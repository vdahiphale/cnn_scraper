The Mega Millions jackpot is now in the 10-figure range after no ticket matched all six winning numbers on Friday's drawing. This marks the fourth time in a little over four years that the top prize has exceeded one billion. The next drawing is Tuesday, January 10th. Good luck.The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. The top stories for you on this Saturday night, Republicans search for a path forward after what might be the craziest fight for House speaker ever. I'll talk to the congressman who nominated Kevin McCarthy in that all important 15th vote. Plus, new details as a Virginia teacher lies in a hospital bed after police say she was shot by her 6-year-old student. And as football evolves, so does its safety practices. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. An olive branch this Saturday from President Biden to the new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The president called McCarthy to congratulate him on his hard-fought win on the 15th vote. We'll see how long that spirit of goodwill last but it's the kind of civility lacking at times among the speaker's own Republican members overnight. Moments after McCarthy confronted GOP Congressman Matt Gaetz for forcing that 15th vote, look at this, Congressman Mike Rogers had to be restrained after lunging at Gaetz, his fellow Republican. But it was the man on the other end of this phone, held up by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene who finally rallied enough Republicans to secure McCarthy's win. That would be former President trump. CNN national politics report Eva McKend is on Capitol Hill this evening. So, Eva, what else did it take besides the former president's nudging to get the job done for McCarthy? EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Pam, essentially McCarthy picked them off one by one, convincing the most conservative members of his conference, his detractors basically by making some key concessions. You know, it will only take one vote, one member, rather, to trigger a vote that could potentially oust the speaker. So really weakening his speakership out of the gate. Also what we will see is members of the House Freedom Caucus, doesn't get more conservative than that, being able to serve on the powerful House Rules Committee. And then of course more time to read bills, not waving those 72 hours. That actually might be something that is welcomed by the rank-and-file members of both the Democratic and Republican caucus. But McCarthy ultimately making these concessions here and it took ultimately 15 votes. The next pivotal step that this group will have to take is voting on a rules package on Monday, Pam. This body, this place does not operate without those rules. Now, if this past week is any indication, there is some concern if Republicans will be able to do that. We've already heard from one moderate who says that he is not OK with the current package. And of course Democrats have indicated that they do not support this as well. A test now that McCarthy is speaker, can he govern -- Pam.",

BRUCE WESTERMAN (R-AR): My preference would be to see 222 Republicans vote for Kevin McCarthy so that we can give a message to Americans who are, I'm sure, gathered around their TVs tonight anxious to see what's going to happen, that Congress is ready to go to work.

Those things that our constituents voted for us to go to Washington and work on.And people said it took too long, it was messy, but in the long run, I think America is going to remember the quality of what we've done instead of how quickly we got it done. They're going to remember that good job versus just pushing something through. And it's going to be tough to get a bill passed off of the floor. It's going to be the same struggle to get the 218 votes no matter what we're working on. It may mean less legislation on the floor, but I think it will be more meaningful legislation.",

He looks at -- he knows the legislative process. He knows what can be done to make things work better. And it was really an agreement that we can move forward with these rules in place and it will make our Congress more efficient. It will make us more effective and it will give individual members a bigger voice as we go forward. We know that we're one-half of one-third of the federal government. But we are the division of government that writes appropriation bills. We're the ones that have more control over the spending. And we've got to figure out not only how to leverage against a Biden White House, but also against a Senate that continually pushes these big spending bills on us and create these shutdown situations. So that's where a lot of the efforts were put on how do we stand up for the House, how do we do the job of the House, and how do we give individual members a voice in doing that.

What are the dynamics regarding how this little 6-year-old boy is treated? Is he being victimized? Is he being treated in a violent way? What about the guns? How did he know how to even shoot a gun? And the concerning thing I think for most people who hear about this case is, we do have examples of 6-year-old kids who access a gun and they're playing with it and it goes off inadvertently. That's apparently not what happened here. What happened here was he brought it to school. Sounds a like he could have secreted it somehow. Brought it to school and in the process of having some kind of a disagreement with the teacher, then he pulled it out and he shot her. That's very concerning because that is learning how to settle your disputes with violence. Where does a 6-year-old learn that? You have to go back to the primary home. Who has access to this little boy? Could be babysitters, parents, other siblings, grandparents. But those dynamics have to be established.",

When you have a 6-year-old boy, so young, I mean, a first grader, right, who clearly, as police said, this was not an accident, there was intent there. How do the courts deal with this?O'TOOLE: That is going to be tough because if this little boy is also a victim, yes, apparently it's pretty clear cut that he shot this teacher. But if he's also the victim the courts and the criminal justice system has to be extremely careful about how they treat him. He is still a 6-year-old little boy and he's probably scared. He's upset. But they cannot, in the state of Virginia, he cannot be tried as an adult. And I'm sure that would never even be considered. But he can't even be turned over to the juvenile justice system. So it looks like that they will have to get him into some kind of temporary care through social services in the state of Virginia. And ultimately, what might happen is that the child is removed from the home legally. And that may be something that happens in the not-too-distant future.",

But an independent study from 2020 still concluded the new rules, as well-intentioned as they may be, have proven to be too weak to make the NFL game demonstrably safer. The amount of time players sat out because of injuries had not changed, they said, between 2010 and 2019. Though, according to the NFL, the league has sustained a 25 percent drop in concussions each season between 2018 and 2021. (On-camera): You're hearing I'm sure from a lot of players, saying, are these protocols working? Are they doing enough to keep us safe? What would you say to that? DR. ALLEN SILLS, NFL'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER: We try to use every one of these situations as a learning opportunity, as an opportunity to get better, and again, to do that in a very transparent manner. GUPTA (voice-over): This year, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa took a hit and played on despite having an apparent head injury. A few days later, he was hit again and concussed. As a result, the league updated their concussion protocol, now requiring an even more conservative approach to dealing with concussions. But most everyone agrees with this. Going back to the days of Joseph Mason Reeves. Rules don't trump culture and history, a history full of big hits and broken dreams. The best you can do is make it safer, but no, not safe.

A lot of these different things that they've kind of implemented over the years. You can make it safe, but I think that they're doing the best they can. I know players have more information today than they did when I was playing 10 and 15 and 20 years ago, so the players obviously assume the risk of, you know breaking bones, tearing ligaments, but you never assume the risk to lose your life on the football field. And you know until the NFL can continue to take care of players after the fact, after they retire, I think that's going to be a big thing that we start looking at now more just because Damar Hamlin was only in his second season of playing in the NFL, which means that he has not an invested player. To become an invested player, you have to play three years, plus three games so he won't receive any of the post career benefits that the NFL gives to players that have been in the NFL. He won't receive that five years of free health insurance, he won't receive a pension. As of now, if he never plays another down. So those are the things that probably need to change on the back end of taking care of players as we saw earlier in the bit with Mike Webster and McNeill from the Vikings.

One of the first things is the DNA. They say that a knife sheath was left and that was linked to his family DNA. We're also in the process of analyzing his own DNA, according to authorities, so we're waiting for that. We also know that according to police, he was around the house 12 times leading up to the killings and even what to the house the day of the killings after -- the morning after -- right before police were called to the scene.

Tell us more about this drug, what exactly does it do and how serious of a concern are those side effects? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:   Well, Pamela, I think what this new drug does do is give people and people who love people who have Alzheimer's disease a hope. So, this drug is called lecanemab and it is a monoclonal antibody constructed against the beta amyloid deposits that most people now believe play a central role in Alzheimer's disease, and the drug is given as an infusion every two weeks. As you said, it's going to cost about $25,000.00 a year. And in a landmark trial just published this week in \"The New England Journal of Medicine,\" the trial authors found that the infusion of this drug slowed the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Both groups, both the patients who received placebo and the patients who received lecanemab both showed progression of disease, but progression was slower in the patients who received active treatment. As you said, there were some side effects of the drug. When you use sophisticated brain imaging, CT scan and PET scans, you can find brain abnormalities. And there was some increased evidence of microscopic bleeding in some patients who received the active drug, as well as some evidence of brain swelling that can be detected on brain imaging. Large, clinically significant bleeding events were rare in both groups. So this drug shows promise.",
