Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

CNN's Crime and Justice Correspondent Shimon Prokupecz is following all these late-breaking developments for us.

      "sentences": "Right, Wolf. So, this just happening in the last few moments, the Memphis Fire Department and city hall officials announcing that they have concluded their investigation of the response there by the EMTs and have terminated, fired three personnel, two EMTs and a lieutenant, they say, have been terminated from the Memphis Fire Department. They say that their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department and are not reflective of the outstanding service the men and women of the Memphis Fire Department provide daily in our community.Now, of course, we have seen -- all have seen this video where the EMTs are on scene for quite some time. They appear to just be standing around, like many of the officers after the horrific beating, not providing Tyre any kind of medical care. And it is some 20 minutes, Wolf, 20 minutes before eventually a stretcher arrives and Tyre is taken to the hospital. I just want to point out one other thing that the fire department, that I think is significant, Wolf, and that is in their initial response, they go to the first scene, the first confrontation. This on your video here obviously is the second confrontation. And you see some of the EMTs there as Tyre's body is slumped over. They seem to be close to his body, picking him up. Now, what happens is they go to this first scene, this initial scene. They are then directed to this second scene, where the second confrontation occurs. And according to the fire department, they are responding to a call for a person who has been pepper sprayed. And that based on that and information they received on the scene, they took no action and took some action obviously later on when they took him to the hospital. But that is significant because it tells us what the fire department, what the EMTs were told as they were responding to that scene. Of course, from the video that we have seen, it was much worse than that. And so now, as a result of this investigation, these three fire officials, EMTs, have been terminated, Wolf.",

They say that this investigation is being completed in record time. And they say there are numerous charges still developing that are impending. And as stated earlier in the earlier updates, they remain committed to transparency in this tragedy. However, Wolf, the Memphis Police Department hasn't necessarily been as transparent as they claim here. Some of these officers were put on leave at the same time the other five officers who were eventually terminated and charged, a lot of this we're just learning today. Some of this was done weeks ago.

ANTONIO ROMANUCCI, TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY ATTORNEY:  Well, they're really taking some time to absorb everything that is going on, because as you can see, Wolf, the story keeps developing not even day-by-day but almost hour-by-hour. Certainly the breadth of this investigation is now it extends not only to Memphis Police Department, but the Shelby County Sheriff's Department, the Memphis Fire Department and its firefighters and EMTs. This is just such a gross collapse of the system that we're supposed to trust that it really is unspeakable. And they're trying to absorb all of this.

In one way, shape, form or another, somebody failed Tyre Nichols. They either failed him by using excessive force, they failed him by severely beating him, they failed him by not intervening, they failed by not rendering aid.

The district attorney said the same thing on Thursday afternoon.So, it's not surprising that this is happening but the speed with which this is happening, I think, is remarkable. It was five, the five initial officers, they prioritized. They realized they had to do something. And then as they go through the video, we saw the sheriff's deputy on Friday, his superior had just seen the video, and, therefore, he was under investigation, and then now you have the two officers. It was six earlier in the day. Now it is seven, the five initial officers and the two. The last two are relieved of duty pending an administrative hearing. They are not fired. So, yes, will there be more? Probably, and I think, again, they're doing exactly what they said they're going to do and that more charges and more people will probably -- there will be a fallout for them.",

The world is watching. Who are we? Who are they as a unit and as police officials? It's about courtesy, professionalism and respect. Was any of that shown to Mr. Nichols? Of course not.And so, clearly, as the investigation continues, I think you'll see more fallout. And with that, Wolf, understand that there are many forms of legal accountability, one, of course, criminal. And I think they should be examined. Everyone should be examined for either acting or failing to act. That's number one. Number two, administrative. Did you do your job? Did you do it properly? Did you do it in accordance with policies, rules, regulations, procedures? If no, you shouldn't be there. You should not be privileged or entitled to have that job. And then, of course, as a civil component, and civil component design, monetarily to punish, the family wants their son, not money, their son. But the law recognizes that not only with respect to money but with regard to the reforms that come about as a result of a lawsuit. So, without question, this is accountability.

You can sue the department. And then the taxpayer ends up. We end up paying for the lawsuits and the money. Perhaps if that changed and police were personally responsible for paying victims, for paying back the taxpayer and so on and so forth, that they would think about their actions in advance knowing that their families also may face ramifications for this.",

They say there are no negotiations, that the debt ceiling needs to be raised to avoid the first ever potential debt default here in the United States. There are real fears that that could happen by June if Congress does not act. Now, behind the scenes, Republicans are trying to put together a plan in which they can agree on. They're talking about capping domestic programs, as well as capping defense programs, cuts to both issues, steering clear of those entitlement programs such as social security and Medicare, something that they know they would be hit hard with in the polls if they went too far. The challenge for Kevin McCarthy is this.

So, we're heading into this critical moment, a key meeting. But what can actually be resolved Wednesday? It's very uncertain whether Wednesday's meeting will be anything more than just optics.

What are you hearing about the direction of his 2024 presidential campaign? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENTare still big questions about what exactly it's going to look like, Wolf, and whether or not it's going to be significantly different than his last campaign. These were his first formal stops that he's made really since announcing that he was going to be running for a third time, running for president, as he did last fall. He was in New Hampshire and South Carolina on Saturday. He promised this forward-looking campaign that is going to be focused on the future. That was a line he used while on stage in South Carolina. But this is a real concern that his advisers have privately behind the scenes is that it's not going to be this forward-focused campaign, and instead, it's going to be the president doing -- the former president doing what he has done time and time again for so long now, which is relying on these election grievances, these lies that he has pushed about the election. And he has had people go to him and say you have to develop a message if you're going to make yourself stand out in this field that we are expecting to be a very big field of Republican candidates. The former president hasn't always taken that message and been particularly receptive to it. He has argued that the message he has now is strong as it is. He has argued that no Republicans should actually run against him for the nomination. Wolf, obviously, we know that's not likely. And so, I think there are real concerns about just how forward looking this campaign is going to be. And it's not just from his advisers. They've reached out to some people who either worked on his last campaign, Wolf, or worked inside the Trump White House to offer them positions on this campaign, people who have denied those for now, saying maybe they'll join at a later date.

No Israeli officials are commenting. But it is interesting to note about the timing of the strike. It comes just days after Israel and the United States wrapped up their largest ever joint military exercise in which the IDF chief of staff actually told me directly that this exercise shows that if Iran makes mistakes, offensive capabilities are getting ready.

I was talking to commanders on the ground some weeks ago. And they don't understand really from a tactical or strategic perspective why the Russians are so focused on Bakhmut other than that they need to get some kind of a victory. So, as far as the Ukrainians are concerned, they have been trying to soak up lot of the violence that the Russians are throwing at it, all this coming at a time when the president has now ruled out the donation of F-16s to the Ukrainian cause.
