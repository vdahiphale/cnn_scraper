And for the second day in a row, he has failed to get the requisite number of votes for that to happen. Let's check in with Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. He just secured an interview with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who, as you may recall, was ousted several weeks ago by his conference. Manu, what did he have to say about what is next? You know, we do not have a functioning legislative branch because of House Republicans' inabilities to get 217 votes behind one Republican.",

There's a discussion right now within the House GOP about moving forward with the resolution to make that very clear, that Patrick McHenry has that power. That has badly divided the House Republicans. They would need Democratic support to do that. But McCarthy says there's no need for such a vote. He also believes that Jim Jordan should continue.

They don't trust the people in leadership.Like Congressman Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, who initially was nominated to replace Kevin McCarthy but faced opposition from many of those same skeptics. Then you have folks who are aligned with Kevin McCarthy, aligned with Steve Scalise, who absolutely do not want to reward what they consider bad behavior. To elevate Jim Jordan, saying that is counter to what they are as Republicans by playing by the rules. They say that doesn't play by the rules to push out a speaker and put someone in that you want. So this boils down to the distrust, the tension that was caused by Speaker McCarthy's ouster just more than two weeks ago. McCarthy had to live week by week as speaker, given that he had given power to any one individual member to oust him. He had to cut that deal to win the speakership on the 15th ballot. And ultimately, he made a decision that the Republicans didn't like. They pushed him out. But it all stems back from that, Jake. Just so much ill will, bad blood within the House Republican conference. And they -- and as a result, the people can see the effect of it. No legislation can move. This chamber is divided. This chamber is stuck. And a big reason why is the two -- two wings of the party are just at war with each other.",

The lack of craters in the parking area of the hospital where the explosion took place, the type of explosion they say it was. The National Security Council put out a statement saying they, too, as of now, came to the conclusion this was an errant rocket fired by the Islamic jihad.

The minute they saw those horrifying scenes of hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children, being maimed and killed, they decided who was to blame. It's important to underscore that for millions and millions of people across the Muslim and Arab world, they have a fundamentally different understanding and perception of this entire conflict and also of the events of the last 10 days. And I think it's clear -- you have to go online or try to engage on some level with this information war that's raging, that people are very wedded to their narratives. No amount of information at this moment, even if it's impartial, even if it's heavily vetted and investigated by impartial groups, it's not going to punch through. Because the narratives that people have chosen, they're digging in. These lines are drawn in the sand. There's an outpouring of emotion.

Number one, howdo you crush Hamas without at the same time creating an incredible damage to Gaza itself, the infrastructure that makes it a viable place for the people who live there? Secondly, what happens afterwards? Who is going to rule Gaza once you have removed those who have ruled Gaza since 2007? There is no good viable answer to that question. Israel clearly doesn't want to occupy Gaza again. And the president made clear that that would be a mistake, and it would be a mistake. No Palestinian Authority, whether the P.A. or some other authority, has the capacity, let alone, the willingness to rule Gaza on the back of Israeli tanks. I don't see the international community, whether it's the Arab community or the U.N., to come in and take over full responsibility for governing this place. So before you start an action like this, as we learned in Afghanistan and learned in Iraq, we better know what the answer is. Who is going to rule? Who is going to take charge?
