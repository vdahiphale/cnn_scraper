I do -- I saw that reporting as I was coming out. So, a couple of things there. Look, the president, as you know, is very close to his family this is a holiday week, Fourth of July. He spent time with his family as you all know, and reported at Camp David. Hunter came back with him and walked with him -- into that meeting that prep that speech prep, and, you know, he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened. It is a week where there's going to be more family members who are going to come to the White House.

The White House released the six-page summary back in February. I don't think that was a full accounting necessarily and Dr. O'Connor, in that memo, described the president as, quote, a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency. I think that is clearly not what the majority of Americans are seeing. And we have a new poll from CBS News that says 72 percent of registered voters say the president does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. So, are you he was saying that the majority of Americans are misguided and that they just need to trust Dr. O'Connor and take him at his word? JEAN-PIERRE:  So a couple of things that I want to say the present is feeling better and you saw him last night. You saw him today, but he does indeed still have a cold. Look, you know, I want to be very sensitive here. I think it is important to be sensitive here. We understand how the American people are feeling. We get it. We do. And I do not want to take away from that. I'm not going to speak. I know that there was -- you all did a poll, CNN do it to the poll. I'm not going to speak to every poll. I'm just not going to do that. I also, I'm, you know, constrained in doing that as we're heading into -- header -- heading into an election in November as you know. What I will say is majority of Americans also support the work that the president has doing an a sense of the his agenda and what he stands for, what he's been fighting for, whether it's reproductive rights, whether it's an economy that works for all, and that is something that the president is going to continue to do. And this is why we have said, and I have said this multiple times from here, is that's why the president acknowledges. We get it. We get what Americans are feeling. That's why he's acknowledging, he's not a young man. That's why he's acknowledging, he's a little slower than he used to be in walking, and that is smooth as speaking, we get that. But we also want to make sure that we point to the successes that he's had. His record and we want to continue to build on his unprecedented record. And I'm not going to discount what the American people see, or feel. What I can say is what we know from our side of things. We could speak to his record and we could speak to what the president has been able to acknowledge, and I think that's important too, and that's basically acknowledging what Americans are seeing and feeling.",

JEAN-PIERRE:  So, look, as you know, I'm constrained to speaking directly to your poll and I get it. I hear the question. I got to be mindful. That is something for the campaign as you started saying that the -- what the campaign has laid out, their argument of the case, that is something for them to take up, and that is something for them to answer. What I can speak to is the president's record. What I can speak to, what he's been able to accomplish and the things that he's been able to do and get done is be -- is actually in line with majority of Americans.

He enjoys engaging with all of you, and we're going to continue making sure that happens. I will say this, this is obviously this is a president that was a senator for 36 years. He was a vice president as you all know, I'm just repeating things that you all know, for eight years. And so, he has long time, you know, advisors that have been here with him for a long time. I don't think that's unusual. He also has people who have -- who are new to -- new to the administration that also advise him look, I've been in meetings with the president where it's been a diverse group of people. And he sees us and he knows the reason why we're sitting in front of him is that we have something to share and he wants to hear from all of us. I've heard him say, hey, what is it that -- what do you -- what do you think? What do you think? And so, my experience has been that that -- that rule is indeed open, and that he does get to hear from a diverse group of people. That has been my experience. And -- but it is not unusual for someone who has been around for that long of time to have a group of people that he's -- that's been around him for some for a minute, right?

A certain part of the media which was doing this. And look, independent mainstream fact-checkers in the press and misinformation experts have been calling out cheap fakes.

What do you say to that? JEAN-PIERRE:  So I want to be mindful in respect to your reporting. I have not read it. I have not seen it. So it's hard for me to respond to it directly.

What I see is a strong, resolute president who is always willing and able to work on behalf of the American people.

Jim Clyburn, long a backer of Biden, in fact, he is the man many give credit for bringing Biden to the fore in 2020, he didn't call for him to step out, he did call it a little legitimate question though to say that, well, if that were to happen, he'd be fine with Kamala Harris. Notable for him to say that. Peter Welch, Democratic Vermont, he lambasted the Biden campaign for what he called a dismissive attitude, quoting political here.

And then people who had one into the president during his travels.One of the reasons we went back to look at it is he has been through an extraordinarily busy month of June. He was in Europe twice. I'm in Berlin right now, but he had come to Europe gone back for about 60 hours, gone back to Europe for the G7, then flew from Italy to Los Angeles for a fundraiser and then back in at the end of that, he was pretty exhausted. So one of the things we were trying to figure out is could the travel has been the explanation here? Of course, he had a week to rest up in- between. What we got was a sense from people who had spent time with the president and the past few months, that these lapses are more frequent. A little more worrisome, and that they happen a lot when he's tired or in big crowds and less so when he's in one-on-one conversations with people and, you know, sort of more directly engaged. So you can draw from that what you will, I think there's something going on that has made these more common. But I also think he went through a pretty hellish month in the run-up and really it's interesting question why they didn't protect him from that. SCIUTTO:  Let me ask you, David, though, when you and your colleagues asked these sources for the story, were they describing a change from say, the last couple of weeks to several months ago, a couple of years ago, right?

Trump's attorneys quickly filed a motion to try to get this entire -- this entire conviction set aside are based on those same immunity claims that the Supreme Court weighed in on yesterday.And instead of a sentencing next week, we're going to see Trumps attorneys lay out their argument for why the conviction should be set aside. And like you said, they're going to try to get some of the evidence in this case thrown out that includes sources telling Paula Reid, our colleague, that includes testimony for people like Hope Hicks, which you remember was so pivotal in that trial in New York. Also, some of the texts are -- some of the tweets that Donald Trump sent and that were introduced into evidence, those are also potentially what Donald Trump's legal team is going to try to get thrown out of this case. So it remains to be seen. The D.A.'s office will have about two weeks after Trump's team files their motion to respond, and then again, the judge will make his determination on September 6 and then impose that sentence on September 18th.
