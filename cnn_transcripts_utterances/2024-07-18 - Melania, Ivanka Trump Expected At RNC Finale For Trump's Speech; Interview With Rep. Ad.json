It was really uncharacteristic and very fulsome, talking about, you know, humanity and the need to come together. I think more than anything, he really needs her in this moment, right, at a time when he is trying to project an image that is human.The theme of this whole convention has been about trying to win over former skeptics of the former president, has been about trying to reintroduce him and recast him away from his old, divisive, polarizing image as a more unifying figure. We'll see what he says tonight and how he tries to approach that theme. But I think he really needs her to be with him in this moment. She's clearly reluctant to be too out front, but she will be there when he needs her.",

I mean, J.D. Vance has only been in the Senate for a year and a half. That was her first foray. His campaign for Senate in Ohio was really her first foray into politics.But I think, to Molly's point, it was a similar message. It was a humanizing message. It was talking about personal stories of their family, how they met. And that has been the goal, not just for Donald Trump, as Molly pointed out, but also for J.D. Vance. We saw that throughout Vance's speech himself, you know, talking about his childhood, his autobiography. And I think she really drove that point home. And just one thing I wanted to add to what Molly said as well, what's been interesting about this week is Donald Trump is not someone who likes to be vulnerable, but we are seeing a lot of that vulnerability come out this week. But I am told, I mean, this entire campaign has really been a contrast between strength versus weakness. That is what they're trying to portray. And I do think that is going to continue moving forward. This is just an interesting kind of departure from what we're used to seeing, whether it be with J.D. Vance and his family or Donald Trump and his family, like we'll see tonight.",

It's about the citizens of this country, you know, as he said in his speech, deciding who we do and don't let in.But absolutely, it reinforces that message for him to be connected to this immigrant family and to say that this too is the American story. This too is the American dream that he embodies and that she embodies. And that that is, you know, what he's going for, not any kind of, you know, racist type of paradigm. So and I agree with you. I had the same thought watching her, that it was endearing that she seemed a little nervous because you could tell that she hasn't been a public person. She hasn't been a part of something like this. And I think for the people want to know these candidates, people want to know him because he's new on the scene. And she really did humanize him in that way.",

And CNN has learned that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden privately that polling shows he cannot defeat Trump and might hurt Democrats' chances in the House.Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Adam Smith from Washington state. He was one of the first Democrats to urge the president to step aside. Sir, thank you so much for spending part of your afternoon with us. Do you think that Biden is going to step aside or is getting closer to it? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): I mean, it seems to be moving in that direction. I think there are still conversations being had. But look, the big change that happened just in the last 24 hours is I think everybody is now getting the impression that the president around him are taking the concerns very seriously and looking at the challenges going forward. And I think that is a very welcome development. So it seems to be heading in that direction, yes.",

You know, we just heard the conversation before I came on here talking about immigration, that the point isn't to denigrate immigrants. Donald Trump does nothing but denigrate immigrants. He's called them rapists and murderers. He said that countries send us their worst. He's more than once, you know, wondered aloud why we don't get more immigrants from Norway. Look, we've got to have that fight. We've got to go back at the messaging here. And that's where we need to get to. And as I've said, the very start, when I came out and said the president should step aside. The reason I'm doing that is I think that debate showed that at this point, President Biden is not the best messenger for our message. It's a good message. Got to get it out. And second, we're going to be dogged by questions about his health. It seems and I have not seen the polling, but it seems like the data is reflecting that.

You're on the ballot across the country. The Democratic Party is on the ballot. So we can pick our candidate at our convention as we plan to do. Yes, you got to move a little money around. There's some different things that have to go into it, but it's really not that difficult.

And right now, it seems like that could happen as soon as August 1st. It's -- I've sort of been likening this to legally getting married before the wedding. Right.

So there's plenty of time in there.Also, from what I can tell, there's no necessity of doing this virtually before the convention. Now we get into some legal niceties that I confess I haven't examined. But from what I've heard, Ohio, which was the whole reason for doing the virtual thing in the first place, has changed their rules so that we would be able to be on the ballot in Ohio, even if we did it at our convention. I'm not 100 percent certain of that, but that's my understanding. So I don't think there's a necessity of doing it.",

And so what's he staging tonight is to show what he really is, which is he's a fighter. I mean, and of course, he's you go back to his years at Atlantic City. He loved -- he knew all the fight promoters. And now with UFC, he's friends with the guys from UFC. He loves going to those events. And it's who he is. I mean, when someone takes literally takes a bullet and then gets up and tells the whole country, I'm ready to go again right now, that's, you know, that's just a contrast. So I think it's brilliant what he's doing. I think it's fantastic. I think it's going to broaden the audience. It's going to increase the reach. And I think you're going to see, again, the voters that are voting for the Republican Party. The platform has simplified 20 point platform. We've never had a platform like that in 50 years that the average American can read like in a minute and understand it. And it all makes sense. It's all common sense. And so the party has become the party of common sense. The party is the party of the working family, someone who's working for a paycheck.

You're the commander in chief of the North Dakota National Guard. We lost soldiers in the war on terror between 2001 attack on, you know, on America on 9-11 and then 2021. We're getting ready for this very serious thing to honor the Gold Star families. Joe Biden pulls out of Afghanistan because he wants to hit a deadline. And we go ahead with our celebration and in memory of these lost soldiers. And I had to spend time with Gold Star mothers in North Dakota who were like, hey, does this mean our son died for nothing? Because Joe Biden was just saying we can pull out and we don't even need to be there. I thought we've spent our lifetime mourning our son who died a decade ago because he gave this life for something that mattered to this country. Now, apparently it doesn't.

That's one of the agencies under the Bureau Department of Interior. We've got a balance sheet in America, which is huge, and we've got all these natural resources, but we're not developing. We're buying our oil and gas from overseas. We're not sending our resources that we can develop cleanly here to our allies in Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines. That's what's part of what's destabilizing the world. So there's a lot of things there, but none of those agencies, it doesn't matter, pick any cabinet agency, President Trump doesn't get to fill them unless he wins. And there's going to be a battle between now and November. These things can tend to, you know, it might feel, it might get closer in the fall, but I think the focus right now isn't about any particular position.
