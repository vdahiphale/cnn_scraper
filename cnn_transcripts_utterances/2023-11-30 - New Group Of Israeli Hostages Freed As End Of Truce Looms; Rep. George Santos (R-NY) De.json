Certainly eight is a bit of an odd number, but Israel and Hamas agreed to count two extra Israeli- Russian hostages released yesterday.Of course, the question now is, is there enough momentum, and are there enough women and children released to push this for one more day? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (voice over):  Tears of unbridled joy, as the mother of Mia Schem found out her daughter is coming home after 55 days held hostage in Gaza. The French-Israeli citizen was last seen in this Hamas video released in mid-October. Her injured arm pinned in place. Please get us out of here as soon as possible, she pleads, please. Schem and 40-year-old Amit Soussana were released from Palestine Square in Gaza City, a sign that Israel does not have complete control over northern Gaza. The reunions are never far from the pain. One day after American- Israeli Liat Beinin Atzili was released by Hamas, the spokesperson for their kibbutz, said her husband, Aviv Atzili, was confirmed killed on October 7th. And this image is from a Hamas clip of Yarden Bibas, father of the Bibas family, including ten-month-old Kfir, the youngest hostage kidnapped on October 7th. Likely under duress, he pleads with Israel to rescue him and bring home the bodies of his family. Hamas' military wing claimed, without evidence one day ago, that his children and wife were killed in an Israeli airstrike, a claim Israel said was assessing. CNN has not confirmed the deaths nor the claim of the strike. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the region on the 7th and potentially final day of a temporary truce amid a diplomatic push to extend it further. Blinken met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

It all depends on whether Hamas comes up with another list of ten women and children to release tomorrow. Prime Minister Netanyahu has made clear that when this phase of hostage releases ends that Israel will go back to the fighting.So, they clearly are taking this day by day. It really was touch-and- go there last night for quite some time, for most of the evening. We understand from officials that there were at least two lists that were presented to Israel, one that had dead bodies on it, one that had elderly men on it that were rejected by Israel. Finally, Hamas came up with a list of eight women and children that Israel did agree to. Those were the eight releases that we saw today. There was a belief going into this two extra days of pause that Hamas did have enough women and children to get through tomorrow. But that remains very much to be seen, Wolf. And then we get into a situation where, do the sides, Israel and Hamas, agree on the release of civilian men, of some of those IDF soldiers? Will Hamas change the terms and ask for more Palestinian prisoners, for example? What seems to be clear right now, Wolf, is if these hostage releases stall, then the fighting will start again.",

That includes that one American woman that officials had been hopeful would be able to get out as part of this negotiated release. The White House so far has been unable to provide any update on her status or condition. And then there are also seven other American men who are being held, including three IDF reservists soldiers. Officials also have said that they need to get more information about each of the conditions and status of these hostages. Red Cross officials, as part of the deal, were supposed to get in, get access to the hostages, but so far that has not happened, really leaving the administration in the dark in many ways about the status of those Americans. Now, the possibility of expanding the hostage list beyond women and children could potentially get others out. The U.S. had been pushing for later on for there to be conversations about getting elderly men out and then also turning to trying to see what they could do relating to those IDF soldiers.

Now, as you mentioned, on top of that, Republicans, even many Trump allies, are still scarred by what happened in 2017, when Trump was unable to fulfill a core campaign promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare, even though he had a complete GOP monopoly of power in Washington. Now, I want to read to you what one operative told me, and this is someone who is Trump-aligned. They said, health care was a loser in 2018 and it's a loser now. Talk about the border. Talk about the economy. Talk about no more foreign wars. Don't talk about health care. Now, there's probably one clear reason for that, and Trump's renewed interest has really given new ammo to Democrats. The Biden campaign has seized on his threats. They have put out surrogates. They actually put out an ad today attacking Trump on health care. So, it will be interesting to see what the next steps here, if we will actually get a policy proposal on what it would look like to repeal and replace Obamacare.
