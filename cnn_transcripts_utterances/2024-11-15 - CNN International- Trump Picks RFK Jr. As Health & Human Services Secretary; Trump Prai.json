Kennedy Jr. has promoted debunked anti-vaccine claims and conspiracy theories. But, today, well, today, he is at the top of this week's list of stunning cabinet picks, after Donald Trump chose him to become the next Health and Human Services Secretary.

The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. Wi-Fi radiation is -- does all kinds of bad things, including causing cancer. Some of these mass shootings that we're seeing in this country may be related to this new -- these new class of drugs about SSRIs and benzos. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, he has named Elise Stefanik, Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz to key roles in his administration, cutting that very narrow margin of majority in the House even narrower.He also addressed RFK Jr. You played that sound from him. He said as well, we want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long time. Of course, for a long time, he has been talking about vaccines in very conspiratorial ways. I'm sure Meg will get to that in a second.

He is a physician, and he says he was called to Samoa in 2019 to vaccinate people there, amid a very large and deadly measles outbreak. Here is what he told Laura Coates about how RFK Jr. was involved with that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH GREEN, GOVERNOR, HAWAII: We had a terrible experience in Samoa. RFK went and rallied that country against vaccinations when there was a measles outbreak. It resulted in the deaths of 83 innocent children. That's what RFK did. And if he is confirmed as HHS Secretary, what he will do is he will cast out on vaccination programs across America. That will mean thousands and then millions of people will consider not getting vaccinated. We will not have heard immunity, and physicians like myself and pediatricians and all sorts of other healthcare providers will see cataclysmic spread of disease. So, he is the worst possible choice for HHS, and I hope that the President will pull his name back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has been talking about, well, if you just show me the data, I will show you that they're unsafe. That's something also we heard from his head of his transition team with our Kaitlan Collins just before the election. The CDC -- I just interviewed the CDC director earlier this week. She says all of the data that they use to assess vaccines is made public and is continuously being assessed for any safety signals. The FDA makes all of its data public, as it's reviewing these vaccine applications before they're approved. Then they go to these public hearings with outside advisors. Then they go to the CDC. The same thing happens.So, the data is there and the monitoring is ongoing for the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. And it's important to note, vaccines are really a cornerstone of public health and of life expectancy getting longer in this country. There has been a lot of talk about life expectancy in the U.S. being worse than other developed countries, and that's a really important feature to focus on, and something people like about what RFK Jr. is saying. But, if you look over the decades, vaccines are a cornerstone of why we live longer lives. The CDC says that among kids born between 1994 and 2023, vaccines will prevent more than 500 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and more than a million deaths. So, measles, polio, the kinds of things we've tried to put behind us, they're worried those may come back in large numbers here in the U.S. [11:10:00] SOLOMON: Yeah. It's interesting, because in some of those cases, we have seen an uptick, not necessarily large numbers, but we have seen an uptick in some of those illnesses where vaccines exist. You have to wonder sort of how much of the anti-vaccine conversation is fueling that. Meg Tirrell, thank you. Steve Contorno, thank you as well. I want to continue the conversation now, and with us is Dr. Paul Offit, who is the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, or CHOP, as it's also known. He is also a member of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee. Doctor, so great to have you today. We really appreciate the time. You have called this a dangerous moment. If RFK Jr. is concerned -- or confirmed, what is your biggest concern? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR OF THE VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA, &amp; MEMBER, FDA VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE: Well, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has always had a platform, owing to his name. I think by even considering him for Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, at some level, you validate him. At least the notion, I think, by the public, is that some of the things he must be saying must be true. And as Meg Tirrell pointed out, I mean, he is a virulent anti-vaccine activist. He is a science denialist, and he is a conspiracy theorist. The notion that that data are being hidden from the public and only he can find it out, does appeal to a certain group of people, and I worry that he would continue to continue his anti- science stance when he is going to be hold sway over science-based agencies like the CDC, the FBI and the NIH.",

And he thinks that -- continues to think the MMR vaccine, or Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine, causes autism when abundant data shows that that's not true. So, he -- the thing that worries me the most about him is that he sort of represents, to me, the notion that you simply declare your own truths, including scientific truths, that science is becoming just kind of another voice in the room, and that it's OK to declare your own truths when they aren't true, and that no one who certainly is an expert in the field knows it, knows certainly that they're not true.

And so, then school mandates were enforced, enforced with major outbreaks in Los Angeles, in Detroit and Alaska, and with that, we brought measles down to the point that we actually eliminated measles by the year 2000, but it started to come back, in large part because of this massive flood of misinformation and disinformation is putting -- being put out by people like him.

For the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region that these APEC leaders are so focused on, they are going to want to see some stability in the relationship, but this high degree of uncertainty right now means that the Biden administration's top priority is to say, over the next two months, we're going to maintain that stability. We're going to hand over power, and we're going to urge the Trump administration to continue to focus not just on its America First priorities, which the American voters obviously have given President Trump the mandate to follow, but also to remind the rest of the administration that peace and security requires some stability.

Today, northern Gaza is the focus of that displacement, as the Israeli military mounts one of its most devastating offensives yet. This woman says Israeli loud speakers blasted a warning to residents. It was saying, either get out or die, one of the two. So, we left with our children, taking only what we could carry. She says they left without food or water, just the clothes on their backs. Fleeing is one thing. Finding safety is something else altogether. Yet another school-turned-shelter for the displaced was struck Thursday by the Israeli military. Emergency rescue officials say four people were killed, including two children, yet another reminder that nowhere in Gaza is truly safe. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Iran fired hundreds of drones back in April, a far larger strike than the U.S. military anticipated. And the U.S. pilot spent hours in the air that night, fighting off the prolonged attack. Let's get more now from CNN's Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, who spoke with those pilots. Natasha, what did they tell you? What did you learn?",

Basically, it wasn't known before this attack whether or not these F- 15 fighter jets would -- how they would fare, essentially, against these very slow, small, cheap flying explosive devices, essentially, these drones that can very easily evade even the most sophisticated radar systems, including those that are on the F-15.Here is what one fighter pilot told me about all of the challenges that were posed by trying to seek out those drones that night.

And of course, they were facing a threat of 300 plus projectiles that were launched by Iran. And so, they had to land at a military base in the Middle East, a U.S. military base, that itself was coming under fire, essentially, from these projectiles that were being launched overhead the base and being intercepted by the base's air defense system.So they had to land. They had to refuel. They had to get these weapons back on the planes, and all of this during this massive barrage that they were trying to fend off. The base went into red alert. Troops had to rush to bunkers. But, many actually decided to stay out on the runways, which we should note had debris falling over them. And so, all of these challenges were really compounded that night, and something that the U.S. military and the Air Force, in particular, according to these pilots I spoke to, did not have that much time to prepare for. They had not been training that much before that night. But, of course, a lot of lessons learned that evening to take away, given that this is the new, essentially, generation of warfare, and how these enemies are going to be deploying these very cheap drones in the future to try to overwhelm their adversaries.

TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Having sex with a teenager, paying for sex, using illicit drugs, accepting improper gifts and dispensing special favors, those are just some of the accusations that have swirled around the former Florida Congressman.

One change reportedly might be ending a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit in the U.S. Electric vehicles tend to be more expensive compared to their gas-powered counterparts, and the tax credit has offset the price for car buyers. Now, there is speculation about how eliminating that tax credit might impact Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. The company is one of the largest EV automakers in the market. It's also the only automaker making a profit on its U.S. EV sales. Now, eliminating the credit might force prices of all EVs to go down, which could overall help Tesla but hurt other U.S. EV makers.

So, on the flip side, there may be policies that help other car makersas well, but clearly, this is a bit of a win for Tesla. And also, I want to show you a tweet from Elon Musk. This is from July.
