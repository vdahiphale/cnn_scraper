The president and vice president in Pittsburgh together, their first joint appearance on the campaign trail since the Democratic National Convention, where the vice president officially became the party's presidential nominee.If you're just joining us, I'm Alex Marquardt in the Situation Room, Wolf Blitzer is off today. What we just heard there from the vice president and the president were quite union and labor-focused remarks by the both of them, as well as leaders from Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and labor leaders. They talked about being the most pro-union administration in U.S. history. And Harris there casting this election as a choice between one side looking forward and the other backwards. She also described her vision for what she called an opportunity economy before finishing up, describing a tight race and claiming that the Democratic ticket are the underdogs in this race. I want to bring in our political panel to break all of this down. Jasmine Wright, what is your takeaway from what we just heard from Kamala Harris and President Biden.

What does that tell you about how you think the president is going to be deployed by the Harris campaign?FMR. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY):  Well, Alex, I think first of all, Jasmine makes the exact right point. This campaign is not taking for granted the blue wall, and I'm really happy to see that actually, because we've seen overconfident campaigns in the past. We're going to need all the votes we can get in those states. The fact that they're so focused on labor in particular, this is an area where Democrats have lost a lot of support to Trump. Let's be honest about that. And they're saying, I think Kamala Harris is saying the things to get people back in favor of the Pro Act to strengthen the right to unionize, to make sure that union-busting is met with real penalties. You know, she's obviously saying U.S. Steel needs to stay in America. These are really important messages for folks who might be tempted to support Donald Trump. So, that helps get those folks back. I think Joe Biden is exactly where he needs to be, in the blue wall stage talking to labor. I wouldn't necessarily say use him anywhere, everywhere. I think this is the perfect place and he is someone who can actually help her get some of those votes back.",

And while aides say that he was excited to take the trail today and to make the case for his vice president, there was also some with wistfulness in his remarks, as he described the arc of a decades-long career, which he described as being backed by organized labor every step of the way, starting from an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was 29 years old.And then he went into some of the actions that he took as president during this past administration, crossing the picket lines with autoworkers, endorsing the American ownership of an iconic steel company here in Pittsburgh, and also encouraging the electrical workers union, where we are right now, to invite more women into their union. That seemed to be a metaphor of sorts, where he transitioned into making the case for Vice President Harris, essentially encouraging the union members here in the room to invite them into their lives as well. And what's interesting is what we heard from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, where he told the attendees here today that they need to talk to their colleagues in particular and encourage them to vote for Vice President Harris and Governor Walz, which is interesting considering that many of these unions are conducting their own internal polling to see exactly who their membership supports, even as Vice President Harris has secured the endorsements from the major leaders of these unions.

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, it's been really interesting to watch them try and damage her over the last several weeks. They have tried various different lines on her, attacking her, and none of them have really landed the way that they have wanted to.One of the things that you're going to see is a lot of linking her to President Joe Biden. One of the things we've reported time and time again is that they believe that their biggest chance to win in November is by essentially running the same campaign that they did against President Joe Biden, but making Harris the incumbent, so using events like today, the showing Harris and Biden side by side and saying that Harris' policies are the same as Joe Biden's policies, particularly when it comes to some of the more unpopular policies on inflation, on immigration. That's what they want to do. But whether or not that's actually landing has yet to be seen. It doesn't seem as though the American public is treating Harris as the incumbent that the Trump campaign would like them to do. So, as we move forward, I will tell you, Alex, speaking to a number of his advisers earlier today. They do feel like they are in a better position now than they were a few weeks ago when it felt as though Harris' bounce was not going to end, and there was a lot of concern around the boost in her poll numbers, around the enthusiasm around Harris. Right now, they feel like this is starting to settle and they have a real race, but they are saying the same thing to their supporters that you're hearing Harris say to hers, which is, we are the underdog. We really have to fight here. And I think it's clear both sides believe that this race is going to be determined by razor thin margins, and they are trying to find any votes that they can to secure. And that includes, for at least Donald Trump's team, trying to siphon away some of those labor votes, some of those rank and file union members that Donald Trump got back in 2016 that helped propel him to the White House. So, you're going to see a lot of that trying to dig away at various voting blocs as they try to get as many votes as they can ahead of November.",

I think what matters are the two issues that the public says they prioritize in this election, which is affordability, not inflation, but affordability of food and fuel, housing and health care, and the idea that that's gotten worse over the last three years, not better, and immigration, which is basically an issue of personal security and safety, and whether the border's controlled or not.She, Vice President Harris, has a clear advantage in personality. If this is an election about who you trust, who you have confidence in, who you like, she wins, clearly. If this is an election about policy, about where things have gone over the last three and a half years and where they're headed, Donald Trump has the advantage. The problem with the Trump campaign is that the candidate himself is actually undermining that message with personal attacks that voters don't like. The challenge with Harris is that she walks into a union hall and doesn't address the two issues that union people prioritize the most. I've done a fair amount of polling within the union community, and there is definitely a split. Government unions and teachers unions absolutely support Harris by significant margins. But their trades, the people who work with their hands, are evenly split between the Democrats and the Republicans, and Republicans have never seen that before. She walked into Ground Zero, everything she said was effective, but she missed the two issues that matter most. And in the end, at least in the debate, she's going to have to address them.",

In 2020, Joe Biden was able to win Pennsylvania back and thus able to win the White House back. And it'll be the same in 2024.The one challenge and the reason why Pennsylvania is such a crucial battleground state is that it includes so many different slices of the electorate. So you actually can't trust. You don't have the luxury to focus on trust. One thing we have urban, suburban, rural. We have immigrants, especially in the Philadelphia area, in places like Lancaster and Reading. We have a lot of blue collar voters of all different ethnicities, but especially white. We have parts of the state that are kind of the beginning of the Midwest. And then we have a big part of the state like where I live, which has very much east coast. So in order to campaign in Pennsylvania, you have to be everywhere at the same time from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, to Erie, and you have to get here early and often. The Harris campaign is doing that. And the Trump campaign is not. Where is Donald Trump today? It's Labor Day. How is he not on the campaign trail?

I do think most voters recognize that as you get more information, as you get more experience, perhaps as you hold a different job, which was the case with kamala Harris going from a senator from California to vice president of the United States, and the Biden administration that there would be a natural evolution. Look, I know that. I do not have 100 percent of the same position today that I first had 15 years ago when I was first elected to office. That's part of growing. I think that's natural.
