He was involved in virtually every detail. And he -- he literally has said, and others have said about him, he knows where the bodies are buried and has, quote-unquote, \"the receipts.\" So he's a valuable witness. Now, the bad is that he has a very long list of strikes against him as a witness that are going to come up at trial.

He wants someone who will fall in line, which Doug Burgum -- You're from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- like people are doing to potentially be tapped.And Nikki Haley has yet -- has actually been rather silent since she has dropped out of the race, other than getting 150,000 votes here and there in post primary since being out of the race. So I think that the Biden campaign is trying to figure out how to go after those voters, because they -- Haley voters actually were a part of the coalition in 2020. He did get some Republicans. We got some independents, and then we got a majority, a large historical number of our base. So yes, Biden is interested in courting those voters. How he courts them, I think, is important, and I think will be much more aggressive once the V.P. is announced as a contrast.",

Maybe you got a chance to see some of this over the weekend. All right. Time now for weather. A waterlogged Texas could see even more rain as the South braces for severe storms, powerful winds, possible tornadoes. Our Weatherman van Dam here to break it all down for us.

Everybody loved it.Of course, headed outside this morning to see if we could see them, but not the case, because we've got clouds moving in with rain. But there's also the severe weather threat that's ongoing, as well. So this is newly issued from the Storm Prediction Center, a severe thunderstorm watch until roughly noon today, Eastern Standard -- or Central Daylight Time, I should say. Here is a look at this line of storms. This is called a mesoscale convective system, and it's -- notice that little bowing feature to it. That has gotten a lot of wind and energy associated with it. So as it traverses across the border of Mississippi and into Alabama, it could pick up some intensity and create a swath of stronger winds and heavier rainfall across the Deep South. There's also potential of a spin-up or two of tornadoes, 5 percent risk today, and that extends as far West as New Orleans, all the way to about Houston. But this is where we're highlighting our greatest chance of large hail, two-inch in diameter, anywhere you see that hashed area, including much of Louisiana and into Southeast Texas. Not one but two rounds of severe storms anticipated over the next 24 hours. So with this amount of whether moving through, better believe there's a flood threat, as well. Flood watch in effect anywhere you see that shading of green. That includes the Florida Panhandle right through Texas and Louisiana. Three to six inches of rain. This is through Tuesday. That is a lot of precipitation on a very waterlogged area. That's why the Weather Prediction Center still has this moderate risk of excessive rain. That could lead to some localized flash flooding. So from aurora borealis to severe storms to flood threat, we cover it all here at CNN Weather -- Kasie.",
