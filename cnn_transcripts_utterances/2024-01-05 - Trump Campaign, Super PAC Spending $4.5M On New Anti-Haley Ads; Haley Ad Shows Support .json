But the other is the question, the broader question of presidential immunity. Can someone who ever served as president ever be held accountable for something they did in the waning days of their presidency or afterwards? And I think, to me, the way the court thinks about one question is going to be completely different than the way it thinks about the other. And legal scholar after legal scholar has said, if every president is immunized forever against anything they ever do because they were president, it would invite like the worst presidents, you know. Basically in the future of the United States because people would run to basically try to immunize themselves for everything.

Can you put this into historical context and, you know, history is may be hard to do because in the current climate, the media is so fractured and there are so many different ways to get information that a lot of the people probably who said that are only consuming information from outlets that are feeding them these conspiracy theories. [12:50:23] WILENTZ: I think you've had exactly the right point, Dana. I mean, conspiracy theories are as American as apple pie. It's been part of American politics from the very beginning. But, you know, now we have the possibility of being unable to disprove them. You know, it's very difficult because people are fed, constantly fed these ideas that, you know, they make an uncertain world look clear, look, you know, look plausible. You know, things are not messy thing -- things are messy, things are not to get -- well, conspiracies give you someone to blame. And with the Trump campaign, I mean, Trump has taken it to a whole different level. I mean, we've had conspiracies -- just thinking about the conspiracies of the 1930s, of the 1950s during the McCarthy era, and they were out there and they had their day, but they were eventually undone. But Joe McCarthy didn't have social media. Joe McCarthy didn't have Truth Social. He didn't have the kinds of things that, you know, former President Trump has at his disposal to continually feed these ideas.
