Today, as you just heard extensively, she will sit down now with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and people are looking to see if there is any space between her policy toward the war on Gaza and that of President Biden.Behind the scenes right now, one of the fastest searches for a vice president in modern history. Governors Andy Beshear, Roy Cooper, Josh Shapiro, Tim Walz among the names being floated, Senator Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also in the mix, maybe.

      "sentences": "Hey, John, good morning. It is going to be a very accelerated process to search for a vice president here. Four years ago when Senator Kamala Harris was in the running, she was waiting around four months and months to see if Joe Biden would call her. But we are told that she will make a decision for her own running mate in less than two weeks time. The reason is, of course, time is running short before the Democratic convention, and also running short to just get on with this campaign.But we do know that some teams have Democratic lawyers have been looking into the finances and the voting records and the personal histories of several of those candidates. Let's take a look at them once again just to kind of break down what they may bring. There are a lot of governors on that list. Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania, of course, a key battleground state. He has been elected three times in statewide office there, so he certainly is popular. Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, has a long-standing relationship with a Kamala Harris. They served as attorneys general together as well. And you can see the rest of the list there. The only senator on the list, we believe, is Mark Kelly. Of course, he's from Arizona, the NASA astronaut, the former Navy pilot. So look, these are the people that she is looking at. You can see the key swing states there. All three of these candidates would be potentially helpful in the swing states. But look, the bottom line is she is going to pick someone who she's comfortable with, someone who can be a governing partner. And yes, the vetting is going on now, but the interview process that she does with these candidates, of course, is going to determine all of this, John.",

That's right.All right, coming up, his opponent in his sights, Donald Trump is reverting right back to his old self on the campaign trail. In his first big rally since Biden exited the race, Trump riled up his supporters with angry rhetoric focused, of course, on Vice President Kamala Harris calling her a liar and an ultra-radical liberal. He is standing by that divisive tone. Here is what the former president and Republican nominee said just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She's a San Francisco radical. She's actually, I think a much worse, in a way, a much worse candidates. She's the most radical person probably that we've had in office, let alone the office of the presidency. I'd love to be nice, but I'm dealing against real garbage. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She's worse than him, because he's a fake liberal. He wasn't that liberal. He was fake. She's a real liberal. She really is a real liberal. She's much worse than him.

And as Jeff said, that opportunity for the Trump campaign to give their first impression of Harris to the American people is now underway, and it's a frantic sprint by the Trump campaign because they know this campaign has changed dramatically in the past week.They have built a campaign to go up against an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent. Well now, they have a much more dynamic, a much more unknown opponent in Vice President Harris, someone who potentially could appeal to voters that Joe Biden was having trouble keeping in the Democratic tent. And so now you are seeing the first and early attempts by the Trump campaign to define Harris. And one of the more interesting criticisms was that he took a shot at Harris for not appearing in Washington for the Israeli prime minister's address to the Congress. He actually said she's quote, \"totally against the Jewish people.\" That's a remarkable statement given that her own husband is Jewish and also his vice presidential nominee also did not appear at that speech either, Sara. But you're seeing these attacks come out. They will be sharpened in the coming weeks, and they will not end until November.",

They went through a nominating process where they both received 14 million Democratic votes in the process and now the process is you have to get a majority of the delegates, 1,976 and she has 1,976 pledged to her so far. She's going to have to go through the roll call and earn the Democratic nomination. This is not a coronation. But I just want to be clear, when you hear Donald Trump and his allies talk and use the words like coup, use the words like DEI, they just can't help themselves. When the Speaker of the House has to write a memo to his caucus saying, hey guys, can we just keep the racist rhetoric in-house? Can we not say what we're thinking out loud? That's what we're going through.

Adrian Gonzalez is expected to appear here for his arraignment. Interestingly enough, his attorney has the option of waiving his appearance. He did not. So, we do expect for the first time, really since this horrific event, to see Adrian Gonzales. It will be the first time that many of the parents and people in the community will be able to see him and be face-to-face. Also, as you recall, the chief, the former chief of the school police department, Pete Arredondo, was also indicted. He will not appear. His attorney waived his appearance. He has pleaded not guilty, so, we will not see him. He's also facing 10 charges of endangerment and that relates to the survivors. He's not facing any charges related to the victims that died that day. But this is certainly an unprecedented moment in this story where you have officers now finally, facing some accountability. And really, for the first time, we're seeing a district attorney bring charges against officers who failed to act that day. Of course, the Department of Justice and other investigators have found that there was inaction and failures from police officials here in Uvalde, allowing the gunman to remain inside that classroom for over an hour, as many of the officers stood outside waiting for backup, waiting for resources which violated active shooter policy, which violated every piece of training these officers have received. And that is why the DA in this case brought these charges. Certainly, family members here did not expect to have this moment.
