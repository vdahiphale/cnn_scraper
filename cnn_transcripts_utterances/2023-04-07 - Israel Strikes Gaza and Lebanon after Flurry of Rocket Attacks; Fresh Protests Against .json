Several hours ago, the Israeli Military announced new strikes on both Gaza and Lebanon, saying it went after targets belonging to Hamas militants. Now, that's after a flurry of rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel on Thursday, most of them reportedly intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome. The Israeli - Israel Defense Forces then carried out yet another round of airstrikes on Gaza, which of course is run by Hamas. The militant group released a statement saying it holds the Israeli occupiers responsible for the dangerous escalation, coming, of course, after the violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.Israel also blames Palestinian militants for a barrage of rocket attacks from Lebanon into northern Israel. Many were intercepted. There was, however, some damage on the ground. It was the largest attack from Lebanese soil since the war with Hezbollah 17 years ago. The UN's peacekeeping force in Lebanon stressed a short while ago that neither side wants another conflict. Now, the airstrikes and rocket attacks follow Israeli raids, as we said, on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site. CNN's Hadas Gold reports from Jerusalem now on how the violence unfolded. HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Streaking across the sky in northern Israel, dozens of rockets fired from Lebanon Thursday, according to the Israel Defense Forces, which said it intercepted most of them, but some made impact, this car hitting the Israeli town of Fassuta. And in Shlomi, the storefront of this bank was destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It does seem that Hezbollah is not interested in a wider war. They're not trying to claim responsibility. Israel is targeting Hamas. Even within Lebanon, it's targeting Hamas facilities. So, I think on both sides, there is an interest in not bringing the region back to the brink as it was back in 2006 in that month-long war.But, we also see red lines may be changing. Hezbollah is thought to have instigated a very serious attack, a road bombing, an unusual road bombing within Israel about a month ago. So, they could be pushing the limits. Again, Netanyahu with his domestic landscape may be interested or even if it's not the motivation may not mind the conversation changing in the region away from his internal pressures.

And do you see a potential Iranian hand in all of this? KAYEThe Iranian factor, though, is worrying, because in the backdrop, we're also seeing growing Israeli tensions with Iran, failed nuclear agreement, Iranian confidence as it's breaking out of its regional isolation, with new normalization agreements with Saudi Arabia, with the Emirates, under the cover of Chinese brokering that agreement, and that kind of covers. So, I think there is concern Iran may have reasons to not want escalation. On the other hand, it may look at this as a separate track, and may, I think, believe incorrectly that Israel may be more vulnerable because of its internal pressures, and may see an opportunity to put the pressure on. But, I do think Israel will respond forcefully as we're seeing.",

There were hundreds of protesters here, afraid of what might happen, the three Democratic legislators, and indeed what they feared did happen. The Republican supermajority in the House of Representatives voted to expel two of them. Those two representatives expelled were Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, accused of disorderly conduct after an incident last week. A third member, Gloria Johnson, was also part of it. She survived by one vote. She is still in the legislature. But, those three legislators said they were not being acknowledged. They walked into the well of the House of Representatives last week, and started talking about what they wanted to see with gun reform after the horrifying school shooting that happened here in Nashville. But, they were declared out of order. They violated the rules. Typically, in a legislature or in Congress or in a City Council, if you violate the rules, you get a slap on the wrist, or maybe you're centered, but the decision was made to fire them, to expel them. Despite the fact that they were elected in their districts by tens of thousands of voters, they are now gone. When the decision was made for those two men to be expelled, people screamed and yelled. They actually had a die in where people were lying down in the halls of legislature. And when it all ended, and when the representatives came out, there were Tennessee troopers separating the protesters from the legislators as they came out.
