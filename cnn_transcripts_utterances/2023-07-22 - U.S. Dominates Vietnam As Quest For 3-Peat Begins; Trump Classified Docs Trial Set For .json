The tests are going to get much tougher from here. You know, for this match, it was really never a question of if the back to back champs were going to beat a World Cup debutante to Vietnam, it was really just a matter of how big the goal differential was going to be.And to your point, Amara, I think a lot of people thought maybe there weren't going to be a few more goals in this one. But the Americans did possess the ball for the majority of the three no win. That's what's really important and it certainly didn't take Sophia Smith long to make an impact in her World Cup debut, driving the ball into the back of the net to score in the 14th minute. She struck again deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. She's just shy of 23 years old. A lot of people think she's going to be the breakout star of this tournament. She became the second youngest player in U.S. women's team in history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game. Megan Rapinoe is used to that kind of thing. She started her final world cup before retirement on the bench. But she did come in as a sub in the 61st minute for her 200 cap for team USA becoming the 14th player to reach that milestone for her nation. And then the captain Lindsey Horan adding a goal of her own in the 77th minute to officially put this one away. Afterwards, Smith spoke about rising to this occasion, knowing that there is still a lot more to be done. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SOPHIA SMITH, 2 GOALS IN WORLD CUP DEBUT: I mean, it's so exciting. Every minute of that game was fun, and the crowd was amazing. And I think it was a good place to start in this tournament. But I know we have so much more to get to. I feel relieved I was a little bit anxious going into the tournament. So it's good to have a game under our belt and to kind of get a feel for it and know what to expect. But we know that the next few games are going to be hard and we're just, you know, we're going to celebrate this for a second but then put our focus into the next game. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Prosecutors say they want to move this along quickly. They suggested December as a time when they would like to take this before a jury. And they insisted that it doesn't matter if former President Trump is running for the White House again, they said he should be treated like any other busy, important person.But his defense attorneys took issue with that. They said this is an unusual case. And it would be quote, unfair to take this before a jury before the 2024 election. They insisted it was too early to even set a trial date. So here Judge Aileen Cannon split the difference, putting on the calendar, a May 2024 trial date. But in addition to that date, she also laid out a schedule, all the things, all the deadlines, all the hearings that have to happen between now and when this goes before a jury. And the Trump team said that they feel confident that they can get this push back until after the election. When you look at that schedule, it's clear how they could make that happen. Just a delay here a hearing postponed for a couple of weeks, filing where they ask for an extension. Those weeks and weeks will add up pushing this closer to the election. And when you get too close to the election itself, it is expected that the Justice Department would be less likely to want to bring this to trial. Historically, the Justice Department has tried not to take any action that could interfere with the outcome of an election. And if Trump's lawyers wanted to fight it, it would certainly be a constitutional question of first impression, ripe for the Supreme Court. Amara, Victor?",

She got a lot of criticism last year for her rulings that seem to bend over backwards to favor the former president, the person who appointed her. Well, now, I think she is doing something that, you know, gave each side something. Trump wanted a delay, and he wanted it beyond the election. He didn't get that.But he did get the delay to May 20th. And I think that is a pretty fair date because you do have some complex issues here. You have a federal act called SIPA, which involves clearances and classified documents. And so I think it's a fair date. It is at the end of the primary season. And there's a law around that time. So having Jack Smith and the Department of Justice has to breathe a sigh of relief that it wasn't postponed until after the election. But mind you, if it had been postponed until after the election, I would bet that they would have appealed to the 11th Circuit. The 11th Circuit would have reversed her and possibly even taken the case away from Judge Cannon. And she clearly was aware of that.",

Or at least I think she would have been appealed to the 11th Circuit.But here she's got the discretion to say this is complex. Now the problem was saying that for the Department of Justice is that allows her discretion to keep postponing it bit by bit piece by piece as opposed to doing it all at once. So that's the worry for Jack Smith. I think their insurance policy here though, is that they're going to indict the former president over January 6th in Washington D.C. And that court I think will move faster. And I think there you will see a trial before you'll see the trial in South Florida.",

That's the inherent tension here.Because when you run as a member of political party, you open yourself up for accusations of political bias. But as long as you follow the evidence in the law, you're going to be OK. You have to avoid politics inside the office. Once you're running for office, look, it's part of the job. That's the inherent tension here. So the fact that the former president has exploited her tweets or comments previously, to try to get her off the case is natural.

Let's get some insight now on the developments there in Ukraine, CNN military analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton joining us this morning. Good morning to you, Colonel.So we heard Putin on Fridays say that none of the help from the West has been helping in the counter offensive. President's Zelenskyy as you heard, seemingly blaming the West for, you know, having to wait for these weapons to begin the counter offensive. What are your thoughts on why it's not going as well as hoped? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning Amara. In many ways President Zelenskyy is right, the way in which the counter offensive was unveiled and the way it rolled out. It's pretty clear that, you know, number one, there should have been more secrecy. And number two, you know, everything that Zelenskyy mentioned from training, to weapons supplies, to movement of troops, all of that, and it should have been done in a much more concerted fashion in a much more synchronized fashion. And the fact that it wasn't, you know, really points to the late start. And the fact things are, in essence, slow going. We gave the -- or the Ukrainians gave the Russians six, seven months of extra time and they use that time to dig in. And the fact that they dug in use mines and in essence, created this vast minefield throughout a large portion of Ukraine about the size of Florida, that really creates a real problem for any advancing forces. And it would be very difficult for any army to get through something like this. So what's remarkable is the fact that the Ukrainians have been able to hold on to this point and make a few advances. They're not very great in terms of territory, but they are certainly not losses of territory.",

There's a lot that the Wagner group and Prigozhin bring to the table in the form of access to monies, access to all kinds of weapons systems and frankly, fairly good fighting force, at least in the Ukrainian theater. So that becomes something that the Russians need. And when Putin finds the right moment, he is going to find a way in which he can sideline and perhaps do more against Prigozhin.
