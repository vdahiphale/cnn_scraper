There are courtroom sketches from New York, Florida and Washington, D.C., as he faces dozens of criminal charges. But we have never see him asked to enter a jail until now. What could also set this arrest apart from all the rest, he could be forced to stand for a mug shot and his arraignment could also be broadcast live. The judge in this case has allowed cameras in the courtroom through at least September 8, is what we hear. CNN's Paula Reid is standing by outside the jail in Fulton County now for us. Paul, what is the latest that's happening behind you? How are they preparing?",

      "sentences": "Well, we expect the former president won't be here until later on this evening.But there are definitely security preparations under way, road closures, folks confined to certain areas if they want to come here to watch or to protest. But we don't expect, again, this will happen until after rush hour traffic. One of the goals here is not to shut the city of Atlanta down, because, even though former President Trump will be treated like any other defendant, he's not like any other defendant. He has a Secret Service detail, of course, and we have learned that he is going to get a full security escort. So here's how this is going to work. We expect that he will leave his Bedminster, New Jersey, home in the afternoon, head here to surrender around 7:00 p.m. Now, this process for most people has taken a little over an hour. It involves fingerprinting, a mug shot and some paperwork. The former president's lawyers have already come here to Georgia to negotiate his bond. So, this is just about having the former president processed. And, as you noted, even though this is his fourth indictment, this is the first time that we could see a mug shot of the former president. In his federal cases and in the criminal case in Manhattan, they opted not to do a mug shot, arguing that mug shots are used to identify people if they go on the lam. But, of course, former President Trump is one of the most recognizable people in the world, so they decided they didn't need a mug shot. But here in Fulton County, Kate, they're adamant that they want to treat every defendant equally, which is why, at this point, we do expect that mug shot will be taken. But we still have a while before the former president comes here. We also have eyes out for former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark or former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Kate, both of those men tried to get their surrender deadline pushed until after their efforts to move their case to the federal level were settled. But a judge disagreed, so both of them also expected here by noon on Friday.",

But anything that creates more of a muddle among the rest of the candidates serves Trump's project. He is way ahead. And the thing that was threatened him as if somehow all the voters who are not with him coalesced around one candidate. I don't think that happened last night. Nothing advanced that.

As you noted, the federal judge in this case declined to grant those emergency requests, because the clear language in the statute doesn't permit for it. That federal removal case will continue on. There's a hearing on Monday, an evidentiary hearing. And Fani Willis, again, in her response brief to their bids to remove this, came back really hard-hitting, noting the requirement to remove would be that these individuals were acting in their official capacity under color of law. But Fani Willis hit back, saying, not only were they not acting in their official capacities, but, in fact, they were engaging in prohibited conduct under a different statute, the Hatch Act, which actually prevents federal officials from engaging in political activity.",

The way that they are trying to combat that is they are subpoenaing people to come in for a hearing to testify under oath about what they witnessed Mark Meadows and Trump doing after the election. The latest subpoena, quite newsworthy, is being cut to Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, the man that Donald Trump called after the election, placed that call and asked him directly to find votes in the state of Georgia. Now, what the DA is arguing here is that what Mark Meadows was helping with on that call, establishing that call, what Trump was doing on that call, none of that was part of the role of the presidency, the role of the federal government, part of their jobs in the administration. And, instead, it was political activity. They're going to try and prove that at this hearing on Monday by bringing to the witness stand Brad Raffensperger. And they have also subpoenaed others to help bolster this case they're going to be making to this federal judge, others, two others, that were also listening in on that call.
