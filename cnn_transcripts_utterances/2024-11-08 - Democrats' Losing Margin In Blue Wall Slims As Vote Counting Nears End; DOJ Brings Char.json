According to the court papers on October 7th, Farhad Shakeri, who is 51 years old and lives in Iran, he's still at large, he tasked a couple of people that he had known here in the United States before he got deported, he tasked them with trying to figure out a way to kill Donald Trump. Again, that is in October 7th before the U.S. election. But according to prosecutors, there are a number of other possible victims that the Iranians were looking for. One of them is a -- an Iranian for -- an Iranian citizen who was a critic of the Iranian regime. They were surveilling this person. They were trying to figure out their comings and goings, and trying to figure out a way to carry out that assassination. According to prosecutors, there's also others who are on this list, including two Jewish-American citizens in New York as well as trying to figure out ways to care -- to kill Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. Now, this is obviously part of a broader story here that, according to the FBI, the Iranian regime has been trying to figure out ways to not only target Donald Trump but also people in this current administration that they believe that perceived to be enemies as well as carrying out other assassinations in the United States. You remember back in the summer there was another plot that was uncovered against a Pakistani citizen who was here to try to find people, again, to carry out assassinations and to do other kinds of surveillance on behalf of the Iranian regime. So again, these charges unsealed today in the U.S. district court in Manhattan. Two of those people who are charged in this plot, Dana, have been arrested. They were presented in court and have been ordered detained until trial. Shakeri, who is the leader of this plot, according to the FBI, was -- remains at large in Iran. Now I think we have a statement here from the FBI director who says that this is part of trying to expose Iran's continued brazen attempts to target U.S. citizens, including President-elect Donald Trump and other government leaders and dissidents who criticize the Iranian regime.

Of course, we heard him talk a lot about tariffs. His numbers shifted here and there, but he pledged to slap a 60 percent tariff on all goods coming in from China. For cars made in Mexico, he floated a 100 percent or 200 percent tariff and then a 10 percent tariff on all other imports. Let's talk about this with business reporter Matt Egan and CNN's Kayla Tausche. She's got brand new reporting on how Trump plans to carry this out. I guess before we get to how he's going to carry it out, as you just heard, we don't really know what this is precisely.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. President-elect Trump, he's made clear. He loves tariffs. He's described them as the greatest thing ever invented, a potential solution to almost any problem. And yet he has repeatedly falsely described how they actually work, suggesting that China is going to be the ones paying for the tariffs.In reality, that's just not the case. Let me give you an example. Let's say you have a Chinese company making sneakers in China. And they ship those sneakers to the U.S. When they get shipped to the U.S., a U.S. company then faces the cost of the tariff. So in this case, it's the 60 percent tariff. So a $100 sneaker is now $160. And the U.S. company then has to decide, are they going to eat the cost of the tariff? Which might mean maybe less money to pay workers. Maybe they can hire fewer workers. Or they could pass along the cost to consumers in the form of higher prices. More often than not, prices go higher. The National Retail Federation put out a study recently that found that Americans are going to spend tens of billions of dollars more because of these proposed tariffs. They're projecting double digit percentage increases on everything from furniture and clothes to footwear and appliances. 36 percent price hike for toys, where obviously a lot of toys were made in China. So you could have a $50 tricycle that would actually cost $68. All told, U.S. households could face $2,600 in additional costs percent year. That's according to the Peterson Institute. Now, all of this explains why a lot of mainstream economists are worried that the Trump agenda, the tariffs, in particular, could be inflationary, maybe very inflationary. But I do think it's important to emphasize that we don't know exactly what this is going to look like yet. We heard what Trump said on the campaign trail, but to Kayla's great reporting, a lot of this is still being worked out. But I think it's very important that they're careful here because if they're not, prices could go even higher for consumers.",

And we have seen President Zelenskyy really flattering President Trump about his victory because there is, we believe, you know, so much uncertainty about the way that President Trump is going to handle the support for Ukraine or perhaps remove that support from Ukraine.But I think what is really remarkable here, Dana, is that you have Elon Musk joining this conversation. And that really speaks to the possibility that Musk may, in fact, have a large voice when it comes to Trump foreign policy. Musk has really played an outsized role, not just on the campaign trail, but also when it comes to this conflict in Ukraine, because his company SpaceX has produces the Starlink internet service, which has been so pivotal in this Ukrainian fight. And in many ways, Musk has been able to control that fight because that service has been so vital for Ukrainian forces. When he has essentially hemmed in that signal, has limited that signal, Ukrainian forces have not been able to make advances on the battlefield. We've heard recently that Russian forces, in fact, have also been using the Starlink internet service and that has allowed them to make advances. Now, as far back as the fall of 2022, Musk was talking about the need for peace in Ukraine. He has not been a full throated supporter of the Ukrainian efforts against Russia. So here we have not just Trump, but Musk on the phone with Zelenskyy really raising questions about how those two men view the future of the conflict in Ukraine. Of course, Zelenskyy would like them to continue supporting his efforts. But Dana, I think in this moment, that is not necessarily certain.",
