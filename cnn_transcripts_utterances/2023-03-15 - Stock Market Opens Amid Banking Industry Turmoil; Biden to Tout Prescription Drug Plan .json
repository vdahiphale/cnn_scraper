So what this means is that some Medicare beneficiaries will pay less out-of-pocket for 27 prescription drugs. Those are drugs whose prices went up and rose faster than inflation did last year.So that would mean that seniors would, for example, see cost sharing drop from $2 to $390 per average dose for medications. Now, in addition to this being cost saving, officials also say that it would serve as a disincentive for these drug makers to raise their prices. And then Secretary Becerra mentioned that they would also be reviewing this on a quarterly basis. In fact, in a statement the HHS secretary said, quote, \"President Biden made lowering prescription drug costs for Americans a top priority, and we're using every lever we have to deliver results.\" So expect to hear some of this in President Biden's remarks this afternoon as he and his administration really focus on the measures that they are taking to save Americans some money with those out-of- pocket costs and then today specifically what that looks like for seniors and Medicare beneficiaries -- Jim and Erica.",

So if we look at this year 6.7 million people will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's- dementia. If you look at 2050 it's going to be 12.7 million. And the implications for this and what we need to help, it's a lot of things. One of them is more geriatricians. We need more people who specialize in care for the elderly. We also need more good treatments for Alzheimer's that are actually affordable. There are two treatments out there that can slow the progression of the disease, but there's two issues, one, there are some questions about how effective they really are, and two, they are enormously expensive and many insurance policies are really, really not so -- you would have a hard time getting your insurance to pay for them. So those are really two big problems that we're seeing right now -- Jim, Erica.",

That it's just embarrassing, you know, you've been successful all your life and then all of a sudden, wow, I'm having trouble remembering things. And fear, denial. You don't want to think that you're headed towards Alzheimer's. Another thing that's standing in the way and this is sort of part of the denial is that people think it's just a part of aging. It's not necessarily a part of aging.So let's take a look at what some of the symptoms are of mild cognitive impairment. Mild cognitive impairment you can think of as almost like a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. So losing things often, forgetting events or appointments that you should know about, and having more trouble coming up with words when you compare yourself to other people of the same age. And so don't just attribute these things to, oh, I'm getting older. You want to make sure that you know exactly what this is. Now, to be clear, your doctor might not have a lot of great prescriptions for you, but they will be able to help you think about what could lie ahead and how to plan for it.",

We made landfall, one of the first times you step foot in the Antarctic Peninsula you're greeted by colonies of penguins, the cuties creatures arguable on the planet. My toddler loves them.But soon sort of the wonder turns to worry when you realize that a lot of these nesting moms, those chicks and those eggs, there's no way they can survive because they got freakishly late snow. They're supposed to be hatched by Christmas. But like we've had bizarre weather patterns in the states they're seeing the same thing down there. At the same time, as the sea ice goes away that is the key habitat for krill. The little shrimp like creatures that are at the bottom of the food chain. They feed everything from the penguins to the sea birds to the humpback whales. And now ecologists, we were hanging out with whale specialists who have proven that when sea ice goes down, krill goes down, and humpback whale pregnancy rates go down. We were using darts on crossbows. That's how you give a pregnancy test to a humpback whale to take a blubber sample. Also measure their stress levels. And so, you know, penguins and whales are sort of our metaphorical canaries. What's happening down there, the water under those glaciers is heating up so much, it's melting that sea ice, and then of course we worry about our lives being impacted at sea levels, from Miami to Shanghai with one of those big glaciers like the Thwaites glacier breaks loose.",

It's set aside for peace and science. How often do you hear that combination of words, right? And since the Antarctic Treaty in the late '50s when 12 nations signed on, there is now 55 nations. They stopped the slaughter of humpback whales.Back in our great-grandparents' generation, killed them by the millions. They would kill the penguins, use their blubber to grease the machines that kill the whales. It was just decimation industry down there. All of those species, many of them have come back fully now. There are other new pressures, the climate change, ocean pollution, ghost nets, shipping traffic that threatens these creatures as well. But as an example of what can happen if humanity agrees on something, some people even think we should use Antarctica as a model for how to behave in space as the human race, and how to think about colonizing the moon or other planets in a cooperative way. So we learned our lesson down there. The question is, can we keep that going and extend it, create blue corridors for some of these massive creatures, that had turned out to be our biggest climate allies for the services they provide the planet for free.
