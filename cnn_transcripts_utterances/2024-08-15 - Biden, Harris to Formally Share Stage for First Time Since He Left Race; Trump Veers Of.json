The major security operation underway as hundreds of thousands of Swifties are expected in London.I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman. This is CNN News Central. Today, for the first time since President Biden decided to drop out of the presidential race, he and Vice President Kamala Harris are teaming up. The two sharing the stage in Maryland to talk about lowering drug prices for Americans. It all centers around Medicare's new power to negotiate with drug companies. The White House says the first round of talks saved billions of dollars for seniors and the federal government. Reducing drug costs is part of Harris' economic message to voters, a plan she is set to lay out in her first major policy speech tomorrow in North Carolina. CNN's Isaac Dovere joining us now. Isaac, what can you tell us about this? What's the very latest on this new messaging we're about to hear on Friday? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes. Look, we have the president and the vice president appearing together for the first time, really, since all the changes happened in the campaign, but they are using it to make that news that you just laid out about the drug prices. And that is something they say will save at least $1.5 billion for consumers on the ten most popular drugs, things that affect diabetes, heart disease, things like that. So, a really direct way of changing the money that is in people's bank accounts and having more of it and having less of it go to drug companies. That's how they are using this appearance and it's part of the buildup of her own larger economic rollout that we're going to start to see tomorrow.",

I haven't heard that laugh in about a week. That's why they keep her off the stage. That's why she's disappeared. That's the laugh of a crazy person, I will tell you, if you haven't heard. It's crazy. She's crazy. Her laugh is career-threatening. They said, don't laugh. She doesn't laugh. She doesn't laugh anymore. It's smart, but someday it's going to come out.

In fact, he said at one point, he sort of joked, there's supposed to talk about the economy, but let's get back to the fun stuff because I know that's what you're here for.And he did get some defense yesterday of this approach from his vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, who, on the campaign trail, said, quote to the people who say Donald Trump should do something different, they had an opportunity to make Donald Trump do something different by challenging him over three separate primaries every single one of which he won. So, I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to run the campaign that he wants to run. Of course, John, it's not just former rivals, like Nikki Haley, who are criticizing this approach as we reported and you and I talked about yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they are also urging Donald Trump to get back on message and attack Harris' policies and not her personality.",

And as well, you know, Donald Trump has been watching as the spotlight has been seized for the past three weeks by Vice President Harris and they have been straining and trying to get him back into -- get some momentum back for his campaign. And one of the ways that has worked for him in the past is by getting in front of cameras, get being unscripted. The problem that they have had lately is that the unscripted Donald Trump is reminding a lot of people why they didn't vote for him four years ago instead of encouraging some new people to get into the mix.",

And you mentioned the security concerns, of course, but the London mayor has pointed out that there has been additional security measures taken per se. It's just that they've outlined them carefully for concertgoers.So, the rules include you cannot congregate outside Wembley Stadium. That's going to be a disappointment. If you know about tay-gating, that's a very popular thing for Swifties to do. Those who do have tickets will be moved on into the stadium and everyone who does not have a ticket has been asked not to go there, Sara, at all. So, what that means is away from the stadium, we might see some of the Swifties gathering and preparing. You mentioned that foiled terror plot that was in Austria. What I saw there last week is the response to this very hateful potential attack on Swifties was love, was community, was exchanging friendship bracelets in the streets of Vienna. So, I expect to see a lot more of that in London as well today. And you have to remember, London has its own tragedy. England has its own tragedy with concerts. In 2017, the Ariana Grande concert was attacked by a terror plot. 22 people were killed. So, authorities are absolutely already prepared for the possibility of any potential attacks and those security measures are very much in place. But, again, the calls are do not congregate outside the stadium for those Swifties. No tay-gating today.",

And he has made clear to those close to him that he was particularly unhappy with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In fact, the two leaders have yet to speak since Biden bowed out of the race.Now, this new reporting from our White House team really provides some insight into President Biden's headspace at this time. Sources stopped short of using that word, grudge, but they did say that Biden would not soon forget those who had pushed publicly and privately for him to exit the race. Now, Biden, as you mentioned, has been alternating between being embittered and relieved about the decision to bow out of the 2024 race, with some saying that he is still processing this entire situation. Now, another source said that while Biden was unhappy in the moment, he hasn't spent time ruminating about the decision. But still, this reporting does highlight some apparent tension between Biden and Pelosi, two Democratic leaders who became friends early on in their political careers and rose in their own ways to lead the Democratic Party. Now, Pelosi was actually asked about her current relationship with Biden in a recent interview with the New Yorker. Take a listen to that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
