Thedeath toll in Gaza continues to soar as eight agencies warn of hunger and desperation. Also, terrifying scenes in Russia as a mob storms an airport and vents its anger against Jews and Israeli travelers. Plus, in Egypt, dozens of trucks carrying aid supplies wait to cross into Gaza. Hello, everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is on assignment today. Welcome to \"One World\". Hamas appears to be stepping up its propaganda campaign as Israel expands and escalates its assault on Gaza. The militant terror group has released a short video showing three women who the IDF has confirmed are hostages. Now, it comes as the IDF says its troops are carrying out an extended ground operation in Gaza that is only set to intensify. We are also seeing another round of heavy airstrikes. The Israeli air force says that it has attacked about 600 terrorist targets in the last few days. New video, meanwhile, shows an Israeli tank apparently firing on a passenger vehicle south of Gaza city. A military spokesperson told CNN that Hamas uses civilian equipment inside of Gaza, while acknowledging that he didn't know who was inside the car. Well, the death toll in Gaza is soaring, and the U.N. warns that amid the growing hunger and desperation there, civil order is now breaking down. The Ministry of Health in Ramallah says that more than 8000 civilians have been killed in Gaza since the conflict began, including more than 3000 children. Those numbers are drawn from sources inside of Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. One leading humanitarian organization says the number of children reported killed in Gaza has surpassed the annual number of children killed in armed conflict globally since 2019. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now from London. And Salma, that is a sobering figure. This organization being saved -- the children. What more we learning about the situation now in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "All right, Salma Abdelaziz, you've been covering it for us so thoroughly for us, thank you. Let's get more detail now about the situationin Northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are pushing further into the enclave. The Israeli military says its troops killed four senior Hamas operatives in its latest operation. And it says that it has thus far succeeded in using drones and air power to foil Hamas attempts to hit back. And Israel claims it has destroyed a number of Hamas missile launch pads, as well as other terrorist infrastructure. Our Nic Robertson is in Sderot, Israel, near the border with Gaza. And Nic, obviously, this is an ambitious operation that Israel has launched, not only targeting those launchpads, but obviously trying to get access to those tunnels. And there are over 1300 tunnels that Hamas has built inside of Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think the aim is, with troops on the ground, it is to identify better where the locationsof those tunnels are. And, if possible, be able to extract hostages. But it is a huge, huge reach. You need that accurate intelligence. You need to know, for example, what you are going to face, and how extensive that tunnel is. What the IDF is saying now is that they have increased their operations. They've put more troops inside of Gaza. They say that they are using the troops to identify locations of terrorists, and then they are calling in air support to take out those locations. And that's what we have heard all day. We've heard the planes flying around the overhead. You can see the contrails sort of flying lazy loops outside of Gaza. And then you hear an explosion, a detonation from one of the missiles dropped from those fighter jets. So, that's what we're seeing unfold on the ground, a cause for the civilians there is putting the much closer and much more in the line of fire. Potentially, the IDF has dropped leaflets over Gaza, telling people it is now a battle zone, a battle ground, telling them to leave and move to the south. Indeed, journalist inside of Gaza caught on camera a tank firing of what looked like a civilian vehicle, very close range. The IDF has said that they don't know who was in the vehicle and questioned whether the journalist could tell if it was terrorists or civilians in the vehicle. However, what we do know from talking to soldiers who are part of the 2014 incursion, they were told back then that when they went to Gaza because civilians had been told to clear the area, that they would be in a battlefield. And any targets that they saw, anything that they saw was either a terrorist or somebody affiliated with a terrorist. And for those soldiers going in and then, they understood that whatever they saw was a potential threat, and they could fire. So, it does appear as if the rules of engagement, this time, if not exactly the same, very very similar. So, it does put civilians on the ground, close to those troops in danger, and hence, what we are seeing an increased effort, it appears, by the IDF to warn people to leave. But for many of them, they don't know how to do it, they can't do it. So, the danger is perhaps now closer and even more present than it was when it was just artillery and missiles.",

Have a look at this map that shows the skirmishes that have been happening along Israel's border with Lebanon where Hezbollah forces have been probing at Israeli defenses. The black dots are Israeli communities where residents have been ordered to evacuate. And if we look at the wider region as a whole, we see all of the places where U.S. forces have come under attack in Syria and Iraq, often with drones. At least 21 U.S. service men have been injured in the attacks. Both Israel and the U.S. blame Iran for these incidents. Iran says that it is not instructing groups to attack anyone, but it is well-known that Hezbollah and other armed groups in the region are supported by Tehran. On Sunday, Iran's President warned that Israel's attacks in Gaza had gone too far. He said Israel had, quote, \"crossed red lines and was risking bringing other nations into the conflict\".

A U.N relief director says the \"Fabric of Society\" in Gaza is starting to break down.With supplies running low and much of Gaza reduced to rubble, the U.N. says hundreds of desperate Gaza residents broke into U.N. warehouses grabbing essential items. An Egyptian official earlier said 75 aid trucks carrying food, medicines and supplies were waiting to cross into Gaza. As CNN stringer at the Rafah crossing says 26 of those trucks have now passed into Gaza. Even though they all have been making it through though, it will still only be a fraction of the roughly 450 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the war. Now, as with many wars, the most vulnerable in-depth bearing the brunt of pain, likely children and the elderly. The Israel-Hamas conflict is no exception. In fact, the NGO \"Save The Children\" reports that the number of children killed in Gaza over the last three weeks surpasses the annual number of children killed across all of the world's conflict zones since 2019. Hospitals in Gaza are overwhelmed if and if they are still operational at all. That means children who are injured and babies just born may not get the help they need to survive. Now, let's talk about the mental health effects, as well. Repeated exposure to traumatic events can interfere with physical and mental development as well. According to UNICEF, a 15-year-old in the Middle East has already lived through several major conflicts and even babies in the womb feel the trauma experienced by the mother. That has led to an increased call for a sustained ceasefire to allow the injured to get medical help and allow humanitarian aid to reach those in need and most of all, to stop the death toll from growing even further. Time now for The Exchange and we're joined by Toby Fricker, spokesman for UNICEF who joins us from Amman, Jordan. Toby, thank you so much for the time.

But things have changed a lot in the last few weeks. It is a pretty significant ban, to be honest. He's going to be on the sidelines for a while -- three years. Liverpool's world-governing body FIFA said that Rubiales had been banned from all football related activities for three years. I'm sure you remember the scandalous kiss that completely marred Spain's triumph at the Women's World Cup just a few months ago. The player, Jenny Hemoso said that the kiss was not consensual. After intense criticism, Rubiales resigned as president of the Spanish Football Federation. Last month, the team's manager, Jorge Wilder, was also fired. FIFA's disciplinary committee found that Rubiales had acted in breach of Article 13 of their disciplinary code. FIFA says the ban covers all football- related activities at national and international level, but that it is subject to a possible appeal before the FIFA Appeal Committee. So, we'll see if there's any more twists and turns to come in this story, but certainly the Spanish women's football team just wanting to move on from this and hopefully get the credit that they deserve because in the aftermath of winning that final against England, the whole thing was just completely overshadowed by that scandal and it was just such a shame for the players.",

Times\" he was found unresponsive in his hot tub. His family, fans, and colleagues are expressing their sadness over his passing, including the creator of \"Friends\". They write, \"We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment, not just to his work, but in life, as well.\" CNN's Camila Bernal joins us from Los Angeles with a closer look at the legacy Matthew Perry leaves behind. And such tragic news over the weekend, Camila, that, you know, the talent, the celebrity there, and obviously a lot of his own demons that had been haunting him that he'd been very vocal about for many years. What more do we know about the expected toxicology report and what else you're hearing from authorities?",

We do know right now that the medical examiner's office here in Los AngelesCounty is still investigating and sources telling us that what they're waiting for is that toxicology report. So, in the meantime, they have labeled the cause of death as deferred. And normally, to get a complete autopsy and toxicology report, it takes a couple of weeks. So, essentially, patience is what we have to have. In terms of what happened, the 911 call came out at 4:07 on Saturday and it was initially reported as a water rescue emergency. Then it was LAPD who came in and categorized it as a death investigation. And you mentioned the \"L.A. Times\" there reporting that he was found unresponsive in his hot tub. So, we'll have to wait for LAPD and for the medical examiner to really piece together exactly what happened and how he died. In the meantime, though, the family is releasing the statement saying that they are heartbroken by the tragic loss of their son and brother, saying that he brought joy to the world, not just in his acting, but as a friend, and you mentioned his struggles. Well, part of the reason that he said he shared those struggles was to be remembered as someone who helped people. He wanted to help others. He said he wanted to be able to relate to talk to people and to help anybody he could, whether that be one on one or in a group. He also, as he was promoting his memoir that was released in November of 2022, said he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well, someone who loved well, who was a seeker. Of course, so many of us know him as Chandler from \"Friends\" but he had many roles on TV and in movies. And in \"Friends\" though, he was very close to his other cast mates. I mean, this was \"Friends\" on and off the screen. They famously negotiated their contracts together. We have not heard from the cast of \"Friends\", so we're waiting to see if there's any reaction on that. But definitely, many others in Hollywood reacting and talking about how much joy he brought to them, how much laughter and just how nice it was to be around him and to watch him on \"Friends\" and on other shows. So, of course, many saying that this is a big loss for Hollywood and for all of his fans, Bianna.",

Well, CNN has just learned that a female Israeli soldier has been released from Hamas captivity. That is the word from the Israeli military, which adds that the soldier was released during the military's ground operation in Gaza. Let's get more information from our Sam Kiley from London. This is quite the development, Sam. What more do we know?",

She was released yesterday, has been reunited with her family. The IDF published a picture of her with her family and that she's reported to be in good health. Now, this is a very remarkable development because I think for two reasons. The first is that there was no yet reporting of some kind of spectacular military or special forces operation to get her out if that was what unfolded. And also that she is in good health. There has been very serious concerns that particularly IDF soldiers might be subjected to beatings or torture at the hands of Hamas extremists, but clearly she has been able to be released and in good health, which is a very remarkable development. We, no doubt, will -- might hear more from the IDF later on, but given that there are more than 200 hostages still in Gaza. I think any revelations about how she was found, how she was released, to what extent the military would directly involve the intelligence operation behind this -- these are all questions that we'll all ask, but I don't imagine the IDF will go into great detail, not yet.",
