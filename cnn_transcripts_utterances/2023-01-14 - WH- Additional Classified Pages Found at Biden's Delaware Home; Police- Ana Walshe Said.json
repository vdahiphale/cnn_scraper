On the same day the Attorney General names a special counsel to the case.Ukraine says Russian missiles are responsible for a new airstrike on an apartment building in Dnipro. Right now, at least a dozen are dead and nearly 60 more or injured. Plus, more than 25 million or under floodwaters across California's heavy rains so already waterlogged areas. You are in the CNN Newsroom. Well, new disclosures from the White House today, President Joe Biden's aides found additional pages of classified material at his personal residence in Wilmington, Delaware this week. It happened on Thursday, the same day that Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the appointment of a special counsel to investigate this matter. And that is in addition to documents found back in November, and in December, but not publicly announced until this past week. CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez joins us now. So, in all, Evan, there are about 20 documents found between the President's private home and at the Penn Biden center, do you -- is this it or do you expect more to be found?",

And that's never a good thing for a White House, right? It's a political problem, for sure. But it is also possibly a legal problem. Because it does, you know, having you've covered the Justice Department for a number of years and you know how investigators think and when they see shifting stories, they start thinking perhaps there might be something here that you're hiding.

So the ozone hole was caused by human-made chemicals. Remember those chemicals we had in our spray cans and refrigerators and air conditioners, even some of the chemicals that used to be in Nike Air shoes. And all over the world, all of the nations of the world got together and they said we have to stop producing these chemicals. And it wasn't easy, but they did it. And now, we're seeing the ozone hole start to recover. And that shows us that if we can get together and say we have to stop producing heat trapping gases, we truly can tackle this problem of climate change, too. So it gives me hope on the one hand, but on the other hand, I know that carbon emissions are woven into every part of our society. We need to change every aspect of how we get our energy. And why do we want to do that? Because we will end up with a healthier, cleaner, safer, better world for all of us.",

A spokesperson for Exxon vaguely pushed back on this saying: \"Exxon's understanding of climate science has developed along with that of the broader scientific community.\" Fossil fuel companies looking out for their own interest isn't particularly surprising, obviously.

And this will be evidence in about 20 trials around the country, States, cities suing Big Oil for selling -- knowingly selling the public, you know, this harmful product and deceiving.But it's interesting, the Montreal Protocol we were just talking about with Professor Hayhoe, considered the greatest environmental treaty ever, all of these countries came together. The difference in that one, though, is the makers of those chemicals in the United States wanted to change. They wanted to lead to something cleaner, so they would be market leaders. The US Chamber of Commerce was behind closing the hole in the ozone layer. How do you get Exxon and Chevron and the rest, to you know, decide that their product needs to be -- we need to move beyond that? Will it be the Courts? Will it be social license by folks? Legislation? Who knows? But it is the story of the future for sure.",

I mean, one military representative told RAND that there were servicemembers with families and children, making the salary of an E4, that is a corporal or specialist who need help getting food on the table. E4 is one of the most common enlisted ranks in the US Army, base pay is just $2,500.00 a month.These people may also get a housing allowance, but it's still not easy to survive, especially with a family.

These are your young privates, new members of the military, E4s, E5s, and while they do receive a wage, it is certainly something that needs to be discussed.And when they talk about food insecurity, while military members do receive a BAS, which is a Basic Allowance for Subsistence, that is only meals for the servicemember. So to your point, if someone is married, and they have some children, that BAS allowance does not cover their meals.   BROWN:   Yes, and we have foods insecurity to find on your screen, limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods, limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways. And I think you raised a good point, some military members, they can go to the cafeteria on the base, right and eat for free. It is different, though, depending on a military member and supporting their family and spouse and that kind of thing. And so I think that's important context for this. Thousands of needing military families, they don't qualify for SNAP benefits, because their housing allowances push their total income too high. Is that right?",

The basic allowance for housing is a housing subsidy that military members qualify for if there's not adequate on base housing.However, that subsidy they receive is actually counted as income. And so even that small amount that they receive to help pay for housing for themselves and their family members, is just enough to disqualify them for SNAP benefits. So that is absolutely something that is a low hanging fruit that could really make a difference in the lives of many of our servicemen and women.",

The big win coming down on Friday, the 13th, and it turns out that this is real lucky -- a really lucky day for Mega Millions players. Six previous jackpots were won on that day. Michigan coming in especially lucky with four wins in the State there for the jackpot, the big win there 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017. Friday's winner matched all six numbers. Those numbers are 30, 43, 45, 46, 61 and the Mega Ball number of 14. So I spoke with the owner of Hometown Gas and Grill in Lebanon, Maine where that winning ticket was sold.
