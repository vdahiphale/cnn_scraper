CNN's Daniel Dale is with us now. Daniel, Trump has fired off a barrage of false claims about what happened in Georgia since election night in 2020. But give us the truth. Give us the fact-check.",

      "sentences": "It's been two and a half years of lies continuing into this morning when he repeated his vague false claim that the election was rigged. We know that's false.There's also been a bunch of thoroughly debunked specific conspiracy theories. I listed 10 lies in an article, \"Ten Lies About Georgia\" in an article on CNN.com. Two of them stand out to me. One of them is this claim about thousands of dead voters in Georgia. At one point, he said it was 5,000. Then he made it 10,000. And so when reporters said OK give us some names. the Trump campaign provided names. This was in 2020. We looked into them. These were living people. For example, they claimed that a dead person named Debra Jean Christiansen had somehow cast a ballot. Well, we knocked on the door of the living Debra Jean Christiansen, just a woman who happened to have the same name. So it's an example of just how half-baked many of these lies are. Another one that stands out is this claim that Trump keeps repeating, thoroughly discredited, thoroughly debunked, about two Fulton County election workers supposedly having been caught on camera stuffing the ballot box, taking ballots out of suitcases. They were completely exonerated by a state investigation. It stands out to me because two senior officials in Trump's own Justice Department, people he appointed himself, have testified they told him directly in 2020 that there was nothing to this. They were not even suitcases. These people did not scan the ballots over and over. It was all wrong. And yet, two and a half years later, the former president keeps saying it.",

So once these crimes are done, once people see all the evidence, I hold out hope that there's going to be like a moment of awakening and saying, look, what have we done.Right now, what you have is, look, to support Donald Trump you have to, like, give a little piece of your soul because you say, well, in 2016, it was I don't like the guy but the Supreme Court's so important. In 2020, it was I don't like Joe Biden, so I'll support Donald Trump. And then you keep having to invest more and more. It's like the sunken cost fallacy. In Vietnam, there was a point at which we had lost 10,000 troops and nobody wanted to leave because we'd already invested 10,000 troops' lives in Vietnam, so we have to stay. And that's kind of, I think, what's happening to a lot of people. To then turn your support against Trump and admit that he's unfit for office, you have to take inventory of the fact that you supported him for so long when he was unfit for office. But I think at the moment all this evidence is laid out in court -- it may not be directly as a result of that -- but I think that's the beginning of the end of this base of support for him.

But the base is so rabidly pro Trump that they can't do it.And what amazes me, Jim, is like, if you're going to run for president and the frontrunner is Donald Trump, you literally have two choices. You either have to take him on -- and boy, you don't have to look for a lot of issues. The guy broke the law a bunch. And he's now out on bail three different times, now soon to be a fourth. That's a pretty good thing to run against him on. So you either have to do that or just drop out and endorse him. Because he's way ahead anyway. I don't understand how these folks are scared to speak out against him. It's fine. If you're scared of doing it or you don't want to do it, I get it. Then drop out of the race because it doesn't make sense for you to be there right now. Chris Christie's spoken loudly. Will Hurd. Asa Hutchinson and Mike Pence to an extent.

He's spoken out a little more recently.I mean, he could have been, by the way, the leader of this whole thing if he'd have just stuck with that from January 7th. But Chris Christie will be. He's realizing that he's not playing to the crowd that's there on the debate stage. He's talking to the voters that are actually watching. And there is no way -- I mean, he's in second place now in New Hampshire. So this is going to be all about Donald Trump. It will be interesting, though, to watch the second tier of folks, whether it's Ramaswamy and some others, do their best to try to really suck up to Donald Trump because I think some of them are running for vice president or running for a cabinet position and not actually for the presidency. And it's going to be -- I think, after this debate, there will be a lot of clarity on who really wants to be president and who just wants a position in the cabinet.",

I'm not sure if it's an attitude issue, if it's just how long that's been going on. But he can't run away from justice. And I think that's the key. He's going to be loud about it and say it's not justice. It is justice. Look at Eric Herschmann's comment to John Eastman shortly after January 6th or leading up to January 6th. He said, hey, John, my recommendation to you is to get a good blanking lawyer because you're going to need it.

He's represented Cardi B. for a felony assault charge that she was charged with, brought it down to a misdemeanor. He's also represented people in high-profile murder trials, also in political corruption scandals. And one thing he's always said is that everyone deserves a fair defense. That, despite the fact he's now on the former president's legal team. However, he has been very critical of former President Trump in numerous instances all over Twitter. I mean, it was back in 2017 when Trump had fired the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, when Drew Findling wrote this. He said, \"The firing was a sign of fear he would aggressively investigate the stench hovering over this president of the United States, or POTUS.\" He also tweeted about Trump in 2017 after Trump tweeted something about LeBron James. Drew Findling said this. \"The racist architect of fraudulent Trump University criticizing LeBron. POTUS pathetic once again.\" So, Jessica, he has really criticized the former president. But at the same time, when he was named to be one of Trump's attorneys down in Georgia, he talked to \"The New York Times\" in 2022 and he said that, \"I represent everybody.\" And he put it this way. He said, \"We have our personal lives and we have our personal politics and I don't apologize for my personal politics.\" So he will be a staunch defender of the former president once we get to all of the hearings and legal wranglings and eventual trial in Georgia. He released this part of the statement from the entire legal team last night, saying, \"The events that have unfolded today have been shocking and absurd.\" He continued to say, \"We look forward to a detailed review of this indictment, which is undoubtably just as flawed and unconstitutional as this entire process has been.\" So he will be a staunch defender of the former president.",
