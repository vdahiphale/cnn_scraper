In the capital of Kyiv, doctors have been forced to perform surgery via flashlight. This picture was taken during heart surgery on a child. Imagine that with flashlights. Southwest of Kyiv, some 3,000 miners have been rescued after the power outages left them trapped underground. And on the battlefield today, Russia and Ukraine carrying out a prisoner exchange. 100 soldiers in total. In some cases, though, there was no negotiating. CNN Sam Kiley takes us to the liberated city of Kherson, where resistance fighters have shown no mercy and no remorse. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Archie killed twice while he was still a teenager. (on-camera): If I'm the guy, he stops to pee. So I'm having a pee. And then what do you do?",

Archie struck again moments later, another drunk Russian soldier. Another throat cut. He acted alone, but now he was one of Kherson's resistance fighters. ARCHIE, RESISTANCE FIGHTER (through translation): They're wasted. It had only been a few days since they entered the city. I finished the first one immediately and then caught up with the other one and killed him on the spot. I threw with a knife and the jacket covered with blood and just left. KILEY (voice-over): Archie was only 19 when the Russians captured his city in March. With a friend he says he drove around the city gathering intelligence to send to Ukraine's Armed Forces. ARCHIE (through translation): At least 10 Russians were slaughtered every night. I wasn't the only one in Kherson. There were a lot of athletic and clever partisan guys. KILEY (voice-over): For eight months, Ukrainian partisans waged a psychological war against the occupiers and their collaborators, targeting Ukrainians who took top posts handed out by Russia. KIRIL STREMOUSOV, RUSSIAN-APPOINTED DEPUTY HEAD OF KHERSON REGION (through translation): As a result of a sneaky terrorist attack today, our colleague, my friend Dmitry Savluchenko has died. KILEY (voice-over): Stremousov himself would die in the final days of Russia's occupation of Kherson city, which ended three weeks ago. Kherson was the only regional capital to fall to Russia, but its population made sure that the invaders were unwelcome from the start. (on-camera): That's incoming. Then the last hour or so that we've been here in Kherson, there's been a constant, shelling backwards and forwards. Almost all of that shelling will ultimately rely on somebody on the ground, telling the gunner where to drop those bombs. (voice-over): Ihor was a young father. This warehouse is wrecked because of him. IHOR, RESISTANCE FIGHTER (through translation): The Russian military kept here around 20 to 30 vehicles. There were armored trucks ABCs. And the Russians lived here. I was passing by this place and I saw all the vehicles. KILEY (voice-over): Ihor communicated on his phone app with his handler, codename, the smoke. IHOR (through translation): I turned on the camera and pointed it at the building and I was just walking and talking on the phone. And the camera was filming. I deleted the video of course, because if they would stop me somewhere and check my videos and pictures, there will be questions. KILEY (voice-over): Less than a day later, he says, Russian vehicles were a mangled mess as Ukraine rained missiles down on the newly identified target. It was a crucial stead in destroying Russia's capacity to hold on to the city. [13:40:16] With the Russians now massed on the eastern side of the Dnipro River, they're close and still control 60 percent of the province, which they claim is now part of Russia. No doubt there are many Ukrainians among them, who will also prepare to prove them wrong and to kill. (on-camera): Do you feel sorry for the guys who killed at all? IHOR (through translation): Yes. No. KILEY (voice-over): Sam Kiley, CNN, Kherson City. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Shanquella Robinson's family tells us she was vacationing in Cabo San Lucas with a group of friends from college when she died. A video that appears to have been taken during the trip and was later posted online reveals that Robinson was thrown on the floor and beaten by another woman while at least one other person was recording.The FBI has since opened its own investigation into the story. Ryan Young is following this developing news. And Ryan, what can you tell us about the arrest warrant? Who's it for?",

They haven't put their name out of that person. But just like you mentioned, that social media video has been spreading all over the Internet.We can't show it to you just yet, but what we do know is the video was quite violent. And in it, you can hear people screaming and yelling at Shanquella Robinson is pretty much dragged through this hotel villa. We do know they called police, and at some point, she suffered some sort of spinal fracture. And so many people were upset about this. This was spreading across the Internet because people were asking for answers. Those friends returned to North Carolina, and at this point, Mexican authorities have issued that warrant. But as you can imagine, her friends and family membershave been very upset about how long this has taken. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This all happened around after October 28, when the six friends arrived in Cabo, San Lucas. But since then, we haven't really got any information about what may have set the fight off.But I can tell you by watching the video, you never see Robinson fight back. You see her take blow after blow after blow until she hits the ground at some point. And then there are all these questions about what happened next. How much medical attention did she receive? And then why it took so long for authorities to start this investigation and the way they did. Boris, so many questions, as you can understand why this is going viral and so many people want answers.",

It's the first time in their last four World Cups that they have started with a win. And you are right to highlight the situation with Ronaldo and Manchester United because that has really dominated the build up to their opening game.And it seemed as though it might actually impact the team and the team dynamic. It's always about Cristiano Ronaldo. It's always been about the biggest ego in the team. And I think they really could have done without that distraction. But I think that now that they've got this game out of the way, they could actually have a good run in this tournament. You're right to point out Ghana as well. They didn't make it easy. It was a 3-2 win for Portugal. The African team made it tough. They became the first African team in this tournament to score any goals prior to this. The four teams that go before them hadn't, but they still ended up on the losing side. So, unfortunately, a disappointing night for Ghana. And the big game of the day, or arguably the big game of the day, is about to kick off just in a few minutes time. It's tournament favorites, Brazil against Serbia. Serbia are a team not to be underestimated, by the way. They actually qualified ahead of Portugal from the European section. I think they could give Brazil a bit of a run for their money tonight.",

A handful of American players will play in the Premier League, so there's going to be a lot of familiarity in this game. Good history between these teams.You might know that the USA beat England, famously at the World Cup in 1950. They played to a drawback in 2010. I think this will be a really, really, really good game. The USA disappointed to draw against Wales the other day. They're going to be looking for something a bit better tomorrow.",
