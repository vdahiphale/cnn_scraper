You have to have the proper clearances because this is a national security case dealing with sensitive classified information. But the fact that this is moving along pretty quickly, right? We were just in court two days ago. She's giving a timeline of five days. This is so significant because what we've been saying is one of the keyways that she can influence this case is through timing. And that's in ways big and small. And one of them is scheduling, right? If you want to wait a week to make an announcement, then give people another few weeks, that's one of the ways that you could potentially work against the special counsel who wants a speedy trial. But here, this is the first time we're hearing from her. She's two days out from the initial appearance, the arraignment and she's saying, look, you have five days to update me on the status of your clearances.

They really tried to paint a contrasting picture earlier this morning of an otherwise peaceful day at a synagogue on a rainy Saturday morning in October of 2018 within the moment that Robert Bowers, the defendant, and I'm quoting here from the prosecution, \"turned a sacred house of worship into a hunting ground.\" The prosecution further said that Bowers killed Jewish people just because they were Jewish. The prosecution, then this morning continued to show some of the most graphic, horrible images of the victims of the synagogue shooting. They were, again, very visceral. They were brutal. They showed something -- played some of the 911 calls that we've heard throughout the past two and a half weeks of this trial as well. And I want to say that we've actually had a view this time in the courthouse of the family members and some of the victims who survived this attack as well. They all the while sat stoically just very intently listening to the prosecution. Then we took a lunch break. Then this afternoon, the defense brought up its case and -- rather its closing argument. And, Brianna, the defense only spoke for less than 25 minutes. The defense said that there is no dispute that Bowers was the one who killed those worshippers. Instead, the defense tried to say that his motives were in question here. That he did not kill these people because they were Jewish, but because one of the congregations -- one of the three that were present at the Tree of Life supported a refugee group. And that this mass killing was more about immigrants and not specifically about Jewish people. As I said, the prosecution then made a rebuttal statement basically saying to the jury, disregard that. That is not what happened here. This is about this man trying to kill Jewish people. Again, this case going to the jury momentarily, Brianna.",
