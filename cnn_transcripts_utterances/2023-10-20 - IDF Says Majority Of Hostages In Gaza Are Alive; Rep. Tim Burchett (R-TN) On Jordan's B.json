So we did try to get more clarity on that.I wanted to give you a chance to talk about something I know that you had the opportunity to do. With all the frustration and pain and waiting, you did have an opportunity to talk to President Biden.

He cried with us. He got screamed at by people not who were angry at him but just expressing their frustration at the fate of the world and he listened. And he said I understand the importance of screaming and if I need to get back on with you tomorrow for you to scream more, I will do it. So his empathy has been remarkable. And I'll say beyond that the U.S. administration, Congress, has been saying all of the right things. The empathy is there and I hope that the action is there as well.
