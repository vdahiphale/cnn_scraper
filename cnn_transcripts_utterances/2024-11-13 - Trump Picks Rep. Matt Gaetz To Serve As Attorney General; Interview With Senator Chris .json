      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.Let me begin to show by uttering some words that I never contemplated using together before. And those words are, U.S. Attorney General Matt Gaetz. If you were wondering what Trump without the guardrails looked like -- well, we're getting an idea beyond the theoretical. We're starting with breaking news on so many fronts related to President- elect Donald Trump's administration. President-elect, of course, Trump announced just minutes ago on Truth Social that he is picking Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida to be the next U.S. attorney general. Gaetz is currently facing a House Ethics Committee investigation over whether he may have, and I should note before I even outline the charges, Gaetz denies it all. The House Ethics Committee in a statement this year said they're looking into whether he may have, quote, engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct, unquote. Again, Gaetz denies it all. Gaetz also famously led the movement to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. In that post on Truth Social, just minutes ago, Trump said of Gaetz, quote, Matt will end weaponized government, protect our borders, dismantle criminal organizations and restore Americans badly shattered faith and confidence in the Justice Department. Matt will route out the corruption at the Department of Justice and return the department to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and Constitution. This attorney general announcement comes on the heels of two other significant Trump picks this afternoon and one yesterday. Trump also plans to appoint a one-time Democrat who announced this, former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii to be the director of National Intelligence. Yesterday we heard that he intends to nominate \"Fox and Friends\" weekend co- host Pete Hegseth, who's a decorated veteran, to be secretary of defense. Buried amidst all these announcements in less shocking news, Trump officials confirm what was reported two days ago that President- elect Trump wants Senator Marco Rubio of Florida to be his secretary of state. So, let's dive into all of this with our team. We're going to start with CNN's Kristen Holmes who's covering the Trump transition, plus CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Kristen, tell us more about the decision to pick Matt Gaetz to be the U.S. attorney general, the top cop.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, nowhere was his name mention in the any of the conversations that I've been having over several months about who Trump, if re-elected, would select as attorney general. They were talking about Matthew Whitaker, the former acting attorney general, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general.And one of the reasons that Gaetz's name did not often enter the conversation is because he has, of course, been under a criminal investigation by the Justice Department for several years. Last year, that investigation was closed. He was not charged. This investigation into the congressman was looking at allegations of possible sex trafficking and allegations of obstruction of justice, trying to interfere with that investigation. That probe was actually started during the first Trump administration. It was overseen by Attorney General Bill Barr, and it lasted for several years and it ramped up when his long-time friend and confidante Joel Greenberg flipped, became states witness and started providing evidence against the not contract. Now, he repeatedly denied wrongdoing, like I said, he wasn't charged. But the congressman is now the subject of an ethics probe on the Hill looking at many of the same allegations. It was always thought this would make him a nonstarter for a potential attorney general pick. But here, President-elect Trump believes that this is the person that will go to the justice department and do what he wants him to do. The question, of course, is whether he can get confirmed. That remains to be seen. But if he wants someone to go and root out corruption, you're selecting someone who's actually been under an investigation for obstruction of justice, something that was open in the Trump administration. So, that's why I think part of why this is such a controversial pick.",

He said at the end of the day, it only comes down to whether you have the credentials and also the relationships. And, of course, what Tillis was referring to was Gaetz central role in pushing for the ouster of Kevin McCarthy that last year. That made him very unpopular and faced a barrage of criticism from Republicans in the Senate as well who viewed the whole episode as showcasing how the House was dysfunctional, how they could not govern and the like. And they pointedly blamed Gaetz for leading the charge McCarthy. That, along with the questions about this ongoing House Ethics investigation into sexual misconduct, Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing, but I asked Cornyn about that, too, Jake, and he said, I'm sure that will come up at the confirmation hearings.

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, I was walking off the Senate floor just moments ago when the news was announced. You could literally hear the jaws dropping to the floor of Republican senators who are now going to be in a position to stand up to Donald Trump in a way that they have been unwilling to. And listen, Matt Gaetz is dangerously unqualified, but that's not the worst of it. Gaetz has been Trump's chief defender when it comes to Trump's assault on democracy. His attempt to overthrow the government on January 6th. And he has openly called for the abolition of law enforcement agencies if they don't get in line with conservative political priorities. This is going to be a red alert moment for American democracy. Matt Gaetz is being nominated for one reason and one reason only, because he will implement Donald Trump's transition of the Department of Justice from an agency that stands up for all of us to an agency that is simply an arm of the White House designed to persecute and prosecute Trump's political enemies. This is a stunning announcement in some ways, but not surprising in others because Trump told us during the campaign that he was going to use the White House to go after people who politically opposed him and it seems that this pick for the head of the Department of Justice is very much in line with the promises he made during the campaign.",

I consider President Trump a friend and I'm excited about them working together and leading the American or the American in the right direction.

So, it's not ideal. The ideal way is for us to move forward, but if that's the last resort. We will absolutely do it. If Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate want to keep us from making any of these appointments, we are going to do our best to do whatever we have to do to get the cabinet in a position and get the appointments in the position so President Trump can go to work on day one.
