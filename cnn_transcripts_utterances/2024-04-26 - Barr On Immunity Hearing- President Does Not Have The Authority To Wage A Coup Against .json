The difference in this case and why it was brought, which goes to the heart of what we've been talking about is Donald Trump was no longer just a celebrity, at the time this was happening. He was a celebrity running for office. And I think his attorney, Todd Blanche, his lead counsel, made a mistake in the opening argument, because he made a statement to the jury, and I think it's going to come back to bite him later on. He said there's nothing wrong with influencing an election. It's called democracy.
