And last night on the stage behind me, we really saw him go full throttle at the former president. And he is really trying to thread a delicate needle in the sense that he's pitching himself to voters, as Trump, essentially without the baggage, without the chaos. That he has some policies that he wants to enact, and he's going after those same voters that likely voted for Trump in the past two elections. So, he can't offend them. But he also needs to give them a reason as to why they should pick him and not Trump. Here's a bit of what he had to say last night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's something that he touted from the stage last night. He's talked about the time that he has spent here in Iowa. His wife and family have spent time here as well. And so, they are really going all in here. And their kind of theory of the case, Pamela and Boris, is that if he can come in, if he can win or come in at least a very, very strong competitive second that that changes the trajectory moving forward in the primary calendar.They also are hoping that at this point people are really starting to engage here in Iowa, really starting to pay attention. And so, to that end, they really saw last night as an opportunity to get in front of those key Iowa voters and make the case to people, you know, in person as to why he should be the candidate. And so, the question remains here, we are just about 5 weeks away. Will it pay off and can they move those numbers that have really been unmovable for Trump? He has remained in the lead in all of that polling here in Iowa. So, we will see if those numbers can change at all in the next 5 weeks -- Pamela and Boris.",

It's the National Highway Traffic Safety's annual campaign aimed at reducing drunk driving during the holidays. But this year, the agency is taking it a step further and announcing a major effort to lower the number of alcohol related deaths on the road. NHTSA is proposing all new vehicles include technology that detects and prevents impaired drivers from getting behind the wheel. CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean is here to explain. I mean, this really could save a lot of lives.",

      "sentences": "It's a huge development and it puts the onus on automakers to put these anti-drunk driving systems in new cars that could one day roll off of the factory floor. This is a really big development because the reality is that drunk driving is killing people by the thousands. NHTSA says 13,000 people were killed by drunk driving in 2021, the last full year of data. December of that year was the worst month for drunk driving ever.Now this advanced notice of proposed rulemaking lays the groundwork for technology that could cut that number dramatically. You may have seen these. They're called ignition interlocks, usually ordered by a court for somebody convicted of driving drunk. That's referred to as active detection. Puts the burden on the driver to blow so they can start their car. What advocates want is a little different, something called passive detection, and this is what it looks like. This is called the driver alcohol detection system, or DADS, sit in the driver's seat and the system automatically detects if you are drunk and won't let you start the car. Now this announcement from NHTSA clears the path for this to be installed in all new cars. I want you to listen now to Senator Ben Lujan of New Mexico. He was a victim of drunk -- a drunk driving crash when he was in college 30 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BEN RAY LUJAN (D-NM): There's brilliant engineers out there. There's technology at our disposal. Heck, my truck today tells me if I hit the center line, it beeps and it buzzes my seat. Let's find a path forward. The technology exists. We can make this happen.

There's also a touch-based version that uses infrared light to see alcohol levels under the surface of the skin that would go into something like a gear shift or a start button. But the reality here is that making this a requirement will not happen fast. The federal government still needs to gather information. Take public comment. Of course, this needs major public support and even still, advocates are hoping that this is a law by next November. So, the clock is ticking now.Remember, there were so many advancements in auto technology that was really facing a lot of pushback, not only from the public but also Congress. Think about seatbelts and the push to put that and make that mandatory in the 70s and 80s. So, we could see some really big shifts here and they could save about 9,000 or more lives a year.",

Last night, just an hour after the White House meeting, 10 ballistic missiles were sent to Kyiv. I called my security official on the ground -- because I'm here in Washington -- to check the team was OK and that they had gone to bunker. And my security officer said we didn't have time because they're ballistic missiles. However, the Ukrainians shot 10 out of 10 down and were able to protect the capital.

You're going to find a huge banner of Tommy at family tailgates emblazoned with Tommy \"Cutlets\".Now, this Giants undrafted rookie quarterback is a whole vibe. He showed up the Monday Night Football -- the night game there rocking his chains with a fuzzy pink pull over in the pregame versus the Packers. And this is a kid from Jersey, grew up nine minutes away from the stadium, still lives with his parents. And his agent, Sean Stellato, went viral. Just talked to me and said, like, Tommy and I are proud of our Italian American roots and he knew he's going to be in a dogfight that night. So, he wanted to wear that strong black suit that everyone was talking about on the Internet. And then, of course, another viral moment when DeVito's dad was just smooching Stellato there as Tommy and the Giants took the lead in that game. And it was just chefs kisses all around, Boris. Tommy led New York on a game-winning drive with under a minute to go. They kicked the game winner as time expires. And they've now won three straight after that 24-22 win over Green Bay.
