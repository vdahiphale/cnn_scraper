In this record year for elections, one of the biggest exercises in democracy is filling 720 seats from 27 nations in European Parliamentary elections. And, as results continue to come in, a split screen image is emerging. Establishment parties did well in many countries and E.U.

So, it is a huge gamble for Macron. As far as he's concerned, of course, he stays at the Elysee for another three years. But the idea is probably to try and split whatever is left of the traditional conservatives and to split also whatever is left on the left side, between the extremist and the sort of center left, with the idea that his own party could resuscitate, so to speak, with his legislative elections. Of course, the issue is that it's a very short campaign. The second round will be on July 7th. That is to say three weeks before the Olympics here in Paris with, of course, the threat of strikes by the straight unions. And so, it's a very sort of goalist gamble.

The numbers of migrants from Africa to Italy was, in 2015, more or less 150,000. OK. Last year, when Giorgia Meloni became prime minister, the number of migrants who arrived in Italy was exactly the same of my year, but she considered the number a normal number, a regular number. What means that? There is in the far-right an approach very ideological against migration. And there is not a concrete attention about the numbers, the reality is as an instrument of propaganda. And I think the same will be in France until they will go to the government. I hope that will not very soon. But that is the very -- the message will come from Italy.

And what is particularly striking is that Emmanuel Macron, whatever mistakes he may have committed on the internal -- on the internal front, he's a staunch European. And indeed, his mark on the way the European Union has developed, his policies towards Ukraine, with a very heavy European calendar in the coming weeks, next Thursday, there's a G7 summit in Italy. Then you have next weekend in Switzerland, a peace conference about Ukraine. Then you have, in July, NATO Summit.

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For those on the ground, it was the deadliest day in six months, according to Gaza officials, capturing the moment of impact of Israeli airstrikes. Sustained gunfire followed, the IDF says there were fierce gun battles with Hamas's fighters throughout the operation, but did not provide evidence of this claim. Then a constant stream of dead and injured arrive at two nearby hospitals. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital overwhelmed by the sheer number of trauma cases. The breakdown of fighters versus civilians is unknown. But women and children are seen in every corner of this hospital. Gaza officials and hospital directors, say more than 270 were killed, hundreds more injured, sparking cries of a massacre from some countries, including the EU's top diplomat. Israel claims less than 100 died blaming Hamas for the shockingly high death toll. CNN cannot independently verify either side's, figures. As residents deal with the devastation left behind in Nuseirat, survivors struggle to understand what happened. I am 60 years old, this man says, and have never experienced anything like this.

Bisan Owd, a young journalist, has been documenting the plight of civilians since October 7th there. Explaining the horrors unfolding to over 4 million social media followers. And she's just been awarded a prestigious Peabody Award in the United States, citing her bravery and commitment to journalism despite life threatening danger. We turn now to the U.S. and advancements in drug therapies. Last week, a federal advisory committee voted against using MDMA, or ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. It marks the first time FDA advisers have even considered a psychedelic drug for medical use. This is something our next guest is passionate about. Ernesto Londono's new book, \"Trippy: The Peril and Promise of Medicinal Psychedelics,\" draws on his own experience in the Amazon trying to ease his depression. And he's joining Walter Isaacson now to discuss the growing intersection between mental health and drug use for therapy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALTER ISAACSON, CO-HOST, AMANPOUR AND CO.:  Thank you, Christiane. And Ernesto Londono, welcome to the show. ERNESTO LONDONO, AUTHOR, \"TRIPPY: THE PERIL AND PROMISE OF MEDICAL PSYCHEDELICS\" AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Thanks for having me.",

And it's a very balanced book. I loved reading it last night because you're not one of these people that goes all in, saying we got to do it or one of these people who's -- you grew up in Colombia. So, you know the war on drugs. It's not a call for the war on drugs. It's a very balanced treatment. But let's start with the news that there was a panel of experts that told the Food and Drug Administration not to approve MDMA, one of the psychedelics, for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and other things. What does that mean? What happened? And how's that going to affect things?",

And if and when the FDA approves MDMA as a treatment for PTSD, that would marka watershed moment in this effort to bring psychedelic compounds into the mainstream of medicine. But what we saw was that an advisory committee that tells the FDA what it thinks about emerging treatments felt that this protocol, you know, combining MDMA, the drug otherwise known as ecstasy, with psychotherapy was not quite ready for prime time. They felt that there were too many unknowns, and they also had questions about the research. I think there's been a concern that the people behind the research, the people funding and conducting the research are true believers and felt so strongly that the war on drugs was morally wrong and strategically wrong that they may have cut corners in the pursuit of getting MDMA approved.",

So, I think I was among those who took a leap of faith and saw in this retreat model, in this psychedelic retreat model that has been unfolding in Latin American countries for many years, an opportunity to pivot out of sort of a downward spiral of depression. And in my case, you know, I was pretty successful. I experienced a pretty dramatic turnaround, you know, from feeling that I was in the grip of depression for months, that was making it almost impossible for me to focus on my work, to sleep at night, and to socialize, to all of a sudden get a really immediate respite. It was almost like I had a burst of oxygen that gave me a window of opportunity to think more clearly and strategically about how I became so depressed and what was within my power to start digging myself out of that hole.",

And for the people who first used this, this is, you know, first and foremost, I think a sacrament. Indigenous people view this as a portal to the realm of spirits. And once they access that spirit, they say they can find healing. And also, sometimes they can find strategic advantage. So, in sort of the very early iterations of this, this was not solely used as a tool to heal people who were suffering, it was also used, for instance, to go to war with a neighboring tribe and gain strategic advantage. What's happened over the years, though, is that as more non-indigenous people have had access to these rituals, have been invited to participate in these rituals, there's been a long and interesting succession of characters who have found ways to reimagine and commodify these rituals, and to really start speaking about them in a language that is accessible to westerners, particularly as it relates to mental health.",

So, from a strict standpoint, it's not legal, for instance, to import ayahuasca from Latin America to or to sell it or administer it to people. You know, however, on the other hand, the way this is unfolding now oftentimes happens in spiritual communities. And the people who are organizing retreats and that are holding these rituals and are inviting people to come and take part in this reach and these rituals, they're increasingly asserting that their use of these compounds is sacramental. And that because religious freedom laws in this country have become so expansive and have created such a high bar for the government to tell people what is and is not a legitimate spiritual practice, that they are operating above board. So, right now, we're having, you know, some really interesting cases before the courts, testing the legality of these rituals and these therapies. We have dozens of psychedelic churches that are operating openly or advertising their services. They have websites. You oftentimes can pay for their services with a credit card. And a small number of them are proactively suing the government and saying, we want outright permission to continue operating openly as we are. We think we're doing important work, and we're healing people who are suffering.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, you know, I think it's very clear that these compounds can induce really fast and lasting changes in mood and behavior. So, we'rein a moment where psychiatry hasn't really had a major development, something new and very useful in the toolkit. So, I think, understandably, there's a huge amount of excitement and hope for what these compounds can do if and when we're able to integrate them into medicine. You know, however, I think as this field continues to grow, you know, really unwieldy and the underground, in the church setting in the spiritual setting, we're bound to be -- we're bound to see some cases that are going to be really disturbing. And I think the question is whether within this window of opportunity where we can sort of go back to the drawing board and reimagine what makes sense in terms of policy and regulation for this class of drugs, are we going to be able to accelerate the research that will answer some of the important questions about the limitations and the promise of these therapies in a way that will be quick enough to sort of open more access points in places and settings that will be safe and ethical, or if this will continue to unfold largely in the underground, where I think the margin of error is substantial? So, I think it's incumbent upon health care regulators and policymakers, I think, to grapple with the question of whether these drugs were properly classified to begin with, whether they should be rescheduled within the government's system and how do we integrate them into mainstream medicine to fulfill the demand we're seeing from patients.",

So, for instance, there's a drug called 5-MeO-DMT, which is derived from the secretions of the Sonoran Desert toad that induces a really fast and intense journey. So, this can be sort of done in a matter of 20 to 40 minutes. If you're undergoing therapy with psilocybin, otherwise known as magic mushrooms, these are lengthier trips. You know, you're going to be under the spell of this for, you know, six to eight hours. If you're trying something like ibogaine, which is derived from an African plant and it's being used oftentimes for people with severe addiction problems, you know, these can be really, really long journeys, 20 hours or so. I think the common denominator is that these experiences appear to induce a state of neuroplasticity, meaning the brain becomes more malleable, you start seeing sort of patterns of thinking and brain activity that are different from sort of our everyday moments. And for people who have been stuck in a rut of depression or trauma, which oftentimes includes this really obsessive thinking, these sort of ruts of, you know, fear inducing and pain inducing thoughts that you just can't get away from, all of a sudden, in the wake of these experiences, when the brain has sort of undergone, for lack of a better word, a hard reset, you're able to sort of pivot away from that and start seeing and thinking about the reasons you became traumatized or depressed more clearly. And once you're able to do that, sometimes it's easier to start feeling better. And also, to start kind of understanding the kind of behaviors that would be required for you to feel more stable and to be more resilient.",

And one of the first things I learned about Robert was that just two weeks earlier, he had put a pistol in his mouth and came very close to killing himself. I chose to start and end the book with veteran stories because veterans have played an outsized role in advocating for more research and for expanded access into these therapies. And I think that's one of the things that makes this era of the so-called psychedelic renaissance really interesting. It is that because veterans have become such champions of these therapies, and some -- you know, they believe so firmly that this is urgently needed for many of their comrades, that they built a significant amount of bipartisan support. So, you have some of the most conservative lawmakers in Congress right now, you know, fiercely advocating for expanded access for these therapies, not just for veterans, but in some instances, for people who are on active duty in the military. And you have this sort of underground community where, you know, by word of mouth, veterans take other veterans to people where they have -- to places where they have found healing. So, the role of veterans has been really paramount. And I think will continue to be so. We continue to see, you know, a V.A. struggling with the suicide rate in the veteran community and with PTSD rates that are still very, very high and lead many people to be disabled early in their lives and careers.",

And a jury in Florida recently. you know, found that the operator of the retreat was at fault in the death. So, I think there's good reason to think that, you know, as more people are drawn to these experiences many people will be healed, but a fair number of people will get hurt, and that may give the whole movement a bad name, a bad reputation, and it could lead to the kind of backlash we saw back in the '60s and '70s, where I think a lot of people just felt that this was out of control.",

I think there's going to be room both for a clinical lane and for more of sort of a spiritual and ritualistic lane. But I think across the board, we need people who are acting ethically.
