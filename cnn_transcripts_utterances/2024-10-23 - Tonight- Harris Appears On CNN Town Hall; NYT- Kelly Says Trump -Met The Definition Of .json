Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, will be focusing on faith in Georgia this afternoon following a tirade from him yesterday against the vice president. Harris's typical campaign travel schedule was replaced yesterday by a series of interviews. In a sit-down with Telemundo, she worked to appeal to Latino men while also expressing concerns about the possibility of post-election violence during an interview with NBC News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Of course, this is a person Donald Trump who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some were killed.

This is obviously something that we have talked about with regards to Trump at for years now when he was in the in the holding the office and in the campaign, since the question, big picture question is, will this matter to voters in the final days, especially as frankly everyone I'm talking to feels like Trump has the upper hand in the campaign right now.",

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of \"The Atlantic\", is the byline on the story. He cites two sources who say that they were in the room when Trump said this. But again, Trump says he didn't. I -- interesting that -- to me that, you know, Walz is putting it that way on the trail. You heard the crowd's reaction there.

One thing I will say that could hurt Trump with these comments is that it allows people like Tim Walz, his opponents to talk about that. But I think a lot of Trump supporters are -- those around him would like it -- like him to talk more about policy instead of these distractions really, because it just comes up again in again.

Welcome back.Donald Trump's campaign trying to raise red flags after dozens of British political staffers reportedly traveled to battleground states in the U.S. to campaign for Kamala Harris. The Trump campaign filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the U.K.'s Labour Party of foreign election interference, and illegal foreign campaign contributions. The social media posts that the Trump campaign included in its complaint says nearly 100 activists were headed across the pond to stump for Harris. \"Reuters\" reporting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they were doing it in their spare time as volunteers. Still, Trump's campaign requesting a formal investigation. A lawyer from the campaign writing, quote, those searching for foreign interference in our elections need to look no further than Ms. Patel's LinkedIn post, the interference is occurring in plain sight. Joining us now CNN international anchor, Max Foster. Max, good morning. You are course in London, very familiar with the labor party in your country.

Liz Truss, a former conservative prime minister, has also come out and said that she supports Donald Trump.So it does happen on both sides. Does that make it forgivable? Well, you know, if you didn't know that this was happening than perhaps you would see it as a British government taking sides. The Labour Party is in power. They meant to remain impartial. And already, there are lots of people in Labour very worried that Donald Trump is going to come into power anyway.

How, how special is it when you've got labor leader who clearly would favor Kamala Harris, I think he hasn't come out and said that, but most of his party believe that's what he wants but also, you know, Donald Trump doesn't have the queen here in the UK, which has always his fascination with the UK in the past, he's got King Charles as well.

And hey, right now, if you're looking for the best colors, the maples are bright, they're off the hook right along the coastline of main stretching down south into Connecticut and just a little secret, if you didn't know this, all leaves, deciduous leaves are actually yellow and orange in nature. It's actually the chlorophyll that gives them their green color once we get into the autumn months, we turn off kind of sunshine hours and then we lose the chlorophyll and we see the changes in the colors of the leaves and then eventually the winds take off those leaves and they fall to the ground. Now, this is what's happening across the mid Atlantic, including Pennsylvania, where Philadelphia, where our own Kasie Hunt is originally from, the peak is approaching very quickly. But when we've had 23 consecutive days, 25 days in Atlanta without a drop of rain, 23 actually in ATL, this does impact the vibrancy, at least of the fall foliage.
