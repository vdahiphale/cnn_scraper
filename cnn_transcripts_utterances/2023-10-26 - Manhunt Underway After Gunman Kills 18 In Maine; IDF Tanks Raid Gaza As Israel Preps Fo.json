A manhunt has been ongoing all day for the individual, for the suspect accused of taking the lives of at least 18 people and wounding at least 13 others in the mass shooting at two different locations in Lewiston, Maine, a bar and grill and a nearby bowling alley where one man says he only survived by sliding down the bowling aisle into the pens and climbing up into the bowling machine. The suspect's car was later found in the town of Lisbon, Maine.Without him in it, communities in Maine are on lockdown. As multiple agencies law enforcement agencies search for the suspect, the individual is considered armed and dangerous. He's a firearms instructor. He's a member of the US Army Reserve. Sources tell CNN that he was at the Camp Smith Training Facility in Upstate New York this summer when he reportedly started making statements about hearing voices in his head and having thoughts about wanting to hurt his fellow soldiers. He then spent time in an army hospital for medical evaluation. Now, people in communities near the shooting are in lockdown and on edge, of course. They're calling police. They're reporting suspicious people. They're hearing noises in the woods. They're hearing far off gunshots. So far there aren't any tips that have led to the suspect. CNN is learning more about some of the people who were killed in this senseless act of gun violence, yet another senseless act of mass violence in the United States. Family members told a local TV station that Joseph Walker was killed during the restaurant shooting. They say police believe Joseph grabbed a knife and went after the gunman, tried to stop him, and that's when he was shot. 40-year-old Brian McFarlane was also killed at the restaurant. His sister says Brian usually went there on Wednesday nights to play Cornhole with other members of Lewiston's deaf community. 53-year-old Trisha Asselin was killed at the nearby bowling alley where she worked. I want to bring in CNN's John Berman in Lewiston, Maine. John, we've got the breaking news of loud bangs or explosions heard near the suspect's last known address. Maine State Police just announced parts of the state are going to stay under a shelter-in-place order. Give us the latest on the manhunt and what you're hearing.",

      "sentences": "Well, the very latest is the situation occurring at the last known address of Robert Card, this 40-year-old suspect in Bowdoin, Maine. Now, Bowdoin is about 10 minutes, 10 miles or so from where I am in Lewiston. Behind me is Schemengees Bar, which is the site of the second series of shootings last night where eight people were killed.You can see on the map there, Bowdoin about 10 miles east of here. That was the suspect's last known home. Our producer there heard bangs, heard loud bangs, heard someone shouting FBI. That's what we know about what's going on there. It's interesting that that's taking place in Bowdoin because most of the activity that we've seen so far today has been just south of that in Lisbon. Lisbon, Maine, again about 10 minutes from here, a few miles south of Bowdoin, Lisbon is where the suspect, Robert Card, where his car was found. Card's car, a Subaru hatchback was found at a boat launch on the Androscoggin River. And so far, it seemed that most of the searches today have been in Lisbon on your map there. Our Shimon Prokupecz saw SWAT teams going into different neighborhoods, clearing out areas looking, going into different areas clearing them out. So the search is obviously very active in these surrounding towns, and they have extended the shelter-in-place order for Lewiston, for Auburn, which is right next door, Bowdoin, Lisbon, those areas you're seeing on your screen moments ago. The shelter-in-place specifically tells people to safeguard their homes and safeguard their cars, their vehicles. The concern is obviously that this suspect, Robert Card, who was considered armed and dangerous with military firearms training, could try to get in to a private residence and hide, could try to take someone's car perhaps while you're in it. So that is why authorities want people to be very careful. We're trying to get more information about what exactly is taking place in Bowdoin. It is interesting that it is the suspect's last known address. It's certainly been known to authorities for the last day why there would be such intense activity there now some 20 to 22 hours later, Jake. We're waiting to find out. We'll make some calls. We'll get back to you as soon as we can with that.",

His army record show the 40-year-old was a petroleum supply specialist in the Reserves, but never served in combat. A former Army Reservist who served with Card telling CNN that he is a skilled marksman and outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his unit. While he was training in Upstate New York over the summer, Card reported hearing voices and having thoughts about hurting fellow soldiers according to law enforcement sources. The National Guard saying he was \"behaving erratically,\" and he was transported to a hospital at the US Military Academy for a medical evaluation. His family telling CNN he did not have a long history of mental health issues. \"This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is.\" His sister in law said, \"This is a good family.\" On his Twitter page, Card like right wing posts including by Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr., Republican members of Congress and multiple posts criticizing President Biden on the economy. His social media also shows photos of him fishing. The Coast Guard is also part of the search. Card's vehicle was found at a boat ramp less than 20 miles from the shooting scene and public records show he owned a boat. According to another former soldier who served with Card, he had extensive training including land navigation, \"so he would be very comfortable in the woods.\" The shooting was in Lewiston, Card's most recent address is in a rural area of a nearby town called Bowdoin according to public records, which also show that his family owns a series of properties nearby. Law enforcement sources say Card recently split up with a longtime girlfriend and they're pursuing a theory that he allegedly targeted the bowling alley and bar because he used to go there with her, and was supposed to be at the bar that night.",

You have officers that are standing out there. They're not seeking cover. There doesn't appear to be a flurry of activity. And so, we just don't know at this time. It would not be unusual in a situation like this, where you have someone who is very proficient with firearms, who we know he was a firearms instructor. If authorities are going to search his residence as a precautionary measure, you can imagine, in order to perhaps defeat any booby traps in the like, they might launch flash -- what are called flash bangs. And that's, you know, obviously, we've seen those before and incidents, that would help try to set off any type of booby trap, if that was the case. And then on the bullhorn, if you're calling this person out, that could just be precautionary, just to see if there's anyone there before they actually do go in to do a search. I would imagine that knowing what we do, we've known the address of this individual for some time, so certainly law enforcement would know the same. And so, you know, we've seen in instances where they will set up surveillance on particular addresses that are associated with this individual when there's a manhunt going on. And so, I'd be surprised if this was the first time that law enforcement was there. But at this hour, we just don't know. But based on these images, you know, you don't see officers rushing in.

Their job is to exploit cellular telephone networks.Twofold, they would be looking at cellular phone towers in and around the region, in case the suspect has his cellphone on him. If that cellphone registers with a nearby tower, that can give them data on where he might be. They also have this device called a cell site simulator. That is a contraption that the FBI uses with a court order that mimics a cellphone tower.

The suspect, still on the loose, is a guy named Robert Card is suspected killer. We know he was committed to a mental health facility over the summer for two weeks and he had made threats to attack a National Guard facility in the state of Maine. Now, Maine's gun laws do require courts to report any court ordered involuntary commitment to the Department of Public Safety. Maine does not have what's called a Red Flag Law. It has what's called a so called Yellow Flag Law which indicates that a firearm can, can be temporarily removed from someone if they're deemed by both a judge and a medical professional to be a threat to themselves or others. Margaret Groban is a retired federal prosecutor and she is an expert in firearms regulation. She's now a law professor at the University of Maine School of Law.

If you put all these attacks together for 35 years and all the gruesome stuff I saw, it comes nothing compared to one day, October 7th. The day I saw the south of Israel, I never imagined in my life I'll ever see. I never imagined I could see a Holocaust. I used to see the Holocaust in the museum in black and white. I saw it in color.I saw people that were torn apart the pieces. They killed. They literally wanted to torture them and humiliate their bodies. Things that I saw that I will never ever forget, I still smelling the smell of the flesh or the burnt flesh, a lot of the victims were burned. And I don't know why they did this. But they started burning people, maybe they shouldn't be recognized. They were just going around shooting and killing people after that, just torturing their bodies, and they came back home that pictures of Jews murdered. That's why they came, they want them to humiliate the Jews in the world, say look what we did to the Jews. They want to cause another holocaust here in Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
