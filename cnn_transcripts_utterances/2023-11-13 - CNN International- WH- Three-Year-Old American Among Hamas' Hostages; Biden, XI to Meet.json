Hospital staff already have been trying to keep premature babies alive after the incubator's oxygen supply ran out.Israel's military says it's offered 300 liters of fuel to the complex, but it claims Hamas blocked the hospital from receiving it. This video comes from the Israel Defense Forces. CNN can't independently verify it. But the hospital's director says while Israeli officials did offer fuel. It was only enough to run the generators for 30 minutes and that staff were too scared to go out and get it. Now the White House says one of the hostages Hamas is holding is a three-year old American toddler whose parents were killed on October the 7th. That news arose from the readout of a phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and the Emir of Qatar. CNN's Kevin Liptak has those details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a three-year-old toddler whose parents were killed by Hamas during the attack on October 7th. And we're learning about this American in a readout of a phone call that President Biden held with the Emir of Qatar.You'll remember that Qatar is playing broker in these talks to try and release some of these hostages and certainly the information that one of those hostages is a three-year-old American, will only increase pressure on the parties to try and come up with some kind of agreement to secure the release of that three-year old. But also the 200 plus other hostages that are being held. And certainly President Biden and other American officials have been in active discussions about some sort of agreement that would include a pause in the fighting to allow those hostages to come out. President Biden has been pressuring the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on a longer pause that would allow for the release pf more hostages. But certainly the fighting has not decreased at all. It certainly has been ramping up around the largest hospital in Gaza. And we did hear from the American National Advisor, Jake Sullivan, who did say that it is in Hamas's playbook to use hospitals as staging grounds for weapons and for fighters. But he did also issue a message of caution to Israel. Listen to what he said. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The bottom line for the United States is that we do not want to see firefights in a hospital. We do not want to see innocent patients who are sick or wounded be injured or killed in the crossfire. So that is how we look at this issue and that is how we are communicating with our Israeli counterpart.",

Now, President Joko Widodo, is coming to the White House from Saudi Arabia, where he was attending a meeting of other Arab and Muslim leaders.

      "sentences": "Yes, and that is the logical question, Max. I think what we're going to see out of this is some symbolism and some substance. If we look at the differences in opinion toward big issues between the United States and China, whether it be Taiwan, whether it be human rights, the war in Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, there are some very profound differences in the way these two nations look at these issues, and that probably will not change.But the goal of this meeting is to at least begin conversation, and if anything avoid any kind of future surprises. This will be a chance for China to let the U.S. know exactly where it stands on Taiwan and just how much pushing by the U.S. may be too far. China also expected to perhaps raise concerns about some of the aerial surveillance that we have seen by the U.S. over the Taiwan Straits, over the South China Sea. It's also though, a chance to agree on some things, especially when it comes to economics. If we look at the relationship between the United States and China, despite some of these political differences, it's a very strong economic relationship. The United States benefits from buying cheap products from China. China also buys products from the U.S. It creates a lot of import/export trade, which really is beneficial for both nations. And that's why we hear officials such as Janet Yellen talking about the need to de-risk and not necessarily decouple this relationship. Max, it is worth stressing though the fact that this meeting is even happening is a very big deal. It was earlier this year that we saw the United States shoot down a Chinese balloon over American airspace, and that added even more chill, Max, to an already frosty relationship.",

But overall, Max, I would say it's encouraging.For Xi Jinping, this is a way for him, one, to show strength in China, especially at a time when China is dealing with so many domestic issues, whether they be economic or changes in leadership, it's also a way for him to look very strong in the world stage, especially as China tries to portray itself as an alternative, a different world order, a new world order almost to what we see in the West and the United States, as far as their approach to politics and diplomacy.",

Officials are saying there's a significant likelihood of an eruption near the world-famous Blue Lagoon geothermal spa. Our CNN's Michael Holmes reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (through translator): Alarming signs in Iceland, where waves of tremors are shaking and splintering parts of the country. And experts say the seismic activity there is likely to get worse. Thousands of earthquakes have struck Iceland southwestern peninsula in the last few days. Geologists say it's related to an underground corridor of magma that's shifting and could soon lead to a volcanic eruption. In the town of Grindavik, some 50 kilometers away from the capital of Reykjavik, the ground has already split open in places because of the volatility under the Earth's crust. More than 3,000 residents were evacuated Saturday, with a few allowed back Sunday to retrieve pets and essential items from their home. Experts say the magma corridor, which stretches about 15 kilometers near Grindavik, could cause an eruption and possibly destroy much of town. VIDIR REYNISSON, ICELAND'S CHIEF PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT: The magma is now on a shallow, very shallow depth, so we're expecting an eruption within a couple of hours. The shortest but at least within a couple of days. Anywhere on that fissure, we can see that in eruption could happen. HOLMES (voice-over): Iceland has declared a state of emergency and as a precaution, closed the blue lagoon. A popular geothermal spa located near Grindavik. The area near Grindavik is prone to volcanic activity, with three eruptions in the past 2 1/2 years. In 2021, a fissure measuring as big as 750 meters long spewed fountains of lava into the sky, attracting tourists to the unpopulated hot spot. This time around, with an entire town potentially at risk, officials warned this eruption could have far more dangerous consequences. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This time there is nothing like that. There is no glacier near this eruption site, so everything is in much other risks. And most of the risk is from the floating lava to a lot of very critical infrastructure. The first one is, of course, the town of Grindavik and the home of almost 4,000 people.And then the secondly, it is power plants for which produce a lot of electricity and the almost all hot water for the southern part -- so southwestern part.

So that's one of the risks that we are trying to protect how it will be. And at this time of year, maybe it will be easier to deal with it because of this time of year in Iceland we have higher wind.
