      "sentences": "Well, this was a trip which followed Secretary Blinken's visit to Jordan and also to Saudi Arabia. Every time hecomes to this region, he does try and visit as many countries as possible. Because from the Biden administration's point of view, it is important to shore up regional support for what they see is hopefully a deal that will be done to release hostages and also to create a ceasefire in Gaza. So, we have heard from the Secretary that this is a good offer that is on the table at this point. We are hearing also from one Hamas senior leader who has said that what Israel has not managed to achieve through war, it will not be able to achieve through negotiations and through pressure. So, although not rejecting the proposal that's on the table at this point, really implying that Hamas may not be willing to agree to it at this point. But we do know that the ultimate decision ends with the Hamas leader in Gaza, and that's Yayah Sinwar, and there was expected to be a decision by him any day now. It was expected potentially yesterday, today, and we've heard from Secretary Blinken that there could be a deal in the coming days, at least he is hoping for that. But what we are seeing inside Gaza at this point, as well, even though there are more aid trucks that are managing to get in, we heard from the U.N. group UNRWA that more trucks were able to get into Gaza in April than at any time before the October of last year. So, a significant amount more is getting in, but it is still falling woefully short. We saw just this Tuesday that World Central Kitchen started its operations once again and provided some 200,000 meals. Now, it hadn't been in Gaza providing these meals since seven of its workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike about a month ago. So, we are seeing increasing aid getting in, but we are still hearing the fears, the warnings from humanitarian groups, from aid groups of famine, of disease, of a lack of food and water and shelter that is affecting civilians and their daily life in Gaza, a daily battle to try and survive bombings. But of course you do have disease, the fears of famine on top of that, as well. So, Secretary Blinken was in the region to discuss this with the Israeli leaders and the fact that he went down to Kerem Shalom, one of the land crossings, is significant because the Biden administration has been very vocal, pushing for more land crossings to be opened, in particular the Erez crossing in the north of Gaza, which opened recently and was allowing a pinpointed effort to try and get food to where it was needed most.",

I want to bring in senior research scholar at Yale Law School and former president of Brandeis University, Professor Frederick Lawrence. Professor, thank you so much for being with us. It's interesting when Columbia University resorts to clearing out the encampments by force, clearing out Hamilton Hall by force, bringing in the NYPD. They win in one way, but they lose in a hundred other ways. Because now you have a situation whereby, I mean, I'm sure you had the interview there with our Gabe Cohen speaking to one of the students who was protesting outside. So, you have a situation where a lot of students simply feel that Columbia is no longer this sort of open forum for freedom of expression. There's no longer trust between students and Dr. Shafik, the president of Columbia University. And also there is this hostile, animus relationship that continues to grow between students and university administrators. So, how does the university heal from this, do you think? FREDERICK M. LAWRENCE, FORMER BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: This is what happens when you back students into a corner and when you have this kind of a we-they relationship. If you look at how other campuses have responded, there are other ways of dealing with this situation. Under any circumstances, it's going to be a tense situation. It's going to be a heated situation because the issues are so fraught and because there's so much passion on so many sides of this issue. But you look, for example, at the deal that was just struck between the administration and protesters at Brown University. The protesters and the administration at Northwestern University. In both cases, you have agreements that have been set out that seem, at least for now, to be working in a way that allows the protesters to be heard, but at the same time maintains the school's very legitimate interest in safety and security of all students, and the operation of the organization. The University of Chicago's president just put out a statement of rules of engagement for protesting. The president of Williams College did something similar a day or so ago. So, there are other ways of doing this. I think the situation at Columbia now is really so hot to the touch that the administration is going to have to look for ways to cool this down.
