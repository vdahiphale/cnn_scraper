Now, the Biden campaign has called for these debates to be one-on-one, which essentially is excluding any potential third-party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They also wanted to see these debates organized directly between the Biden -- the campaigns and the broadcast networks. That is something that we have seen now play out, as both Biden and Trump have announced that they are accepting a debate with CNN on June 27. That debate is set to take place at CNN's Atlanta studios and will take place with just the two candidates, the moderator -- or potential moderators, I should say, and no audience will be involved. Now, in their letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the Biden campaign outlined how they were concerned that -- about getting candidates in front of voters much earlier in the process. Those camp -- debates were not set to take place until beginning, I believe on September 16. So this will give the two men an opportunity to lay out their viewpoints on various issues far -- much earlier in the presidential contest that is typical. And, also, the campaign noted in their letter that some of these debates had turned into entertainment spectacles, with outburst or involvement from audience members. So they're trying to eliminate some of that. Another thing the Biden campaign has called for is for the microphones to only be on when that candidate is actively speaking, potentially eliminating some of that intense back-and-forth that we saw between Biden and Trump back in 2020. But it's clear at this point that the debates -- date seems to be set with that debate, first debate between the two men for this election cycle taking place in just six weeks.",

We know what a second Donald Trump term will do to middle-class families across the country. We know where Donald Trump stands on important issues, like reproductive freedom for women.

I'm glad you highlighted some of those insults, because that's what defense attorneys started with, Todd Blanche basically using Michael Cohen's own words from his books, from his podcasts to basically say that he has vengeance against the former president. He called him a boorish cartoon misogynist, a Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain, to which Michael Cohen essentially said, yes, that sounds like something I would say. They basically have said that Michael Cohen has profited off of Donald Trump, getting him to admit on the stand that he has used Trump's name in every single podcast that he's aired. And, basically, that is their tactic so far. They haven't gotten yet to the crux of the charges. However, before the defense attorneys had their turn, the prosecution did wrap up its case pretty much in a nice little bow, getting to that Oval Office discussion where, essentially, Michael Cohen told for jurors how Donald Trump knew about these hush money payments. Let me read an excerpt -- excerpt for -- from the transcript. It says -- Michael Cohen said on the stand: \"So, I was sitting with President Trump, and he asked me if I was OK. He asked me if I needed money. And I said, 'No, all good.' He said, 'Because I can get a check.' And I said, 'No.' I said, 'I'm OK.' He said, um, 'All right, just make sure you deal with Allen.'\" And the prosecution said: \"Did he say anything about anything that would be forthcoming to you?\" And Cohen said: \"Yes, it would be a check for January and February.\" Now, listen, the prosecution laid out there the fact that Michael Cohen has pled guilty to federal charges, he served some prison time, trying to get ahead of the defense questions. And we fully expect that to happen when the defense picks back up. But, Wolf, listen, we're nearing the end of this trial. It's very possible the prosecution may rest its case, possibly tomorrow. We will see how long there is for redirect with Michael Cohen. And then it's the defense's turn, which we don't expect a very long defense. And then this, of course, will go to the jurors.",

I mean, he basically is an opportunist and takes every chance to make money off his relationship with Trump. He wanted promotion because of his relationship with Trump. He's now selling books and doing his podcasts and apparently looking for his next gig because of this. I think that became clear. I also thought that the method of cross-examination, while it may not have seemed conventional, that is, that it wasn't all in a sequential story, it was good for the defense lawyer to do that because it allows him to catch the witness off guard, off-script, to not just follow the sequence that he's been prepping for months now, maybe years, with the government prosecutors to tell the story. So he's moving around. And I think that's essential. You're going to see, I think in the next few days, a continued effort to discredit him. And, remember, it takes one juror. And Michael Cohen is the only thing that the people have put forward to connect Trump with this idea that somehow, instead of being a misdemeanor business records case, this should suddenly become a felony case because of some intention to commit a violation of federal law. And they have not made that a very strong part of the case yet. So the defense is looking to show that one witness. They have got one juror. It's good that they have got a couple lawyers on the jury as well to play to, but basically to say, look, they have not met their burden of proof.

And that is, if they catch him in a lie or in a -- sort of a shaded mistruth, then that may be enough for the jury to believe, well, he's lying to us. He certainly knew about this. And, clearly, he would be asked on cross, did he participate in this, did he know about federal election law, right after he's asked about what the relationship was with Ms. Daniels that he felt like he needed to cover up or at least keep out of public view.
