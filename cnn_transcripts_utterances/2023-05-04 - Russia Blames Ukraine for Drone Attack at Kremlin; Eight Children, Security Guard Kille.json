In the past few hours, authorities in Kyiv have described the most intense Russian air attacks of the year what is believed to be retaliation after Moscow accused Ukraine of a drone attack on the Kremlin, which Ukrainian officials say air defenses destroyed all incoming missiles. Explosions have also been reported to the south in Odesa.Moscow says an early morning drone attack on the Kremlin was a terrorist plot to assassinate President Vladimir Putin by the Ukrainians. Putin doesn't actually live at the Kremlin. CNN analysis confirms Russian claims that two drones were spotted over the Kremlin, but finds no evidence of Ukrainian involvement. Unlike previous attacks on Russian soil, when Ukrainian officials have hinted and implied Ukraine was responsible, this time, President Vladimir Zelenskyy made it clear Ukraine had nothing to do with the drone attack at the Kremlin. There are many theories about who may have carried out the attack. Ukrainian officials have suggested it could be a false flag operation by Russia, while a former Russian lawmaker now living in exile tells CNN Russian partisans may be responsible. More now from CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is the moment Russia's war in Ukraine finally struck home. Two drone attacks on the Kremlin minutes apart, leaving smoke billowing from the historic buildings and an extraordinary scene of vulnerability at the heart of the Russian state. It was hours before Kremlin controlled TV announced the news in the form of an official statement blaming Ukraine. Last night, the Kyiv regime attempted a drone strike against the residents of the president of the Russian Federation. The statement reads. We view these actions as a planned terrorist attack and an assassination attempt, adding that Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures wherever and whenever it deems appropriate. Amid calls in Russia for an overwhelming military response, Ukraine's president visiting Finland is distancing his country from the incident.",

The arrests were part of the Eureka operation and tied to the increasingly powerful Ndrangheta crime syndicate based in the southern Italian region of Calabria that has achieved global reach. 108 of the arrest warrants were handed down in Italy. The arrests were made in Belgium, Germany, France, Slovenia, Spain and Romania. Arrests were also made in Brazil and Panama. More than 2,770 officers were involved. The massive sting operation took nearly two years of investigation that unraveled an international network of drug smuggling from South America to Europe and Australia. A number of European seaports were also involved, officials said at a press conference announcing the successful operation.

And certainly, there is little reconnaissance capability. The other thing to note here, John, is that these drones probably would have had to have been controlled by a ground controller, on the way in to a target like the Kremlin. And, you know, the range of a drone like this, the range of the command and control effort, would have had to exceed 100 miles and that is not something that most of these drones have the capability of.
