We haven't exactly seen a profile in courage from the Democratic congressional leadership on this. They've been very cautious. And George Clooney said what a lot of Democrats are saying. It reminded me a little bit of 1968 when the only major surrogate that Gene McCarthy could get when he was challenging Lyndon Johnson, even though many Democrats felt that Johnson, through the war in Vietnam, was kind of rendering himself unelectable, was Paul Lynn. Paul Lynn was the only one to go to New Hampshire and say publicly, because he was kind of like, you know, he was immune. I mean, he was a -- he was a rich celebrity. He didn't need the usual political rewards. And I think Clooney actually fits a little bit, to me, in that lineage where, you know, he is not the only person who has thought this. And what was so significant about what he said was that he didn't only say that he didn't think Biden can win. He said that the Biden he saw was like what they saw at the debate.

      "sentences": "A new study from the American Cancer Society finds that nearly half of adult cancer deaths in the U.S. couldn't be prevented.Now, a study shows about 40 percent of new cancer cases and 44 percent of cancer deaths among adults aged 30 and up may be preventable through lifestyle changes. Now, cigarette smoking was by far the leading risk factor, contributing to nearly one in five cancer cases. Other key risk factors include excess body weight and alcohol consumption. A study suggests that certain cancers are more preventable than others. Lung cancer had the largest number of cases attributable to modifiable risk factors, followed by breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. And joining me now is Dr. Jorge Rodriguez. He's a board-certified internal medicine specialist and viral researcher. It's been a while. Good to see you again. So, listen, we often think of cancer as sort of this bolt of lightning, a bad lottery ball. We knew, of course, that there was a strong link between lifestyle and cancer. But what do you make about these numbers and how much agency we have over this horrible disease? DR. JORGE RODRIGUEZ, INTERNAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST AND VIRAL RESEARCHER: Well, I was glad to see this study because it does show that we have actually a lot of control over what happens to us. I have a lot of patients that come in, and they say, well, you know, my father had this, and my mother had that. And I', bound to get it. And that's not necessarily the truth. So, what it showed is that a great percentage of what we can do can affect how we can have less of a risk for cancers. Things that are completely within our control: smoking, weight, exercise.",

Breast cancer is one that is very directly linked to weight. Colon cancer is another one that is very linked to weight.I mean, not to even mention heart disease, which is a direct connection. But we know that having a metabolism that is not 100 percent efficient or normal can make the DNA act erratically. So that's -- that's the link. And now listen, as much as sometimes I have criticized the overuse of medications like Ozempic and Wegovy, we know that weight loss -- and these studies have shown, other studies that losing weight in one manner or another definitely decreases the risk of cancers.",

Eventually, guess what? If you get sick, you will have no choice, really, but to take multiple numbers of pills and be under a lot of duress with different medical therapies.
