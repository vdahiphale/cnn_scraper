But first, the active manhunt in New York City. Police searching for the gunman who shot and killed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare this morning outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan. The NYPD calling it a, quote, brazen, targeted attack some New Yorkers, terrified as video emerges of the shooting which shows what looks to be a professional hitman using a silencer on his weapon. CNN's Brynn Gingras has been with investigators as they collect evidence and is laying out what we know so far about this gruesome murder. And we want to warn our viewers parts of this story are clearly disturbing.

They do betray an astounding level of preplanning, of organization and I should also say, cool headedness and all of those things together would point towards a very competent assassin and potentially even someone who does this for hire.We know first by his use of the weapon, he's carrying a nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol. It appears to be equipped with some sort of silencer or suppression device. These are not things that you see on everyday ordinary homicides, drive-by shootings, things like that. This is a -- this is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. He uses it with great precision. His timing is impeccable. He waits behind the SUV until the target walks past. He steps out behind the target so as not to be seen. He shoots once and then follows it up with two additional shots to make sure he's got a -- you know, a complete kill. And, of course, he's able to recycle the weapon to clear an ammunition jam in the middle of the attack. That shows a high degree of training on firearms training, that in which you practice over and over, how to clear a jam from a gun in the middle of a firefight. He's clearly adept at those skills. And I think the timing and the way he conducts himself also really lend to this impression that this is someone who is very serious and spent a lot of time thinking this through.",

There are also license plate scanners and readers that are throughout the city, which law enforcement can use if they're looking for a particular vehicle and so here what we see is the individual, not using a vehicle, but using a bicycle which obviously provides a more agile means of transportation to move in and around that area and we know he's still at large here. So this is not only a sophisticated hit, but this is someone who likely would have been looking into how he actually got to that location in order to cover his tracks. And then some kind of plan on how to get away. And I agree totally with Andy on that weapon. I mean, you look at that video here. Of course, we're not showing that in full because of the graphic nature of it, but interestingly, with that suppressor on the weapon, you see him actually racking the slide between each individual shot. That sometimes happens you know, when you're using a suppressor. But then as Andy mentioned, he's able to clear that malfunction and then quickly get that weapon back up on target and continue to fire at the suspect. So, a lot of questions at this hour about why he did this. Authorities obviously trying to figure that out. And then finally ill point out, you know, I've been talking to folks in the executive protection industry as well, including Andy and his former colleagues in the FBI. And they have questions as law enforcement does, as well, about what kind of security precautions this individual had were there any potential threats around him? You know, one thing that's interesting is on this panel in Andy McCabe, you have someone who, as the former FBI director and deputy director had a robust professional protection detail. Sometime protectees don't like that because, you know, you don't want people following you everywhere you go. But we continue to hear from people in that industry that it's so important when you have these high profile people who could be targets.",

And then of course, after the attack, now he clearly has the jump on them in terms of timing, as Josh mentioned, I think the selection of the E-bike to evade the scene was really quite brilliant. It is trackable by GPS, but it's not as immediately identifiable as something like a vehicle is so he's got the jump on them. You can see that he's wearing a large backpack. That's a peak designs backpack. It's a kind of specialty item among outdoors enthusiasts and photographers, and people travel with a lot of gear. He's got a coat on that completely obscures him, except his eyes and nose. So he's really thought this out. He's likely changed his of his clothing, maybe taken out another set of clothing from that backpack as soon as he had an opportunity to after he left the scene. So the guy they're looking for probably doesn't look like this right now, and he is likely been moved considerably outside the area. But we'll see. The PD is definitely all over this manhunt.",

Of course, he denied wrongdoing as he has before, and I think it's important to note that no charges were ever filed, and a lot of the leaks that are happening, which are very popular in Washington, are anonymous. And so, you've had a lot of people come out publicly supporting him, Pete Hegseth, and I will tell you, most of the conversation that I had is what you should have with a nominee, which is -- what is the direction you want to see the department of defense go in.

The damage is extensive once you get to the south and I should add, we can't even get right up against the border. There are about 60 villages that the IDF says are still completely verboten. You are not allowed to visit them. That's because IDF forces are still there.This is all part of this delicate choreography where they have to pull back.

But what we did see in the city of Tyre, which is a historic city it's mentioned many times in the bible, a mixed community of Muslims and Christians was extensive damage entire buildings destroyed, people feeling genuinely, honestly like they have no future. Even though this fragile ceasefire is just about holding tight, they don't believe that there will be any kind of a lasting peace. And so there's a lot of frustration. There's a lot of exhaustion. And it was interesting when we talked to people, Jake, because they're not just angry at Israel, they're angry at America, who they believe has kind of turned away from this conflict, closed its eyes to the suffering of ordinary Lebanese people. But another thing that's really interesting, and they wont say it on camera, but there are a lot of Lebanese people who are also very angry with Hezbollah, who have absolutely no love for the militant group who feel that they have been forced into a war, that they didn't want. And so while there may be a lot of hatred for Israel for many Lebanese, there's a sense of kind of being caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, if you will, which was really interesting. Definitely a lot of animosity towards the West, but the prevailing sentiment honestly, is a sense of crushing exhaustion is a sense of how do we rebuild our lives? Where do we get the money? I mean, the World Bank, Jake, has talked about the figures you're talking about well, over $3 billion of damage, physical damage, well over $5 billion of losses to the economy. The Lebanese government has said 10 billion altogether. So even though this fragile ceasefire is just about holding, you do not see a lot of optimism here in Lebanon, Jake.",
