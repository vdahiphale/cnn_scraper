The party shattering fundraising records, in the first 24 hours of her presidential bid. And tonight, the search for a potential running mate is taking shape. And a governor, who is widely seen as a top contender is here. He was actually one of the first people that she called, after President Biden left the race. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We are live, in Washington, D.C., tonight, where truly everything has changed. And I do mean everything. The 2024 campaign, as we knew it, is over. Vice President Kamala Harris has effectively cleared the runway to the nomination in what has been a whirlwind 24 hours. She's been locking down state delegations and racking up critical endorsements, including that, a former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Now, the current Democratic leaders, we are told by sources, are expected to follow suit. And just about everyone who is considered a potential challenger for this nomination has endorsed Harris. On top of that, the campaign says that she has raised a staggering and record-breaking $81 million in 24 hours. That's on top of the existing $240 million that will be passed on, from the Biden war chest. But what stood out the most today was when we heard from President Biden himself, the first time since making his monumental announcement, yesterday, calling into what is now the Harris campaign headquarters, in Delaware.

Sources tell us tonight that she was wearing a Howard University hoodie, her alma mater, with workout sweats and pair of sneakers, yesterday, as she made more than a 100 phone calls, and about 10 hours with her family and her staff there with her, plus, having her favorite, an anchovy pizza. She also had a phone call with my next guest. That is the California senator, Alex Padilla, who has known Vice President Harris, for decades, starting way back when he served on the L.A. City Council, when she was an Assistant D.A. in San Francisco, in the early 2000s. So, someone who is well-versed to talk about her. And Senator, I know you spoke with the Vice President, yesterday. What can you tell us just about what she said about how these 24 hours have been for her? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA): Sure. Well, good to be with you, Kaitlan. And a good job on the homework of how -- just how far back I go with Vice President Kamala Harris, our soon-to-be Democratic nominee. We connected yesterday, because there was a couple phone calls that went back-and-forth. Look, I can tell she was excited. I can tell she was focused, and really putting in the work, to pay respect to members of Congress on the Hill, to Democratic delegates, and both elected leaders, community leaders, labor leaders, across the country. And it's not a surprise to me knowing her as well as I do. But you see the results of the number of endorsements, the record level of grassroots fundraising, that's an indicator of the excitement and momentum in the base, the amount of support that is just coming out of the woodwork, including, here's some breaking news for you, the California Democratic Party has officially endorsed our own Kamala Harris, to be the Democratic nominee. And we'll formalize it at the convention in Chicago. But to your question. How did she sound on the phone? Hey, friend. How are we doing? We've got a lot of work to do.

Many of us endorsed her within minutes, or within an hour, of her being -- announcing her candidacy, after President Biden made his decision. But look, this has been an electrifying 24 hours, in our party. Joe Biden is a hero, and he's a patriot, and he's a great leader, and he's still the heart and soul of our party. And now, we have Kamala Harris, who's been a fantastic vice president, going out, as the career prosecutor she was, to bring the case for democracy and freedom and progress against a convicted felon, and twice-impeached former President, who is an adjudicated sexual assailant, and somebody who tried to overthrow our constitutional order. So, it's a magnificent matchup, which is why you have record donations, record volunteerism, record participation and exuberance, right now. It's had an electrifying effect on our party.",
