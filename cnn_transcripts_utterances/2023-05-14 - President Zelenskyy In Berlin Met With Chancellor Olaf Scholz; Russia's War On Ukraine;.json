We'll have a live report from Berlin in a little while.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy is indicating Ukraine will soon start taking first important steps for its expected counteroffensive soon. He made the statement after meeting Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, on Saturday. But inside Ukraine, Russian artillery is pummeling targets across the country. Now, this is a video of a drone strike in the western part of the country on Saturday which reportedly left 21 people injured. Ukraine says, another attack in the east killed two people and left 10 others wounded. So, for more now, Salma Abdelaziz joins us from London.

It is Germany that really was the center of a debate a few months ago, Kim, if you'll remember around tanks.Germany eventually reaching that deal with the United States that the U.S. provided Abrams tanks and Germany provided those very critical Leopard tanks that's really made a huge difference on the frontlines. And it showed a change in calculation for NATO. Early on in this conflict, many western partners didn't want to send offensive weapons to Ukraine, fearing that that could escalate the conflict. That that could aggravate the Kremlin. That calculation really the changed in Berlin a few months ago. And even before his arrival, President Zelenskyy was promised a $3 billion aid package, that's going to include even more tanks and more help. Of course, ahead of this expected counteroffensive. But don't expect that President Zelenskyy is going to provide you all the details of when this counteroffensive is going to start, but it's very much going to be the crux of the negotiations, the crux of the discussions in Berlin today. Germany wants to know, wants to understand what are the next steps for Ukraine's fighters on the ground. President Zelenskyy has been reassuring his partners as he has in Rome just yesterday that those first steps in the counteroffensive could be taken soon. Kim.",

Of course, according to Customs and Border Protection who has cited in a recently filed court document that says that 10-day average of migrant encounters currently stands at about 9,000, which is well below what was expected.However, there is some concern and some projections that suggested that number could go up to as many as 14,000 in the coming days or weeks. There is a number thought that is critically high here, and that is the daily custody average, which is the total number of migrants that are in the custody of Customs and Border Protection. That number still stands at about 23,000. So, this -- what you can, perhaps, call a temporary rest pit is allowing them opportunities to process those individuals to make room for others who may possibly choose to enter the country illegally. Now, there is some speculation here on the ground when you speak to some of those who are running the shelters, that receive some of these migrants after they're processed. They seem to believe that perhaps some of the news coming from the Biden administration of stricter policies could be making it south to the border. So, you have many asylum -- potential asylum seekers just south of the border that are still weighing their options. There are -- of course, those numbers that are likely to continue to grow, and that is the number of asylum seekers ending up in some of America's largest cities. Of course, many of them here in El Paso telling me that they are wanting to go to California, some wanting to stay in Texas, but many of them continue to say that New York City is their final destination.

But the reality is Congress doesn't have months to do this. We are less than 20 days away from June 1st and that is the deadline that the Treasury Department has set for when the government could default on its debt. The Congressional Budget Office also released a report on Friday backing up the Treasury Department's timeline here, saying that a default is likely to happen in the first week, two weeks of June. Now, we did hear from President Joe Biden on this Saturday afternoon. He said negotiations are moving along and we should know more in the next few days. Let's listen to what he had to say.

They began to pinpoint certain policy areas that they could find some common ground. On topics so far have centered on permitting reform, resending unspent COVID relief funds and spending cuts.Now, the spending cuts issue is something that the White House has repeatedly said that they wanted to avoid in a deal. But increasingly, I am told, that people within the west ring are beginning to recognize it's something that they might have to cave on. So, we're going to see these talks continue throughout the weekend and into next week, but they need to have a deal in hand in the coming days to get a bill through Congress by June 1st. Remember, Congress moves very slowly and once they have a deal, they still need to draft a bill, sell it to both the House and the Senate and then try to get enough support to pass it.

The system itself over the next 24 to 36 hours, pushes in, and again the friction of the land weakening it to just a basic area of low pressure. Regardless, you're still dealing with strong wind gusts as well as heavy rain. So, that's going to cause landslides and mudslides, especially through some of the higher elevations. So, the winds will finally start to die down moving into Monday. We're picking up some of the strongest of the winds now as this whole it comes on shore. The heaviest rain really pushing in as the outer bands continue on and the eye wall making its way onto the coastline. And finally, by the time we get into Monday night and into Tuesday, we wind down with the rain. It's still scattered.

And one of the things that you mentioned is absolutely correct. It is that show of solidarity, that I think is extremely important for the German government. You saw earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy there greeted with full military honors, meeting Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the president of Germany, and then later now meeting Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor.And if you look at some of the things that have already been announced here ahead of this meeting that you can already say, that at least for the Ukrainians, and probably also for the Germans as well, this has already been a big success. And one of the things that we've been talking about is that big weapons package. The Germans have announced that they are giving to Ukraine, it's 2.7 billion euros, that's around $3 billion. And a lot of the weapons that the Germans say they are going to give to the Ukrainians are extremely important for them on the battlefield. But then also, of course, for the safety of their population. There's a lot of air defense systems, like for instance, the IRIS-T which is quite frankly one of the most capable in the world right now, also more anti-aircraft guns as well. But then you're also talking about main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. And I think, you know, if we look at some of the pictures that we've been seeing throughout the course of the morning, you can really see how far the relations between Olaf Scholz, between the German government, and the Ukrainians have come since this war started. If you recall at the beginning, the Germans were criticized by a lot of people for allegedly not doing enough, not giving enough weapons. [04:30:00] One of the main things that we heard in the early stages of Russia's big invasion of Ukraine is that Germans wanting to give only 5,000 helmets to the Ukrainians. And now you see this big package of 2.7 billion euros in weapons, which the Ukrainians, quite frankly, badly need. And you can see that Germany has come a long way, but that the Ukrainians also have come a long way in their relations with Germany as well. So, I do think this is an important meeting today for Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And quite frankly, an important day for him as well. Because on the one hand, he's meeting the top leaders of the German government but, of course, he is also later receiving one of the main European prizes as well, which is obviously important for the Ukrainians as they try to make their way towards Europe, possibly towards membership of the European Union.

Many will also have to start paying for pharmaceutical treatments. Now, there's no immediate change expected when it comes to vaccines, they'll still be free.For more on this we're joined by Dr. Carlos del Rio, interim dean at Emory University School of Medicine. Thank you so much for being with us, doctor. So, you know, just to start off, after more than three years, this emergency has been such a huge part of your life for so many people in the medical community for so long. Now, that's it ended viscerally, how does this this symbolic moment feel now that's it's finally here? DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, INTERIM DEAN, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Well, in a way there's a sense of relief, right? A sense of accomplishment. It's been a long three years and I think, you know, we've seen millions of people die here in the United States, more -- you know, millions of people died globally. But it's also a reminder that this is not over. The public health emergency declaration is over but the pandemic still continues. It's clearly, you know, causing lesser disease and killing less people but we still have this as a problem and we'll need to continue to think about it and do the right thing in order to have it not return as a major problem.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, it still continues, as you say, it might surprise folks to learn that right now in the U.S. more than 1,000 people die of COVID per week. I mean, it's the lowest since its, you know, since the pandemic started in earnest. But it's not insignificant. So, going forward, vaccines will still be free. Treatments like Paxlovid as well, as long as the U.S. supply lasts. Do you have concerns about what happens after that?DR. DEL RIO:  Well, I even have concerns of what happens now because, you know, vaccines are free and the recommendation from the FDA, from CDC has been that everybody gets a bivalent booster. And if you're over the age of 65 and you've got a bivalent booster more than four months ago, the recommendation is you get another dose. The reality is that only 16 percent of the U.S. population -- one, six, 16 percent has received a bivalent booster, and only 45 percent of those over the age of 65 have received one shot, let alone two. So, we have a lot of unvaccinated people even now when the vaccines are available for free. What happens when you have to pay for it? What happens when your insurance has to cover? I think, you know, it's going to be less. So, what I would like to see is people, actually, take that opportunity and do take the bivalent booster and do -- you know if you're over 65, you get a second shot. Because the reality is, if you are protected, if you are up to date in your vaccinations, if you get COVID, you're not going to get terrible ill, and you're not going to get in the hospital, and you're certainly not going to die.",

It was really something valuable that came from this pandemic looking now at how it's being used for other diseases as well.DR. DEL RIO:  That is correct. You know, once a public health emergency is over, CDC can no longer expect states to send app results. That means states are -- have the -- you know, don't have -- no longer have an obligation and some may decide not to report. But CDC has set up this network of wastewater surveillance. And wastewater surveillance has really become a great way to monitor, not only COVID, but many other infectious diseases like polio and monkey pox. So, I think we were learning of wastewater surveillance as a very, very good tool for surveillance for a variety of infectious diseases.",
