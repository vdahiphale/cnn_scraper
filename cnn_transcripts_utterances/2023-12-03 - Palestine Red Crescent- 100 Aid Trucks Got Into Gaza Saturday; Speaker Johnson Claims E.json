In the north, they seem to be focused on Shuja'iyya, which is east of Gaza City and the Jabalia refugee camp to the north where there were -- there was a very large strike there on a six-storey building, totally pancaking it.Palestinian medical sources say that more than 100 people were in that building, and they are reporting dozens dead in that strike, as well as a similar strike in the Shuja'iyya district. Now, we heard from the government press office in Gaza today that the death toll in the last 24 hours, tops 700. But we can't confirm that sort of number. I've seen other figures as low as 300 but that's still a fairly significant amount of people to be killed from the video we're seeing coming out of Gaza from our cameraman there. It seems a lot of the dead are women and children. Now the Israeli say that they did, in one of those strikes kill one of the senior Hamas commanders who was behind the attacks of October 7th, the Israelis are also reporting that two of their soldiers in Gaza have been killed. They also say that since their ground offensive began. They have located 800 tunnels in Gaza and destroyed 500 of them. Now as far as the humanitarian situation in Gaza goes, the Palestine Red Crescent Society says that around 100 trucks entered Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing. They contain food, medical supplies, medicine, and also body bags. They -- a spokesman for the U.N. agency that oversees the welfare of Palestinian refugees in Gaza said that what is coming in in terms of aid to Gaza is a drop, in his words, in the ocean. He said that increasingly, the health and sanitary situation in Gaza, particularly in the south is getting worse. He said that the number of intestine -- cases of intestinal diseases has gone up by four times, skin diseases by three times and that in general, the sanitary situation threatens to cause a situation where diseases could spread.

We are being told that the Israeli official thanked the U.S. envoy and just the U.S. in general for their ongoing support of Israel since the conflict began on October 7th.Now, this meeting is just another effort from the White House to try to resume the negotiation process to initiate another humanitarian pause, because the reality of the situation is without a humanitarian pause in place, then that means virtually no humanitarian aid gets into the region of Gaza for those in need. And that also means that the possibility of freeing more hostages is going to be virtually non-existent if a truce is not in place. And so the White House knows that is important and their efforts to be deeply engaged in these conversations to resume a humanitarian pause to really get that going. But as our colleague just mentioned, that the possibility of a truce now being in place just because of the breakdown, and the talks between Israel and Hamas just took place yesterday, then that means the chances could be very slim at this point in time, Victor.",

And then as you rightly say, they're being forced to move from A to B without anything. They go to places where there is no water, there is no food.

They have to accept that they are allowing the death of these people. As you and I have spoken, there's been another two very large bombardments, Isabel.

When the playoff field expands to 12 teams next year, we're not even going to be having this debate funnily enough, but as it stands right now, four teams can legitimately argue that they should be in this playoff. There only seems to be room for two. Georgia entering yesterday's SEC Championship against Alabama riding a 29-game win streak. The Bulldogs last lost the 2021 SEC title game against who else, but the Crimson Tide.And Bama quarterback Jalen Milroe was magnificent, throwing two touchdown passes in the first half. They took a 10 point lead in the fourth quarter when Georgia started clawing back. Kendall Milton scoring to cut it to three, which is under three to go, but they would never get the ball back. And Milroe, all effort diving for the first down to seal the 27 to 24 win. He was benched earlier in the season. And he was in tears after this game as 8th rank Alabama lays claim to the best win of any team in the country this season, giving the playoff committee plenty to discuss before they announce the final rankings at noon today. In the NBA, listen to this. The Mavericks set an NBA record on Saturday scoring 30 straight points against the Thunder and they still somehow ended up losing this game. Dallas getting blown out early in the fourth quarter when A.J. Lawson hits a three, then Seth Curry, then Luka Doncic. Curry would have another, then it would be Derrick Jones. You get the picture. Everybody joining the party here and then eventually it'd be Luca Doncic giving Dallas the lead. In just over six minutes, guys, the Mavs go from down 24 to up by six. But after all of that effort, they ran out of gas. The Thunders storming right back outscoring Dallas by 15 the rest of the way for the win. Just wild. MLS playoffs now. FC Cincinnati and Columbus Crew in Ohio Derby with a spot in the final on the line. 86 minute here, Crew down. They nearly sunk. Diego Rossi finding a life raft here. The forward tying the game at two. Columbus not just surviving, they are absolutely thriving 115th minute. Kukukachu, Cucho Hernandez, finding Christian Ramirez with a brilliant header. Ramirez burying the winner there. So, Columbus heading to the Cup final hosting the defending champs LAFC next Saturday. That should be a good one. And lastly for you this morning, an absolutely wild finishing college feud between Vermont and Yale. So, Vermont down five here with less than four seconds to go. Aaron Deloney hitting an uncontested layup with six-tenths of a second left. But then on the ensuing inbound play here, look at this. Yale committing an offensive foul. Vermont gets the ball back. T.J. Long absolutely making Yale pay draining the three-pointer to tie it, and he gets the foul, and he makes the free throw. And somehow Vermont pulls off this insane comeback win, 66 to 65 the final. There is a lot going on right now. We're going to know more about the college playoff. More of that stands later on this afternoon, but a fun morning for you guys for sure. Back to you.",
