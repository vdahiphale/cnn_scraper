Mary, good morning to you. How bad is this shortage, and what impact does it have on air travel? MARY SCHIAVO, CNN TRANSPORTATION ANALYST, FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, any air traffic control shortage is bad but this one's particularly bad because it's been so long ongoing. You know, the FAA still goes back and blames it on COVID but it's their fault. They stopped training and hiring during COVID. And, of course, if they didn't have new controllers coming in the pipeline for training obviously, they knew that in a year or two they'd have a shortage, and that's what's occurring now. They say they were 3,000 short this year but they hired 1,800. Now, your math and my math says yeah, that's not enough, but the FAA says they met their goal. And so that's the frustration that the airlines and travelers share. So this flow control where they intentionally slow things down obviously puts more space between aircraft. I mean, flying is space in time, and you've got to have enough time between the aircraft to have separation. So that's why they're intentionally slowing things down. The airlines are frustrated, and travelers will be very frustrated, but they have to count on luck. They better hope that the weather doesn't add delays and trouble on top of this because that will be a meltdown. The traffic is dramatically up.",
