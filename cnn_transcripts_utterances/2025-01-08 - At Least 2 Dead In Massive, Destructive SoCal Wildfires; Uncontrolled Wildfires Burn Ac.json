It's shutting down major highways, partially closing the second-largest school district in the country. The most devastating inferno is the Palisades Fire, which is on the west side of Los Angeles. It has scorched more than 5,000 acres. It has just razed homes. It is just moving through them, businesses, local landmarks as well. Mandatory evacuations are underway right now for the Eaton Fire, which is another one -- that is in Pasadena and Altadena -- where officials confirmed that at least two people have died and several more have suffered what they are calling \"significant injuries.\" CNN national correspondent, Julia Vargas Jones, is on the ground in Altadena. We're coming back to you, Julia. There's been a lot of development there on the ground where you have been. Tell us what you're seeing and what -- it should be a downtown street that you can clearly see down but is very much not.",

Here was Palisades resident and actor, James Woods, sharing his story with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES WOODS, ACTOR &amp; PALISADES RESIDENT: We got to walk out? I mean, I'm a 77-year-old, man. I can't walk up these hills. It's like Mount Everest here. It's like, you know, pretty steep. So, you know, it's just -- you know, I posted this on X. But -- but Sarah was on with her 8-year-old niece last night. And she came out -- I'm sorry, just, you know, one day you're swimming in the pool, and the next day it's all gone. But she came out with her little Yeti piggy bank for us to rebuild our house. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you can probably tell from my neck bobbing up and down, because, as I think most Palisades are doing, we're all texting each other and trying to share information to the extent that we can get it from either our fire department or LAPD or the council office. We're trying to collect that information.I'm on the phone now with our school board elected rep, who's going to drive through and see what happened to the schools. But we're all holding up by just exchanging sort of well wishes and information and trying to figure out what's going on. Obviously, the news is also informing us and what we see and hear on TV and on the radio is disheartening.",

      "sentences": "Right? So we live on a ridge that's not too far from where the fire broke out. So I think I was probably one of the first people to smell it.I was, you know, sitting in my backyard on the phone with my mother, and I said, wow, I smell burning eucalyptus. And I looked around and I saw nothing. And she said, well, it's windy. Maybe you're just smelling the eucalyptus as it's coming off the trees. And I said, no. There's an unmistakable smell of burn. And, you know, in the Palisades, we always know that there's fire risk. And we had also been under a fire risk warning for a couple of days because there we're high winds. And we knew that. So within a couple of minutes, I looked to my left and I could see the smoke rising. I called the fire department. I texted the people I know there. Some other people had already called. And then, within about 10 minutes, we heard the helicopters and I could see -- I mean, I could see with my eyes that it was just growing exponentially. Nothing like we'd seen before. I mean, as I say, the Palisades gets fires once in a while. They're usually small. They're -- they're put out pretty quickly. And you can sort of tell that the fire department is getting their hands around it. But this one was just growing exponentially. So within probably about 15, 20 minutes, I was inside the house. I was telling the kids to get up, pack up, we probably have to evacuate. And I don't know the timing, but it wasn't too far after that where it was obvious for a lot of people that we had to go. So that was where I was as it unfolded.",

But let's put this into context. This is expected to be a pretty short proceeding. There will be no penalties. And he's even allowed to appear virtually. Because the judge is making a rare concession to his status as president-elect, saying, look, I know there's a lot of physical and mental demands on you right now because you are going to be president. So I'll let you appear virtually. And that's what we expect Trump to do. So now they're asking the Supreme Court to step in and stop this. But Trump's team believes that his status as president-elect should not only delay the sentencing but mean that the entire case should be tossed out. So in addition to the immediate issue of what happens Friday, they also have these larger appeals that they are filing, arguing that, as president-elect, he should not be subject to any state level proceedings. And also arguing that the Supreme Courts immunity decision on Trump's January 6th case earlier this year, that that also means that this verdict on 34 counts of falsifying business records should be tossed. Now, it is unlikely that those arguments are going to succeed. They have failed so far at the lower courts. But right now we're watching and waiting what the Supreme Court does. Look, this court has surprised us in the past on some of these Trump- related issues. But given the way that the judge has tailored the sentencing, it would be highly unusual if the Supreme Court were to delay.",
