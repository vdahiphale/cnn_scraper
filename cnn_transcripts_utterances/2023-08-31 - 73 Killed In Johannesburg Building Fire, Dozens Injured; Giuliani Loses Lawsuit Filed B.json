This is Gen. Brice Oligui Nguema. This is other military men celebrating him, hoisting up -- hoisting him up in the air to celebrate him declaring himself the leader. He's said to be the cousin of the ousted President Ali Bongo Ondimba. Now, the Bongo family has led Gabon since 1967 -- almost 56 years continuously. His dad led the country until his death in 2009, and then he won the presidential election there. And just before this military coup, he had been announced the winner for a third time of a seven-year term. Now, these military men who have taken over say that election has been voided. They've shut down the country's borders and dissolved all institutions because they said that election was a sham election. And then, we saw this extraordinary video from Ali Bongo Ondimba appealing for international help from his friends around the world. I want to show you a bit of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials in North Carolina are warning about heavy rain, life- threatening flooding, and a chance of isolated tornadoes. Governor Roy Cooper has already declared a state of emergency and swift water rescue crews are on high alert.CNN's Dianne Gallagher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  As Tropical Storm Idalia moves up the Carolina coast before it breaks away from land, here in the Carolinas we are feeling the effects of that storm and we'll likely do so until late Thursday morning. According to officials here in New Hanover County, wind bands like what you're seeing here are going to go into the mid-morning area and they expect the worst of it to actually come right around the time most people would be commuting for work. The emergency management director telling me that they anticipate they could see moderate flooding and moderate winds and that their concern is that they could have areas that they already consider to be trouble areas experience extra flooding because of the king tide when those waters are already very high. Now, in speaking to the town manager here in Carolina Beach, they say they are most concerned about flooding in areas and are asking visitors to stay not just out of floodwater but out of the ocean as well. Because of Hurricane Franklin out in the Atlantic, as well as the oncoming Tropical Storm Idalia, the swells and the currents are simply too strong, they say, for visitors and people who are not experienced surfers or swimmers. They're asking those visitors not to go into the water and they're saying that they're going to extend that request likely into the holiday weekend, even as the weather gets better because they feel that it still may be dangerous as the remnants of the storm remain below the surface.

Meanwhile, 39 past the hour right now. A federal judge has ruled former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has lost a defamation lawsuit. Giuliani recently said in court he could no longer contest the claim that he made false, defamatory statements against two Georgia election workers. Damages in the case could cost Giuliani tens of thousands if not millions of dollars. CNN's Sara Murray has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  More legal problems for former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. A judge saying Rudy Giuliani forfeits a case that had been ongoing where some election workers from Georgia accused Giuliani of defaming them. He had accused Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss of ballot tampering even though he didn't have the goods to back up these allegations. A judge said because Giuliani did not comply with the discovery in this case and did not hand over the documents he needed to as part of this case, he forfeits -- meaning he loses. That means there's going to be a trial to determine what kind of damages he could end up having to pay out to these election workers. That could happen later this year or early next year. The election workers in this case said they felt gratitude about this decision. They said Rudy Giuliani made their lives a living nightmare. Meanwhile, a political adviser to Giuliani slammed this decision and said Giuliani wants to try to reverse it. It's hard to see how the New York mayor is going to do that, though. One of the issues he has cited over and over again are his cash flow problems. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL J. GOTTLIEB, ATTORNEY FOR SHAYE MOSS AND RUBY FREEMAN:  But our expectation is that we'll be able to prove tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages before you get punitive damages.

Obviously, the punitive damages are going to be a lot bigger probably than the compensatory damages. And these are -- these damages are made up of two categories. Compensatory are actual and presumed losses that they suffered. So actual losses could be if they had to hire security for their home. Presumed damages are the damages to their reputation. But the punitive damages are where the amount could really get high, but that's also where Giuliani's financial records and the state of his financial affairs come into play. Because while punitive damages are meant to deter the conduct of people doing that in the future, it's also not meant to necessarily financially wipe out the person who is responsible to pay them. So it seems high but it really remains to be seen because there's a lot of public -- a lot of strong public feelings either way about this case, and that could seep into the jury.",

But now he can't use it because the judge said that he gave no specificity. He didn't even give what the judge said was a smoke signal that Trump had actually invoked the executive privilege defense on a phone call. He couldn't testify to any specifics.
