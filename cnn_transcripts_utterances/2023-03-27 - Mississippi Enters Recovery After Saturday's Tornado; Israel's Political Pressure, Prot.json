[03That will mean pretty much all checks and balances on the government, allowing it to put its allies in the Supreme Court and preventing the Supreme Court from striking down laws passed by parliament, accepting very narrow circumstances. Now, since this announcement by Netanyahu, since it came out that he had sacked Gallant, these people have come out onto the streets. They're usually out on the streets for the past three months on Saturday evenings and on Thursday, which is a Sunday evening, they are incredibly angry that this has happened. We've heard from opposition leaders like Yair Lapid, former Prime Minister, and Benny Gantz, former defense minister coming out and saying that Netanyahu has crossed a red line. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak has told Netanyahu to step down. The Histadrut, Israel's main labor union, has called for a general strike on Monday. So, if Netanyahu thought that sacking Gallant was going to quash dissent in his ranks and put an end to opposition to this dude is real overhaul, he was very much mistaken.

And I think that what we're seeing now is an internal fight around Netanyahu, between two camps, between many people in his party were saying that this judicial overall is crossed all red line and it's tearing the country apart. The Minister of Defense Gallant, who was fired by Netanyahu yesterday, just finished the hearing in the Knesset in parliament and warned that Iran, Hezbollah and other of Israel's adversaries are cheering to what is going on now in the country. On the other hand, Netanyahu's Minister of Defense -- sorry Netanyahu Ministers of Justice Yariv Levin, who initiated this whole process of judicial overhaul, and Netanyahu's son, Yair Netanyahu, are pressing him very hard to continue pushing this legislation. Netanyahu's far right partners, Betzalel Smotrich, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, are also pressing Netanyahu to continue with the legislation and even threatening that they could dissolve the government if he suspends the legislation.

On Sunday, the Central American country signed a formal document recognizing one China, and establishing diplomatic ties with Beijing. It comes after breaking off relations with Taiwan, a decision Taiwan's president called, quote, \"very regrettable.\" Several Central American and Pacific countries have made the same move recently in order to increase trade with China.The sting of COVID-19 ease (ph) are being felt in China's economy. New data shows while retail sales ask deadly climbing, both property investment and industrial profits dipped and it will take considerable work to hit Beijing's economic goals. CNN Selina Wang shows us how the city is coming back to life. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): The crowds are back in Beijing. During the pandemic, this popular shopping area was virtually empty. The stores were starved for business. And the restaurants did not allow people to dine inside.

But this line is huge to get into this restaurant. Follow me. (voice-over): But it's not so bad compared to other places (on-camera): They're not even taking waits anymore. It's all fully booked for the rest of the night. (voice-over): We try our luck in another area, but it's not any better. (on-camera): There are these long lines out of so many of the restaurants. I've been talking to people here who've been waiting for more than an hour. (voice-over): Including this man, a tourist from Wuhan, where the pandemic started. I asked him if people are feeling happy that the country has opened up, not necessarily, he responds. The mood is still depressed because people's incomes were unstable during the pandemic. Beneath the surface of busy shops and streets are deep economic wounds, nearly one in five of China's youth is unemployed. That could be about 20 million people, according to CNN's calculations. Across the country, they're flocking to job fairs like this one. (on-camera): The organizers here say that things have really picked up since pandemic restrictions ended. (voice-over): These two women graduated college last summer but still haven't found work. She tells me she majored in chemistry. But if she can't find a job in the sciences, she'll take any job she can get. This computer science graduate tells me he's been applying to jobs everywhere, online and in person with no luck yet. He says he's worried about the mass layoffs at China's technology companies. But it's not just hire pink tech jobs getting hit. This factory owner gives an impassioned speech claiming that a lot of factories in Guangdong, Chinese manufacturing hub, are laying off workers and cutting salaries. Meanwhile, local governments are struggling to cope with mounting debts after years of paying for mass testing and COVID quarantines. Just one province, Guangdong, spent $22 billion fighting COVID over the past three years. Some cities are reducing costs by cutting government-provided medical insurance for residents. The change sparked protests in several cities last month. Crowds of senior citizens took to the streets in Wuhan and Dalian, shouting for their money back. Some of them pushing against rows of police. Back on the streets of Beijing, normal life has returned, but each person and business is still dealing with the aftermath of years of economic pain.
