      "sentences": "Good morning, John. Look, election eve, happy election eve to everyone. We are just 36 hours or so away from polls beginning to close. This is crunch time for Donald Trump and his campaign.Now, one key thing that I'm going to be looking for today at his series of stops, he's starting off his day in North Carolina, then he goes to Pennsylvania for two separate stops and then ends his day in Michigan. It's whether or not he can stay on message and really deliver the closing argument that I know the Trump campaign is hoping that he will. And we didn't see a lot of that yesterday. I mean, I will say from talking to a lot of allies of Donald Trump, some of his top campaign officials, a lot of them were exasperated with some of the off-script topics that he kept bringing up. You mentioned this, but he spent several minutes of one of his rallies yesterday wailing against polling that shows Harris gaining ground. He talked about how he shouldn't have left the White House and he also even made a claim that he wouldn't mind if an attacker or would-be attacker had to shoot through the press to get to him. So, these are obviously not the types of comments that the Trump campaign is wanting him to focus on. They really want him to be trying to turn out as many voters as possible, keep his rhetoric in check and essentially deliver that policy message that they want him to, which is talking about the economy and the border. Now, one thing we also heard Donald Trump do a lot yesterday is to begin really sowing the seeds of doubt in this upcoming election. I want you to take a listen to what he said yesterday on this.

Harris didn't even mention Donald Trump by name when she was campaigning Sunday, Isaac. What does that mean for her final message of this campaign? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, good morning, Kate, and happy election eve to you. that, that was a deliberate choice by the Harris campaign, and I will tell you something that Harris aides were very eager to point out, that in the last speech that she gave last night in East Lansing, Michigan, she did not mention Donald Trump at all. It is, to them, a way of emphasizing that she is on a positive forward-looking message. That's what she's been trying to talk about over the last couple of weeks of this campaign. And that's where she is looking to end today. Of course, this big day all around Pennsylvania, the incredibly competitive battleground state. But you see what we will see out of her today.

Almost 500 ballots were damaged, but the majority of those ballots, the voters affected by that, have already requested new ballots. They said that only about six ballots from those three incidents were too damaged to be able to be read.Now, police are still looking for that suspect. They say they fear he could continue his attacks. They're saying that he's a white man around 30 to 40 years old, short balding hair, and they're also looking for a dark color S60 Volvo linked to those attacks. In Washington, Governor Jay Inslee said that these incidents are election related unrest, but he did say in a statement that this is a purely precautionary measure taken in response to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's nationwide warnings regarding threats to election infrastructure and other recent activities that have occurred in Southwestern Washington. Obviously, he's talking about those incidents there in Oregon as well, Kate. The police in, in Oregon and in Portland, actually, that's where they're looking for that suspect. But the mayor there, Ted Wheeler, he warned about something else. He said, you know, we will do everything possible to protect the people's right to demonstrate peacefully, but we'll also be prepared to address anything that is related to criminal destruction or violence. In Nevada, about 60 National Guard troops are going to be on standby as well. But, again, this is also a precaution, Kate. This is something that the government said has been done in the past. It's something that is going to be happening in the future as well. It's just a standard procedure, but they are urging the public to stay on high alert and report any kind of suspicious activity as they try to have this Election Day be as smooth as possible.",
