As we know, it was on that expedition and there was a catastrophic implosion, all the five members of that expedition were killed. And in the last several days we have been trying to learn more about what happened and how it happened. That's what authorities have been doing. We've learned some new critical information throughout today that the mission to try and find more pieces of the submersible is still ongoing.In fact, as we speak, there's a remote operating vehicle that is 400 miles out at sea searching the bottom of the ocean floor, the Odysseus 6K. Now the Odysseus has gone to the bottom of the ocean a total of four times. And there's several pieces that have been recovered since it began its mission, including the nose of the vessel, the front and the back of the pressurized hull, and two other debris fields. We also learned today, Fred, that the company that's been operating the Odysseus was using its heavy lifting capabilities. That gives us a bit of a clue about what they might have possibly found during these search operations, that they might have been lifting debris from out of the bottom of the ocean floor. And that is what we are hoping that the U.S. Coast Guard can provide more details on today. Why is that so important? Well, authorities have said that they need to gather as much evidence, as much materials as possible in order to understand what happened here and to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. So hopefully we'll get more details from the Coast Guard soon -- Fred.",

Now bear in mind, the early stages of this rebellion, Vladimir Putin said that these -- all of these men and indeed his former chef, the leader of Wagner, were guilty of treason and would be -- face the full force of the law. Clearly that has now been dialed back as the Wagner Group was prepared, in their words, at any rate to turn their convoy around some 125 miles, 200 kilometers short of the Russian capital Moscow. But what we don't know now is what the longer term implications for the Putin regime are or indeed for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine because this clearly suits the Ukrainians very nicely -- Wolf.",

The White House saying that the two men discussed not only the United States' ongoing support for Ukraine but also recent events in Russia. As Sam outlined there, one of the key questions is how this mercenary rebellion in Russia will ultimately impact the war in Ukraine.Now this call between Biden and Zelenskyy follows the call Biden had yesterday with top allies, including the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. And they also talked about Ukraine as well as those developments in Russia. And sources have said that one of the main takeaways from that call was really trying to emphasize from President Biden to those leaders the need to simply remain quiet and allow for the situation in Russia to play out. Officials have been concerned. They don't want to show any indication of showing support for either side in this matter. And so that is part of those very quiet strategy that we've seen from the White House. We have yet to hear directly from President Biden regarding this matter. He is returning to the White House a bit later this evening, but we did start to hear the first response from the administration earlier today when Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that this rebellion was extraordinary and it has shown that there are some cracks in Vladimir Putin's hold on power in Russia.

      "sentences": "Yes. They certainly have been.Wolf, I should just note that we're also just getting word that the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart today so it does appear that top American officials are reaching out to their Ukrainian counterparts after this extraordinary mutiny, insurrection, by Yevgeny Prigozhin. But you're absolutely right, Wolf, the intelligence community, national security officials here in Washington have been watching him closely for quite some time as his anger appears to have grown towards Moscow. Now remember that Prigozhin has been in charge of these Wagner forces who were the primary fighters in and around the fight for Bakhmut which has been one of the central fights in Ukraine over the past few months. And we've seen this anger growing from Prigozhin accusing top military officials in Moscow of not giving him enough support, not giving him enough weapons, not getting him what he needs, literally screaming in videos at the Defense Minister Shoigu, at the head of the Russian military, Valery Gerasimo. And so that appears now to have reached a crescendo, Wolf. And I'm told that intelligence officials saw the planning for what turned out to be this march towards Moscow carried out by Prigozhin, which ended very suddenly yesterday. They saw these Wagner forces who had retreated from Bakhmut start to gather, start to move, gather equipment and weapons, and make this move towards Rostov in southern Russia, which they eventually took over. So it did appear that this march would be imminent to the point, Wolf, where intelligence officials I'm told briefed top members of Congress, the leaders both Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate, as well as the top leaders of both parties in the Intelligence Committees to let them know that something like this would be coming. The surprise, Wolf, I'm told, was when it actually was carried out and how little resistance there was. There was no resistance from the Russian military, from the Russian security forces, from the border guard. They met zero confrontation along that road to Moscow. So I'm told there had been a U.S. assessment that a lot more violence, a lot more bloodshed was expected, and that never came -- Wolf. BLITZER: Alex Marquardt and Arlette Saenz, guys, thank you very, very much. Let's get some analysis right now from retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt. He's the former assistance secretary of state for political military affairs during the George W. Bush administration. General, thanks for joining us. President Zelenskyy says he and President Biden discussed the hostilities in Russia and Putin's war on Ukraine. How do the U.S. and the Western allies help Ukraine capitalize right now on this Russian instability? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, I think 24 hours ago there was an opportunity to capitalize on this when you had the instability, when you had the uncertainty about the military chain of command. That would have been a good opportunity to attack. On the other hand, I think we can all recognize right now, as you said, that there are fissures in Putin's grip on power. He will be trying to do whatever he can to close those fissures. And I think that if Zelenskyy and his people push too hard right now, out of a show of strength, Putin may overreact. So I would suspect that the advice of Zelenskyy was let's just hold off for right now, let's not provoke him, let's wait until this settled down, and let's get back to the counteroffensive as we had planned.",

There's going to be searched for collaborators.

Here is CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Roughly a dozen states are already under either heat advisories or excessive heat warnings. And in some instances, these are likely going to last for several days. That's because for some of these areas, they don't even peak temperature rise until Tuesday or even Wednesday of the upcoming week. Take for example Houston going from 101 for the high on Monday up to 103. By Wednesday, Dallas going from 102 on Monday to 107 by the time we get to the middle portion of the upcoming week. And for many of these areas, even though they peak, they really don't drop back down by the end of the week. Take Austin for example. The average high this time of year is 94. We are going to spend every single one of the next seven days with those high temperatures getting into the triple digits. And we're looking at over 35 cities breaking record temperatures at some point this week between Monday and Friday. Some of those communities possibly even having two or three days in a row of record breaking temperatures. It's also not just the temperature we're concerned about. But also when you factor in that humidity you get what we call the feels like temperature. And in some of these areas, you're talking extremely high numbers. Corpus Christi getting that feels like temperature all the way up to 110 on Tuesday. Dallas looking at a feels like temperature Tuesday of up to 114 degrees. Really the only areas that are likely not going to see much of this heat, especially in the eastern half of the country is one of the places like the Midwest, the Northeast in the mid-Atlantic. And the reason for that is you have a lot of the showers and thunderstorms that will be moving into the area because of it also the potential for some severe storms, especially for cities like New York, Washington DC stretching down through Atlanta, the main threats there will be damaging winds and the potential for some large hail as well.

Affirmative action has always been a very controversial tool, but they are choosing to end this and all likelihood precisely at the moment when kids of color have become a majority of the nation's high school graduates for the first time.
