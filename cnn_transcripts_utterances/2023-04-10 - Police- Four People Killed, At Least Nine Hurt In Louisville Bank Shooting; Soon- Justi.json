Officials say that police exchanged gunfire when they confronted the shooter. Two officers were hurt in the gunfight. The shooter died at the scene and it's unclear if he was shot by police or by himself.Witnesses described chaotic moments. People were running for cover, some inside the bank even hiding themselves in a vault for safety. And investigators say the gunman was working alone and may have been a former employee or some connection with that bank. President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both been briefed. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear revealing that two of those killed today were close friends. We're expecting another update in a press briefing in the next hour. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is here with more on what we're learning about the circumstances, all the events that took place. And the shooter, what do we know? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. That's the big question, the shooter. You know, obviously, police have identified the shooter. They know who this individual is. There's some connection to this bank, former employee, current employee. But that's a really important key fact because there seems to be -- right now, the theory is some kind of argument, disagreement, disgruntled former current employee, so that's a big key here. But what's so significant in all of this, Fred, is the fact that it took police just three minutes to get to the scene. And even still, that was not enough to save those lives. Four people were killed. Listen to the police chief there describing the officers' response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And also, the other thing that we've learned is that the weapon here used according to our John Miller was that it was a AR-style -- AR-15 style weapon.

I mean, of course, in a winning state that you know, has refused to pass a Red Flag Law you know, that allows you to identify and at least remove firearms for those who have indications that they would use them. We have laws that permit constitutionally anybody to carry a gun concealed anywhere they want to, except perhaps in a government building.We have laws that they've been rejected even as to safety for children, those who own legally owned firearms that do not store them properly, and others are injured and are killed because of some child or someone else who can have access to them. So, this is not a state that's friendly to those who would think about gun reform in that area or gun control in some way or even reasonable as you might consider gun steps that we could take in terms of restricting them. This is not that state. However, the effort continues. We will continue because the evidence is obvious that if we don't take steps now, we actually are complicit in these outcomes. There's already data that shows that there's certain things you can do that minimizes or at least compromises or mitigates gun balance to a certain level. And we're just talking about a part of it here. We're not talking about that everyday gun violence that we all know and experience in our -- in our communities. WHITFIELD: Well, talk to me more about how you think this is going to be an uphill battle because Kentucky, as you mentioned, it will -- it is a state too that adopted the law in 2019 under Governor Bevin for it to be a permitless carry state. Not even at the time the Louisville Metro Police nor Kentucky State Fraternal Order of Police liked that idea. So, how much of an uphill battle do you believe it's going to be given the current state of affairs, the sequence of shootings taking place, not just Kentucky, but really across the country for it to be impetus to have more discussions that actually turn into some sort of action?",

There was legislation that required or at least permitted the age for carrying a gun from 21 to 18, the Lord's age.They pass legislation this past -- this last legislative session to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies and other public officials from enforcing any federal power on bans or regulations enacted after January 21. They'd be charged with a crime and face termination from jobs. Just think about it. We depend on the collaboration efforts between state and federal law enforcement with respect to preventing gun violence and gun trafficking, but yet Kentucky takes this step. You know, I think it'd be an uphill battle. I think the history shows it. I think the current mood and the actions of the legislature does not indicate that there's going to be any easy rollover on this particular piece. But I think the effort must continue. We'd be remiss if we did not do this and we'll be complicit as well.",

That is going to be the first order of business with the police putting together exactly what this individual did, how he gained access to the building, and what his motivations were. You know, in private security, there's a concept called adversarial terminations. And we work on these all the time. And that's when an HR department or chief people person will reach out knowing that they're separating an individual from their company.These can be traumatic moments for people. And it sometimes results in violence at the termination or this kind of a follow-up incident. These can be mitigated with the proper planning and the implementation of security protocols to do things like keeping this person out of the bank after he's been separated from the service.

Unfortunately, the numbers don't really seem to be bearing that out. According to CDC figures the year before permitless carry was 2018. Between that and 2021, gun deaths as a whole are up 25 percent. And gun homicides are up 75 percent between 2018 and 2021. So, we're kind of seeing the limits of this argument that having more guns around are going to reduce shootings.There's always going to be places where people can't carry guns. That's a reality. Unless we have gun stations in every aspect of civilian life, that argument really falls short. Kentucky does permit checks. They do background checks on people with concealed carry permits every month. In 2019 when permitless carry passed. That was a real protection against people who shouldn't have guns that were lost. So, we don't have that anymore. You can buy a gun from a stranger in Kentucky, and there's no record of it.",

It's so -- it's a rather lengthy statement. That's kind of a truncated version of the statement coming from the White House. Jennifer, so you just talked about the measures that went into place in Kentucky. The reason being people thought that having more guns would mean more protection.
