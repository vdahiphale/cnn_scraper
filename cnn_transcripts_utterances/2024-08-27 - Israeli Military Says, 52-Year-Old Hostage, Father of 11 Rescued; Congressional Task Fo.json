Israel's military says it has rescued a hostage held in Gaza since the Hamas terror attacks on October 7th of last year. This man, a father of 11, had spent the last 326 days as a prisoner. There he is in the hospital a short time ago, reuniting with his brother. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following this breaking news for us. He's live in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what can you tell us? What's the latest? It's a remarkable story, and the details are just coming in.",

      "sentences": "Without a doubt, Jim. And we are only just starting to get some of the details, but they are indeed remarkable. The Israeli military, its special forces, carrying out an operation in Southern Gaza, rescuing this man, Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi, a- 52-year-old father of 11 from a tunnel in southern Gaza. This is the first time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued a hostage alive from a tunnel beneath the Gaza Strip. It is the fourth rescue operation in the Gaza Strip that has successfully returned hostages alive, and he is the eighth hostage to be returned by Israeli military operations coming back to Israel alive.This operation was carried out by the Israeli military equivalent of the Navy SEALS, known as Shayetet 13, alongside several other Israeli military brigades and intelligence gathered by Israel's Shin Bet, the domestic intelligence service. He was then taken by helicopter to Soroka Medical Center. That is a hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. He is in stable medical condition, we are told, and is getting medical checks as we speak. Several of his family members have been able to see him already, have been able to hug him after 326 days of captivity, 326 days of absolute anguish for them and uncertainty as they didn't know whether or not he was actually alive and whether he would ultimately return to Israel alive. Now, the hostage and family forum is noting the fact that his recovery is, quote, nothing short of miraculous, but they do also underscore this critical point, and that is to say that the majority of hostages who have been released so far alive from Gaza and those who could be released in the future happen through negotiated settlements. And so they note that while that Israeli military operations alone cannot free all of the remaining 104 hostages who were taken captive on October 7th and remain captive in Gaza, that will have to happen through a deal.

What can you tell us? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, thanks, Jim. Obviously it's great news for the family. It's great news for the state of Israel. Obviously, Israel is continuing to show that if they have actionable intelligence, they will go and get their hostages. But obviously, it reminds us how many families are still waiting for Sinwar to release the remaining of the hostages. And so, you know, it's great that Israel has the capability to do that if they have actionable intelligence to go and get hostages. But we have to eventually get to a deal and get Sinwar, put the pressure on Sinwar to release the remainder of the hostages.",

We were also able to walk from where the perimeter ended to this building to see how close it was.There were some interesting things that we learned. One was the parking lot that is next to this building was closed off the cars, but it wasn't closed off the people. So, people just walked in, right, and were able to get up to this fence line where the perimeter was. I mean, you're talking that it's a clear shot to the stage both from the perimeter and from the elevated position of that stage. I mean, it's just an outrageous failure by the Secret Service to have allowed this to not be in the perimeter or to not have it better guarded to keep people from the public. While we don't have direct evidence of it yet, Jim, I mean, it just appears to me there's no doubt that the shooter had known this facility had cased it maybe a day before, because he entered the roof on the farthest side of the building and then walked to the closest side of the structure closest to the stage. He had to know these buildings had the roof connecting. And the only way you can see that is from being on top. And so while we have not been provided evidence that he's done that, he had to have known that he jumped on an air handler, and that's how we got on to the building.",
