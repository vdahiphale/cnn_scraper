One, how he feels the prosecution is going to try to impeach his testimony, meaning try to make his testimony not credible. Try to show him as a not credible witness.You know, there are a number of things, including those things you identified, that perhaps the prosecution wants to raise, and the judge is going to weigh the probability of those issues versus the prejudicial effect they may have on the defendant. And that's the balancing test that the court is going to take into consideration when deciding how far the prosecution is going to be able to go on those prior acts. SIDNER:  Well, Trump's defense team, of course, has a plan as well. Perhaps the most crucial witness in this case is Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. He is a prosecution witness. He was the one facilitating the deals for Donald Trump in both of these cases with Stormy Daniels and the Playboy playmate.

They're going to go after him with everything they have.And that's why you saw -- you saw prosecutors asking the jurors -- potential jurors whether it's a like -- the difference between likability and believability. That goes right to Michael Cohen. Because they're worried that the jurors might not like Michael Cohen and they're going -- they've got to everything they can to make him believable, and that's going to be a really tough hill for the prosecutors to climb.",

And the reason -- the only reason they have felony charges is they're making an allegation that there was a campaign finance law that was broken and that that's why the business records were recorded the way they were recorded to cover that up.Well, that underlying crime or violation had never been charged. It wasn't brought by the FEC. The federal prosecutors never brought it. And remember, that's a federal crime at the end of the day. We're in state court.

He specializes in that. He co- founded, rather, a company called ZetX that can -- that basically is able to track a device and also solve complex cases. And they say that his testimony will prove that Kohberger's cellphone was not traveling east on the Moscow Pullman Highway the night of the murders and that they say that proves that his car could not have been caught on surveillance video on that same highway. Now, prosecutors contend that Kohberger's cellphone was in the area of the crime scene just hours after the murders. They also say his cellphone was around the house about 12 times starting in June of 2023 all the way up until his eventual arrest in December of 2023.

There was a letter that was sent dated April 15 from the top officials in Trump's campaign saying look, if you're going to use Trump's name, likeness, and image then we should get a chunk of that money that you raise using Trump's image. And they suggested at least five percent.And I say at least five percent because there is this interesting line in the letter that they sent, and let me read it for you now. It says, \"Any split that is higher than five percent will be seen favorably by the Republican National Committee and President Trump's campaign and is\" -- that information -- \"routinely reported to the highest levels of leadership within both organizations.\" The implication being if you give a little more than five percent maybe the former president will even know about it and maybe the top level of the RNC will know about it. So clearly, trying to encourage people to give even more. And look, the RNC is saying we need to do this because there are people who are putting Trump's name, claiming endorsements, putting pictures of him and of their candidates with family members, starting Trump memberships. This can be confusing for donors who think that they might be giving to a Trump-backed candidate or maybe even Trump themselves. And so they want to eliminate any confusion there. But obviously, this is coming at a time where Trump is in a tight race with President Biden in the -- and in a fundraising cash crunch.

JOE MANCHIN:  I don't know if it's desperate but it could be. I mean, I think there's a couple of things. Clearly, he's got a money problem. They're going to -- he's going to lose the money race. I think that is already clear. I think the other part to it that I think is maybe the more kind of controlling aspect of this -- I think the Trump campaign wants to know who is using his likeness and who isn't but for a particular reason. Essentially, who is on his team and who isn't? And so, if you think about this in terms of the entire country, especially in those key battlegrounds, you can almost -- you can almost kind of reverse engineer -- all right -- in some of the key races who is, like, leaning into Trump and who's running away. And that can help kind of shape their strategy. So I think it's bigger than just money because I think unless they're completely delusional they know they're going to lose the money race.

I mean, splicing border security away from foreign aid seems like the best possible option for him. And look, I have to remind folks Marjorie Taylor Greene is threatening to get rid of the speaker altogether. Why? Simply because he wants to put Ukraine aid on the floor. And we all know that Ukraine needs this money. This money has been helpful all along. And now if they don't get it, they don't have what they need to beat back Russian aggression. It's as simple as that. But again, you've got people like Marjorie Taylor Greene who want to blow it all up. And Speaker Johnson is showing that he's willing to lose his job if it just means to do the legislating. So I really admire it. I think this is a week in which there has been a bit of a win on the Republican side. And look, there have been a lot of us who say how does Speaker Johnson survive this without the Democrats' help?
