We start this hour with the President's son in more legal peril but this time the charges could land Hunter Biden in prison for up to 17 years that's if he's found guilty on nine new charges the Justice Department has brought forward. Three of them are felony counts.Special Counsel David Weiss is accusing Hunter Biden of million dollar tax evasion, tax fraud and more. The new charges add to the fallout from that collapsed plea deal that he struck with federal prosecutors that fell apart over the summer. Hunter Biden's attorneys say this: \"If Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden the charges in Delaware and now California would not have been brought. After five years of investigating with no new evidence and two years after Hunter paid his taxes back in full the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors.\" President Biden, we should point out, is not part of any of his son's charges. Let's break this down with CNN'S Paula Reid. Paul, the Special Counsel said that Hunter Biden had the money to pay his taxes but he spent it on other things which they spell out in great detail.",

      "sentences": "Yes. They go to great lengths to be extremely specific and really kind of embarrass Hunter Biden in a lot of ways by detailing what it was he was spending his money on during this time. They say he was spending it on \"drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short everything but his taxes.\"You can see he spent $600,000 on various women, hundreds of thousands of dollars on adult entertainment and 10s of thousands of dollars on rehab for drug and alcohol of course he has been very open about his substance abuse issues. Now, Hunter Biden did pay these taxes along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees and penalties and his lawyers have insisted that prosecutors here have bowed to political pressure to charge the President's son with something. Now, interestingly, Hunter appeared on Moby's podcast, now it's unclear when this was taped but it was definitely before the indictment was unsealed last night and he gave his first really in-depth public comments about how he's internalizing these investigations he's been facing for five or six years now. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, JOE BIDEN'S SON: They are trying to, in the - in their most illegitimate, way but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency. And so it's not about me, and their most base way, what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle.

      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly is. Marshall Cohen, thank you for that report.And with us now is Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. He recently co-authored an op-ed for the National Review, along with several other secretaries of state, talking about the need for both parties to help restore trust in American election systems. And to that point, Secretary, you just saw our exclusive reporting here that Chesebro is now cooperating with probes in Michigan and Wisconsin, already pleaded guilty, of course, to conspiracy in Georgia. Are these investigations and cases enough to put an end to election-related conspiracies and to rebuild public trust in elections? BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R) GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, I think it's incumbent upon all of us, both sides of the aisle, to stand up and give people the facts. And that's what we've been doing in Georgia since 2020. And I've been responding to people, giving them the facts. The big facts in Georgia, going back to 2020, is that 27,500 people approximately skipped the Presidential race and yet voted down ballot. And that's why you saw the Republican congressman get about 27,500 more votes than President Trump. And then also 33,000 Republicans that voted in the June 2020 primary never came back out to vote in the fall election. And that's why he came up short. It was as simple as that. But all the other allegations that were raised, we responded point by point at the time, even wrote a 10-page letter to Congress. But I think it's really important that we all stand up and give people the facts, but also look at how we can improve the process. And I know here in Georgia and the other states that joined me in that editorial have also been working. So such as having photo ID for absentee voting, it shores up security, but also has elevated confidence. And so after our 2022 race, both the MIT and UGA (ph) did a poll and they said over 90 percent of all Georgians is what they found, 90 percent of all Georgians really feel comfortable and have high confidence in the results of the Georgia election process. They may not like the results, but they do have confidence in the process that we have here in Georgia.",

Notably, several co-defendants in that case, including the former president have had very charged words for some of the witnesses on that list. You have been someone that has received all sorts of threats going back to the 2020 election, because of your taking a stand for democracy and essentially for repeating the truth that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election in Georgia.I'm wondering what you make of what you've seen lately from some of these co-defendants, including the former president himself, when it comes to attacking not only Fani Willis, but other witnesses in that case.",

      "sentences": "Well, as you know, you can make all sorts of allegations and say anything you want to on social media, but when you get to a court of law, you're going to have to prove facts and we have the facts. Also, when you write a letter to Congress, a 10-page letter like I did, and they got it on January 6, 2021, I wanted to make sure I did have the facts, and I've responded on every single point. Nothing has changed other than we found two more dead people, so now we're up to a total of four.But I understand that the Trump campaign paid for two reports, and those reports very early on gave him data that showed them that President Trump did come up short. They knew very early on that they had only identified less than 50 potential voters that actually had died and that people had assumed those identities. And we had found two, and now we've found two more, so up to four. That's it. But those types of allegations just never were proved out. They were just misinformation - disinformation. And the real problem with that also, people are losing sight of this, it's tearing our society apart. We live in polarized times, but let's deal with the facts. And when you lose, lose honorably, and then it's by all means, if you want to run again, there's nothing stopping you from doing that. But also, when you win, win graciously, too.

And if you look at whether it's political, military or business leadership, it's someone that can cast a positive vision and get things done. I'm at - I come from the engineering and construction background, and we build things. It takes maybe 18 months to 24 months to build a building. Now, if you want to, you can blow it up in over a weekend and everyone watch that on TV. But it takes time and energy to build things up. That's a positive force and Americans are positive people, and they're looking for a positive vision.And that's the kind of people we're looking to vote for next year. And I think that's what is really that - I guess, a lot, of excitement in both political parties right now. They're looking for that next generation leader. Is it a Lincoln? Is it a Reagan? Is it a Truman? Or is it an Eisenhower? What does that look like going forward? I think both parties that are casting are looking for positive, visionary leadership.",

And a prominent Penn alum is threatening to pull a $100 million donation unless the school's president steps down. Penn's board of trustees held an emergency meeting on Thursday about President Liz Magill, and the Wharton Board of Advisors is calling for her immediate resignation. Magill attempted to clarify her testimony in a social media post on Wednesday. And today, Harvard's president, Claudine Gay, apologized for her comments in an interview with the school's newspaper, actually published last night. It said, \"I'm sorry.\" And it said, \"Words matter.\" But those apologies may be too little, too late for a growing list of alumni, students, business leaders and politicians who want those leaders out.

They want to take their position on and espouse and talk about what their positions are on any particular subject. That's fine by me, but you cannot have hate speech. You cannot intimidate other students. You cannot make it so that the Jewish students are afraid to come out of their dorms and go to class.The Anti-Defamation League did a study recently of the Jewish students at colleges and universities across the country, and they found that 50 percent - more than 50 percent of the Jewish students were afraid to leave their dorms and go to class. They found that 75 percent of the Jewish students were either involved directly in - with anti- Semitism on campus or witnessed anti-Semitism on their campus. You cannot have that in America.

You've got to realize an inquiry is not an impeachment, and everyone should be - well, everyone should support something looking for open records and getting the facts out.
