Kataib Hezbollah issued a statement early Thursday, mourning the commander's death. The group is part of a broader movement backed by Iran that has carried out attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East. A drone strike in Jordan last month killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded dozens more. CNN's Elliott Gotkine is following developments for us. He joins us live from London. Good morning to Elliott. So, what more are you learning about this U.S. military strike that killed the man behind that deadly attack on U.S. forces in Jordan, and what might come next?",

And clearly, as this drone strike by the U.S. shows, it hasn't worked, the U.S. carrying out its precision strike on a moving SUV in a neighborhood of Baghdad, killing the commander. And also, according to the Iraqis, killing one other person as well, but no additional collateral damage, or other casualties that we are aware of in wake -- in the wake of that attack. Now, Iraq isn't too happy with it, it is once again as it referred to the previous strikes by the U.S. in Iraq and also in Syria as a violation of its sovereignty. It described this as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and said it was going to undermine the understandings between the United States and Iraq. And that comes at a very crucial time because the U.S. is soon due to start talks with Iraq about the future presence of U.S. forces in Iraq as its part of this U.S. led coalition against ISIS. So, there are a few unanswered questions about all of this, which is what more is the U.S. going to do in response to this attack on its outposts in Jordan on the killing of three U.S. soldiers? When will it decide that it has done enough and presumably, there will now be a response from Kataib Hezbollah, which could result in tit for tat strikes, and of course, the U.S. adamant that it doesn't want to see an escalation into a region that it is already pretty much on fire. But we don't know what this will result in. We don't know how it will impact U.S.-Iraqi relations, as I say, at a very delicate time when it's about to start talks about the future of its relationship and its presence in Iraq. But certainly, this is another part of America's response to the killing of those three U.S. soldiers. It says it's not the end. And that will just mean more strikes both on facilities belonging to Iran backed militias, and probably also on other leaders that it holds responsible, Rosemary.",

And so, there will be many questions around whether or not it applies to the president, whether or not holding office is the same as running for office.
