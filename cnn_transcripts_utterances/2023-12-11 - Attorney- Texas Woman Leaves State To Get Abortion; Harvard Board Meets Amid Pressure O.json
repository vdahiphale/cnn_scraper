Kate Cox, the pregnant woman from Texas to - who asked the court to allow an emergency abortion over medical issues, has left the state to obtain the procedure. That's according to a statement from her attorney.Now, Cox's fetus has a fatal condition and doctors have told her that continuing her pregnancy threatens her ability to have more children. The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked her from terminating that pregnancy. CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now live from Dallas. So Ed, what are we learning about her decision to leave?",

      "sentences": "Well, her lawyers say that because she has been caught in this \"legal limbo\" for the - specifically the last several days and much of the last week, that because of that, Kate Cox has decided to leave Texas and get the abortion elsewhere.Her lawyers are not saying exactly where she's going, but in the statement they did say that she had offers of help from places in Colorado, Kansas, even Canada as well. Let's get to some of the statement that her lawyers released just a short while ago where she's - where they said, \"Her health is on the line. She's been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer. This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people - they are not doctors. This is the result of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade, women are forced to beg for urgent health care in court.\" And that kind of echoes the theme that we've heard from lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights, the organization that has been representing Kate Cox here for the last week in her case. She - the lawyers had also said that for - throughout most of the last week, she has been asked several times why not just leave the state originally. Her lawyers had said that she wanted to have the procedure here in Texas. This is where her home is. She wanted to be close to family. But clearly, the - what has unfolded here in the last several days has changed that calculation, where we now have learned that Kate Cox has left Texas to get this abortion procedure done. We have reached out to the Attorney General's office, Republican Ken Paxton, who over the weekend issued or submitted another motion to the Texas Supreme Court saying that they did not believe that Kate Cox's condition rose to the level of reaching the medical exemption in Texas. And we have been waiting for the Texas Supreme Court to make its ruling since Friday night, but so far, no movement there legally. So obviously, this legal limbo is what lawyers say has forced Kate Cox to leave the state of Texas. Boris?",

It's not just a part of Kate Cox's case, but there's also a case involving 20 women and two doctors that is also sitting before the Texas Supreme Court as well, as these organizations and critics of the Texas abortion ban have been very critical of this, what they consider to be the vagueness of the medical exemption law and they say more clarity is needed in that.",

And when the baby could be considered viable outside the womb and then that even limits your options even more if you want to get an abortion, if your state doesn't allow that.Of course, Texas is one of the most strict on the books. And you have Ken Paxton, who is a lawyer, not a medical doctor, we should emphasize, he is arguing that this woman's situation does not fit the definition of life-threatening of Texas law and that her future fertility is not impacted anymore from this pregnancy with any other pregnancy. I mean, basically, he's saying just because this fetus has a life- threatening condition, that doesn't impact her future fertility more than any other pregnancy, even if it was normal. What do you say to that?",

If this woman's doctor is saying that carrying this likely - this pregnancy to term is threatening her future health, we need to take her doctor's word.Moreover, as an emergency physician, what worries me even more is all of the folks that are coming into emergency departments across the state of Texas and in other states with similar laws, who don't have the time to wait, who are literally facing life-threatening conditions, the physicians caring for them are being forced to go through the same legal rigmarole in order to care for the patients in front of them who are facing incredibly time-sensitive, life- threatening conditions. Again, not to say that Kate's case is not time-sensitive. Each week that passes puts her and the rest of her family more at risk. And if I can say one more thing here, it's that I get deeply worried about what would happen to the United States if folks had to travel outside of the U.S. in order to get this life-saving health care, because abortion is part of reproductive health care. Luckily, right now, there are places within the U.S. that Kate can travel to.",

She's obviously decided to travel outside the state.

Certainly the single case is upsetting and heartbreaking, but we already face one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world here in the United States. We already have millions of women nationwide who are living with limited access to high-quality obstetric care. That's part of the reason that we have such high maternal mortality rates.And we have studies showing already that these states that pass restrictive abortion laws are less likely to attract new OB-GYNs. So newly - new physicians are less likely to pursue their training in these states. So it's worsening that existing problem of lack of access to physicians. It is then going to continue to worsen maternal mortality rates, access to high-quality health care. It is just a really bad situation from a public health perspective. And, of course, it's a situation that's preventable if we just recognize that abortion is part of health care.",

To put it into context, Claudine Gay, has been under pressure to quit, along with the presidents of Penn, MIT, for their testimony last week to Congress. They failed to unequivocally say that calls for the genocide of Jews violate their school's code of conduct.On Saturday, Penn's president, Liz Magill, resigned. But on Sunday, Harvard faculty began circulating a letter declaring that the university should keep Gay and resist political pressures. More than 700 people have signed it so far, and they are not the only Harvard members now advocating for her as the university board is meeting today. CNN's Matt Egan joins us now with the latest. So Matt, who else is coming out in favor of Gay staying on as the Harvard president?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, last week there was this intense backlash against Harvard's leaders. We heard from donors, and CEOs and lawmakers demanding that Harvard cut ties with Claudine Gay. And now there has been this impressive show of support for Gay from within the Harvard community and it's building by the hour.Here's the latest, black alumni have gathered more than 800 signatures in support of Gay, arguing that no one understands better than her the need for Harvard to be against hate. And they point out that Claudine Gay is the daughter of Haitian immigrants. Now, we also have heard from the Harvard Alumni association's executive committee. They put out a statement of their own saying that Claudine Gay has their \"unanimous and unequivocal support.\" And saying they have full confidence in her leadership during this difficult time. And all of this is on top of the now more than 700 Harvard faculty members who are pleading with Harvard officials not to give in to political pressure by parting ways with Gay. And what's interesting is that some of the Harvard faculty members who are coming out in support of her, they've actually been quite critical, including Harvard legal scholar Laurence Tribe. He had slammed her testimony as deeply troubling, but now he's telling me that he signed this statement. He said, \"Once external pressures, whether from ultrawealthy donors or from politicians pursuing their ideological agendas, override the internal decision-making processes of universities, we are on the road to tyranny.\" So, Boris, will all of this be enough to save Claudine Gay's job? It's not clear yet. But what is clear is that, unlike Penn's Liz Magill, she does have a significant amount of internal support.",

They want this to be pushed till after the election. And if Trump wins the election, they don't believe that charges could be brought against him if he was a sitting president. So this is a part of a larger strategy and that's what we've seen.As Paula said, this could have taken months, and months and months had it gone through the appeals court, then up to the Supreme Court. Instead, they're saying, let's just cut to the chase and essentially calling their bluff, putting them on notice that they're going directly there to kind of cut out the middleman. And again, obviously, we don't know what that means. We don't know if the Supreme Court will even take it up. But it is definitely a - as you said - aggressive maneuver.",
