And that the move would also flood the Kherson region, potentially causing cooling issues at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The Kremlin, though, says it is all nonsense. Joining me now John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications. Good to see you this afternoon. We are going to get to Ukraine. But I want to get to new reporting from \"The Washington Post,\" details about some of the classified documents reportedly found, according to \"Post\" sources, during the FBI search in August. Specifically that one of those classified documents describe Iran's missile program.  Others had to do with China.  We know the DOJ thinks there could be more there. What is your level of concern this afternoon in terms of the potential exposure because of these documents and the exposure for the country's national security?",

This comes after the Russian ambassador said, you know, there's really not a channel open here. We have heard from Secretary of State Blinken, who said, \"Whenever the U.S. has something important to communicate to Russians, the U.S. will do it.\" Does a diplomatic channel remain open and how important is that?",

Even down to the fairly low operational level.We still have a de-confliction line set up in Europe so that we can properly de-conflict operations with respect to NATO's eastern flank with Russia. Of course, you saw today the secretary of defense spoke with his counterpart. The secretary of state still has an open line of communication with Foreign Minister Lavrov, if needed. Yes, there are many channels here at various levels throughout our government to continue to communicate with Russia. That's important, particularly now.  Particularly now when bellicose rhetoric by Mr. Putin about the potential use of nuclear weapons only could lead to confusion and miscalculations. So, yes, those channels are open. And as you saw this morning, we'll use them.",

So it is a bald fact.  It's out there.  And Iran can say what they want and so can Russia. But it's true.

It's the largest integrated delivery system for children in the United States.  We have tremendous capacity in terms of bed capacity for children.  We are seeing certainly another surge of RSV and plenty of influenza cases in the double-digit percent-wise. I would say 10 percent or more of our beds occupied by children with respiratory illnesses.  That is a big number for us.

We're used to seeing RSV cause severe respiratory illness in infants and young children in the winter, not in August, September and October.So, number one, what is unprecedented here is the seasonal variation has been turned upside down.  Number two, we're seeing kids hospitalized with rhino virus, the common cold.  That is really unheard of. We're seeing some other respiratory viruses that typically show up in late summer early fall. And most of our kids with respiratory illness are under the age of 2. We've got some older kids in with respiratory disease because they have underlying asthma. It is this unusual seasonal variation and this surge right now that's really unprecedented.  Why?  Well, I like the hypothesis that all those infection control strategies have been relaxed. Kids are back at school, back in daycare, in sports.  They are visiting with friends.  Nobody is wearing masks anymore.  People are not washing their hands as much. So we went for a couple years with really strict infection control strategies, which worked, works against COVID, worked against other respiratory viruses. Now here we are with this surging respiratory virus sort of milieu with no infection control strategies and with kids who have never seen these viruses before if they're under the age of 3.",

The children may present with respiratory distress, difficulty breathing.  And of course, that can and should be an alarm for any parent.  We can see this disease rapidly progress.  Children need attention quickly. We have plenty of diagnostic testing capacity.  Our emergency centers and urgent care centers are very busy. But we're doing all we can to see these patients, in person, virtually, at more than 100 care locations.  We're fortunate in that we can meet the demand. But as you highlighted, these symptoms can present acutely in a child, coupled with fever, persistently, and difficulty breathing, respiratory symptoms that can progress rapidly. And that's the main issue with respect to hospitalization.  We need to get the children diagnosed and get them to supportive care in the hospital, as needed, as quickly as possible.",
