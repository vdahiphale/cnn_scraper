You'll see areas highlighted in Orange, Dallas, bullseye, bringing in the threat for isolated tornadoes. Also, very large hail and damaging winds. Those are our biggest concerns today. And we're talking like golf ball size hail, if not larger, almost 2 inches in diameter. So take a look at the time frame on this. Sunday morning, rather, Sunday night, 07:00, here we are bringing in the chance for storms really starting to ramp up here. Dallas, you're seeing that back into southern Oklahoma, pushing into parts of Arkansas and Louisiana.

While former President Trump's aides, allies, advisers have all expressed concern that he might not get a fair trial if this actually does go to trial in Manhattan, given the political makeup of that borough.But we have talked to a number of sources who say that Trump's legal team is not considering asking for a change of venue to perhaps a more Republican friendly borough, but that they are just waiting to actually see that indictment, which they are expected to do on Tuesday at that arraignment before they make any decisions. But the messaging behind this, that this potential trial might not be fair, is really what we have heard from the former President for the last several days. He has painted this as a witch hunt, this indictment, this case. He has said that Alvin Bragg is linked to Democrats, linked to Joe Biden, that this is in some way a favor to Joe Biden. He has even gone after the judge who he is expected to appear in front of on Tuesday, saying that that judge hates him. And this is something that we haven't just heard from the former President, but also from many Republicans. And a lot of that is due to what we know the President is doing right now behind closed doors. He is making phone calls to allies across the country and on Capitol Hill. He is shoring up the support that he has ahead of this indictment. And I will tell you that the sources that I am talking to every day, they feel like it is working. They feel like they are having Republicans rally around them. Now, of course, the question still remains whether or not this will be politically helpful in a primary. Many of these Republicans believe it will be, but also in a general election. And that is just a big unknown right now.",

This shows you the power that Trump still has over his base and over the people who will be voting, perhaps in the Republican presidential nomination. Let's look at this for what it is. It is a deflection to try to discredit the prosecutor is merely a ploy to try to take attention away from the charges, which we'll hear more of in a few days against Donald Trump. This is a base political play for people who are still afraid of President Trump. Remarkable, isn't it? But you got to note that the staying power of Trump is proved time and time again.",

I think that the -- Trump does best when he is portrayed as a martyr, when he is portrayed as a victim, when he is portrayed as the subject of a witch hunt. This makes him more popular, more popular with his base. I would think the thing to watch for here in my analysis is whether or not anyone who's identified with Trump says, at the least, let the process unfold.Yes, nothing wrong with saying this is America, that you're innocent until presumed guilty. But that is different than saying that the prosecutor is on a witch hunt against Trump. And as we all know, and as you have discussed many times, you know, everyone knows this is just one of multiple investigations against Trump, federal and state level. So the -- I would just say the most important thing to see if he is weakened within the Republican Party base is if anyone who comes from his wing of the Trump supporting family says, let's at least see what the process is. Let this play out. Let's see what the evidence is. If they don't do that, then I think my analysis is that Trump's tank power may even get a little stronger if he's able to portray himself as a martyr.",

So the planning began then, which was a couple of weeks ago.But now that we have a schematic in place in terms of how we're going to manage the visit for Donald Trump to be arrested in relation to this indictment, we're going to lend deference to two specific instances. One would be the January 6 riots that occurred in Washington, D.C. We're going to view the After Action Review and see what went right and what went wrong. In addition to that, not too long ago, we had El Chapo that was contained here in Manhattan Federal Court.

CNN National Correspondent Dianne Gallagher is a Nashville with more.DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Amara, Victor, it is a somber Sunday on what has truly been a somber weekend here in Nashville as the community says goodbye to the victims of the shooting at The Covenant School on Monday. Amara, you were here and you saw just a number of people coming out to pay their respects. That number has grown exponentially with those who know the victims and those who have never met them, but are just moved by this tragedy, laying down balloons and flowers. But more often than not, it's stuffed animals, which is really just a reflection on where this happened, a grade school. And how young some of these victims are, their children. And one of those children, nine- year-old, Will Kinney will be laid to rest today. Here, his family, friends described him as someone with an unflappable spirit. Saying that nine-year-old was unfailingly kind, quick to laugh, always inclusive of others. He loved his sisters and adored his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and was always excited to host friends. His classmate at The Covenant School, nine-year-old, Hallie Scruggs, a funeral was held for her at Covenant Presbyterian Church on Saturday. Her father is the pastor at that church. Her aunt described her as incredibly smart and feisty enough to keep up with her three brothers. Her aunt said, that if she had had a daughter, that Hallie would have embodied all of the things that she would want in her own little girl. And just before Hallie was laid to rest, 61-year-old Cynthia Peak who, we're told, her friends' called Cindy was also laid to rest. One of the best friends, the governor said, of the first lady of Tennessee. She was a substitute teacher at the school that day. A native of Leesville, Louisiana. A state representative in Louisiana told us that he had known Cindy his whole life and that she was a great friend and a good person, and the entire community in Leesville is in mourning right now. Victor, Amara, the funerals continue through the midweek next week with Mike Hill, the custodian of the school and the headmaster, Katherine Koonce, being laid to rest through Wednesday.",
