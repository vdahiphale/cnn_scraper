Multiple sources tell CNN a convoy of 20 trucks, agreed to by Egypt, Israel and the U.S., is not expected to pass through the Rafah border crossing before Saturday. With aid groups warning of a dire situation in Gaza, any delay in humanitarian assistance will have devastating consequences. Israel is refusing to last supplies of food, medicine and fuel into Gaza until Hamas releases all the hostages currently being held. But Israeli officials say humanitarian aid crossing from Egypt will be allowed. At the same time, Israel appears to be closer than ever to launching a ground offensive, an all-out effort which Israeli officials say will bring an end to Hamas. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant met with troops in southern Israel on Thursday, telling them you see Gaza now from a distance, you will soon see it from the inside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): There is no forgiveness for this thing. Only total annihilation of Hamas organization, terror infrastructures, everything that has to do with terrorists and whoever sent them. It will take a week, it will take a month, it will take two months until we eliminate them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is his fundamental message. And he's also saying it is a threat to American national security. That is why the American people need to keep investing in America's security in this way. But as you say, it is a challenge, particularly with Ukraine, because the public support for funding Ukraine against this Russian invasion has been waning.We are now into the 20th month of this war in Ukraine. And so this funding is continuing to be debated. We're heading a poll just in August of this year that CNN conducted that 55 percent of Americans, over half, no longer think Congress should be supplying aid. to Ukraine. So clearly there is a battle there. And even with Israel, clearly public opinion is also not completely in agreement. This is a more current war, clearly a lot still developing on the ground. And yet only 35 percent are currently agreeing on the amount of U.S. assistance going into Israel. So it's a quite difficult sell. And then you put into the context of all the U.S. politics. There is a complete leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives as well. This is a very difficult situation for President Biden, and he wants to unify the American public as he sees this war in the Middle East escalating and also the war in Europe continuing to unfold.

Unfortunately, most of the hospitals, shelters, the schools of U.N. and also their clinics, the shelters that are used, the houses, they operate a majority of them and almost all the time on the generators because of unstable electricity.The fuel is needed for all of that, for the generators to operate. We are very concerned with the testimonies that we are seeing from people. I know that you have heard of the water crisis and that people are now drinking contaminated water or unclean water. And this is basically because most of the water that comes to Gaza, the fresh water that is normally used for drinking, is pumped through treatment units that are operating using fuel. And then we need the fuel to transport this fresh water to the population. And again, all of that is getting very, very complicated. Even us as a humanitarian organization with all our networks and connections, we were able to secure water. But the most important thing, the most biggest obstacle that we faced was how to transport it. The one liter of oil, of fuel now, is costing 50 shekels, which is around $15. And this makes it very, very expensive. The same is applied on the hospitals that are operating on generators. Doctors were explaining, U.N. agencies were explaining that this is a catastrophic situation where also the hospitals are becoming unfunctional, some of them already out of service. So this is the situation. Water and electricity being restructured and again in Gaza is an immediate need. So even if, for instance, humanitarian assistance is delivered today, tomorrow, and you know the high estimates of the need, the scale of the need by the U.N. agencies, they declared that we need at least 100 trucks per day. This will not solve the issue if we have water and electricity and fuel specifically to generate these two main important necessities, then the situation might look better. And when I say might look better, it does not mean like in an amazing way, but to allow for saving lives.",

What I can tell you as a humanitarian service provider and from my colleagues who live the same conditions and also from our partners, medical supplies, medical services suppliers, is that they are running out of fuel.So the problem now is to deal with the consequences for us to save lives, is to find out how we can secure fuel to continue providing medical services and water for not only wounded, but also those in patients like women, pregnant women. We have 50,000 pregnant women who are unable to access prenatal and postnatal services. We have patients who need dialysis services and they are unable to access these services. So the most important thing for us is to ensure that we have access to fuel for the hospitals and for the water treatment units that exist in Gaza.

The thing is, Joe Biden's of a different generation. He was probably the last American president, certainly the last American president to have been born during World War II, probably the last to have really dealt seriously with the Cold War.

The Pentagon reporting the US Navy Destroyer in the Red Sea has shot down cruise missiles possibly heading towards Israel. More details now from CNN's Oren Liebermann reporting from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: A US Navy Destroyer operating in the Red Sea intercepted three cruise missiles and a number of drones that the Pentagon says may have been heading towards Israel. And that indicates the potential opening of a new front, or at least a new actor, in what the US fears may become a growing regional conflict. According to the Pentagon on Thursday, Houthi forces in Yemen, and it's worth noting that Houthi forces are backed by Iran, launched the drones and the cruise missiles north along the Red Sea towards Israel. The USS Carney, a US Navy Destroyer in the Red Sea, intercepted those drones as the Pentagon promised it would continue to defend not only the US but also its interests and its partners. And this isn't the only region, or the only area in the Middle East, where we're seeing Iranian-backed back proxies potentially targeting US forces. There were a number of drone attacks in Iraq over the course of the past 48 or 72 hours, targeting US and coalition forces. And although the Pentagon hasn't given attribution or said who was responsible, they are similar to attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq carried out by Iranian-backed proxies there. This as the Biden administration and defense secretary Lloyd Austin are trying to keep the conflict in Gaza from spreading beyond the borders of the coastal enclave and into the rest of the Middle East. We've already seen protests at a number of US embassies in the region, and now, the interception of those drones and cruise missiles on the Red Sea, the attacks on US and coalition forces, defense secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart as well as with a number of Arab leaders to make the point first that the US would have Israel's back, and second that the US has placed an emphasis on the importance of safeguarding civilians. This, an attempt to try and alleviate perhaps some of the tension, some of the anger in the region. But even as the US has tried to keep this conflict from spreading to the region, that very much seems like a real possibility now. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
