The death toll is now more than 2,500 and aid from across the world is pouring in. The aftermath of this catastrophic -- of this is catastrophic. This was the strongest earthquake to hit that area in more than 100 years, and it struck while nearly everyone was asleep. Hundreds of people this hour are still believed to be trapped, massive high-rises reduced to rubble as more than 50 aftershocks, some as strong as 7.5.-magnitude, make matters even worse for rescue crews. One survivor capturing this horrific moment that the building collapsed, floor after floor falling as people run from a massive debris cloud. Nearby, another collapse. Look at this. And video of dramatic rescues are also coming in, this child pulled from the wreckage. Crews are now hoping to uncover more miracles in the rubble. CNN's Scott McLean will lead us off here. Scott, a massive rescue effort is under way now. What more are you learning about how that is going?",

So, this added on top of it is really incredibly tragic. Scott McLean, thank you so much for that. And let's get to more on this with Susan Hough. She is a seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey. So, Susan, thank you for being here. This was the strongest earthquake to be recorded in Turkey in more than 100 years. Did anyone in your line of work know that something like this was coming? SUSAN HOUGH, SEISMOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  No, there weren't any predictions that it was going to happen on any given day or even any given decade, but it's been known for a long time that Turkey is one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. And so it was very much foreseeable, even though it wasn't predicted, per se.",

So, to see a 7.5 after a 7.8 isn't unheard of at all. It's not likely that there's going to be another aftershock that big. But with a 7.8 main shock, you can have magnitude 6. 65. aftershocks. And that's as big as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, for example. That was 6.7. So, if one of those aftershocks happens to hit close to a population center, they very much are a continuing concern.",

And, also, as building codes improve, there's a problem of older structures that weren't built to modern codes. So there's a lot to sort out. In general, we can engineer buildings to withstand even severe shaking. California, where I'm from, we have had seismic provisions in the building codes going back 90 years after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake.

And airspace is restricted off the South Carolina coast as the Navy looks for more debris.A U.S. fighter jet shot down that balloon over the weekend in spectacular fashion. Critics say, though, the President Biden waited too long to order at the strike. The administration says, though, that it wanted to ensure that no Americans were on the ground and were in danger if they took that balloon down. And while the remnants of this Chinese balloon are being scooped up in the ocean, Beijing has admitted another one is flying over Latin America right now and that it is also theirs. We're covering the fallout from all of this with Dianne Gallagher, who is off the coast of South Carolina on a boat right now. And also with us at the White House is Phil Mattingly. I want to start with you, Dianne. Dianne, what can you tell us about this search effort? Have you been able to see anything from your vantage point off that South Carolina coast?",

      "sentences": "Look, Abby, you have certainly heard from Republicans who made very clear from the first time it was made public that this balloon was over the continental United States that they believed White House officials, that the president should have signed off on it being shut down immediately when it was over Montana.Now, White House officials have made very clear that the military leadership, Secretary Lloyd Austin, as well as Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had recommended, do not do that. The scale in terms of the debris would have put civilians in the risk or at risk of being in harm's way. And, therefore, they recommended waiting until it was over open water for the shoot-down, which is exactly what you saw on Saturday. But there's also, what we have heard from the administration, the fact that they believe that this has happened before, including in the last administration, during the Trump administration, where, at least three separate occasions, balloons were able to float over the continental United States. Now, White House officials have made clear that they will brief former Trump officials who say they don't have any knowledge of this, if they requested those briefings at some point in time. But I think the recognition to some degree is, this is becoming a very political issue, particularly on a very political week, with the president's State of the Union coming up. And White House officials believed that both on the decision-making in this process -- they believe they made the right choices, particularly now, as Dianne is laying out, that they believe they can collect a lot of the payload, a lot of the information that was as part of this because it landed in water, and not on land -- but also that they have some pushback in the fact that this was not the first time this has happened, and it wasn't just in this administration when balloons floated across the continental United States.",

And let's break all of this down even further with CNN military analyst retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. So, Colonel Leighton, based on what we know about when this balloon entered U.S. airspace, the path that it was taking coming down from Alaska, through Canada and down into the United States, was there an opening? Could it have been shot down earlier? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  I think so, Abby, but there are certain things that you have to consider when you when you look at this, because, for one thing, you have got this timeline right here. So, NORAD detected this on the 28th of January. And the president wasn't briefed until Tuesday the 31st. So, by that time, a lot of path -- the paths had been crossed right there. So let's go to Alaska, where the first sightings actually occurred. And there's some reporting that the balloon actually overflew Shemya Island, which is right here in the Aleutians. This particular island, it has a radar station associated with it. So that would have been the first installation that the balloon would have been able to take a look at from a surveillance perspective. And then the path was somewhere around this going up the Aleutians and possibly like this. We have an Air Force base right here. That Air Force base, Elmendorf Air Force Base, does have F-22s stationed right there. So, theoretically, they could have conducted that operation off of Alaska, but, by this time, the president hadn't even been briefed yet. '",

I mean, the Biden administration says that previous balloons have flown over the U.S. before, but the previous administration, the Trump administration, may not have been aware.How is that possible?

      "timeStamp": "13:15:15",
      "speaker": "LEIGHTON",
      "sentences": "Right.So let's take a look, first of all, at the different altitudes that all of these platforms can fly at. The F-22, which was the plane that shot down the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon, that flies at a maximum advertised ceiling of 50,000 feet. Now, we know it can go higher than that, because it was actually higher, at a higher altitude, about 58,000, when it actually shot the balloon down. But that gives you a basic idea that NASA flies at 100,000 feet for their scientific balloons. So we're getting into the stratosphere at this particular point in time. What the problem is, is that these types of devices cannot be picked up very easily in terms of radar traffic. So as things go floating through the United States, this basic path right here, which is what the balloon took, when it does that, it's not always possible for radar installations to pick these balloons up. And so that's why we need to fine-tune the radar. We also need to fine-tune the intelligence capabilities to recognize data streams that may be emanating from a balloon like this so that we can then figure out the command-and-control associated with it, and then track it that way as well.",

There is a supposition that maybe this was meant to embarrass the Biden administration ahead of the State of the Union by sending something up that was so public, it couldn't be ignored. But you could also surmise that, since previous balloon flights had been not really reacted to, not noticed publicly, that maybe China was pushing the boundaries. There's even analysis out there that the diplomatic side vs. the military side within the Chinese government are at odds, and while the diplomats wanted to smooth things over, the military remains more hawkish. And so they sent this balloon out to jettison any warming of relations. In either case, they're definitely going to be taking advantage of it, at least the hard-liners within China.",

So, planning that controlled release, that's going to happen at 3:30 Eastern today, according to officials. And here's what that's going to look like. The goal is to blast a small hole, about a three-inch hole, in the bottom of those five unstable railcars. And they're going to drain any chemical. In at least one of them, we're talking about vinyl chloride. It's a highly flammable substance. And what they're going to do is drain it into a trench built below each of these railcars, and those trenches are going to be lined with flares, the goal, to be able to control getting that chemical out and actually burning it off as it goes. They're also expanding their evacuation area. There are still real concerns about that possible explosion, that evacuation area now expanded up to two miles in at least one direction. So, they are concerned that people need to get out. They said they are still knocking on doors, trying to make sure people understand the danger and potentially what could be fatal for some people if there is a massive explosion and shrapnel could be shot in the air up to a mile in any direction, so still that concern.
