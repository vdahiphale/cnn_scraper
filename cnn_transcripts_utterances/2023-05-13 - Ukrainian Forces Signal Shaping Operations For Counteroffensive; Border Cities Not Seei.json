I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this hour with remarkable new insights into Ukraine's president and his desire to hit Russia on its home soil. Citing the recently leaked classified documents, the \"Washington Post\" says President Zelenskyy has suggested bold attacks behind closed doors including blowing up a pipeline and attempting to occupy Russian border villages to gain leverage over Moscow in talks. The \"Post\" points out the meetings where Zelenskyy made such suggestions happened months ago. Still, it says the Pentagon did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked materials. This comes as we're getting new signs that the long-awaited Ukrainian counter offensive could be getting underway soon. Sources tell CNN, Ukraine has begun shaping operations, and CNN's Sam Kiley has more details on that.",

A blizzard of disinformation being published particularly on video platforms. We've seen a counter attack going in around Bakhmut with significant gains made there by the Ukrainians after months of grinding warfare. And we've seen repeated statements from government officials here saying that an offensive is imminent. Now all of that is designed to wear upon the minds of the Russian soldiers. On top of that, of course, we've also seen longer range missiles used against the town of Luhansk with a number of people being reported to have been injured there. The Russians, of course, have counter attacked to some extent. They killed two recently in a bombardment of a town in the east of the country. But more broadly, we are seeing more of these longer-range attacks possibly involving Ukrainian-made or even ultimately British-made cruise missiles reaching behind the main frontline elements, going after the logistics chain and ultimately breaking that logistics chain is part of the effort to break the will of the Russian soldiers -- Jim.",

He just tweeted a short time ago, saying that he is now in Germany, and he posted on social media, quote, \"Already in Berlin. Weapons, powerful package, air defense, reconstruction, E.U. NATO security.\" Earlier he traveled to Italy to meet with the country's president, prime minister, and Pope Francis at the Vatican. After a 40-minute discussion with the Pope, Zelenskyy said he's grateful for his, quote, \"personal attention to the tragedy of millions of Ukrainians.\" Zelenskyy says he asked the Pope to condemn Russia's crimes in Ukraine arguing there could be no equality between victim and aggressor. Now to the U.S.-Mexico border, and images that will surprise many. Some border communities say they've yet to see the massive surge in migrants many were expecting. That's despite the end of Title 42, the pandemic-era policy that allowed for the quick expulsion of the migrants coming to the border. The long lines of people waiting to enter the U.S. they have appeared to have tapered off dramatically at least for the moment. The Biden administration is vowing tougher consequences for migrants who tried to enter the country illegally. U.S. officials fear the situation could still become a crisis with tens of thousands reportedly waiting in northern Mexico to cross into the U.S. Let's go to El Paso, Texas, right now, CNN's Polo Sandoval. Polo, there might be some cause for some cautious optimism here in terms of what we're seeing so far. What can you tell us?",

This is only the second time in the history of our country where we had someone die in custody. We all should be outraged with this. Once again not about the finger- pointing but just how do we protect people, regardless of their legal status? So I'm committed to doing that. I'm also working on legislation. I think work visas makes a lot of sense. And you'll see kind of me build a coalition, if you will, of folks that want to tackle that. But I need the White House's help.

I mean, you know, these people that are coming over, they shouldn't be political pawns, if you will, but they need to get their day in court and if they do not qualify for asylum because many of them don't, they're here for economic purposes, they're not seeking asylum. I also think, what about the people that are fleeing political and religious persecution? Those folks that do have legal claims are getting roped up in this as well.

And he also referenced those clashes down in Charlottesville which was really one of the animating forces that made Joe Biden run for president back in 2020.

Analysts are predicting a tight race between Erdogan and the main opposition candidate. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote, it would trigger a second runoff election later this month. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has more on the impact that this election could have on the world stage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Turkey closed down this waterway to Russian warships when the war in Ukraine started and it is through here at the Bosphorus Strait that Ukrainian grain now flows to the world. It was Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ultimate balancing act, a stand some describe as pro-Ukrainian without being anti-Russian that allowed him to play mediator and helped broker a key grain deal between Turkey's warring Black Sea neighbors allowing Ukrainian grain exports and helping to avert a global hunger crisis. Over the years, Turkish foreign policy has come to resemble the country's president. It is combative with a personal touch. Erdogan has carved out a central role for himself and his country on the world stage. He meted out soft power with Turkish soap operas and launched a spree of diplomatic missions in capitals long ignored by the West. Erdogan backed that with large investments in a growing defense industry that's made Turkey one of the world's top drone manufacturers. This key NATO member has had an uneasy alliance with its Western partners. Erdogan's leveraged NATO membership for domestically important issues, most recently, he has held up Sweden's accession to NATO in an attempt to secure cooperation from the Nordic nation on groups Turkey considers terrorists. Turkey's ongoing economic crisis has forced some diplomatic U-turns that were once unthinkable. Erdogan mended ties with oil rich regional foes, bringing in billions of dollars of investment and much needed hard currency. Turkish foreign policy under Erdogan has been full of dramatic twists and turns, crises that may at times have been exacerbated by the President's personality. But at the heart of these disagreements with allies are national interests that will remain unchanged, no matter who emerges victorious in these most consequential of elections for a country that wields power and influence far beyond its borders.

That's because Twitter instituted massive layoffs when Elon Musk took over, around 80 percent of its workforce and the hiring of Yaccarino, an ad sales executive is a clear sign that Elon Musk recognizes that Twitter is at its core, an advertising company, right?You know, when Elon Musk took over, the financials of the company, we don't know as much about it, but when he took it over, around 90 percent of its revenue came from advertising. That's what most social media sites like Facebook and Google have similar business models. Well, there was an advertising -- you know, a fleeing of advertisers when Elon Musk took over and so now, it will be Linda Yaccarino's job to woo those advertisers back into the site.",

How do we get our employees better positioned to work on the grill, make great food, make it fast, accurate?

The Phoenix Mercury star received a standing ovation during her much anticipated return to the WNBA last night. Griner, of course, missed the entire 2022 season while she was detained in Russia. She finished with 10 points and three rebounds in the preseason game against the LA Sparks. Afterwards, she said she felt a little bit rusty, but was just happy to be there. We were happy to see you there as well. A heavy penalty to pay for two men who admitted to cheating during a fishing tournament by stuffing lead weights into their fish. An Ohio judge sentenced the men to 10 days in jail and their fishing licenses are suspended for three years. They must forfeit their boat worth about $130,000.00. Wow. Each man must pay a $2,500.00 fine as well. If the fishermen had not been caught tipping the scales at last September's competition, their prize would have been worth nearly $30,000.00.
