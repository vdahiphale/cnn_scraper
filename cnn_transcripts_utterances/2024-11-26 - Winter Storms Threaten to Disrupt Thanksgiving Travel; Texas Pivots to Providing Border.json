If you look behind us, yes, we're known for the airport here in Atlanta, but traffic through Metro Atlanta is always a big deal.And guess what, somewhere, somebody's drinking some coffee, getting ready to hit the road today. We know from AAA, they expect 71.1 million travelers hit the roads. And, John, I know you're already asking, how much more is that than last year? It's 1.3 more million drivers than last year. And, in fact, the good news for those who are getting ready to hit the road, gas prices are down from last year this time. It's about an average of $3.07. And as we were talking to people yesterday, they felt that impact. They feel like, look, sometimes they can't afford those expensive air flights with their family of four, so they want to get in the car and make that trip maybe to grandma's house for some turkey time. We know we've been talking to AAA as well. They tell us this is one of those years, they want people to pay attention to the roads in front of them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There has been one through line over the course of the Biden administration, and that has been the ongoing feud between President Biden and Texas Governor Greg Abbott over the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. But now, with Donald Trump in the White House, it's going to be a markedly different relationship and one where the state of Texas is now serving as a blueprint for Trump's immigration plans.Now, we'll get a preview of what that's going to look like later today when the incoming border czar, Tom Homan, joins Abbott along the border to deliver remarks, and he gave a sense of what exactly he'll be saying in an interview with Fox this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM HOMAN, BORDER CZAR FOR PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP:  We're not waiting to January 20th. We're already planning what we're going to do to lock down the state of Texas. Congress needs to change the asylum laws, but I'm not counting that to happen. So, President Trump's got to come in with executive orders, like he did the first time.

That included the buses of migrants to those Democratic-led cities blocking a part of the border for two federal agents and those buoys along the Rio Grande.Now, all of that led to lawsuits by the Justice Department against the state of Texas. But now this is going to be a White House, the Trump White House, that's going to welcome these moves. Sources tell me that the Trump team is planning how states are expected to coordinate with federal law enforcement when it comes to border security, and they're using the state of Texas to build that road map. Now, in addition to all of that, Donald Trump is also weighing the Texas border czar, Michael Banks, to join his administration potentially as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So, that alone gives you a sense of how different it's going to be under the incoming administration. But, again, Kate, the bottom line here is that a relationship that has been quite fraught over the last three years here at the White House between Texas is about to evolve significantly, to be one where the White House embraces what Texas is doing and expects the same of other states along the border.",

Currently, the coverage is to cover these medications specifically for people who have certain chronic conditions, like diabetes. But with this change, it would include anyone with obesity, whether they have a diabetes diagnosis or not, they will get coverage under this proposal.And like you said, this would potentially impact millions of people out there. We know these medications come with a cost of about $1,000 a month without coverage. So, this could save people a lot of money out of pocket. Now, what's interesting here, though, John, this proposal is coming towards the end of Biden's term. So, how quickly will this proposal be finalized, we have to wait to see. It could run up against January, which means, to be finalized, it may have to rely on the Trump administration to finalize it. So, we could see politics come into play here because we don't know what the timeline is exactly. But we do know there are many patients out there who could potentially be excited by this proposed rule.",

But what's new there is probably not very much and that we have seen the shape of both of these cases against Donald Trump. We've seen them in court. We've read a lot of documents about the evidence that the prosecutors have. And so all of that is going to be compiled.But what the Justice Department did yesterday is something for the history books, John. It is the end of the two federal criminal cases against Donald Trump, which were both filed against him last year in courts in D.C. and Florida. Specifically, the reason is that you can't prosecute a president. That is what the Justice Department decided, not only within the office special counsel, but they also got the department to set some policy here. They also say that the cases themselves didn't change, but the circumstances had here. So, the government still backs up what they said in court in trying to bring these indictments against Donald Trump, trying to take him to trial. But now that he's going to be inaugurated the president in January, that is the circumstance that has changed that makes it impossible to continue a case against him. Special Counsel Jack Smith wrote in the filing asking to dismiss the January 6th case. The department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated. And the judge signed off on it pretty quickly.",
