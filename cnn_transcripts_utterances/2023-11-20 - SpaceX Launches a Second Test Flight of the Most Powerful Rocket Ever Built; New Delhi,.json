      "sentences": "Engineers at SpaceX will spend the next several days and weeks pouring over all of this data,trying to figure out what exactly went wrong. But this is what SpaceX likes to do. They like to push their rockets and their spacecrafts all the way to the point of failure, because that`s how they learn. They`ve done that with all of their older, successful rockets and spacecrafts, and now they`re trying to do it with Starship, the biggest, most powerful rocket to ever fly. And someday, the ultimate goal is for this rocket to allow and carry up to 100 humans to the surface of Mars and ultimately colonize Mars and make humanity multi-planetary. That`s the goal. But first, SpaceX has to get this thing up into orbit. And the test flight on Saturday was a success in that 33 engines did fire, all of them. The launch pad survived. There was successful stage separation between the booster and the spacecraft on top. And it did make it up far past where it flew on its first failed flight test back in April. It made it all the way up to the edge of space. But then something happened, and that`s why this test flight was also a failure. There were two explosions. Both the booster and the spacecraft exploded after separating, and the spacecraft, if all had gone according to plan, was supposed to make almost a complete lap of planet Earth and then splash down in the Pacific Ocean. That is what`s characterized as a mishap by the FAA. They are now investigating a mishap with SpaceX. It`s an investigation that SpaceX will lead, but it`s now unclear exactly how long that will take before SpaceX is given the green light to fly again. But NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, who needs the Starship spacecraft in order to land NASA astronauts on the surface of the moon as part of its Artemis program, congratulated SpaceX yesterday and said that Saturday`s test flight was a sign of real progress.

Primary schools were forced to close. Road traffic was restricted and construction was put on hold because of a dense smog over New Delhi. CNN`s Vedika Sud has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "What you see around me is a thick, dense layer of pollution. The air outside is so toxic that even with a mask on, I cantaste it. If you`re out for too long, the eyes begin to burn and the throat hurts. Around this time, every year, this smog shrouds India`s capital city obscuring the skyline and putting more than 20 million people at risk. On a bad day, New Delhi`s pollution levels are nearly 80 times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. So why is Delhi one of the most polluted cities in the world? One major factor is crop burning, which can be better understood from above. Satellite images shared by NASA show thousands of fire set by farmers over the last few weeks in Delhi`s neighboring states. They do this annually to clear the fields after harvest for the next year`s crops. That`s from roads and construction sites, vehicle emissions and industrial pollution are also major contributors to Delhi`s toxic care. As winter approaches, the cold air acts as a blanket covering the ground trapping air pollutants. And as for the geography, deli is a landlord city, limiting options to flush out polluted air. With multiple causes and no one solution, this pollution crisis will not be easy to solve. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

When threatened sick or old, these jellyfish start to createyounger versions of themselves that will grow up into an adult identical version. I`m a little bit jellous. how about you? Well, a jellyfish boom is now happening in the U.K. and Ireland, according to the Marine Conservation Society, we asked its data expert Angus Jackson, to explain the why. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "There`s a jellyfish boom in the U.K. and Ireland, according to a new report. The Marine conservation society has revealed a32% increase in jellyfish sightings compared to last year. The charity`s annual report is based on data sent in by the public. Those sightings are then analyzed for interesting patterns, such as changes in species or long- term trends in population sizes. So what`s behind the rise of jellyfish sightings? DR. ANGUS JACKSON, SEASEARCH DATA OFFICER: As waters warm in springtime, jellyfish start to grow and reproduce. And when the conditions are really good, when the water`s warm, when there`s lots of food available, that reproduction can happen really very, very quickly. Under those conditions, the numbers of jellyfish at sea can get to be very large. If that coincide with storms or onshore winds, these blooms of jellyfish are blown in towards the coast where they accumulate and appear even more dense. If the public happened to be there at that time, that`s when there are more and more observations.",
