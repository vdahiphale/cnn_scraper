The judge says May 24th, 2024 will be the date, which essentially split the difference between the timelines that both sides wanted. Special Counsel Jack Smith wanted a lot sooner. Trump wanted a lot later. He wanted after the election. CNN senior law legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid leads us off this hour. So Paula tell us how the judge got to this date. I mean, what did she say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, I was in court on Tuesday down in Florida when all of this was being argued back and forth. And it's clear, right now the central conflict in this case is about timing. Defense attorneys argued that it would be quote, unfair to hold this trial before the 2024 election, and they insisted that it was too early to even set a date.But on the other side of the room, prosecutors insisted they wanted a quote, speedy trial. They were asking for a December trial date. And they said, look, it doesn't matter if Trump is the candidate, they believe he should be treated like any other important busy person, and this should proceed swiftly. So here, the judge, like you said, she basically split the difference. She set a trial date for May 2024. But it is highly likely that that is probably going to slide, why, well also included in her order is a very detailed schedule of everything the lawyers need to do between now and the trial. Rahel, there are over 30 individual items that are listed in that schedule. And it is likely as in any case that a few of those are probably going to be delayed, and you have one deadline slide then they all slide a few more. And then you start to get into a really critical period in the months and weeks ahead of the election. And it's unclear if even the Justice Department would want to hold a criminal trial if someone who is expected to be the Republican candidate for the presidency, so close to the election. Historically, they have sort of tried to mostly err on the side of caution, not taking action that could impact the outcome of an election. While the trial date is of course up to the judge, the larger question of whether they want to hold a trial if this gets delayed into August, September, October, DOJ would need to weigh in there. And if that is something that they tried to do, you can bet the Trump attorneys would try to appeal that likely all the way to the Supreme Court.",

We know that there's going to be a March 2024 trial that has been set by Judge Merchan in the Manhattan case for document falsification to cover up alleged 2016 election interference.If this trial date slips, which it certainly could, Jack Smith, like a chess player, has already started to make another move. And that is he's signaled in his target letter that he's going to bring charges most likely in the District of Columbia for 2020 election interference. So if the Mar-a-Lago documents case slips, he's going to be pushing for that other case to go before the likely before the Republican convention in July 2024. So I do think we'll see a serious effort at, at least two criminal trials of Donald Trump, totally unprecedented in a political season.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's no formal coordination. These are four completely different courts, assuming that the two cases that are on file are joined by the Federal and State cases that seem to be looming for the 2020 alleged election interference. But what will happen is there's a little bit of first in first out. Judge Merchan in Manhattan has that March 2024 trial date. He's signaled he's going to hang on to that. That's a simple case about document falsification that should be able to go. And then probably what we'll see is the Jack Smith federal election interference case, will get a trial date over the course of the next year if he follows through on his target letter. So that'll be kind of trailing the Mar-a-Lago case. If the Mar-a-Lago documents case goes to trial, I don't think we're going to see in the course of the next 12 months, three trials, if Fani Willis brings her Georgia State election interference case, that is reported to be possibly a very large sweeping case on how the election interference nationally hit Georgia, that will likely wait for 2025.And Rahel, it's important to note that unlike the federal cases, if Trump wins, he could try to pardon himself. He could order DOJ to drop them. The state cases are not subject to his pardon power. So that Georgia case really can wait for 2025 as kind of an insurance policy for those who believe there should be judicial accountability for the alleged election interference.",

STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENTAs someone who grew up in the Bay Area, I always thought it was kind of cool for just us locals when he found out the whole world love that song too. But he had such a massive catalog. The man won 19 Grammys plus a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Recording Academy, let alone two Emmys as well. And he said that his focus was really to just focus on the classic to perform for the entire family. And there was a time where that wasn't in favor. People weren't feeling his music as much. But then he came back when MTV had a special with him and then performing with Lady Gaga. All of this helping to just create a very long legacy for a man who even after having Alzheimer's in 1996, being diagnosed with it, still continued to perform. His wife saying that once the music would start, he would just kick right back in and he was the old Tony Bennett once again, performing those songs even performing with Lady Gaga for his 95th birthday, those turning out to be his final performances there. But beyond the fact that he was just a wonderful musician, it's also important to remember that this was a man who fought in World War II and then was so moved by what was happening with the Civil Rights Movement here in the United States. And in 1965, he was marching in Selma with Martin Luther King Jr. and Harry Belafonte. You can see him there in those pictures. He was also an acclaimed painter as well. So when you look at Tony Bennett's full life, the man lived enough lives for several people all in one life. And the one thing he said that he wanted to be known for, was being a nice person.",
