We'll hear from the young witnesses and survivors.Plus, at least three states in the northeast are deploying drone detection systems, while the White House says more than 5,000 tips showed no threat to the public. And CNN's K-File found that Donald Trump's pick for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spread baseless conspiracy theories about the January 6th attack on the Capitol and the 2020 election. Good morning. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. School shooting in Wisconsin has shattered the community in Madison just before the holidays and police are scrambling to understand why it happened. A teenage student opened fire at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison. One student and a teacher are dead. Six people are injured, including two students who are in critical condition this morning. Two others are in stable condition. Adding to the horror, it was a second grade student, a second grade student who had to make the call to 911. And in an unusual twist, police say the killer was a 15-year-old girl. She was a student at the school named Natalie Rupnow. She went by the name Samantha. Police say she shot herself and later died. Today, children and adults at the school bear the scars of what they witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADLER JEAN-CHARLES, SIXTH GRADER:  We heard them and then some people started crying. And then we just waited until the police came. And then they escorted us out to the church. I was scared. Why did they do that? Why?",

MARK POCAN (D-WI):  Yes, it's unbelievable. You know, you can't even sometimes think it's actually happening until it happens, I guess, in your backyard. I've sat through so many moments of silence on the floor of Congress that are followed by zero moments of action. This is the over 80th school shooting this year, 480th mass shooting in this country this year alone. And to have it happen in your backyard and they have to hear second graders calling it in and you hear the children talking like they are right now, this is uniquely a United States problem and we need to address it much more rapidly than we are.",

And we have so many guns, and it's become so accepted and so commonplace that Congress won't act. And we need to be more upset about this.This many shootings in the United States, it's uniquely -- we're number one and it's not something you want to be number one in. It's so bad Jim, that, you know, we even had some media today that we originally were going to do and canceled. And they said, oh, it got downgraded to only two deaths. If that is the societal response, we are screwed. We have to do more as a society. We have to be more outraged that you drop your kid off to a school and you're not sure they're going to be safe. That's completely unacceptable, and we all need to speak out much louder.",

And we have to have some accountability for our elected officials at the state and federal level.But, you know, we need to talk about this more as the unique problem it is in our country. And there's no reason if other countries don't have this problem, we're doing something wrong and we got to figure out what that is. And we can't wait until there's the 90th and the 100th school shooting because this is just nothing anyone should ever have to go through and no community should have to go through this.",

It is about it, as a society, why are we not more outraged that there are this many mass shootings, this many school shootings, killing kids that you can't be guaranteed the safety of your kid if you drop them off because of our unique problem?So, I think that's the real issue, Jim, and I just hope that we start to accept that sooner than later in this country.",

So, this runs consistent with that demographic. But when we look to a shooting of this magnitude or the school shootings, there's a significant component that's missing, and that would be a programmatic review, because in Wisconsin, they have a tip line. So, if someone believes that they were the subject of bullying and harassment, they can call this tip line.Bullying and harassment are the number one complaints that come into this tip line. So, when I speak to a programmatic review, there should be an assessment done of who calls and what was the actual act that occurred. And then the reassessment is very important because oftentimes when we see a fight between two students, a teacher or a resource officer breaks up the fight and both parties go their separate ways, worst case scenario, there may be a suspension or they may call the parents, but that programmatic review would continually reassess to see if, in fact, this behavior continues. Because we no longer just have to monitor the assailant, but the victim as well, because in many of these cases, it's the victims that perpetuate the violence.",

Multiple government agencies released a joint statement yesterday saying they've reviewed thousands of tips and that there is nothing to suggest at this point that the aircraft posed any kind of national security or public safety threat.Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California. Congressman, thanks so much for making time for us. We appreciate it. What is your sense of it right now? Do you agree with that assessment coming out of the White House that, yes, there are a lot of these drones, people might be concerned about them, but they don't pose a threat? REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  Well, I think this should have come a lot sooner, frankly, Jim. The American people are trusting people and they want, you know, to believe the best in their government. But when it seems like they're not getting the complete picture, that's when, you know, speculation, misinformation and disinformation can fill a void. So, if these are airplanes, helicopters, law enforcement drones and personal commercial drones, that's great. Just tell the American people that. And I think the failure here has led to all of this speculation. One other issue, and I'm working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues on this, is that if there are drones that pose a threat to public safety or national security, law enforcement right now don't have many authorities to take them out. And we need to change that so that they can move more quickly when there is an actual threat. And you're seeing bipartisan consensus on that, and I hope we can fix that soon.",
