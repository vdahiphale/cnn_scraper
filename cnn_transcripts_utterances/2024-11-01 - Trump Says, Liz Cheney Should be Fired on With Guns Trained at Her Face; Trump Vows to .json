We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. And just moments ago, a Trump campaign spokeswoman said this in a statement, President Trump was clearly explaining that warmongers like Liz Cheney, these are her words are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them rather than go into combat themselves.My first guest to talk about this, this morning, is Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. You and I've had many discussions about this campaign, so I appreciate coming on here right before Election Day. I have to ask you about this violent language that Trump is using against Liz Cheney, talking about having guns trained on her face. Do you approve of that kind of rhetoric? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  Well, clearly, President Trump was talking about how she's quick to get American troops into war and young people die, and yet she's not facing any of that. That's clearly what he was stating. And any other thoughts on that would be a misstatement, obviously. He was not calling for her assassination or anything like that. It was clearly saying if she wanted to go to war, then she ought to be out there on the lines. And so she the Cheney family has profited greatly from American Wars. I'm sitting in front of a 48-star flag that was on my uncle's casket in the Second World War. My dad fought the Japanese. My mama lost her oldest brother fighting the Nazis.

And they don't want to lose their races. They don't want to lose their finances, whatever it is. And it's just -- to me, it is completely counter to the system of government, literally, that our founding fathers started up, which says that there are three branches of government, and the responsibility of legislators on Capitol Hill is to be a check and balance on the executive branch and on the president, no matter who it is. So, I just -- it's a loyalty test. They're scared to fail it. And what happened to Liz Cheney is a perfect example, that he is making an example of her to the rest of the Republicans, that if you go against me, even on grounds of merit, I will come for you and I will make your life literally less safe.
