Of course, investors are looking for a rebound after Wednesday's selloff sent the Dow plunging almost 650 points. The markets had expected a more convincing showing from the Republicans on Tuesday and so as you can see, reacted negatively to that indecision that now hangs over control of Congress.Now with the midterms behind them, investors are returning their focus to the economy. Polls showed that it was the number one concern for voters heading into the elections understandably. Central to that, the latest U.S. inflation figures that come out today and the annual inflation in the U.S. at about 8 percent. If today's figures show the economy is still overheated, the Federal Reserve could come back with another aggressive rate hike. A series of earlier rate hikes is reflected in the rising cost of consumer debt. The average credit card is now charging just over 19 percent annual interest. The highest rate since 1985. If Republicans do retake control of either the House or the Senate or both, come January it could greatly complicate the Biden administration's ability to pursue its legislative agenda. Even so, the White House Chief of Staff says President Biden will continue to reach out to Republicans in the meantime to try and get as much done as possible by the end of the year. Take a listen.

They've just claimed in the last hour, they've just claimed taking a village that's to the south of Kherson, in the Mykolaiv region. Right on the road, on the path to Kherson city itself.But don't expect everything to change overnight here, Max. As you said, President Zelenskyy says he's going to proceed cautiously. In his nightly address he said the enemy does not give us gifts. Meaning that he's worried that this is potentially a trap to lure Ukrainian forces into the city of Kherson. And yes, again a huge defeat. A huge loss here for President Putin. But in some ways not surprising, Max. We had seen signs now for weeks that Russia was struggling to hold on to this very important strategic city. There were less Russian checkpoints. Less of a Russian presence in the city. They been evacuated -- evacuating rather, tens of thousands of people forcing them out of their homes. And already Ukrainian officials say they are seeing movement on the ground. Russian forces are withdrawing from some of the front line villages. They are also blowing up the bridges all along the Dnipro River. Remember, the plan here is, the orders here are that Russian forces pull away from the west bank across the river into the east side and fortify those positions there. Now there's questions about what the state of Kherson will be once they pull out if they pull out. Will they booby trap it? Will they plant mines? That's, again, why everybody is proceeding with caution here in Ukraine. But just take a look at the overall picture. I me, for weeks now President Putin has been losing to this very successful Ukrainian counteroffensive. Now having to concede the one and only regional capital Russian forces were able to take since the start of this invasion in February. And it was just a few weeks ago, Max, that President Putin was in this glitzy ceremony signing a decree that Kherson belonged to Russia, illegally annexing it, and now having to pull that back, having to withdraw. I think the only word you can think of here is humiliation. This is absolutely humiliating for Russia. OK, Salma in Kyiv. Thank you very much indeed. Interesting to see how that develops.",
