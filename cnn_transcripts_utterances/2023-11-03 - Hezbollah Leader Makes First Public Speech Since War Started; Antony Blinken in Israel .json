The head of Hezbollah says Hamas's attacks on Israel October the 7th where 100 percent Palestinian planned and executed. Hassan Nasrallah still speaking. He is addressing crowds in a recorded speech live in Beirut, or certainly being broadcast live in Beirut by video. These are his first comments since the Israel-Hamas war started, addressing speculation about whether the Iran-backed faction was involved in these attacks. This speech being watched very closely amid fears that the stepped-up skirmishes that we are seeing between Israel and militants along the Lebanese border could turn into a new front. CNN's Ben Wedeman has been listening in from Beirut. There are crowds of people around this region watching in squares, waiting to hear what Hassan Nasrallah has to say. He is still speaking, Ben. To date, what has he said that was notable, and perhaps, what has he not said at this point?",

I'm interested to hear what you think of the tone of the speech as well, so we'll catch up with you a little later in the show. Thank you, Ben. Well, more now on the U.S. secretary of state's visit to Israel. Antony Blinken addressing reporters just moments ago after meeting with Israeli leaders. He emphasized Israel's right to defend itself while describing in vivid detail images he's seen today provided by Israel's government of the Hamas massacre of October the 7th that showed terrorists killing an Israeli father as his young children looked on. Blinken also says Israel must do more to keep civilians and Gaza safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. We have been clear that as Israel conducts this campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters. It matters because it's the right and lawful thing to do. It matters because failure to do so plays into the hands of Hamas and other terror groups. There will be no partners for peace if they are consumed by humanitarian catastrophe and alienated by any perceived indifference to their plight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's a real risk and concern here around the region. A diplomatic source says Jordan's foreign minister will demand an immediate cease fire. Well, inside Gaza, another night of intense aerial bombardments. Israel's military says its ground forces are destroying Hamas infrastructure above and below ground, and have encircled Gaza City. And the slow but steady evacuation of foreign nationals from Gaza continues to the south. An Egyptian border official tells us more than 350 have arrived in Egypt through the Rafah Border Crossing. Today it feels like about 400 is capacity at this point. Of course we will continue to see those evacuations in the days to come. CNN correspondent Gustavo Valdes is in Tel Aviv. Let's concentrate on what we've heard from Antony Blinken today. He's got two messages, reaffirming support for Israel's right to self-defense and a warning about how it goes about that. We also know he'll push Israel for a pause in airstrikes in Gaza to allow for mediation. What have we heard from Blinken and the Israelis in response to that message?",

Diplomatic sources telling me earlier on the call will be for a period of pause during which the mediators working on negotiating the release of these prisoners can work through a process that might get those talks across the line. This is about a period of pause, military pause, to try and affect the release of these hostages followed, as I understand, by a further pause if indeed they can get these hostages out. Of course any pause in military action will help enormously. On the ground, as far as humanitarian supplies and access is concerned. Thank, you sir. And Emirati official has called for diplomatic efforts and cooperation to be stepped up to try to make sure the Israel-Hamas war does not spread to other countries. That is a message which is being echoed around this region. Noura Al-Kaabi, a UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told a conference in Abu Dhabi extremists could take advantage of the conflict, potentially leading to more violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NOURA AL-KAABI, UAE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS: The risk of regional spillover and further escalation is real, as is the risk that extremist groups will take advantage of the situation to advance ideologies that will keep us locked in cycles of violence.

Well, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains dire. A doctor at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital says low fuel stocks have plunged wards into darkness and cut off major basic functions like oxygen generation. Another doctor says the hospital will turn into a mass grave without more electricity. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent reports at least 21 people, mostly women and children were injured from shattered glass and falling ceilings when Israeli airstrikes hit near the Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City. This facility provides shelter to 14,000 displaced people, according to the hospital's director. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.

And there's been no comment from the Israeli Defense Forces and CNN was not able to independently confirm the source of the blast. Palestinian TV has not released any evidence linking it directly to the Israeli military. Since the start of the current conflict, though, 36 journalists have lost their lives. A statement by the Committee to Protect Journalists says 31 of them were Palestinian, four Israelis, and one Lebanese. Jodie Ginsberg joins me now. She is the president of the Committee to Protect Journalists. And Jodie, thank you for joining us. The Israel-Gaza war, as I understand, it has become the deadliest period for journalists covering conflicts since CPJ began documenting fatalities. And that was back in 1992.

But as you heard earlier in the report, the U.N. has said that the orders for people to leave is essentially impossible to fulfill.

But, yes, you're right, we're seeing harassment of journalists online, when people consider them to be taking a particular position, simply for stating what's happening. We're seeing arrests in places like the West Bank, harassment of journalists, even in Israel we've seen police approach and take out at gunpoint the journalists from the BBC Arabic Service.

We've also been monitoring a speech by the Hezbollah secretary general. Hassan Nasrallah has just finished speaking, talking for nearly 90 minutes. He said the possibility of the Lebanese front escalating into broad bottle is a realistic option. Meantime, the Israeli prime minister came out and warned against an escalation to the north.

But also to ensure that the -- what he calls the resistance, Hamas, and the other groups in Gaza, emerge victorious. He had a lot to say about the Americans who he held directly responsible for Israel's war on Gaza because of their political, military and diplomatic support for Israel. But he mentioned, for instance, the two U.S. carrier groups in the Eastern Mediterranean that have been deployed there since the 7th of October. And he said they don't scare us now and they never scared us in the past. He called upon Arab countries that have relations with Israel to withdraw their ambassadors, to stop trading with Israel, to cut off all ties. But in terms of concrete steps, no, he remains -- he's talking about options. But that has sort of been the discourse we've been hearing from others in the so-called axis of resistance. We've heard, for instance, the Iranian foreign minister talking about maybe they will do something if red lines will be crossed. So at this point, we're sort of where we were when we started, at the beginning of this speech. Still waiting to see what Hezbollah's next steps we'll be. Now, the speech began with a volley of celebratory gunfire and it ended with a volley of celebratory gunfire. But now it's quiet again. Just, Alessandro Gentile, my cameraman, sticking the camera out the window. As you can see, not a lot of people in the streets. But by and large it's gone back to Beirut, as it might be on a normal Friday evening, though somewhat more subdued. Many people here were very worried about what this -- what would come with the speech. I know many Lebanese have actually left the country before it happened, just to be out of the way. Others have gone up into the mountains to safer places. Others have stored up food and water in the event that something bad will follow the speech.
