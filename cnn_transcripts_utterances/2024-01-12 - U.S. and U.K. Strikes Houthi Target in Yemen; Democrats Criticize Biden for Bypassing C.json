The coalition strikes are a direct response to the surge of attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.Now, we're hearing coalition forces hit more than 60 targets at 16 Houthi locations across Yemen. A senior U.S. military official says it's not clear what percentage of Houthi assets have been destroyed, but he says the amount was significant. Now, these new images show smoke hanging over the skyline in a western Yemeni port city as the sun starts to rise. The Pentagon press secretary says the surgical strikes were meant to degrade and disrupt Houthi capabilities. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK RYDER, U.S. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT PRESS SECRETARY:  We've conducted this significant multi-nation operation in order to send a clear message to the Houthis that the kinds of attacks that they've been conducting since November 19th, 27 as of today, will not be tolerated.

We're told the coalition strikes targeted militant's radar systems as well as storage and launch sites for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. Now, this is a clear sign of the growing alarm over the threat to international shipping in one of the world's most critical waterways.Let's get straight to CNN's Paula Hancocks, who's live in Abu Dhabi. So, Paula, the Biden administration says these strikes may well not be the last word. What could the next word be? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Kim, the U.S. military and through senior administration officials have really left the door wide open for being able to continue strikes against targets, Houthi targets in Yemen. What we've heard from one senior official is, quote, \"This may well not be the last word on the topic. And when we have more to say and more to do, you will hear from us.\" So, making it very clear that this may not be the end of it. Now, as they have said overnight, Middle East time, they did target some 60 targets. They said they're trying to degrade the ability of these rebels to be able to target commercial vessels in the Red Sea and also to try and target U.S. and U.K. assets that are patrolling the Red Sea at this point. Now, we have heard from the Houthi side as well. They have said that there will be repercussions. We heard on Thursday the leader saying that if these U.S. attacks took place, then there would be repercussions. A spokesperson since the attacks happening saying they were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza. So, they have already said that there will be some kind of retaliation. We don't know what form that could come in though, because at this point, we've heard from the U.S. side that they believe that they have significantly degraded the abilities of the Houthi rebels to strike back, but they don't have exact details as the sun comes up in Yemen as to what that looks like.

There were plans that had been drawn up for this exact reason in the past and in recent days, we understand. But there was a reticence as to whether this was going to expand the conflict in the region and increase tensions to an unacceptable degree. But really what happened on Tuesday when rebels fired some 21 drones and missiles which were shot down by U.K. and U.S. navies, that's according to a U.S. official was actually targeting a U.S. asset in the region.And so that was really the tipping point from the U.S. point of view. And then on Wednesday you had the United Nations Security Council resolution condemning what the Houthis were doing in the Red Sea and also calling on them to immediately stop their operations. Now, that had 11 votes in favor, it had four abstentions, including Russia and China, but that's really the best that the U.S. could have hoped for from the U.S. and China. So, it shows that there was strong support for this U.N. Security Council resolution, again adding more legitimacy in the eyes of the United States for what they were going to do. But there has been hesitancy at striking Houthi targets inside Yemen. [02:04:56] They have certainly in recent days and weeks been carrying out operations, they say, in self-defense, protecting commercial vessels in the Red Sea and trying to shoot down any drone and missile attacks. But this is the first time during these recent months that we have seen the U.S. directly targeting inside Yemen. Kim?",

And that had to be responded to, particularly when the Houthis and Iran refused to respond to the U.S. delivered diplomatic warning that was delivered some days back. They can carry it on the attack.

This could be about terrorism or it could be about cyber-attacks or it could be about other forms of use of force.

And what we are learning tonight is that the attacks that we saw from the Houthis on Tuesday, this was just two days ago, had targeted some U.S. vessels. And what we are told by sources is that, had it not been for this defensive coalition called Operation Prosperity Guardian that was already set up by the U.S. and a number of its allies in the Red Sea, that we may have seen situations where ships were sunk by these attacks, and that there was even an instance within the last month where a commercial vessel that carrying jet fuel may have been hit.

A senior Biden administration official says these strikes may not be the final action against Houthi targets. We have more on the military campaign from CNN's Alex Marquardt.ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURIITY DEPARTMENT:  The United States and the United Kingdom have announced that they have carried out what they call precision strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, more than a dozen of them because of the attacks by Houthi forces since late November against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. This is the Red Sea right here. It is a critical waterway that sees some 15 percent of the global shipping trade pass through it. So, there were more than a dozen strikes, mostly in the western part of Houthi controlled Yemen, in and around the capital Sana'a, over here on the coast. And then up here in Saada, we saw this video of the night sky glowing after these strikes. In just a moment, you'll see another strike right there. In terms of the targets that were hit, this is both according to the Pentagon as well as the Houthis, air bases and airports, camps, radar systems, drone storage and launch sites. Drones have been central to those Houthi attacks. You have ballistic and cruise missile storage and launch sites that were hit, as well as coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities. Now, in terms of what was used in these strikes, you have fighter jets from both the U.S. and the United Kingdom. This is one of the British fighter jets that was taking off in order to carry out an air strike. You also have ships and submarine platforms that were used, according to the Pentagon. One of the submarines that was named was the USS Florida. It's a guided missile submarine. The ships and submarines are able to fire Tomahawk missiles against those targets on Yemeni soil. Now, to what extent the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group was used, we don't know, but it has been in the region to try to deter any regional actors, including the Houthis and Iran, from expanding the conflict that we are seeing currently between Israel and Hamas.

It was U.K. Typhoon fighter jets that targeted two different sites. It was the United States missiles, and fighter aircraft that targeted other sites. So, Houthis says it is not quite clear how they'll respond to the U.K., U.S. interest in the region. How will they respond? The potential here for escalation is a very real. It could be that the Houthis continue to try to target shipping in the Red Sea to send a message. Remembering, of course, after October 7th, they began to try and target cruise missiles to Israel, and that some of those were intercepted by the United States, by the U.K., and also by Saudi Arabia. So there are a number of different ways and places that the Houthis can target. We have had a long running war against Saudi Arabia that only just ended, and not so long ago, where they were sending long range cruise missiles to the capital Riyadh. They have sent drones into the United Arab Emirates. So there is a number of ways that they can destabilized in their own view, U.K. and U.S. interest in the region by doing it not just in the Red Sea but more broadly across the region. So, the concerns of the Saudis about at the potential for escalation a very real, they have been worrying about the October 7th attacks on the response for that escalating tension, for the northern border in Israel with Lebanon and Hezbollah. All these Iranian-backed proxies trying to stoke tensions in the region, and the Houthis are the ones that seem to parted precipitated this particular escalation. The Saudis, of course, are saying the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is of vital importance for the region. So, while they are not part of that military coalition in the Red Sea, they are clearly giving it a green light to go ahead.

When those attacks continued in certainly after Tuesday when we saw the largest such barrage launched from the Houthis, the U.S. stepped in, prepare its plans and finalize those plans, and then acted, carrying out those series of strikes intended to degrade the ability of the Houthis on Iranian-backed proxy in Yemen to target international shipping here. The U.S. trying to contain this, so it doesn't escalate too much, but fully aware of the risk of escalation here, knowing the Houthis had promised to respond to any American action. It's worth noting that even with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the hospital following complications from surgery for prostate cancer, he tracked this very closely. It was intimately involved in the planning over the course of the past 72 hours, holding two calls with President Joe Biden and multiple daily calls with the NSC, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Kurilla. Earlier on Thursday, he gave the order to execute those strikes and we saw those play out late in the evening. The U.S. essentially carry out the warning that we have seen them threatened repeatedly that if the Houthi attacks on international shipping continue, the U.S. and the U.K. will be forced to act. And that is what we've seen. Of course, the question, where does this go from here as the Houthis promise a response and do the Iranians essentially get into this and respond in their own fashion? Those are questions the U.S. has asked and to find out the answer, they will watch the region very closely. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The former President Trump getting the last word in at closing arguments, usually closing arguments are an opportunity for lawyers to summarize their theory of the case. And the day kicked off with Trumps lawyer, Chris Kise, laying out their theory the case, arguing that this is political persecution and that his client, Trump, had no intention of defrauding banks and that the banks were never harmed.But after Kise wrapped his remarks, he then asked if his client could have a few minutes to address the court. And, look, the judge granted it, saying I'll give you five minutes, and the judge had previously set a restriction on Trump saying, you can participate in closing arguments, but you can't give a campaign speech and that's exactly what Trump did, attacking the judge, attacking the attorney generals office, and insisting that he is a, quote, innocent man. Now, Trump addressed the public on his way to court on his way out of court, those remarks in court and then had a press conference. So, it appears he got a real return on investment here in terms of amplifying his argument that he is being targeted because of a desire by his political opponents to try to quote, interfere in this election. But I want to note something that the attorney generals office said in their closing arguments. They noticed that even though Chris Kise talked for two hours, other attorneys got up and laid out their closing arguments, not one person address the false financial statements that Trump submitted that misrepresented his assets by billions, and those are really the key this case.
