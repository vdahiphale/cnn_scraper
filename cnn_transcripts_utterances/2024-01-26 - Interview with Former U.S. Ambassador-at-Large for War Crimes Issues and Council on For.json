David, welcome to the program. Wanted to get your reaction to this preliminary, the ruling that we heard today, obviously on the issue of genocide. That will take years to decide. But from what we heard today from the ICJ, any surprises from you? DAVID SCHEFFER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR WAR CRIMES ISSUES AND SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS:  No, no surprises at all. I think the most interesting aspect of the ruling is actually in the individual declarations by certain judges, where they do emphasize points that are not really highlighted in the judgment itself. One of them is the extremely high bar that is set for proving genocidal intent. The German judge in particular said, I do not think that South Africa has met the test of plausibility on genocidal intent by Israel, but I do join the majority because of my belief, the German judge saying this, that these insightful statements are allegedly insightful statements by Israeli officials do need to be brought under control and they do pose a serious risk that could be associated with intent to the Palestinian people. But at the same time, he cautioned that, look, we're in a situation of war here. And that doesn't point to necessarily a cease fire ruling but rather a pairing of the acts of genocide, killing, et cetera, that are alleged with a genocidal intent, and that's extremely difficult to prove in front of the world court and prior cases have demonstrated how difficult that has been to prove. And frankly, there are several cases where it was never proved, that pairing of genocidal intent with the destructiveness and killing of warfare.",

It's verydifferent from example on the Ukraine-Russia case before the court where Russia was an outright aggressor. There was no self-defense involved for the court to say, that should cease. That military conduct should cease completely. Whereas in this case, there is a claim of self-defense by Israel, which the court acknowledges, if not -- if only indirectly, that yes, there is a basis for combat, and during combat, it is international humanitarian law and the law of war, which controls. You can sometimes attach genocide to that, but you have to prove that genocidal intent in order to associate the killing and destruction with the war itself and with genocide.

Remember, in their application of December 29th, they listed something like 50 statements by Israeli officials that could call into question what is the intent here. Israel needs to be extremely careful, one, to reject all of those statements, as the court has requested them essentially to do, and to prove in this report that comes out in 30 months -- 30 days that there have been no further expressions that could be possibly inferred as incitement to genocide. Rather, the government is trying to demonstrate that it's in a war, it's conducting its operations in accordance with the law of war and international humanitarian law, and that there is no genocidal intent whatsoever.

And also, just to note that several of the judges in their declarations are cautioning deeply how far the court should go, that this should be a very narrow ruling under the genocide convention. And that so far, a lot has not been proven by South Africa with respect to these charges. So, the court is acting very responsibly, rather conservatively and also stressing, which is the reality that this is a war and that outside of the Geneva Convention, the parties, including Hamas, need to recognize that international humanitarian law must be complied with.

Because until now, the Qataris never attacked Netanyahu since the beginning of the war. And even if there were tensions, they were under the table and they have not come out into the open. So, this daylight right now obviously does not help. On the other hand, you see that this meeting in Europe is going to take place on Sunday, regardless of all of that. Another interesting thing, by the way. The prime minister of Qatar, a day after he's meeting the director of CIA and the head of Mossad in Europe, is coming here to Washington.

And, you know, we can't shy away from this. When Biden told Netanyahu last Friday that he's not in it for a year of war in Gaza, it is clear what he was pointing at, because if the war started in October of 2023 and the elections are in November of 2024, it's clear what he was hinting at. And senior Biden officials as senior Biden aides told me several times in the last few days that they see every day the amount of political damage they get among young voters in America, and they say that they just want this war to stop dominating the news, because every day that this is front and center in -- on TV in the U.S. and newspapers and online.

So, they're looking for the right time. And for them -- from what I hear from their people, that the right time is after there's some sort of a deal on the release of hostages. Once this happens, they can say, this is why we went into the government. We managed to get one deal on the hostages. Now, a second deal on the hostages. Now, we can lead the coalition and call for an election. And a lot of people, big parts of the Israeli public who supports both of them don't go to the streets because they say they are still in the government.
