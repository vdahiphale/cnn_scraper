Parts of Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana are also getting bands of freezing rain along with wintery thunderstorms. Nearly 4 million are under blizzard warnings in Kansas and Missouri, with wind gusts topping 40 miles per hour or 64 kilometers per hour.

Tens of thousands of people remain without electricity. Some places could see more than 12 inches or 30 centimeters of snow as this system continues to move east.

I still think, however they structure this, John, one bill or two, in the end, they're going to be back on terrain that has been tough for Republicans before, where they're arguing for tax cuts that primarily benefit the top while cutting programs that primarily benefit the lower half of the income spectrum in the middle class, like Medicaid, food stamps and maybe education funding.",

What was different? Donald Trump lost. So this, I think, is now a yardstick that's going to be out there the next time Republicans lose, which surely, they will in a two-party system in 2028 or 2032. If they lose, can they plausibly say, well, there was fraud again because we happen to lose? The other question, of course, is calm before the storm is, you know, the question you just asked me, Donald Trump tax cuts, legislative strategy, all the normal things you get in an administration. There's a whole other track of a potential Trump presidency, which is how far is he going to go in straining, if not shredding, the rule of law as we have understood it?

What's interesting about Musk's intervention is that this particular stage, we're not really sure who's speaking. Is it the private citizen articulating his views of global politics? Is it the wealthy, internationally known entrepreneur, or is it a surrogate for President-elect Trump?The fact that we know that Musk is entering this administration and is part of that hemisphere of the Trump world, means that this entanglement is more complicated than it was previously. What is unprecedented is him going after not just important leaders, the chancellor of Germany, the prime minister of the UK, but undermining institutions like the EU, NATO and the G7. By doing this, allies (AUDIO GAP) were entering here, John, is simply an unprecedented, unchartered territory of sort of political behavior and a kind of recalibration that is about to come once President Trump enters -- enters office. And there's no reason to think that this kind of aggressive, insulting and lack of diplomatic approach is going to characterize the years to come with this administration.",

But also pointing to this London, where city traffic dropped by 33 percent, and that was after the charge was introduced back in 2003.
