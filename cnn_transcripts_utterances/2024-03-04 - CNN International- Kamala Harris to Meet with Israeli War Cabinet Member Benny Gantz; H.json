Benny Gantz is expected to sit down with the Vice President Kamala Harris, in the hours ahead, and meet with the Secretary of State Antony Blinken tomorrow.But even as these meetings are set to kick off, Israel has decided to skip ceasefire talks in Cairo that are being attended by a Hamas delegation. An Israeli official tells CNN that Israel is not sending a delegation to Egypt after Hamas failed to respond to two key demands, one being a list of hostages indicating which are alive and which are dead, all this seeming to dash hopes of an imminent deal. Still, the U.S. is ramping up its push to address the dire situation in Gaza.
