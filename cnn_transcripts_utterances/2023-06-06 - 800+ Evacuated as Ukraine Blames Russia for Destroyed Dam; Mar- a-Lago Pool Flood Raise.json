You can see the water pouring through a gap in the wall there. Hundreds of people have already been evacuated as flooding hits along the Dnipro River. Eighty settlements are in this flood zone, according to the Ukrainian president, and the water could reach a, quote, \"critical level\" very soon. MATTINGLY: And a CNN exclusive: flooded at a Mar-a-Lago in the room where surveillance video logs were kept. Federal prosecutors say it's suspicious as former President Trump's attorneys meet with the special counsel.

That has always been -- the Dnipro River has always been a formidable natural barrier. And the Ukrainians have said if that was their intent, that will be no problem for us. The spokeswoman for the Southern Command saying that they have the capacity to get across those river crossings, regardless of the level of flooding. But I think ultimately, the -- there may well be a question here as to whether or not this was something of a kind of predictable accident, because the areas most dangerously affected in many ways are Russian- occupied areas, including areas where, at least until very recently, they had some significant concentrations of artillery that they were using to pound Ukrainian positions, particularly in Kherson City itself.",

Talking about what Ukrainian officials are saying at this point in time, blaming Russia or Russian-occupied forces, saying Russians are panicked. You can't separate this from what we saw over the course of the last 24 hours or so. An uptick in the tempo of potential offensive actions from Ukraine. Do you think these are connected and how does this affect the battlefield? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Well, this probably is connected. I do believe it is an indication that there is some panic in the Russian lines. But I mean, it's another page out of their playbook. They're trying to wreak havoc. They're trying to hurt the civilian population there. And they're just not going to be successful, I think, in degrading the will of the Ukrainian people to conduct this fight or to conduct any kind of a river crossing operation that they need down there. My major concern with the blowing up of this dam is the impact on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is upriver from this dam about 50 miles. And they desperately need cooling water in order to cool those six active reactors they have up there. None of them are online right now. But they still need cooling water in order to, you know, to prevent some kind of a catastrophe up there. So that's my big concern, is on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",

And essentially, what we've done, we've given them a lot of equipment, but we've never provided the repair parts and the maintenance expertise that they need in order to sustain this equipment. My understanding anecdotally is less than half of the equipment that we have given the Ukrainians is fully mission-capable. It's not operational. You cannot go into a war fight, you know, like this. They need to outnumber in terms of firepower -- the defending force needs to be outnumbered by the attacker by a ratio of three to one. And I just don't think that they can do that. Their only hope is to be able to conduct offensive maneuver warfare to seek some sort of a penetration and then attack from the rear areas and the francs and come from behind. And hope they can get tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Russians to surrender. That's their only hope. But there's no way they can go toe-to-toe with the Russians. They're dug in.

And according to, you know, sources who talked to Katelyn Polantz and Kaitlan Collins, you know, witnesses are being asked by prosecutors about this incident. It's all about the timing. Right? The -- the first subpoena that comes to -- to the Trump team is in the early summer. They provide some documents. And then the FBI goes and does a search in August. And it is after this that they get another subpoena for more surveillance video, for them to turn over surveillance video, again, from Mar-a-Lago. This happens in October during the time, again, where prosecutors are serving additional subpoenas for surveillance video, and of course, another one in late October, where they get a preservation order. All of this adds up to the prosecutors trying to understand whether, again, this flooding incident that happened, which affected a room where surveillance logs are being kept, whether this was intentional, whether this was a mistake. Now, some testimony that came in to prosecutors indicated that the I.T. room was not affected by this.

And that if he were to get in the race, he would do something directly about it. And we seem to be at this point. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expected to announce his run for president today. He's hosting a town hall tonight at St. Anselm College here in New Hampshire, where he's expected to make brief remarks and then answer questions from the audience.
