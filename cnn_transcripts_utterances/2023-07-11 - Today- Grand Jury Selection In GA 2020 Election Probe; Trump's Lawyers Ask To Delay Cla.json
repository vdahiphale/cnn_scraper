Soon whoever is picked will make a historic decision whether to charge Donald Trump with trying to sabotage the 2020 election results in Georgia.And a deal for one ally, a disk from another. Turkey relents and says yes to letting Sweden into the NATO alliance, but Ukraine upstages the big Biden win with the demand for respect and entry into NATO now and not later. Plus, bad blood. Donald Trump says, he has problems with Iowa's governor and another deep cut. We just learned that the front runner says, he'll skip a headline event for Iowa GOP voters. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. And we start with grand jury selection in Georgia. That panel is expected to consider charges against Donald Trump and his Republican allies for trying to overturn the state's 2020 election. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis launched the investigation in 2021. Shortly after the former president suggested Georgia's top election officials could help him \"fined 11,780 votes just enough to beat President elect Joe Biden.\" CNN's Nick Valencia is live outside the courthouse. Nick, what are we seeing and hearing at this point as they're doing the selection inside behind you?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, there is so much at stake here for the former president and some of the biggest names in his orbit. One of the two grand jury selected today will ultimately be tasked with hearing evidence against the former president and some of his closest allies in their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results here in Georgia. And that grand jury will ultimately decide whether or not to bring an indictment against the former president and some of his Republican allies.So, let's take you inside right now and what's happening in there. We have a reporter inside, Marshall Cohen, who tells us that this jury pool is 96 potential jurors all drawn here from Fulton County, which as many of you know, is heavily Democratic. 73 percent of the voters here voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election. I mentioned two grand juries will be selected today. They will consist of 26 jurors each. They will be needed 16 for quorum, 12 of them will have to be in agreement in order for an indictment to be leveled. And right now, judge McBurney, who was presiding over the special purpose grand jury will also preside over this selection of the grand jurors. He is going over hardships with these jurors, who're seeing if they have any scheduling conflicts. We understand that he's meeting privately with some of those who've expressed that they have some hardships and some of those valid excuses that he says, we'll be allowing. You know, some of these jurors to not serve include things like them being 70 or above 70 years old or above if they're not a U.S. citizen, if they're a full- time resident. The bottom line here though, is by the end of the day, we will have the grand jury that is ultimately going to hear evidence against the former president in his effort to overturn the 2020 elections' results. And Dana, the anticipation is that we will hear one way or another about the potential of an indictment or indictments as early as August. Dana?",

And well, that's exactly what he and his team want to do. We've kind of gotten hints of it. And now they've just said it plainly. They want an indefinite delay. They're looking for perhaps a trial that goes beyond election day in 2024.But one of the extraordinary things that, you know, that happens in Donald Trump words and in his team's filing, is this line. It says, the extraordinary case presents a serious challenge to both the fat and the perception of our American democracy. I think those words actually could also extend to the conduct that the former president exhibited on January 6, before January 6, after he lost the election in 2020. And also, just his conduct since, right. And I think it's one of those words, that one of those things that if you look at the words that they write in there, you could extrapolate it to a lot of different things that the former president has been doing. And so, we don't know whether this judge is going to agree with this, whether she's going to look to try to speed this up. The Justice Department says, they can go to trial in December.

And it was quite clear at the time that he saw a third bid for the presidency, not just as a pursuit for the presidency again, and a political operation, but also as a legal strategy against all of these clouds forming here because your shield. Yes, exactly. These two things are you cannot separate them. They're inseparable, and his trials, his legal woes are part and parcel of his campaign for the presidency. And he sees it as a protection in many ways because he knows if he gets elected president in 2024, all of this goes away. It goes away instantly.

Nauta couldn't find a lawyer, sort of hard to find that credible. That all adds up here.And even in the best of circumstances, this would have been a very difficult case to get the trial before the presidential season. This makes it almost impossible. And the thing -- the great thing for Cannon -- Judge Cannon is she doesn't have to weigh in on one side of the other.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived here just a few hours ago, seeking security guarantees and also a clear pathway to membership in NATO.But the communique that was released just hours after Zelenskyy's touchdown here does not offer that. It simply says that there will be conditions that need to be met before the NATO alliance would invite Ukraine into the group. Now, Zelenskyy really put allies on blast as he headed into these meetings, tweeting, quote, it's unprecedented and absurd when timeframe is not set, neither for the invitation, nor for Ukraine's membership. While at the same time, vague wording about conditions is added even for inviting Ukraine. You'll remember President Biden came into this summit, saying that now is not the time for Ukraine to join NATO due to the fact that that war is still ongoing against Russia. And also stressing that there are still reforms that need to be made before Ukraine can join the alliance. Now, the communique does say that they will remove the Membership Action Plan once they do move closer to that membership application. Now President Biden and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy are set to meet face to face tomorrow. This certainly will be an issue of discussion. I think one thing to watch more closely is whether Biden is able to offer any long-term security commitments to Ukraine, as they're trying to show that the U.S. and their allies still have the resolve and support behind Ukraine, as they face this war against Russia.",
