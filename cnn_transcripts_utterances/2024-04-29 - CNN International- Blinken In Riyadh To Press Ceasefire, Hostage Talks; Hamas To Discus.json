This is CNN Newsroom.Just ahead, delicate diplomacy, the U.S. Secretary of State is in Saudi Arabia before heading to Jordan and Israel. But, can Antony Blinken make any progress on a ceasefire deal? Plus, dozens are killed after heavy rains in Kenya cause a dam to burst. We are live in one of the affected areas this hour. And universities across the United States and around the world grappling with how to handle protests over the war in Gaza. A full report is coming up. Talks over a potential ceasefire in the Middle East appear to be gaining some momentum. That is one reason U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the region, his seventh visit since the Israel- Hamas war started. Earlier, he met with the Saudi Foreign Minister in Riyadh. He will also travel to Israel and Jordan to help jumpstart hostage release and ceasefire talks. A short time ago, Blinken told the World Economic Forum, only one thing is standing in the way of a ceasefire right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: A major effort has been made over the last couple of months to get to that ceasefire, to get the hostages out. And right now, as you said, Hamas has before it a proposal that is extraordinarily, extraordinarily generous on the part of Israel. And in this moment, the only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. That's right. Hamas officials are actually currently in Cairo, Egypt, meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators to discuss this latest framework that has been put forward by Egypt. This latest framework has significant input from the Israelis who met with Egyptian officials last Friday to try and put something on paper here, a framework that Hamas could review to see whether or not there is indeed a path forward for these talks.This latest framework, I'm told, would see somewhere between 20 and 33 hostages released over the first phase of this agreement, and following that there would be a longer-term ceasefire, something that's being described as the restoration of sustainable calm, diplomatic speak, that would effectively lead potentially to the end of this war in Gaza, as well as the release of the remaining hostages and Israeli soldiers being held by Hamas. Now, a lot of details still remain to be seen. But, the basis for this framework in terms of how long that initial ceasefire would last, I'm told, would be one day of ceasefire in exchange for every single hostage. So, we're looking at something less than the initial six weeks that was being discussed for the 40 hostages. But now, instead, we're looking at something that could be potentially between three to five weeks for some 20 to 33 hostages. And then, following that, there is an attempt to kind of broker a comprehensive deal that would lead to the release of all of the hostages as well as an end to this war, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Now, we've seen significant movement from Israel over the course of the last month or so in this latest framework. For example, Israel has agreed to, I'm told, to allow for the unrestricted access of Palestinians to northern Gaza, which was something that Hamas was insisting on. Israel had refused to do so far. But, there are still gaps between these two sides. And the next couple of days as Hamas officials review this proposal, the proposal, I'm told, is also in the hands of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza. These next couple of days will be critical to determining whether or not there is a path forward for a deal or perhaps what is looming all over these talks is an impending Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, whether that will happen instead. One Israeli source familiar with these negotiations said effectively that a deal through this latest piece of negotiations is the only way to avert that Rafah offensive. For now, Israeli officials appear to be holding off on going forward with that offensive, seeing if a deal can be reached this week through these negotiations. But, if there is a clear sense that these talks are going nowhere, then it is understood that that Rafah offensive will move forward.",

We know that Israeli officials and American officials have held multiple consultations over the course of the last couple of weeks to discuss Israeli plans to move into Rafah.But today, the Secretary of State Tony Blinken saying that we have not yet seen a plan that civilians can be effectively protected in the event of a ground offensive in Rafah, and that's obviously a major red flag here, because Israeli officials have insisted that they are making preparations to evacuate the civilian population from Rafah to move them to areas further north in the Gaza Strip, where they are setting up tents and field hospitals and other facilities to provide for the basic needs of those displaced individuals. But yet, the U.S. Secretary of State is still saying at this hour that he hasn't yet seen a plan that effectively protects civilians. So, clearly, there is still some more work to be done, or perhaps the Israelis will move forward with a plan that the Americans simply do not support or agree with.",

And that really has been a catalyst for this increased confrontation that we've been seeing, not just between Iran and Israel, but also between Iran and the United States.And to that extent, the rhetoric here in Tehran from the leadership has definitely shifted considerably, especially after that recent massive standoff where you had Iran's embassy in Damascus being bombed, several top level Revolutionary Guard commanders killed there, then the Iranians answering, the Israelis answering back. The Iranians now saying, if Israel makes another move, they will hit back hard. Of course, those were some pretty tough words coming from the Iranians.

It was roughly a quarter-mile wide, winds of 218 kilometers per hour or greater. That's 136 miles per hour.

But, this United States Postal Service truck completely flipped on its side, tossed around like a toy.

The immediate threats right now, though, is located across this area. We still have a severe thunderstorm watch throughout Central Louisiana. The storms threats here with wind gusts in excess of 50 to 60 miles per hour, but it is weakening as it traverses eastward through Baton Rouge and towards New Orleans.

The goal is to jumpstart ceasefire and hostage negotiations, which appears may be gaining momentum, with sources saying Hamas is set to meet with mediators in Cairo to discuss a new proposal. Now, Blinken says the only thing standing in the way of a ceasefire itself is Hamas. Blinken's comments come a day after the U.S. and Israeli leaders held a phone call that focused on securing a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages.Let's bring in our Kylie Atwood, joining us from the State Department. Hi there, Kylie. First off, let's talk about this trip to Saudi Arabia, and of course through the Middle East for Blinken. What is he hoping to achieve on this trip? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, what they're really trying to push forward is this ceasefire, and of course, the secure of the release of hostages. This has been, of course, an ongoing effort between Israel and Hamas and the parties that have been involved, including Qatar, Egypt and the United States. What the Secretary said this morning is that Israel had provided, in his words, an extraordinarily generous proposal to Hamas, and that Hamas should accept it. He has been saying for a while now, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that the onus is on Hamas right now to accept what Israel has put on the table. And it's worth noting that when I spoke with him last week, he was a little bit more hopeful that things, this go round, in terms of these negotiations could actually manifest into a ceasefire and the release of prisoners, because he said, there is less degree of challenges in the region right now that could escalate into a wider war. Of course, we saw that back and forth between Iran and Israel occurring in the recent weeks. That has obviously simmered down. So, he thinks that Hamas was looking at that and hoping it would turn into a wider war, but it hasn't. And so, maybe they're in a position to actually accept the terms of this deal for a ceasefire and hostage relief. Now, in the backdrop here, we're also looking at the State Department where there is division over whether Israel is using American-made weapons in accordance with international law. According to a State Department official, there is not consensus in the department as to if the assurances that Israel has provided to the United States are credible. So, this is something that's going to come to the fore next week, because the Secretary of State, according to a national security memorandum that President Biden signed last year, next week, he is going to have to provide Congress with his assessment as to if all of the countries that are using American-made weapons are doing so in accordance with international law. He is going to have to determine if the reasons, if the justification that Israel has given are credible and reliable in this report to Congress. So, we'll have to watch and see where he lands. But, as it stands now, the State Department itself is divided on this topic, which is incredibly noteworthy.",

But, they also are eyes wide open about the fact that these negotiations between Israel and Hamas have been stalled for a while now. And so, they're also beginning to, in the backdrop, rethink, OK, maybe there is a world in which we roll out a framework for normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. They've been working on for a while.Now, as you said, this proposal for a two-state solution, this defense agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia as a means to push towards a ceasefire. That's something that Secretary said they could roll out before there is a ceasefire, if they aren't able to come to a ceasefire agreement. So, we'll have to watch and see if they get to that first. But, if they don't, they're trying to think of plan B here to try and push towards peace. WALKER: All right. A lot on his agenda, obviously. Kylie Atwood, great to have you, at the State Department.

Putin's tactical advances are now daily and reflect the rhythm of the battlefield since the fall of the industrial town of Avdiivka February. Ukraine's Army Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi says the situation on the frontline has escalated, but he cautions that the circumstances are dynamic and changing every day. Joining us now with more is CNN's Clare Sebastian from London. Hi there, Clare. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Look, Amara, I think what's clear is that the task of stabilizing this frontline, especially in the east for Ukraine as it waits for that U.S. aid to arrive, is getting harder by the day. The Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi over the weekend in quite a detailed message on Telegram revealing that Ukraine had withdrawn from a cluster of three villages northwest of Avdiivka, he said, to preserve the life of personnel. That's on top of the village that the Russian Defense Ministry says that it has taken in that same area. So, you can see that the momentum is on the Russian side.As of now, we're talking really small villages with literally like an intersection of two roads, a cluster of houses. So, this is not a lot of territory. Right now, it is more tactical than it is strategic, but the momentum is towards more important higher ground from which they can fire on important military hubs. So, Russia's strategy is clear here. And the momentum is on their side, superior manpower. They have air superiority. Still, they're able to drop these halftime glide bombs from planes miles behind the frontlines. That was, by the way, a key determinant in their capture of Avdiivka in February. So, the momentum is on their side. Ukraine is still waiting for that first injection of U.S. aid, and is really working hard to stabilize the frontline, not only in the east, but up north in the Kharkiv region, where there are reports that Russia is gaining some momentum there, a region where the frontlines have been largely stable since a very successful Ukrainian counteroffensive there in the autumn of 2022, Amara.",

I mean, it took many, many months for the U.S. Congress and for Joe Biden, the President, to finally sign that foreign aid package, sending $61 billion to Ukraine. But, it's been months since they've been running out of ammunition and weapons. And of course, they also have a personnel shortage there, a troop shortage.

That was what the then Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces called technological parity. They could really both see what the other side was doing, and no one was really moving. Since then, of course, we've seen Ukraine's ammunition supply is dwindling. They've had to ration. They're at a point now where they're firing one artillery shell for every 10 that Russia is firing. When we look at the loss of territory, as I said, it's not necessarily game changing in the course of the war, but Russia has gained momentum here, and the frontlines are now not stable.So, the thinking among military circles and experts that we speak to is that what Ukraine will do with this new U.S. aid is try to stabilize things, to dig in, to regroup, and then potentially only look to go on the offensive again next year in 2025, Amara. So, that is the big picture here.",

The next is on Tuesday.Pedro Sanchez has announced he will not resign from his post as Spanish Prime Minister and will remain in office. The announcement comes five days after Mr. Sanchez abandoned his public duties temporarily to decide whether he could continue his job. That is after a Spanish court launched an investigation into his wife Begona Gomez over corruption allegations. Mr. Sanchez said his wife would defend herself and cooperate with the judicial system. Well, politics can be a brutal business. That's the word from the Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf in his resignation speech. He quit earlier on Monday after a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party collapsed. His resignation cuts off a likely no- confidence vote in both his leadership and minority government. Humza Yousaf says he will stay on until his party chooses a new leader. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUMZA YOUSAF, SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER: Therefore, after spending the weekend, reflecting on what is best for my party, for the government and for the country I lead, I've concluded that repairing a relationship across the political divide can only be done to someone else at the helm. I have therefore informed the SNP's national secretary of my intention to stand down as party leader, and ask that she commences as a leadership contest for my replacement as soon as possible.
