      "sentences": "Why you shouldn't sleep on what Donald Trump's trial is really about, that's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. In minutes, we will run you through a very busy day inside of the courthouse for Donald Trump where his legal team won, where his legal team lost, and the countdown to the shutdown of that jury pool by the numbers. And, plus, there's much, much more. But, first, the matter at the heart of this Trump trial and why Americans shouldn't look the other way about the very serious allegations that face Donald Trump, the headlines that you may have read this morning probably played on just a few words, hush money, porn star, Stormy. And, yes, the details of Trump's allegedly falsifying of business records do belong in places like the National Enquirer. But the deception is about much more than just $130,000 funneled to an adult film actress. It is about who Donald Trump was trying to deceive, you, the voter, and how he's still trying to deceive you now. Think back to when prosecutors say that Michael Cohen made that payment to silence Stormy Daniels. That was October 27th, 2016, just 12 days before that election, and 20 days after The Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mic explaining how he groped women. Now, that story prompted the rarest of things, a Trump apology. But it also prompted panic inside of his campaign. Poll numbers like this, this was CNN's final poll just before the election, showing Hillary Clinton leading by six points. And it prompted a rush to catch and kill any other stories about Trump's history of bad behavior with women before November 8th. Now, that kind of story could alienate suburban women who were revolted by a major party presidential candidate talking about grabbing women by the you know what, stories like an affair with an adult film actress. Then the election happened and Trump won. And, look, it is impossible to interpret how more evidence of Trump's misogyny could have swayed the election but he made voters the victims. The affair story might have broken, but it might not have broken through with a few hundred thousand people who ultimately decide American elections. The point is Trump cared enough to bury it, to bend and to break the rules to make sure it didn't get out. Now, whether that is a crime, whether he committed a crime, the jury is out on that question or they will be. But whether Trump has a pattern and practice of deception, that verdict is very much in. CNN's Legal Analyst Elie Honig is joining me now from the magic wall. Elie, jury selection, it's just the beginning and we're nowhere even near the end of this process. Where do we stand in terms of that?",

Judge also said the juror can hear about Trump's efforts to use the National Enquirer to put in politically damaging stories about his enemies. Again, it goes to that pattern.The Judge ruled with the respect of that Access Hollywood tape you were talking about before, that grab them tape, but the jury is not going to get to see or hear the tape, but they're going to get to know what Donald Trump said in it. Perhaps they'll see a transcript. So, they will see it in a sort of dry form. And then, finally, the judge ruled that evidence about Donald Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll case cannot come in. That's a win, a minor win, but a win for Donald Trump.",

And so the D.A. went to the judge this morning and said, you have to do something, Judge.Now, what can the judge do? Well, you can reprimand. You can say, don't do that again. Ordinarily, you don't want to get reprimanded by the judge. Trump doesn't really care. The judge can oppose fines. In fact, the D.A.'s office is asking the judges to fine. Don't laugh. The D.A. office has asked the judge to find Donald Trump $3,000 for all of his offenses. I don' think that's really going to deter Donald Trump. Ultimately, a judge has the power to send someone to prison. That's not realistically going happen here with respect to Donald. Trump. But this is going be an ongoing battle, as between the D.A. and Judge Merchan trying to keep Donald under some set of rules, some discipline. This will be happening for the next few months or so.",

He's made a mockery out of a norms while president.And so I think this continues on with the trend that we have seen of Donald Trump, frankly, taking little beyond himself very seriously. But I don't think this makes it neutralizes the age issue for Joe Biden, even if the version of Joe Biden that conservatives have been trying to push, particularly on social media, particularly kind of falling off the stage, falling off the bike, is more of a caricature than the real reality. When we look at the numbers, Joe Biden's numbers went up after the State of the Union. It's partially because he showed a different version of himself than I think a lot of folks have presented.

They basically ran RFK out of the party, even though his last name is stitched into the actual DNA of the Democratic Party. So, yes, I believe that the American people are tuned out in large part because they have been locked out of the process by decisions that have been made by people that want to make this about whether Trump is snoozing in court and not about whether the economy is working for the people on Main Street, the border issue that is a great deal of concern, and the tinderbox in the Middle East that is threatening to be the staging ground for the World War III we hope this never comes to.",

So, a small response could mean a discreet use of cyberattacks or commando raids or something like that. Medium response cyberattacks may be with weapons like an attack on a city or on an installation. More likely, they would go after -- the Israelis would go after military installations. And then if you have a large response, it would include basically everything plus more conventional things, bombing runs against certain military installations, bases. For example, you could attack some of the naval installations that are on the coast here. You could attack some of the airfields that are in these parts of Iran.

House Speaker Mike Johnson revealing a new plan to vote on separate aid packages for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan and other foreign policy proposals. He's now facing steep opposition from within his own party, including its far right wing, over how and whether to fund these key allies abroad, including a number of Republicans who are against more money to Ukraine.Among them is my next guest. Joining me now is Republican Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio. He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee as well as the House Freedom Caucus Congressman. We appreciate you staying up late for us tonight. Are you and the rest of the Freedom Caucus on board with the Speaker's current plan? WARREN DAVIDSON (R) FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: Well, I certainly can't speak for anyone else. Freedom Caucus or anyone else in the conference. But I really am a big fan of the idea of regular order, single subject bills subject to amendment. And I think that's where the Speaker's landed. I mean, the situation in Ukraine is different than the situation in Israel. And frankly, it's different than the situation in the Pacific. And, you know, lastly, what I hear from my constituents is what about American security? And they want something at the border. So, the way this falls short, frankly, is the Speaker has a plan to do something about America. But it really isn't what our constituents around the country are talking about. They're talking about securing the border. But I am glad that he has a plan to give us four separate votes. And it might take a fifth so we can deal with, you know, the real national security threat that's top of mind for American citizens. We're supportive for Ukraine. We feel like they were wrongly attacked by Vladimir Putin in Russia. But we're incredibly supportive of Israel, one of America's closest friends. And we see the danger in the Pacific. So, we should have each of those debates. And frankly, they should be subject to amendment.",

It is in the interest of Russia to have a long war. And frankly, you know who's benefiting from this is China. China would love for us to be bogged down for another 20 years in an ill-defined war.
