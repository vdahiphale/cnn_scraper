It's been pounding the city of Tia in Southern Lebanon with multiple airstrikes over the course of the day as it pursues, what it says again, is that operation against Hezbollah outposts and various installations connected with the militia.Previously -- earlier, the Israeli military had warned residents of that Lebanese city to evacuate, giving them notice that airstrikes were on their way. And so, that caused scenes of panic as well as people tried to flee the areas that they anticipated the airstrikes would come in on. That of course, as Israel continues to strike Hezbollah targets elsewhere in Beirut and Southern and Eastern Lebanon as well. They say, the Israeli military, they've killed at least three Hezbollah commanders over the course of the past 24 hours, plus a figure they say is responsible for Hezbollah's drone attacks, or is sort of an expert in drone warfare with Hezbollah, as part of those military operations. The point is, Amara, there's very little sign of that military operation, which has targeted hospitals and financial institutions as well, and is having a terrible impact on the people of Lebanon, is coming to a close anytime soon.",

Now, it was initially intended to be a debate, but Donald Trump turned down the invitation. The audience will be Democrats, Republicans and Independents who remain undecided. We're going to have more on tonight's CNN Town Hall, but first, polls show the race for the White House in a dead heat.

We've heard John Kelly in the past say that Trump, during the time that he served as Chief of Staff, would inquire about Hitler or express praise for Hitler and for Hitler's generals and the like. What I think is so damning about this is that your White House Chief of Staff, longest serving of your tenure, your Homeland Security Secretary, and a well-decorated military general in this country, is saying that you, Donald Trump are the only president in his lifetime or through history that he can think of who is against the grain of what America actually stands for.Now, that's just an unprecedented kind of assessment of somebody serving a president. Now, the question of does it matter politically, we don't know the answer to that. But history shows us that learning these outlandish and totally against the grain, anti-democratic, authoritarian leaning comments that Donald Trump makes doesn't seem to move the needle. Donald Trump is as popular today as he has been at any point in his nine years on the public stage. So, I don't think this will upend this presidential race, these comments, but I do think it -- they are damning comments from a very reliable source. WALKER:  Right.

To illustrate this, I just want to bring you back those images, from the Rafik Hariri Hospital. This is the largest public hospital in Lebanon. It was struck two days ago, but still rescue operations continue. Look at people there gathered around, trying to find the bodies of those killed under the rubble. That man specifically are looking at with the red jacket being hugged, he has lost five children and his wife. The body of three of those children have been recovered. At the time this was filmed, he was still waiting and looking to find the body of his wife and two of his other children. We're also hearing from medical workers on the ground who say they feel that they are the targets of Israel's air campaign. They have denied any allegations that Israel has made, that Hezbollah has any infrastructure in and around these hospitals. And these medical workers believe that Israel's goal is to dismantle Lebanon's medical system. Again, according to a Lebanese medical official, some 150 healthcare workers have been killed, including four doctors. And I want to reiterate that information you had earlier as well, five hospitals completely out of operation and 22 partially destroyed. It shows that this offensive on Lebanon is expanding.

Well, the United Nations says absolutely nowhere. And specifically that situation in Northern Gaza, I mean, I'm running out of words to describe just how dire it is. People are running out of food, running out of water, death, violence is part of their daily reality. A huge part of the push for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, was to get more humanitarian aid, specifically into that part of Northern Gaza, a place where aid workers say that essentially there's been no help that has arrived in weeks. He has received no guarantees so far from Prime Minister Netanyahu that help is coming to those still trapped in that part of the enclave.",

So, we see victims who are affected by these shrapnel injuries. In fact, there was a patient at Sibline Hospital, which is not too far from where I'm at right now. She was 28 weeks pregnant, affected by a bombing that had taken place, had her leg broken. And in the process, she lost that pregnancy because of the trauma that she sustained.I mean, we're talking about horrifying stories that are in place here. Just because you give an evacuation order does not mean that you're going to prevent any sort of civilian casualties in the process, especially when you're dropping massive bombs that are leveling eight- , nine-storey buildings. So, you're seeing the victims of these bombs, even if you hear that there's some sort of evacuation order. And the other thing I'd say is that there was that hospital that was evacuated recently because there was suspicion that there was something underneath there. All of the patients in that hospital were evacuated by the staff. All of the patients that were there getting treated got evacuated out of that hospital. That has serious health implications. That's dangerous. You can't just move patients who are in the hospital and take them somewhere else. So this is very concerning, and I'm -- again, I heard you guys mention that we're worried about what happened in Gaza may be repeated in Lebanon. If you look at the South now, it's repeated. Many of the villages are leveled, hospitals have been evacuated, totally empty and rendered defunct. It's very concerning.",

The problem is this system already is being stretched very thin, and so you're burdening -- you're overburdening it when you take a hospital out of commission and you're forcing patients to be transferred to other areas.I mean, remember, just because that -- just because people are doctors or nurses doesn't mean that they're not also going to be displaced, that they're not also on the run. And so, that's something that's important to consider with respect to the healthcare system being brought to its knees. The pager incident used a lot of resources. The walkie-talkie incident used a lot of resources, and that's very -- again, that's something that we all have to consider moving forward.",

Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg says this new fine really shows that that era is now over. It's really this TikTok that thrust this issue back into the limelight. This is from last November, and it shows American Airlines baggage handlers there essentially tossing a wheelchair down the chute of a jet way.The Department of Transportation says this is just one of thousands of cases where American Airlines mishandled wheelchairs between 2019 and 2023. This investigation also found that the airline failed to provide adequate assistance to disabled passengers. One passenger in a wheelchair told investigators that she felt like the airline treated her like cargo. So now, she just simply doesn't fly anymore. The punishment here is the largest ever of its type, and the federal government is fining American Airlines a total of $50 million. That fine also includes a mandate that American spend half that money, $25 million to reduce cases of damaged wheelchairs and make significant infrastructure upgrades. Now, you mentioned this in the lead and American Airlines insists it is already doing that a bit, having spent $175 million this year on disability services, new training, new technology. The airline also insists wheelchair and scooter handling, its rating has gone up 20 percent since 2022. But even still, a pretty big apology here from American Airlines, this is what it says. Despite these improvements, there are instances where the service the airline provides is disrupted, untimely, or results in harm to the passenger or their equipment. American takes all these complaints and claims seriously and works hard to remediate them. The message here, the big message, is that this is only just the start. And I want you to read now the statement from the federal government. It says these problems are not unique to American Airlines and allegations of wheelchair mishandling and inadequate wheelchair assistance are far too common. The Department of Transportation has active investigations into similar violations at other U.S. airlines, so other airlines have been put on notice here. But Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg says American was by far the worst offender, so that is where it had to start, Amara.",
