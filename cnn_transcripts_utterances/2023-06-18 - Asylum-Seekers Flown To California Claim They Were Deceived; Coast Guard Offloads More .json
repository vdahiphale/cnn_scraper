As you were saying, no major deliverables expected out of this visit, but U.S. officials are still calling it incredibly critical because they're seeking to normalize regular channels of communication between the U.S. and China. Simply, they haven't been regular over the course of the last few months, particularly military to military channels. And when you look at what's happened just in recent weeks, there were two close calls, military incidents in the South China Sea between the U.S. and China, in the air and in the sea. And that is, of course, of concern for the United States. Those were due to aggressive Chinese military maneuvers in the areas. And so, the U.S. is really looking to stand up those regular channels of communication. With President Biden saying just yesterday he's hoping that this visit can reduce the tensions between the two countries. And saying this about a potential visit with President Xi later this year.

Let's start by trying to contextualize some of the rhetoric. We've got the incendiary statements from Chinese diplomats, the silent treatment from the Chinese military officials. The relationship is clearly strained and has been for some time. But it's not like Secretary Blinken is going uninvited. He's not barging into Beijing. This is keeping a delayed appointment. So how much of the tension, the aggressive rhetoric that Kylie talked about will make it behind closed doors? How much of it should we discount as for potentially a domestic audience, but they're going to get to more once they close those doors? DAVID SANGER, CNN GLOBAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Victor. And I think you've got it just right. I mean, that's going to be the true measure. You may remember that when the Biden administration first came in, there was a meeting with Secretary Blinken and the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had with the Chinese just weeks into the presidency in Alaska. And the public portion of it, when the cameras were on, were full of vitriol, chiefly by the Chinese, but some back from Secretary Blinken. And then we were told once the cameras went away and the doors closed, they actually had a constructive conversation. Now, the relationship, as Kylie suggested before, has really spiraled downward. You've heard the list on the U.S. side, these military encounters we've had. Fortunately, no accidents yet, but one very possible. Certainly, the crackdowns that we've seen in Hong Kong and then the military action around Taiwan after Speaker Pelosi went to go visit. But on the Chinese side, there are some very serious complaints as well. And the biggest one has to do with something that most Americans didn't pay that much attention to. It came in October of last year when the United States put incredibly far reaching sanctions on China's ability not only to buy high-end semiconductors from us, useful in industrial equipment and military equipment, but the machinery to make them. And the Chinese saw that as containment.",

And one of the reasons is that when your economy is growing at 5 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent, what China got used to over the past couple of decades, your interest in a reset, you know, may be somewhat limited because everyone's doing pretty well.Well, right now, their economy is moving, growing at around 1 percent or 2 percent, 3 percent, something more akin to what Americans have been accustomed to. But it doesn't create jobs at the pace at which the Communist Party needs it in order to take care of that flow of people, mostly young men coming from the middle of the country out to the coast for manufacturing jobs. And so there's a Division in China right now between An Economic Team that says, hey, this is not going to cut it for us, and ultimately will lead to political instability. And a security team that has been winning the day so far saying, we're not about economic growth right now, we're about securing the country and China's role in the world.",
