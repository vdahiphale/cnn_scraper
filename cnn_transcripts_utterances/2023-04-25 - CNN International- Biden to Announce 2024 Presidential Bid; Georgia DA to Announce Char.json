      "sentences": "After months of waiting, of speculating, of everybody knowing it was coming but not necessarily knowing when it was coming, President Biden may, and I stress may, be announcing his run for reelection. Now, that \"may\" is contingent on the president himself. There is no question, over the course of the last 10 days, his closest advisers and outside allies have been laying the groundwork and accelerating efforts for a reelection announcement to come Tuesday morning. That announcement will come four years to the day after the anniversary of his first presidential announcement in 2020.Now during that campaign, he took on and defeated incoming President Donald Trump. Donald Trump who is now the frontrunner for the Republican nomination once again. And therein lies some significant challenges for both, but in particular President Biden who is 80 years old and would be 86 at the time of his second term coming to an end. Americans very clearly in poll after poll after poll aren't enthused about the match-up. And according to an NBC poll only 26 percent of Americans actually want to see Biden run again. If you look deep into the cross tabs of these polls, Democrats by a majority don't want Biden to run again, and those are some of the headwinds that the president will face. Their head ones, however, his team is confident he can overcome. Overcome in part due to the sweeping legislative agenda he was able to get past Congress in his first two years, an agenda he will spend much of the next year selling. And able to overcome because of who he will be facing, whether it's Trump or some other Republican where advisors are very clear, they believe they will have a crystal-clear contrast message that will resonate with the American people. Now the president himself still not committing to announcing reelection, saying to reporters on Monday at the White House when he was asked about it, it would be coming really soon. But it is very clear that after months of closely guarded secrecy when it came to personnel, when it came to timelines, when it came to what they were actually planning, moves are being made. Donors will be in town later this week. Personnel announcements are starting to come into the forefront. A campaign manager appears to be Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a senior advisor for the president, here at the White House. Other personnel likely to be announced as well. All that is necessary at this point is the announcement, which is still expected on Tuesday. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Donald Trump has one more ally in his corner in his quest for reelection. U.S. Senate Republican Steve Daines, who's also the GOP s campaign committee chair, endorsed the former president on Monday. Speaking with Trump's son, Don Jr., Daines had nothing but praise for Trump's time in office, calling it the best four years he's experienced in the Senate. A source close to the Trump campaign says Daines also has ties to many wealthy Republican donors, which could mean a much-needed boost to Trump's fundraising efforts.Donald Trump, of course, isn't the only Republican to announce his candidacy. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are also running. [04:05:00] And governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia are expected to enter the race. But here is the problem, most of them other than DeSantis are polling in the single digits. And they have to walk a fine line, making a name for themselves without alienating very loyal Trump supporters. Ron DeSantis is trying to make a name for himself on the world stage. He's on an overseas trip that includes stops in South Korea, Israel and the U.K. In Tokyo on Monday, he met with the Prime Minister and push trade between Japan and Florida. Donald Trump poked fun at the trip on social media, calling it an emergency round the world tour. Not to be outdone, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin is in Taiwan. He met with President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday to discuss trade and investment. Youngkin also signed an executive order establishing Virginia's first office for economic development in Taipei. He's also planning to visit Tokyo and Seoul during his time in Asia. Nikki Haley will speak to an audience today in Arlington, Virginia, about her stance against abortion. So far on the campaign trail, she's been reluctant to provide specifics about what kind of abortion policies she would support as president. A spokesperson says Haley wants to reframe the issue in a way that will appeal to critical swing voters. A source says she's going to make the case that you can't be a prolife conservative Republican and win a general election. North Dakota's Republican governor has signed a bill banning abortions at six weeks of pregnancy. The governor's office says there are no exceptions for rape or incest. In a statement to CNN, the governor says the bill clarifies and refines existing law and reaffirms North Dakota as a prolife state. The bill has an emergency clause and will become law as soon as the Secretary of State signs and files it. The Fulton County district attorney investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia says she will announce this summer whether she'll bring charges against the former president or his allies. Fani Willis is already pressing the Fulton County sheriff for heightened security ahead of the announcement. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has the details from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The prosecutor in Georgia that has been investigating Donald Trump and the actions he and others took after the 2020 election now has a time frame for announcing potential charges, charging decisions possible indictments even against potentially Donald Trump himself for those actions.Now the reason we are learning this is because district attorney Fani Willis sent letters to several members of local law enforcement in Georgia, essentially alerting them that they may have a security concern that is coming in what is called the court's fourth quarter in Fulton County, Georgia. That would be specifically July 11th to September first of this year. So, that's when those indictments could be announced. Willis writes in her letter. I am providing this letter to bring to your attention, the need for heightened security and preparedness in coming months due to this pending announcement. She specifically talks about the criminal investigation into interference in the Georgia 2020 general election. She also writes: Open-source intelligence has indicated the announcement of decisions in this case may provoke a significant public reaction. And then she signals that there are acts of violence that have taken place that would be outside First Amendment protests that would be protected speech. Remember Donald Trump, the things that he is being investigated for doing did ultimately lead to that violence at the U.S. Capitol in January of 2021, the riot whenever his supporters tried to overtake Congress and stop the certification of the presidency, his loss of that election. And so, Fani Willis is signaling that that is all part of the thinking here, and also, she's taking into consideration the need for security around that courthouse, especially after Donald Trump already was indicted once for totally separate behavior related to hush money payments in New York. The allegations there caused him to say he was expecting to be arrested and then calling for protests. And so, we do know that there was a lot of law enforcement coordination before that, locking down that courthouse. And Willis is clearly signaling to local law enforcement that they will need to be ready in summer and into the early fall of this year. Again, we don't know exactly what is going to be indicated, but it is quite clear, the charges are on the near horizon. Katelyn Polantz, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

COORDINATOR: Our best advice to most Americans, who are still in Sudan, despite the warnings to leave, is to shelter in place. Stay somewhere safe and secure before moving about. That said, we are providing information to all those Americans we can reach and who wants to stay in touch with us about these convoys that might be leaving towards Port Sudan overground. And what the United States military is doing is providing overwatch, unmanned aerial assets of these convoys so that we can stay, have some level of situational awareness and stay informed about their progresses as they make this very, very long journey from Khartoum to Port Sudan. We're only temporarily suspending our operations at the embassy. We're not walking away from Sudan. We'd love to get those diplomats back in. We'd love to get that embassy back up and running to provide services to our citizens there and two others. But we've got to do it when it's safe to do it, and it's not safe right now.
