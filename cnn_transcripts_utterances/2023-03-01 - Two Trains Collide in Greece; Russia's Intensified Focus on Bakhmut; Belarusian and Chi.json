Rescue workers say at least36 people have been killed, the death toll is expected to rise. Greece has announced three days of mourning for the victims. Some of those who survived, they say they had to find a way through fires that erupted in the derailed passenger cars. Let's bring in CNN's Eleni Giokos, who is across the story. The Greek president has described this crash as an unimaginable tragedy. What is the latest as we understand it from the scene? ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Yes, look, people are in absolute shock. It has been called the train of death and at least 36 people have lost their lives; 350 people were on that passenger train. The latest now, about 18 hours after that initial collision, and the two first carriages you can see on your screen right now, the first two carriages caught alight. The heat was so intense that it completely mangled and destroyed those first two carriages. The third carriages where most of the fatalities occurred and rescue operations are still underway. Right now, we know the DNA testing is occurring to identify the people who lost their lives. There are reports of family members and mostly parents of young university students that are waiting for any kind of news about their loved ones. There was a three-day break in Greece; many people were returning to Thessaloniki from Athens. And here's the thing, this is two trains traveling in opposite directions on the same track. So many questions about how this happened, why this happened. The station master has been arrested, currently in police custody. And we've heard a short while ago that the transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, who spoke earlier at the crash site, who teared up, saying that anything he says will not be sufficient. But they are going to investigate. But he resigned and he says it is a fact that we received the Greek railway system in a state that is not up to 21st century standards, in these 3.5 years we have made every effort to improve this reality. But it has not been sufficient to prevent such a bad incident. People in Greece are in absolute shock. People use this line, this journey, they travel extensively on this. What is even more concerning is there was a huge train delay earlier in the day from another cable electrical fault that occurred. So there are many questions about how this happened. But Becky, right now, still the main efforts are continued for rescue operations and the hope is, there aren't any more victims after this head-on collision.",

One of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's advisers tells CNN, Ukraine's military will weigh all options, including strategically pulling back if needed.

Defensive positions by Ukrainians are getting hit very badly by the Russians. There is no announcement yet on whether Ukrainians may pull out of Bakhmut, a strategic withdrawal. It is clearly something that is being considered, because Ukrainians do appear to be on their hind feet. The Russians are pushing forward. The primary Russian forces in and around Bakhmut have been the Wagner mercenary group, those contractors, those convicts recruited from prisons. Now we understand, according to Ukrainian officials, it is the more elite Wagner forces who have experience fighting elsewhere around the world that are making this main push into the city, around the city, Wagner claims to have taken a territory north of Bakhmut. They do appear to be trying to encircle the city. But for now, Becky, Ukrainian troops standing their ground. One soldier that CNN spoke with yesterday saying, they are not going to leave that city without a fight. But it is getting incredibly difficult, so you can imagine right now Ukraine is likely focusing on trying to defend their positions west of the city, if they do need to withdraw, to make sure that, even if Russia were to take Bakhmut, then it would be purely a symbolic victory. But it would be a victory nonetheless, because it would give Russia another foothold in Donbas. But it would have come at great cost. They have lost thousands of forces. Ukrainian troops have also suffered severely as well. So it would be a loss for Ukraine but, in the short term at least, it would not alter the battlefield all that significantly -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky, so the FBI, of course, has joined the Department of Energy in being the twointelligence agencies who believe that this virus did leak from a lab in Wuhan. But we should note that is still the minority view. Just backing up a bit, the FBI did conclude in 2021 with moderate confidence, according to our sources, that the virus did leak from a lab. But this is significant because it is the first time we are hearing Chris Wray, the FBI director, actually come out and confirm that. It had been reported previously. But he has not spoken about it really since that assessment in 2021. So that indicates that, you know, the FBI clearly is becoming a little bit bolder and they have not changed their assessment over the past nearly two years as to what actually caused this pandemic. Chris Wray, the FBI director, is really doubling down, really doubling down yesterday and saying that the FBI's assessment is that this was, you, know this came from a lab. Now this was again a minority view among the intelligence community, which still writ large cannot agree on how this pandemic actually began. In fact, the majority of the eight intelligence agencies that reviewed this data and came to an assessment said that they do believe still that it was -- it was -- came from nature and that it was -- came from the wild rather than that it started in a lab. So we are seeing now that there is a continued divide within the intelligence community. But they all agree on two things, the first being that this was not genetically engineered as a bioweapon. China did not mean for this to be leaked. And Chinese officials did not appear to have any foreknowledge that this would leak, if that is, in fact, what happened. And the other thing they agree on is that this is going to be very difficult to determine conclusively, the origins of this pandemic, without the full cooperation of Beijing into an investigation into how this pandemic began. And there is no real confidence here in the U.S. that the Chinese are going to be participating in any kind of serious inquiry into how the pandemic began. So right now, officials saying we just really may never know how this pandemic actually started -- Becky.",
