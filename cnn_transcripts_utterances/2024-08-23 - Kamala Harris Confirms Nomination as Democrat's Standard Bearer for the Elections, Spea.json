WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: For four days, there was a jubilant celebration here in Chicago, culminating in Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday night formally accepting her party's nomination for the presidency. But despite all of this, the confetti and the balloons and the celebration, I am told that the vice president remains clear-eyed about what could come next after Chicago. I spoke with somebody who recently spoke with the vice president. And they said that even though the vice president with them didn't use the word honeymoon, the idea is definitely there. The idea that the honeymoon period that we have seen over the past month or so could come to an end at some point and that there's a recognition by the vice president and others on down in the Harris campaign, that the enthusiasm and the momentum that have fueled Harris' quick ascension to the top of her, the party's ticket that those things could wane for reasons that may or may not be under the vice president's control. But for the time being, Thursday night, the partying, the celebration, all of those things continuing in Chicago, including with the vice president heading over to the Queenie Supper Club here in the United Center, where she was going to be greeted by supporters. And also there's something else she is celebrating tonight, her 10th wedding anniversary with second gentleman Doug Emhoff. M.J. Lee, CNN, in Chicago. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think last night we also heard some of that, a strong line in defense of Israel's right to defend itself as well as the threat from Iran, but also saying that the actions of Israel are concerning that we need a ceasefire.And I think Harris didn't have to deliver extensive policy points last night.

It deals not only with the export of goods, but with importing fuel to Crimea. And that ferry was apparently doing just that.Kim, there was an attack on this ferry, according to Russian officials who are blaming Ukrainians for it that caused this huge fire. I believe we have social media video to show you of that rescue workers were able to evacuate everyone on board, but that ferry did sink with 30 tanks of fuel on board, I think. Although we don't have, of course, any comment from Ukraine at this time to Russia, this is absolutely yet again a sign that it is vulnerable, that its war machine can be struck deep in the Black Sea, but also, of course, in Kursk, where Ukrainian forces are continuing that surprise offensive they launched two weeks ago, but Russian forces have been able to divert to that front line, able to push back, able to create more resistance. But what Ukrainian officials are most concerned about right now, Kim, is a very different diversion. And that is one in eastern Ukraine, where, as you mentioned, Russian troops are advancing more quickly than expected. The city of Pokrovsk, which is right now very much near that front line, everyone there has been asked to evacuate within two weeks. Already record numbers are fleeing every day. Local officials saying that parents are going so far as to hide their children from these mandatory evacuations. So true scenes of distress playing out in eastern Ukraine where you have these Russian troops advancing very quickly, claiming yet another village just in the last 24 hours, but Ukraine carrying on its offensive in Kursk trying to push and break that Russian war machine, Kim.

That's how this all came about.As far as the messaging that we will hear from this meeting, well, based off of statements from New Delhi prior to this meeting and based off of statements from Prime Minister Modi speaking yesterday in Warsaw, he's very much trying to portray himself as a statesman. In fact, if we look at his remarks from yesterday in Warsaw. He talks about diplomacy, dialogue, being an advocate for peace in the region. But as you alluded to, there are some challenges. First of all, the meeting with Vladimir Putin in Russia, where these two leaders are seen embracing each other. In addition, India has not condemned Russia's aggression, its invasion of Ukraine. It has called for a ceasefire, but it has not made a direct condemnation. In fact, if we look at the United Nations, it has abstained from resolutions and dialogue relating to the Ukraine issue. Now, India may have some geopolitical reasons for that. It obviously has strong trade ties with Russia and is trying to be a global player, but these are going to be the focus of likely some tough discussions between these two world leaders. It's also important to stress that this relationship between Ukraine and India, it's not new. This is one that dates back to the early 90's. These two nations have enjoyed trade together. They have, India, for example, sends its medical students to Ukraine for trading. As one official from New Delhi pointed out, there are a number of issues that will be on the table, including economic ties, infrastructure, and defense as well as this current conflict. So this is certainly going to be a relationship that these nations are going to want to discuss not only because of this conflict taking place with Ukraine and Russia, but also the broader implications for their cultures, for their citizens and for their economies, Kim.",

They have complicated relationships with China and they know what it means to live near big, big autocracy, which can be very dangerous. So I think it's in the best interest of India that international law would be restored and will work in the world. And this would not happen if Ukraine will not win in this war, because the international law is at stake and international law and order is at stake. So we hope very much that India will start to pressure Russia to start, will start to have a real position.

People are walking past saying, India, it's India's fault. And that isthe message that we are hearing in Bangladesh, that it was India that opened the floodgates to one of its dams just past the border. We are virtually on the border of Bangladesh and India. And that has caused this extreme flooding. You know, Bangladesh is no stranger to flooding. It has them every single year. And in actual fact, they have developed an early warning system, probably one of the best in South Asia. So the fact that there was no warning on Wednesday night when this surge of water came down the river, you know, Bangladeshis are absolutely furious. Now, India denies that they opened the floodgates, but it also says that there is an automatic release that is triggered when there is too much water. There has been no apology from India, just further infuriating people here in Bangladesh. But you know, this is unprecedented. That is what we are hearing from the government, that this is an unprecedented flood situation. And this is a huge challenge as well, Kim, for the interim chief advisor, Mohammed Yunus, an 84-year-old sworn in just two weeks ago, after the mass uprisings here in Bangladesh, which lasted for over a month, and saw the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheik Hussain. I think it's also really important to stress that Sheik Hussain has taken refuge in India. So like I say, a huge challenge for the Chief Advisor. He has called on the military, the army, the navy for volunteers to come out and help the flood affected people. And the latest numbers that we are getting, Kim, is 3.6 million Bangladeshis have been impacted by these floods here in the southeast of the country. It has spread over 10 districts. And the water here, there were Friday players just a short time ago, and the people here, they are wading through. This is what they've been living now for days. We also, Kim, and I think this is really important to note that guest houses have been affected, livelihoods have been affected, there's been a very low death count so far, but we just saw a baby rushed to a clinic. It had fallen into the flood waters, it was lying on a bed, the bed was surrounded by water, the one year old tumbled into the water. We've just received amazing news that the baby is alive, but the mother walked past, she was screaming, she was crying. This has a human impact, this is not just about houses, this is about lives, people's livelihoods. So Bangladesh is going through so much right now -- now and you know there is a real shortage of boats so there is a truck after truck coming down the highway with boats on board to rescue the people who are trapped on their on their on their rooms and in their houses, Kim.",

But if they come and rest on our platform here with the wide slats, we get to climb into wetsuits, swim below them and disentangle them. And we use a very special tool for that.This is our cutter and it is a hooked blade on the inside, very thin to fit through the wooden slats. And the idea is that we'll swim in a wetsuit underneath the platform. We poke this through the slats, hook it onto the entanglement and give it a really good tug. And that'll snap it off the seal's neck. From the seals' point of view, he's resting in the sun. He'll feel a tug on his neck. He'll stand up, he'll bark at the seal next to him and lie down again. He doesn't even know there was a human involved in removing this plastic off his neck.
