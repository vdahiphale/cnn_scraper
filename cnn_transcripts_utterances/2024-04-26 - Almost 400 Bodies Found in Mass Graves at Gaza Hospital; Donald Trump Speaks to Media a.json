Now the prosecution's first witness in the Donald Trump hush money trial returns to the stand when court resumes in about a half hour from now. We've already seen the president enter now. Trump's attorneys will continue cross examining David Pecker, the former publisher of \"The National Enquirer\". Over three days of testimony now Pecker has detailed several so called catch and kill operations to prevent allegations of affairs involving Trump from becoming public. Trump has denied you remember any of these affairs ever happened? The prosecution's catch and kill schemes were part of a broader effort to keep negative stories about Trump under wraps during the 2016 presidential campaign and to try and undermine the integrity of the election. Now Judge Juan Merchan may also announce a ruling on the prosecution's claim that Trump has repeatedly violated his gag order on the case. And remember, the prosecution continues to say that he is in a state of really violating that gag order again and again. The judge now says he's scheduled another hearing next week on some of those new alleged violations. We're going to throw it now back to Lynda in Atlanta as we go to the rest of this day's top stories Lynda.",

Well, protests in support of Palestinians in Gaza have spread across a growing number of college campuses here in the U.S.and some are facing crackdowns that by police take a look. This is the chaotic scene from Emory University in Atlanta where 28 people were arrested on Thursday, including two professors. A CNN crew witnessed police using a stun gun on at least one protester who authorities say was a resisting arrest. In Washington officials at George Washington University asked the police to assist in relocating an unauthorized protest and cabinet and on the West Coast the University of Southern California says it's canceling the main stage graduation ceremony next month over safety concerns.

Additionally, Abby also reporting that those students were told that as part of these ongoing negotiations, that they are discussing the possibility of a potential statement that will be issued either by the university, or by the president herself, possibly addressing the events of last week. You recall, the Columbia University actually reached out to the NYPD last week, asked him for assistance to step onto the campus to then assist what was taking place here in removing an encampment that would eventually simply pop up again. So that really gives you an idea of what the current situation is right now that's playing out here. Initially, there was a conversation -- that talks about a possible deadline. However yesterday as we heard from organizers this is really more of a timeline for these conversations that are happening right now as they tried to bring this to a peaceful resolution.

And it's remarkably similar to what you've been seeing in New York and another American campus. What they've been saying is that so far, the negotiations are not going well. The university is not giving them their principle demand, which is similarly to the United States, the idea that Sciences School should boycott any companies that have ties to Israel. In fact, what the student leaders has been saying is that the administration is trying to do as they did on Wednesday, at another site and bring in the police to clear them out extremely controversial it was Wednesday, and so it would prove again, should that happen. Again there also says a student leader being threatened with suspension from the school should they carry on their protest. As you can imagine Lynda, this is more grist to their mill. And what the students say is that they intend to stay here occupying this one of the main sites of Sciences School University -- of France's most prestigious. This site they've been occupying since yesterday. And they say they're going to stay until their demands is met, not just keeping up pressure on the administration of their university, but more broadly, trying to draw attention, as students have on American University to the plight of Palestinians inside Gaza, and calling for an urgent end to the war.",

Well, the university protests also highlighting thetoll the war has had on the school system in Gaza. United Nations experts say that after six months of Israeli attacks, 80 percent of Gaza's schools have been destroyed. 261 teachers killed along with 95 University professors. Hundreds more teachers have been injured with those numbers growing by the day, and it's left more than half a million children without access to education. The UN team expressed deep concern that Israel may be committing what they call a scholastic aside, they say the destruction could have a devastating long term impact on the fundamental rights of people to learn and freely express them. Well, authorities in Gaza have concluded their search of mass graves at Nasr medical complex in the south of the strip. They found almost 400 bodies, including some still wearing surgical gowns. An official from the Palestinian civil defense in Gaza said 165 of them have been identified. Israeli forces entered that complex in February in an operation that they said targeted Hamas. Well meantime, the Pentagon says U.S. forces have begun work on a temporary pier that will be used to let ships deliver humanitarian and direct aid to Gaza. Construction is being carried out at sea the finished pier will be connected to the shore later. Well, I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond who's in Jerusalem and our Natasha Bertrand from the Pentagon. Good to have you both with us.

And Egyptian officials have long expressed concerns about such an operation and also the possibility that it could send Palestinian refugees flooding into Egypt, something that the Egyptian government very much wants to avoid. And so we know that Israeli officials were in Egypt earlier this week trying to work towards a possible agreement today. An Egyptian Delegation I'm told is in Israel to continue those negotiations and also to talk security coordination with the Israelis around a potential Rafah offensive. We don't have the timing for that offensive. But there's certainly a sense that it is looming over these negotiations. And that if these talks now fail, that you could soon see the Israeli military beginning to order evacuations from Rafah and then beginning to send troops in there. So no clear sense yet, of how promising these latest talks are.

But we do know that he is allowed to say things like he has been saying over and over again. There is, however, a situation right now where the judge is looking at the prosecutors wish to hold Donald Trump in criminal contempt or in contempt in this criminal case, for as many as 14 alleged violations of that gag order, especially talking about Michael Cohen, who is expected to be an upcoming star witness in this trial. Talking about David Pecker who's, on the stand now saying yesterday that he was being very nice and then talking about the jury calling them liberal democrats or liberal activists at various points over the last several days.

And in terms of what happened is thatthe New York court of appeals found that the testimony allowed from victims, alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein that wasn't charged in the indictment that. That wasn't supposed to be allowed into evidence that Harvey Weinstein did not get a fair trial, because it seems that the jury made a decision based on charges or based on victims and testimony that wasn't part of the charges itself instead of the charge victims in this case.",

But just to be clear, this decision by the court of appeal does not reflect on the credibility of these victims. It doesn't at all. The decision was strictly based on one of fundamental fairness, whether it should have been admissible at trial. It doesn't say that the court of appeals doesn't believe these victims. So what happened to them? They're just saying that in terms of the fundamental fairness of this trial, that certain testimony shouldn't have been allowed. And I hope that victims out there of sexual assault are not deterred by this decision, and for them to notice still this MeToo movement, that their words and what happened to them is still valid, and they should be heard that they should not be considered victimless.",

So it's unknown whether the California appellate court will have the same decision as the New York appellate court. So that will have to be weighed and we have to wait and see what the California court of appeals is going to do. In the meantime, though, he still continues to serve that 16 year sentence. The question will be a New York, though, is whether they are going to retry Harvey Weinstein, when they're going to retry Harvey Weinstein? And what the bail conditions are going to be for Harvey Weinstein, because now he no longer has a New York conviction on these charges?",

      "sentences": "Well, the similarities in terms of how people comparing is the same decision making by the judge whether there's some prior bad acts, forexample, how you hearing the testimony, having to deal with Karen McDougal and having to deal with the man at the hotel in terms of whether Donald Trump had fathered a child whether that testimony should be allowed. And so those are the comparisons that are being made. Obviously, every judge has to make a decision as to the relevance of what evidence is allowed. And they take that chance. And if they do allow that evidence that a court will say it has nothing to do with the current charges itself. Also to take into account that some of the same decision making as to what evidence is allowed, and whether when Harvey Weinstein if he would have been allowed to testify that if he would have testified he would have been cross examined or some of these things, is what precluded him from testifying. Now, when we deal with Donald Trump, there are certain things that he's going to be cross examined on that because of these rulings that he is allowed to be cross examined on and that defense attorneys can argue that look, he's not being allowed to have a fair trial, because it's precluding him from being able to testify. So again, this is same typical issues, but it's all up to the judge to decide what is he going to be allowed in? And ultimately, if you make the wrong decision, and if there's a conviction, a court of appeals would actually review the decision making.",

It jumped 2.7 percent for the year that ended in March, that's higher than economistspredicted and above February's number prices rose by 0.3 percent in March alone. We're here to break it all down for us is our very own Matt Egan, who joins us live from New York. Good to see you, Matt. So inflation accelerated for the first three months of this year largely due to those certain gas prices, mortgages, and of course rent. What does this mean for those hoping for an interest rate cut?",

      "sentences": "Yeah Lynda, this is not the report that really we would be hoping for if you're looking for an interest rate -- no doubt thecost to borrow right now mortgages, credit cards, car loans, is really high. And the hope had been that inflation would cool off enough to allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates. But these interest rate cuts, it just keeps getting delayed. I mean, people had hoped for March that didn't happen. June looks unlikely, July now even September may not happen. Now, these latest numbers, as you mentioned, shows that inflation heated up in March 2.7 percent is the annual rate and this is harder than expected. It is moving in the wrong direction, versus 2.5 percent in February, what's important, though, is to look at the trend. And when you zoom out and you look at a where this metric has been, you can see that it was above 7 percent, two years ago. That's what that chart shows. So we're clearly miles away from that meet much improvement in large part because of the Fed interest rate hikes. But the problem is I think that chart also shows that some of the progress has really stalled out, in fact, inflation is starting to tick higher in the last few months. And that is a concern, because at the end of the day, we're talking about the cost of living, right. So the higher those numbers go, the more expensive life is for all of us. And we do talk to a lot of people who are frustrated with how expensive it is to get food and gasoline. Of course, housing is a big thing. But also there are other concerns too, like the cost to insure your car, the cost to get your pet to send your pet to the vet, baby formula. All of these things have gotten more expensive. And so I think the concern is that some of this progress in the inflation front has sort of stalled out, Lynda.",
