Now, the attack came after Ukraine fired longer-range American missiles into Russia for the first time this week. That's according to Russia's defense ministry and two U.S. officials. CNN's Fred Pleitgen picks up the story from Moscow.

Several sub-warheads impacting in Dnipro, apparently not fully laden with explosives, causing no explosions on the ground, but aiming to deliver a strong message from the Russian leader. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In combat conditions, the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was also tested, in this case with a ballistic missile and non-nuclear hypersonic equipment. Our missile men call it Oreshnik. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Ukrainians exclusively sharing these photos of the missile debris with CNN, Kyiv saying the speed, trajectory, and impact of the rocket bore the hallmarks of an intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of carrying thermonuclear warheads, although Western officials say it was not an ICBM. \"Today, our crazy neighbor once again showed what he really is, and how he despises dignity, freedom, and people's lives in general,\" Ukraine's president said.

MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Ohtani made history as the first player ever to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single season. He's also won MVP this time solely as a designated hitter. He didn't pitch this year because, yes, he was recovering from elbow surgery while breaking all these records. And Japan couldn't be prouder. Fans here have been eagerly awaiting their favorite baseball superstar to win MVP once again. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I thought he was a monster for being able to hit that hard in rehab. I admire him. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Japan also hoped he'd win MVP unanimously, and he did. This also marks his first MVP win in the National League, and he achieved it in a year when his team, the Dodgers, won the World Series. So, even though this is his third MVP win, in a lot of ways, this one feels even more special for both him and his country.
