We begin today with the Israel-Hamas war and a shift here in the U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a long and steadfast supporter of Israel, made a stunning break with his longtime friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and called him an obstacle to peace in the region. That comes as the U.S. works to build a floating pier to deliver aid to desperate people in war-torn Gaza, while, early this week, negotiators are expected to -- later this week, I should say, are expected to start talks again about a potential deal to pause fighting and free more of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas since October 7, when Hamas started all this by attacking Israel and brutally killing more than 1,000 civilians. Here with me now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thank you so much for joining me. Let's start with that potential deal, sir. One hundred hostages, about, are still being held by Hamas. You're sending that negotiating team to Qatar in the coming days to talk about a potential deal, free hostages in exchange for a six-week pause in fighting. As you know, Hamas is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for roughly 40 female hostages. Are you open to that? Are you close to a deal?",

That's like leaving a quarter of the Hamas -- of the Nazi terrorist army in Germany and saying, no, we're not going to finish the last quarter and we're not going into Berlin. Most Israelis overwhelmingly support the position that we have to go in.

They support those policies that I'm putting forward. And to present that as something that is, I'm an outlier, it doesn't represent the majority of the people of Israel, is simply a fallacy. And I will tell you, the other fallacy is, they're saying, well, most Palestinians don't support the Hamas massacre.

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  The prime minister's presentation proved the necessity of Chuck Schumer's speech. Chuck Schumer's speech was an act of courage, an act of love for Israel. And I wish the prime minister would read the whole speech, because he speaks with great vehemence about the need to defeat Hamas. He is concerned about the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and the very, very dangerous attitude of the right-wing Israeli government. The issue of food in Gaza is a very big one. And either the prime minister, Netanyahu, is unaware or ill-informed. But the head of the World Central Kitchen, Jose Andres, who's there, as you mentioned, Cindy McCain, World Food Program, and any other of these entities that are there to feed the people will tell you, there is starvation, there is famine, there is dehydration, because it has not -- Israel has not allowed the food and the humanitarian assistance to go right in. So, again, it's a fact that so many people are dying from lack of food. It's really a very sad situation. Now, from the standpoint of Chuck Schumer, he is, as you had mentioned, the leading Jewish elected official in our country in history, in history. He has -- he loves Israel, as we do. We support Israel. And the fact that he made this statement should be listened to, because Israel's reputation is at risk because of what is happening in Gaza. Now, we all agree, many of us, Hamas is a terrorist organization. They should be defeated. But what happens next? We have called for a two- state solution. In the Democratic Party, I was chair of the platform committee in 1992, where we called for a two-state solution. Netanyahu has been against that. But what is the solution?",

But, again, let's put that aside and let's just say, as we go forward, what is wrong with advocating for elections in a democracy? And you know. You mentioned the polls. You see the thousands and thousands of people are in the streets, even last night, in Israel. But, again, it's a democracy, and people have different views, and they express them, and that's a beautiful thing. But for him to say -- what does that say if he won't even say that, as the war winds down, the people of Israel should speak? That's all Chuck was saying. But read the speech, because it condemns Hamas. It criticizes Abbas and the Palestinian Authority for not being good partners for peace. Read the speech. The right wing -- I mean, sad to say, when you listen to Netanyahu, I thought it was a very weak presentation and, again, argued for Chuck Schumer's speech. But, nonetheless, he's probably the most moderate person in that coalition. And it's really a sad state of affairs. Let me just -- if I just may say this. I love Israel. I love the Israeli people. And this is how we think of them, about shared values. I remember being there as speaker on one visit to Hadassah Hospital, and they told me they had just dealt with a clash between Palestinians and Israelis, and they treated them both the same. And they said: \"We didn't treat the Palestinian differently because they were Palestinian. We treated them the same because we are Jewish.\" The values are so -- have been so clear. Now, we have to stop Hamas. They're a terrorist organization. What they did on October 7 was barbaric. We must free the hostages. Think of it if it were your brother, sister, mother, father, child. Any one of us would be insistent on that. But, as you have indicated, it's not a matter if -- if you do it. It's how you do it. And to do it at the expense of children and their well- being is really what Chuck was addressing.
