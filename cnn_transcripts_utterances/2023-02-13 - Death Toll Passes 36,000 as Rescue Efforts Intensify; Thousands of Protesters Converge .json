This is one of more than 200 trucks, which is left this warehouse over the last week filled with essential items, blankets, clothes, toiletries, electric heaters. And of course, the people that will be receiving this aid are so desperately in need of that humanitarian assistance. The coordinators here, this center say that there simply isn't enough. They need more support. They need more aid from the Turkish government and crucially, they need more aid from the international community. They say they do not want to be forgotten because of course thousands of families thousands of people are depending on this aid on that support.

But they really wanted to come to Jerusalem; they can be essentially in the backyard of these legislators to show them why they were opposed to this. They really see this as a weakening of Israel's independent judiciary. They see this, as you noted as something for Benjamin Netanyahu that can benefit him personally as he faces corruption charges. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu denies this. He says that these are necessary reforms that have been a long time coming. And we heard from the Israeli President last night Isaac Hertzog in a rare televised address, calling for consensus saying there's voices on both sides that that we can listen to, we can come together and we need to talk. Because otherwise, he was warning that Israel could be on a violent collision course where he said it would be essentially brother fighting against brother. And Becky, even U.S. President Joe Biden weighed in.

Now they're stopping short of saying they're going to halt the pace of this legislation, which still needs to go through its first few readings.

Those objects were flying at around 40,000 feet and had balloon like features with a small metal cylinder underneath officials said. Sunday's object over Lake Huron was flying at around 20,000 feet and it was described by officials as octagonal with potential surveillance capabilities. The incidents have sparked confusion and prompted bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows. But part of the problem here is that the both of the second and the third objects were shot down in very remote areas. So my guess is that there's just not a lot of information out there yet to share. BERTRAND (voice over): After a Chinese spy balloon transmitted the U.S. earlier this month and was also shot down. The North American Aerospace Defense Command readjusted its filters to better spots low moving targets operating above a certain altitude official said, which may be leading to more detection. But officials say they won't know more about the objects until they can recover and analyze all of the debris. The incidents have also raised questions about whether similar objects have simply gone undetected in the past. And whether shooting each one down is the right response. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): What's been come clear in the public discussion is that we don't really have adequate radar systems. We certainly don't have an integrated missile defense system. We're going to have to begin to look at the United States airspace as one that we need to defend and that we need to have appropriate sensors to do so. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Earlier a 25 year old woman was pulled out of the rubble alive 178 hours since the earthquake hit. But hope is fading as the likelihood of similar rescues and pockets of life grows colder with each passing hour. Meantime, six more U.N. trucks carrying food and relief have crossed into northwestern Syria from Turkey after another convoy entered on Sunday. And the European Parliament is discussing the EU's response to the situation. An ominous warning today from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says we are seeing the start of a new Russian offensive in Ukraine. It comes amid word that Russia is sending thousands of new troops to war. And the Ukrainian military spokesperson says they are seeing a record amount of artillery fire in the eastern part of his country. Military aid from NATO countries has been a crucial lifeline for Ukraine's military since the start of this war nearly 12 months ago, but some of the weapons provided to Kyiv were made decades ago. Sam Kiley reports on how Ukrainians are making do with military equipment from another era. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Carrying weapons designed 75 years ago, these Ukrainians are grateful that they're training with an American vehicle, even if it's from another age. They're a mixture of combat Veterans and relatively new recruits. But all have been fighting in Ukraine's eastern front with Russia in the Cauldrons of Bakhmut and Soledar. That Commander-in-Chief Volodymyr Zelenskyy has begged the West for modern NATO standard equipment, and he's been given some modern weapons. But not the strategic weapons like long range missiles and jets that he says he needs. Meanwhile, Ukraine's war is expected to intensify and Ukrainians make do with old Soviet weapons. And workhorse hand me downs like these M113s, aluminum troop carriers, which the U.S. army started using in 1960. About 400 have been given to Ukraine by the U.S. and others. This has been patched up since it took a direct hit in Bakhmut, where the top gunner was killed. To say that it's old, well, it looks old, but it just looks battered, but it does the job 100 percent, he tells me. Ukraine has been given better air defenses, better artillery, better missile systems than it had before. But Zelenskyy said that's not enough in any way. It's not the best equipment, often, not even second best. KILEY (on camera): The Ukrainian military are keen to stress that they're really, really grateful for all and any help that they're given. These armored personnel carriers from America are better than some of what they started the war with. And they're an important part of the battlefield replacement. They've been here since the summer this one already needs a new engine. KILEY (voice over): Ukraine captures a lot of what it needs from Russia. It's desperately cannibalizing ancient equipment for parts, like a 20th century nation under siege, not a nation that's backed by America and by NATO allies. Making do is what Ukraine has done. Privately though commanders here make it clear that it's going to take more than an iron will and hand me down weapons for them to win this war. Sam Kiley, CNN in southern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
