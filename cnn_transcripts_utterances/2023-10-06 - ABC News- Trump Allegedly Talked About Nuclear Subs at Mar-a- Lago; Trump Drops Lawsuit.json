It doesn't matter how classified it is, merely that it relates to the national defense with another person.So, it could be a crime to have -- convey this information. Now, any -- there's any number of reasons why something won't appear in an indictment. Number one, they have some reason not to trust the evidence that they have, perhaps there are some credibility issues with this witness. Number two, they could charge it down the road if they get more witnesses or evidence to back it up. Or number three, they just feel that they are not confident with what they have -- the prosecutors are not confident with what they have, and just simply chosen not to prosecute it. All -- those kinds of decisions go into cases all of the time, and that might have happened here.",

If in fact the president is convicted of the crime on the other charges, merely having engaged in similar conduct could be the kind of thing that could come up at sentencing even if not at trial. Number two, again, they maybe eventually thinking about charging this down the road. Number three, he might have other information to provide about conversations he's had with the president.So, prosecutors tend to be overinclusive, often in their witness list because they have to turn them over to the defense. Anybody you're even thinking about calling as a witness is relevant information. And so, you know, I'm not shocked that they would put someone like this on even if the things he has to say aren't things that they could charge as crimes.",

He had been suing his former fixer, Michael Cohen, for some time because he says that Cohen breached his professional obligation and the stuff that he wrote. He was going after Cohen for stuff that he said. And then he dropped it, basically just before he was going to have to give a deposition in this case. Why do you think that is, what does it tell you about what Donald Trump may or may not fear, or what his intentions are general?",

I can't divine what they were thinking. But merely an approaching deposition date probably seemed like the kind of image that got him to say that it wasn't worth pursuing.Number one, any time a witness goes into a deposition, he is creating another record of evidence. And his attorneys in his criminal cases were probably screaming to the high heavens that the moment you open up your mouth in another case, you could put -- open yourself up to far more trouble. And so, I just think it's the fact that it was going to happen rather than sticking it to Michael Cohen that led the president to back out here. And look, you see this in criminal cases, too, where cases tend to plead out right before trial. Where it's the reality of knowing what consequences you might face that makes people really second-guess how much they want the fight the cases.",

You know -- and I think, Kate, this just again highlights, you know, I sound like a broken record sometimes, but this just highlights the closeness of Fox News, this right-wing channel with the GOP, you know. There's a reason that they're going to Fox News for this joint interview. And that's because it effectively is an arm of the Republican Party. Now, Bret Baier, of course, is a little different than the people like Sean Hannity who have actually made endorsements already in the speaker race, but nonetheless, they are close.
