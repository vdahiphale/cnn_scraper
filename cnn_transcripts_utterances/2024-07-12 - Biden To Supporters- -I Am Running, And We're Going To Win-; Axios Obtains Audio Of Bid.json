So, Rudy Giuliani is liked by fewer Americans now, than Richard Nixon was when he was forced to resign the presidency back in 1974. Quite a fall from grace. It's quite honestly sad.",

I actually think it makes us stronger. Think about it this way. And I think the 2016 analogy is real. A lot of people in the party thought things were off-kilter towards the end of the 2016 campaign, the obvious example of our candidate not going to Wisconsin, which was such a key state. A lot of people in Wisconsin felt that. Those voices being heard and not shut down is actually part of what makes a party stronger, and a candidacy stronger. So now, you actually see Joe Biden responding to these voices, and showing us more. And that's what people need to see. I would be very worried if everyone was feeling something was wrong, but no one had the decency or the concern for our country to say it. Because ironically, the only way to make this campaign better, whether it's Joe Biden, or if Joe Biden decides to step aside, and it's Kamala Harris, the only way to make the campaign the strongest it can be, is to be open about the things we have to address.",

And I think it is head in the sand if you act like that didn't happen, if you think you could just like un-see it.

You are not going to, just a week or two, after a debate, say I've made a final decision. It's a painful, it's a difficult decision. It takes a while.

It made the staff of the campaign, it made the staff of the White House, also incredibly worried. It varies from person to person. Some people are sort of coming back around, and are loyalists, and are very dug in. Some people feel disillusioned that they feel that they've lost confidence, and so are their leaders.

The actor, seen sobbing, as the judge read her decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY L. MARLOWE SOMMER, JUDGE, FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO: The sanction of dismissal is the only warranted remedy. The jury has been sworn. Jeopardy has attached. And a mistrial would not be based upon manifest necessity. Further, the sanction of dismissal is warranted in this case. The State has repeatedly made representations to defense and to the court that they were compliant with all their discovery obligations. Despite their repeated representations, they have continued to fail to disclose critical evidence to the defendant. (ALEC BALDWIN CRIES AFTER JUDGE TOSSES CASE AGAINST HIM) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Those responsibilities run deep. You're dealing with someone's liberty. And so, it's basic. It's called discovery. The prosecution collects the evidence. They give it to the defense. The defense tests it, analyze it and prepares itself for trial. The judge's issue here is that it's willful. You don't get live rounds that are turned over. It happens to go in another file, not the file it should be. And then, the prosecution says nothing to see here. It's irrelevant. And it makes a unilateral decision, Kaitlan, oh, they're not identical. That's not your decision to make. You hand it to the defense. They subject it to analysis. And it's either relevant or not. And so, because of the discovery violation, and because we want to protect the integrity of the process, case has to be dismissed.",

I didn't really analyze the ammunition. The judge not too pleased. And I think this was beyond appropriate. This is what we do. This is what the integrity of the court system looks like. And the judge has to fashion remedy. Sometimes -- not all the time, will a judge dismiss. The judge will do a number of other things, not allow the evidence in, right, sanction counsel, et cetera.
