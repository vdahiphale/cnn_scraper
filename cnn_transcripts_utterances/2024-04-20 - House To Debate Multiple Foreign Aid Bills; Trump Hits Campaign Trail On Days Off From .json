Here's CNN's Kara Scannell.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We have our full panel, that announcement from Judge Juan Marchan after jury selection concluded, 18 Manhattanites, 12 jurors and six alternates now seated. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm sitting at a courthouse all day long this is going on for the week. And this will go on for another four or five weeks and it's very unfair. SCANNELL (voice-over): Trump appeared bored much of the trial day four as attorneys on both sides pro potential jurors until they filled the remaining five alternate seats. Moments after the full jury was picked, a bizarre and tragic moment outside court as a man set himself on fire. Authority say he was previously known to the police and while they are searching for any domestic terror connections, that is not believed to have been the motivation. In court, a handful of prospective jurors became emotional. One was excused after she told the judge she had anxiety and was worried as a trial goes on. More people could know she's part of the jury saying I might not be able to be completely fair and not emotional. So that concerns me. Another was dismissed after she began crying, saying I'm sorry, I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either. I don't want you to feel I've wasted anyone's time. This is so much more stressful than I thought. A third was sent home after noting she was feeling anxiety and self- doubt as she listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses. At the defense table, Trump set flipping through papers with charts, photos and graphics he whispered in past notes with his lawyers and at some points was hunched over with his elbows on the desk. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger started off questioning potential jurors telling them this is not about Mr. Trump being a former president. It's not about his being a candidate for the presidency. It's only about whether the evidence proves he's guilty. During her presentation, Trump leaned back in his chair at one point his eyes closed. Trump's attorney Susan Necheles focused on bias against the former president. She told those in the jury box, you all bring biases and you particularly bring biases about someone who is as publicly and outspoken as President Trump. There's nobody that doesn't know him in this room. In the afternoon, the court moved to a routine hearing to determine how much of Trump's legal history the prosecution will be allowed to ask him about if he testifies, which he said he plans to. Prosecutors argued they should be allowed to question Trump about the findings in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case among others despite Trump's attorneys' strong objections. The former president shook his head as the prosecution spoke about how he defamed Carroll.",

And so that really opens up any issues if you've previously found to be lying. And that's what's really opening the door to all of these other issues. So there's been some discussion, I think, a little bit confusing in the media, that this is all bad character evidence. That's true, in a sense, certainly, because it slides up his character, but it will only come in because he's taking a stand and his credibility, any witnesses, any defendants, credibility is very much an issue when they're testifying in these past acts, lying about someone to defamation, civil fraud, and business records, those things all go to his honesty and credibility that the jury is always allowed to consider.",

CNN's Gabe Cohen has the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GABE COHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Well, police say 18-year- old Alex Ye referred to his disturbing 129-page manifesto as his memoir. A story about a very similar young man planning a school shooting. And according to this lengthy statement of charges, all of this only came to light because last month, he sent the book to a friend who he had previously been hospitalized with in a psychiatric facility. They read it according to police, didn't even finish it before calling authorities to report what they saw as an imminent threat of a school shooting, and that kicked off this investigation. And since then, police say they have uncovered many more disturbing details. Online searches by Ye about school shootings, AR-15s and gun ranges, as well as some alarming messages, including one sent back in December, allegedly to the very same friend where Ye said, quote, \"my homicidal ideation has been getting worse lately to the point I might act on it eventually.\" Take a listen. Here's a little bit of what the Montgomery County police chief said was in this manifesto.",

Police say a school counselor that saw him dating back to 2022, told officers that Ye would express violent thoughts such as shooting up the school and wanting to hurt other people, and would smile while saying it.I want to walk you through a timeline of that hospitalization that I referenced before back in December 2022, police say Ye was hospitalized for threatening to shoot up a school the next month in January of 2023, he was reported to be released from the hospital, but police say, he was still preoccupied with self-harming, school shootings and explosives. Then in February, he was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Pediatric Unit where he remained for five months until July when he was released to a residential facility. What we don't know is what happened in the eight months after that, how much treatment or monitoring that Ye received before March last month when his friend notified police of that potential threat of a school shooting. Now, the Montgomery County school district says Ye has not physically been inside one of their schools since Fall of 2022, and that's when he started taking online courses. According to police, Ye did appear in court on Friday on that misdemeanor charge of a threat of mass violence that carries a potential maximum penalty of ten years in prison. He is now being held without bond until his trial scheduled in early June. Gabe Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
