With respect to his independence, Matt Gaetz is a firebrand. Matt Gaetz is the Trumpiest congressman on Capitol Hill. And that's not me talking.

And quite frankly, I also think for Vladimir Putin, personal relations are very important as well. We see that in the relations between Russia and China, where the personal relations between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, which, of course, are exceptional, have been one of the driving factors, also, in relations between China and Russia. Of course, some of it is also by necessity, as both of them are adversaries of the United States and the other NATO nations.I do think that from what we're hearing from folks here on the ground in Russia, they believe that the personal relationships between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump is going to be a lot better than between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, or than it was between Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden. And they do believe that that could also be a driving factor as far as possible negotiations around Ukraine are concerned, but also as far as relations between the United States and Russia are concerned. I think that is something that the Russians really believe could be an important point going forward as these two leaders will deal with one another and as they will speak with one another. Of course, we know that Vladimir Putin has said that he's very open to speaking to Donald Trump even before he takes office. The Russians have so far telegraphed that they are not going to be the ones who are going to initiate those types of conversations, but they certainly say that they are very open to them. And there does also, in the Kremlin itself, seem to be at least a sense that the Russians are willing to speak to Donald Trump, that they believe that there could be an inroad for them, not just, of course, as far as the topic of Ukraine is concerned, but as far as the general relations are concerned, as the Russians do want to put those relations on a different footing than they have been over the past four years, guys.",

And I think a lot of that, as far as the Ukrainians are concerned, is going to be ammunition for the various weapon systems that the U.S. has already given to the Ukrainians.One of the main points, though, of course, is air defense weapons for the Ukrainians. That's something that is key for them to protect their cities, to protect their infrastructure. And right now, if you look at Ukraine's air defenses, they are completely 100 percent reliant on Western technology. The Patriot systems from the United States, some of the other systems from some of the other NATO members as well. But then, of course, also ammunition in general, artillery ammunition, those kinds of things, ammunition for artillery rocket systems like the HIMARS, which only the U.S. can deliver. All of those things appear to be things that the Biden administration wants to push through. How much that will translate into the next administration, of course, we don't know. And I also think that there is a great deal of uncertainty here in Russia about what exactly Donald Trump is going to do, how exactly he's going to define those relations with Russia and also his stance on the war in Ukraine as well. Is he going to cut off some of the aid to Ukraine? Is he going to cut off all of the aid to Ukraine? Or is he even going to bolster aid to Ukraine and try and force Russia into negotiations that are more on par with the Ukrainians and the Russians? It's really unclear. And I do think that that sense of uncertainty is here, despite the fact that, of course, the Russians do believe that the personal relations between these two leaders are going to be key, are going to be good, and are going to happen in an atmosphere of both of them trying to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end. Of course, the Russians, again, right now, as far as the Kremlin is concerned, remain in their maximal position that they have had since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, where they say that they essentially want Ukraine to disarm, to give up a lot of its territory, and to make sure that Ukraine does not join NATO. That's something that the Ukrainians say is absolutely out of the question for them. And so we're going to have to wait and see how the U.S. will try to mediate that under a new president, guys.",

Among his small entourage, a slate of advisors and billionaire Elon Musk. Notably absent, former First Lady Melania Trump, despite an invitation from current First Lady Jill Biden. In a statement, Trump's team not giving a reason for her absence. Instead, writing, quote: Her husband's return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging and she wishes him great success. After carving out her own approach to being First Lady during Trump's first term, sources telling CNN Melania Trump's absence is likely to be a staple of Trump's second term in the White House, with Mrs. Trump unlikely to move back to Washington full-time. She herself indicating she has a better understanding of the role and how to handle it this time around. MELANIA TRUMP, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: I'm not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience, much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. So when you go in, you know exactly what to expect. HOLMES (voice-over): Discussions about when and how the next First Lady will spend most of her time are ongoing, though she's expected to split her time between Palm Beach and New York, where her son Barron will be attending college. M. TRUMP: I could not say I'm an empty nester. I don't feel that way. HOLMES (voice-over): The decision, unsurprising. On the campaign trail, the former First Lady was rarely seen by her husband's side, appearing only a handful of times, including at his announcement and the convention, her only speaking role at her husband's Madison Square Garden rally. M. TRUMP: Let us charge together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let's size this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve.

And this is not the first time that we've heard warnings that Israel's actions on the ground in Gaza could amount to war crimes, both from humanitarian organizations and U.N. investigators looking at the situation on the ground.But what this Human Rights Watch report details is more than a year of enormous widespread destruction across the Strip and the displacement of civilians. They say a deliberate and systematic campaign of displacement, forcing civilians from their homes, pushing them into these humanitarian zones, which have also become targets, of course, as we've often reported. And we've heard from one Human Rights Watch researcher who has said that there have been deliberate, controlled and legal demolitions of homes and civilian infrastructure as part of this campaign. There have been expressed aims by the Israeli military to create so- called buffer zones or security corridors in parts of Gaza, including in southern Gaza and Rafah, of course, where Palestinians are likely to be permanently displaced from their homes. And what we've seen on repeated occasions, as also detailed by Human Rights Watch, is civilians who are attempting to flee through these so-called safe corridors outlined by the Israeli military, then coming under attack or coming under attack in these humanitarian zones outlined by the Israeli military. And I can just read you a bit from the report where it says: The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs, so-called safe zones and cuts off food, water and sanitation. And we've been talking about the deteriorating humanitarian situation. At least eight aid groups this week saying that they believe that Israel has not only not done enough to improve the humanitarian situation, but actually in the last month has taken action to worsen the humanitarian situation. And of course, the Israeli military has denied these allegations. They say that the Israeli military abides by international law, that there is no doctrine that aims at causing maximal damage. That really stands in contrast to what we're seeing on the ground and what we're hearing, not only from Human Rights Watch in this report, but from multiple human rights organizations and U.N. agencies.",

I mean, we heard Katz's comments there, Defense Minister's comments there. Does this indicate that perhaps Israel are not making the inroads against Hezbollah, that they are claiming they are?",

We are still seeing Hezbollah rocket fire along the border. And of course, what we've seen really is no substantial gains from the Israeli military in terms of what is happening on the ground in southern Lebanon.I know details have been offered by the Israeli Defense Minister as to what this expanded operation will look like, what the next steps are. As you heard there, no clear push for a ceasefire. In fact, the complete opposite. They don't want to see a ceasefire until those military aims are achieved. But again, we are seeing an enormous displacement crisis in Lebanon as well. Nearly a million people now displaced, not only in the south, but across the city. And this is, of course, the third straight day that we've seen airstrikes targeting the capital, Beirut as well.",
