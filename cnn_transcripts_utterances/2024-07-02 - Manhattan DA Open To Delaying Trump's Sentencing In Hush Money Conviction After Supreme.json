      "sentences": "New today, more fallout in the wake of yesterday's Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity.The Manhattan district attorney's office now saying that it's open to delaying the sentencing a former President Trump. Trump was found guilty, of course, in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to payments to adult film actress, Stormy Daniels. CNN's Kristen Holmes is tracking all of these developments for us. Kristen, sentencing, we should note, it was coming up fast. It was supposed to happen next week. So what happens now?",

      "sentences": "Next Thursday. So now we're going to wait and hear from the judge if he agrees to both sides, which seems strange that he wouldn't agree to postpone the sentencing, particularly now that we know that attorney's office is fine with that.So just to backtrack as to how exactly we got here, as you noted, this is all about yesterday's immunity ruling. We heard from Donald Trump almost immediately afterwards. His team saying that that New York hush money case should be thrown out because of this immunity ruling. Now we have heard from the district attorney's office in response to that. And this is what they said. They said, \"Although we believe the defendant's arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion.\" They also called to have all the documents they needed by July 24th, so two weeks afterwards. So the really interesting thing here, Brianna, though, is that one of the things we we're tracking as they campaign reporter, not just legally, was that this was just days before the convention. It was going to set up the narrative going into the convention. There was some questions as to what that sentencing would look like. But also the narrative of Donald Trump is a martyr. He's a victim. Now that goes away. So what exactly are they? Going to do around the convention to lead up and build up anticipation? One thing that's still missing that they haven't done is announced vice president.",

      "sentences": "So I would go two lanes here. One, when you're talking about the community, I would say that it helps them politically. Maybe not necessarily for voters to forgive them.But when you look at it as a whole, you see this argument that the Supreme Court ruled with Donald Trump. They have said, over and over again, that everything, including the New York hush money case, was some form of quote, unquote, \"lawfare\" from the Biden administration. Obviously, as we know, we have absolutely zero evidence that Biden is linked to any of Donald Trump's legal issues. However, that is something that they have pushed politically. They do believe that this immunity ruling, as well as last week's ruling on January 6th that the Department of Justice overreached on that issue when they we're charging some of the participants in January 6th, help them politically. Because it tells voters, oh, look, the Supreme Court agreed with us. All of the things that we are saying turns out their true. So there's one line there. Now on the other side, how's the campaign feeling? Well, they're feeling great. Donald Trump is usually in charge of the -- not in charge of, but most of the media narrative. And it's not always positive. This is the time that you're not really seeing or hearing from Donald Trump almost at all. And that is intentional. They are riding this wave. They know the new cycle is about Biden and it is not positive. So they want to sit back -- he's a Bedminster right now playing golf -- celebrate the Fourth of July with his family. Don't expect to hear that much from him right now.",

      "sentences": "The question for investigators will now be how this happened. Since airlines are getting better all the time at forecasting turbulence, it is an invisible phenomenon to pilots.Onboard radar can detect some of the major causes, like thunderstorms. Though important to note, our CNN weather team says there we're no thunderstorms in the area at the time. There's also mountain wave turbulence, which creates shearing columns of wind. There's wake turbulence, which is created by another airplane, just like the wake on a boat. Then there is clear air turbulence. The most mysterious type of turbulence associated with none of those tell-tales I just laid out. It's usually bumpy patches at high altitudes. It's more frequent in the wintertime. Remember, Brazil, in the southern hemisphere where it's winter there right now. The big takeaway for passengers here is to always keep your seatbelt buckled or at least as much as it can. Hard to do on a flight like this, 12 hours long. So when you're up and walking around, going to the bathroom, stretching your legs, you have to treat it like a bit of a risk. We're going into a huge period for international travel right now. And remember, the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is the number-one cause of injuries on commercial flights. The good news is the data says U.S. airlines have become good at avoiding it. And passengers are really following the rules. The latest data from the FAA says 17 people, only 17 people suffered serious injuries from turbulence on U.S. flights in 2022 and 2021. That number was six. That was the peak of the pandemic. Although that number is certainly going to rise with the TSA numbers we've been seeing. A record just set last month on June 23rd. And we're likely to set another air-travel record over this weekend with all these people coming home after the July 4th rush.",

So right now, we're able to see that there wasn't really a lot of strong convective activity. That's hot air rising that turns into thunderstorms. The weather team hasn't been able to see that on their radar from the time of this incident. But that'll be something that investigators will look at closely, too. They will just really want to know, was this caused by something external, which is typically the cause of turbulence? Or could this have been maybe an internal thing? Because during the Lanham incident back earlier this spring, that was something that was initially reported as a turbulence incident. Although it turned out to be somebody leaning on a switch on one of the pilot seats then ran the pilot seat into the control column of the airplane, which caused the airplane to nose over briefly, and people who hit the ceiling. So there could be a lot of factors here. We don't want to speculate, although it's something that investigators now really have their work cut out to do.",

President Ruto has a lot of support and respect internationally. You saw the White House roll out the red carpet for him in late May for that state visit, the first African head of state in 16 years. But here at home, there's growing anger at his administration about corruption, about the high cost of living, in some cases, about the extravagant lifestyles that some of his senior government officials live. And that's the anger you see translating on the streets of these young people, saying, enough is enough. This is a fight for our future. This is the fight for survival. And they're willing to go out there and risk everything. We saw on CNN last Tuesday when protesters stormed into Kenya's parliament and we saw police shooting directly at unarmed protesters.
