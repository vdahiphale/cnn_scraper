The other could cost him chunks of his business empire starting at any point today.Very shortly, Trump is expected to be in a New York courtroom for a hearing in his hush money trial involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels. This is a criminal case with criminal consequences. The proceedings today could set a trial date for as soon as mid-April. Today is also the deadline for Trump to produce nearly half a billion dollars in bond payment, and the civil fraud trial, he lost. If he does not come up with the money, the attorney general in New York is prepared to begin freezing his bank accounts and seizing his properties. This could happen at any moment today and on social media you can see it's already getting under Trump's skin. CNN's Kristen Holmes is outside the court here in New York City. This is where Trump will physically be today in the criminal case, but you get a sense his heart is with the money elsewhere, Kristen.",

So, these things take time. The money in bank accounts is the easiest thing to freeze and then ultimately seize real property is more difficult. But she's already started filing the judgments in different jurisdictions like Westchester County and Manhattan, where she could seize properties. So, I think she'll go ahead and get that ball rolling.It's not an instantaneous thing. There are lots of legal paperwork- type steps that need to happen first, but I think she'll start doing that, as she has said she will.",

The Manhattan D.A. charging him with falsifying documents in connection with trying to quiet Stormy Daniels, the film star that said she had a sexual encounter with him. Is there a scenario where this gets dismissed because you have the Trump attorneys, which is what attorneys would do, what a defense attorney would do, which is ask for the entire case to be thrown out, is there a scenario where you see this actually happening, though?",

But what's come out since then is that these documents that were turned over, which were really voluminous, a very small subset of that was actually new material. And of that, there doesn't seem to be anything that's exculpatory or really blockbuster in any way.So, I suspect the judge will still want an explanation as to why those documents weren't turned over last year, what happened. But, ultimately, I think he'll go ahead and set a trial date and it will probably be in mid April. So, we may see this fairly soon.",

What else could they argue to try and delay this further? Because one thing they're trying to do is get it dismissed, the other thing they're trying to do is delay until after the election.",

And that happens to be starting, the oral arguments, April 25th, right? That's only a little more than a week away from when this trial is supposed to begin.So, he could argue, why don't we wait for that decision, since he's also claiming that presidential immunity in the Manhattan D.A. case as well? So, he could try that, which he has already tried to seek delay. He will argue, as Jennifer says, that certain pieces of material that was turned over was exculpatory, and, therefore, there should be some sort of punishment or sanction on the Manhattan D.A.'s Office. So, I think we're going to expect they're going to make all the typical arguments to try to get delay. But Judge Merchan is an experienced judge, so I don't think he's going to allow his legal team to get away with that.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, as you say at this point, we're waiting for some kind of response to this potential counterproposal.Now, what we've heard from CNN Analyst Barak Ravid, citing Israeli government sources, is that this could take a few days now for a counterproposal or an answer to come from Hamas, saying that the person in charge, Yahya Sinwar, is likely about 100 feet under the ground in a tunnel in Gaza. So, to get the response from him will take time. Now, we are hearing a lot of leaks, a lot of sources talking from the Israeli side. Clearly, the Israeli government is under pressure, domestically and internationally, to try and push this deal forward. So, what we have heard is just ten days ago, Hamas suggesting that their counter-proposal was between 700 and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released. So, this U.S. proposal, 700, it's within that range. And, of course, it's not just the number of prisoners released, it's which prisoners. And this proposal suggesting there would be 100 who are serving life sentences at this point for having killed Israeli citizens. Now, it's important to note as well, this is just one part of one phase of the overall potential ceasefire deal that is being worked out. We're hearing from one source close to the talks that there is steady progress, but there are still differences that remain a number of other issues that have to be hammered out at this point. For example, what happens to the Israeli military in Gaza once there is a ceasefire? Hamas has made it clear that they would like the Israeli military to be outside of Gaza when that happens. Israel has made it clear that that is not possible. We have heard consistently from the Israeli prime minister that they want to still carry out this major ground offensive in Rafah. So, at this point, the Palestinian prisoner issue is a key element of this, but worth remembering, this is just one small part of an overall deal. John?",
