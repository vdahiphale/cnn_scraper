That is the World Trade Center, and we haveunconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. CNN Center right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is, once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The day caused chaos, terror, and deathwhen the al-Qaeda terrorist group carried out coordinated attacks against America. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when terrorists flew commercial airplanes into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Now, Wednesday, on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are scheduled to visit three sites of those attacks. Now, considered a national day of service and remembrance, September 11th memorial ceremonies and volunteer events will be held in communities across the country as the nation pauses to reflect and remember those who lost their lives on that tragic day. In New York, a 9-11 memorial and museum now sit in the original location of the World Trade Center towers. CNN went inside that museum as it was opening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATE BOLDUAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The museum is built almost entirely underground. Some 70 feet down, it sits in the precise footprint of the World Trade Center. (On camera): Yeah. JOE DANIELS, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL &amp; MUSEUM: So this is exactly where the south tower started and went up 1,350 feet. BOLDUAN (voice-over): A striking display of the sheer scale of the destruction with poignant reminders of the tragedy at every turn. Visitors will also walk alongside the survivor stairs.",

One was a collection of poetry, \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" by Shel Silverstein.I had a bit of a speech impediment when I grew up, and so it helped me to perfect my diction a lot. And it was just fun tales and gave you encouragement. And I loved it. The other one was a book called \"The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho.\" It translates at every stage in your life, looking for meaning in your personal journey. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, my favorite book growing up is a pretty obvious one for me. It was \"Siddhartha\" by Hermann Hesse. The big takeaway was that knowledge is something that can be taught, but wisdom is something that has to be experienced. I give this book to a lot of high school students, even today when they`re graduating from high school or even earlier, because it had such a profound impact on me.",
