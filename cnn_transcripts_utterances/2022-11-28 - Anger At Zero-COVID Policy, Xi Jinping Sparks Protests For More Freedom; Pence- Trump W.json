What has been unthinkable until this moment are the calls for the leader of the country, Xi Jinping, to step down.John Berman here in for Anderson. Anger at the country's rigid Zero-COVID Policy and questions about whether it delayed response for a fire in one city that killed 10 people has unleashed a wider array of resentments with some calling for democracy and freedom. This is a map of where CNN has confirmed protests, at least 16 locations nationwide, including the capital, Beijing, as well as Shanghai. And of course it is happening in a country of more than one billion people whose fates both politically and financially have a huge impact on the US and the entire world.

It has put immense psychological, emotional and financial pressure on the country's population, and over the weekend, some of that pressure finally snapped.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice over): Anger on the streets of Chinese cities, the biggest nationwide display of discontent of this tightly-controlled country has seen in a generation. Protesters pushing back against police and the government's Zero-COVID Policy. The unrest triggered by a deadly fire in Urumqi in China's Western Xinjiang region last Thursday. Videos emerge of fire hoses, barely reaching the blaze, which killed at least 10 people. Among them, Kamarnisa Han Abdul Rahman (ph) and four of her children. WATSON (on camera): What happened to your mother and your brothers and sisters? SHARAPAT ALI (through translator): The fire started on the 15th floor. The smoke poisoned my family. The government could not stop the fire in time. WATSON (voice over): Two surviving adult children of Kamarnisa, Han speak to me from Turkey, unable to see their family since 2017 due to the harsh crackdown. The government accused of putting up to two million of their fellow ethnic Uighurs and members of other minorities in internment camps. They say their loved ones were trapped in the building by COVID measures. MOHAMMAD ALI, FAMILY KILLED IN APARTMENT FIRE (through translator): They could not escape because the fire escape was blocked and the fire escape to the roof of the building was also locked. WATSON (voice over): Accusations CNN cannot independently confirm, but Chinese authorities have been seen literally locking residents into buildings. Outrage over Urumqi fire compounded by previous deadly incidents in recent months directly linked to COVID prevention. Though CNN verified 16 protests in 11 Chinese cities this weekend, a Chinese government official told the journalists they just didn't happen. ZHAO LIJIAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (through translator): What you mentioned does not reflect what actually happened. China has been following the dynamic Zero-COVID Policy and has been making adjustments based on realities on the ground. WATSON (on camera): On Monday, the white papers that have become a symbol of the protests in Mainland China spread here to Hong Kong, where these small groups of demonstrators are holding a vigil for what they say are the victims of China's Zero-COVID Policy.",

But overall, we have not heard a change of the country's rhetoric. It says it is still committed, the government to trying to completely eradicate COVID-19 from China. And when it comes to the protests, we had a quieter night, certainly in the capital of Beijing on Monday night. The Chinese government has an enormous system of surveillance and state security, many levers that can use to try to repress people from coming out into the streets. For instance, we're hearing more and more about universities sending their students home very early, perhaps in an attempt to try to take some of the air out of some of these protests. And just to bring back to that family that has suffered so much in that fire. They are ethnic Uighurs. That is a population that has been rounded up by potentially the millions in recent years, and that family alone, they tell us that their father has been put into an internment camp. They haven't spoken to him for years, a brother as well and they don't even know if they can get any information to those people to let them know about the tragedy that their mother and four other siblings died in this terrible fire.",

There was crying, too, because this is a rare chance for these young people to be surrounded with others and to pour out their emotions in a country where people cannot freely express themselves. And you'll see in the video many people holding white pieces of paper. That is a sign of protest without actually writing anything that the authorities could arrest them for. Now, this protest, I witnessed, was peaceful but there was heavy police presence and after 2:00 AM, you just saw rows of police filing in, pushing all of us to disperse. But China's giant censorship machine is determined to make it as if these protests never happened, erasing videos, comments about the protests and state media meanwhile, completely ignoring it all and instead publishing headlines calling Zero-COVID scientific and effective.",

But what really struck me, John, was how many people were saying \"We love China. We are doing this because we love our country and we want it to change for the better.\" There was even a man on a loudspeaker who was saying, \"We support the Communist Party, but we want more freedoms.\" There was one protester without a mask that was willing and eager to speak to be on camera. He told me, he motorcycled and biked for more than an hour to get to the protest. He told me that the Chinese people need to stand together.

Sun, want to start with you listening to Ivan Watson and Selina Wang's piece and seeing those images. What did you make of it? YUN SUN, CO-DIRECTOR, EAST ASIA PROGRAM AT THE STIMSON CENTER: Well, this is really unprecedented in the recent memory of any Chinese people or Chinese generation, that this is something that has not happened since 1989. And remember, the 20th Party Congress only ended last month. So basically, within a month of Xi Jinping in his third term, we're already seeing popular opposition and we are seeing the mass protests against Xi Jinping's cornerstone policy, which is Zero COVID.

There is no endgame here, and that was the frustration, living under the lockdown in talking to my neighbors who are local Shanghainese, who had lived there for generations, and who had felt at this point in their lives, they had nowhere to go and no one to voice their concern to. And what you also look at, and I even brought this up, is you go to places like Xinjiang, right, where we have traveled to. It is one of the most heavily surveilled places on this planet, arguably, certainly within China. And you start to see now traces across China, particularly in Shanghai where we were, one of the most cosmopolitan and the financial hub of China, the city that really had gravitated in getting a lot of attention internationally for folks who saw this as perhaps the window to the West and they started building that same infrastructure. We started to see it in front of our own homes. We started to see the walls go up, the cameras go into place, and they would corral you through certain areas where conveniently those cameras were pointing on your face.

Most people are demanding for their freedoms, the freedom to go outside of their apartment, the freedom to go to work, the freedom to make a salary. So, that's very different from the political demand for the Chinese Communist Party, you know, for Xi Jinping to step down. But for Xi Jinping to cater to that demand will require him to reconsider and adjust his Zero-COVID Policy, which has been his signature policy in the past three years to demonstrate the superiority of the disease control models that China has been adopting.

This is what you do, you hang out with discredited entertainers, you hang out with Neo Nazis, and you try to make time with whoever will give you attention.

At the end of the day, the base, the Democratic base, can be, you know, there are other surrogates like Obama, who can get the base fired up without bringing Biden down to remind perhaps those moderate voters, those swing voters, those persuadable conservative voters that like the President isn't very popular right now.

Ukraine rejects the Russian claims.Joining me now near the front lines in Donetsk is CNN senior international correspondent, Matthew Chance. Matthew, what do we know about who holds Bakhmut, the Ukrainians or Russians have the upper hand here? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Well, John, I was up on the outskirts of Bakhmut earlier on today. And I had the opportunity to speak to several Ukrainian commanders on the ground to look at the maps look at the live feeds from the drones. They've got up in the air to survey the situation. And the town is not encircled yet. But that certainly appears to be the efforts that the Russian military are heading towards. And there are fierce fighting taking place in the center of Bakhmut's and its outskirts as well. The Russians basically are approaching from the north and the east. The Ukrainians still hold sorry, the south, east and the south. The Ukrainians still hold the north and the and the west. But that situation is very dynamic. Again, fierce fighting dozens of people every day, being killed on both sides, according to the Ukrainian officials that I spoke to, John. BERMAN: Matthew, why is control so important?

In addition to that they're in artillery range from the Russian side, and the weather is getting absolutely freezing in this part of Ukraine. There's mud on the ground, it's wet, it's damp, it's miserable, it's cold. These are the challenges that they're facing defending that time right now.",
