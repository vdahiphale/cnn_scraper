This as Mr. Trump's lawyers meet with Justice Department officials today. Then, come on in, the water's fine.

We start today with the law and justice lead and serious questions as to whether Donald Trump could face his first federal indictment ever. Today, lawyers for the former president met with Justice Department officials here in Washington for 90 minutes, a possible sign that special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into how Trump handled classified documents and whether he obstructed justice could be nearing its final stages. Adding fuel to the speculation that Trump's about to face some legal consequence is his own wild reaction on his own social media site, Truth Social, where he wrote, quote: How can the Justice Department possibly charge me, who did nothing wrong, when no other presidents were charged, when Joe Biden won't be charged for anything. He goes on from there, but let's move on. Let's get right to CNN's Katelyn Polantz. And, Katelyn, you have some exclusive new insight into the special counsel's investigation, especially as it concerns possible obstruction of justice. Tell us more.",

He drained the pool at Mar-a-Lago in October, and when that happened, it flooded a room and that room had IT equipment in it that had surveillance footage.And so we don't know -- and it's not clear if prosecutors believe that this flood was intentional. It could have been a mistake. But it is one of these things that adds into this constellation of things that are suspicious to prosecutors, have raised questions. And we know too that prosecutors have received some testimony and some answers about what happened there. And some of the testimony is that the video surveillance system wasn't damaged in this flood. But all of these questions are going back to, did Donald Trump give some sort of direction, or did these people who were working for him, this maintenance worker and another man who was captured on tape moving boxes, while not his body man, were they taking steps to inquire about the surveillance footage or want to sort of screw up what the Justice Department was able to get as they were seeking evidence?",

It tells me that we are nearing the end of the special counsel's investigation. We thought we were nearing the end for a long time. I think this is a signal that at least from the Trump defense team's perspective, this may be their last clear chance to try to head off a federal indictment. They went in. They alleged prosecutorial misconduct. I'm not sure that was the right strategy. I suspect that appeal is going to fall on deaf ears before the special counsel.

Why after?

But, the Department of Justice, I'm sure you both would say, makes its decisions based on the facts, follows the facts.

Before I get to that though, I want to ask you both about what we just heard from General Milley about Ukraine. Do you think they are ready for this long promised counteroffensive? Let me start with Congressman Wenstrup, because he out-ranks you, Captain Crow. Colonel, please? REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): It would appear that they already in many ways, and I'll go to one in particular. They have the will for this. You know, the people in Ukraine know what freedom looked like, and they do not want it taken away, whereas the Russian military is in a different situation. I don't think it's even that popular within the Russian populous as it is. So, that's one of the advantages for the Ukrainians going up. What goes on in Ukraine does matter. And China is watching every bit of this. And so, it's important. But what we want to see for the United States and European allies in particular, is what is our aid doing?

You better believe the Ukrainians are ready. They have the grit, the will, the determination to fight in a way that someone who is always fighting for their children, for their home, for their neighborhoods, will always fight, with all of their strength and their will. So, the Russians actually have something really in store for them and I would encourage the Russian soldiers to lay down their arms and return home, or at least leave the battlefield because this is not a nation to be fighting. And listen, we've always been clear as the United States that we were going to give them the equipment, the training, the resources to fight. But this is the Ukrainians fight. They know how to take this fight to the battlefield to the Russians. They know how to spread the Russians out. They know how to strike deep. They are not going to use the U.S. munitions to do so. They have respected our request to avoid doing that. There's no reason to believe that they will not continue to respect that. The Ukrainians are doing exactly what they need to do.",

Already, the railroad has been reopened and we can see what looks like a brand-new modern train moving it down the tracks here. That is even as scores of people are still looking for their missing loved ones from the accident that took place on Friday night. Now the initial accident, authorities say, was caused by a switching malfunction. So a passenger train was moved onto a track where there was a parked freight train, loaded with iron ore. And that crash sent some of the train cars into the other track where there was an approaching passenger train coming from the other side. So that mistake led to absolutely catastrophic results. As you can see, the railroad here has been reopened. We have another train moving through right now. The railroad system in India, it dates back in origins to when this country was a British colony. It is essential to this country, more than 13 million people a day move around on trains in India. So, that's part of why the authorities have worked so hard to reopen the rails after the train crash. I'm going to show you over here, this is an example of a railroad station in the Indian countryside.
