It is 9 am in Washington, 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\". Also ahead voting has ended in Pakistan's general election. The day has been marred by Taliban violence at some polling stations. A U.S. drone strike in Iraq takes out a Kataib Hezbollah leader responsible for attacks on American troops. We're live at the pentagon for more details on that. Plus, we are also monitoring a volcano in Iceland spewing pools of lava for the second time this year. Well, the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now, if these are any indication, the futures markets for you showing a mixed open. We are less than an hour away from the U.S. Supreme Court case that has the potential to append this year's U.S. presidential election. The historic hearings set to determine whether Colorado can classify Donald Trump as an insurrectionist and disqualify him from running for office. Trump's lawyers are appealing a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that tries to do just that. Based on the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution, which says no officer of the United States who's engaged in an insurrection shall hold any public office. It is a case that could have nationwide implications. Let's bring in CNN's Legal Analyst, the Criminal Defense Attorney, Joey Jackson, with an international audience in mind. Sir, can we first discuss how unusual this case is that a former U.S. president is trying to get onto a ballot in a state where the court has disqualified him? Let's just give our viewers a sense of the significance here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Becky, good to be with you. It's huge, right? That's the best way to describe it. Because you can have afront runner for his party removed from the ballot that would mean that no voter in the 50 states of the United States would even have the opportunity to vote for him. So just think about that, right. And so the next question becomes how can that happen? Well, how it can happen is, as you described, Becky and looking at the constitution of the United States, there's an amendment right, the 14th amendment, Section 3 says if you've engaged in insurrection, you cannot hold public office. And so Colorado had a five day hearing in which they heard evidence with respect to January 6, that's what we're speaking about. January 6, the after Trump had lost the election. He was encouraging right supporters, etcetera, to not certify the vote. That's the question. There are many factual arguments as to whether you engage in insurrection or not. States are what they're doing, not only Colorado, we've seen it throughout the country are really in terms of not allowing him to appear on the ballot, looking at initiatives to use that 14th Amendment, Section 3 to do just that. Colorado did so, they're courts, every state in the country has their own independent courts, their own governor, their own judicial system. The reason the Supreme Court is weighing in Becky is, because you need uniformity, you need guidance. Imagine if Colorado removes him California doesn't. New York does -- you know New Jersey doesn't. You can't have that. And so the determination of the Supreme Court will be whether he should be removed, whether he should not.",

We know that the balance of the court is six to three conservative liberal. What on earth does that mean? It means that the conservative justices may be more inclined to support and otherwise adopt Republican initiatives. That means that that holds that Trump will be put on the ballot, and they will find a way that is the court to say that that Colorado ballot initiative to remove him has to be rejected. And so, we're looking to determine whether the court evaluates this case on the legal merits, or if there's any hint of politics here, which certainly can undermine the democratic process. And so that's what we're looking for, as we have this oral argument today, where the judges will ask probing questions of the litigants to determine whether or not he stays on the ballot. That is Mr. Trump or is removed.",

This is not atime for him to wax poetic right to campaign or anything else. It's a time for the Supreme Court of the United States to give a fair, reasonable interpretation as to what Amendment 14 Section 3 means. And whether or not in all the various arguments and there are many, it would exclude him from the ballot or permit him from the ballot. A decision will not be made today to be clear, this is simply oral argument. Thereafter Becky the court will render a written determination and indications are that'll happen before Super Tuesday. What does that mean? Super Tuesday is March 5th and it's a date where you have about 15 states in the 50 United States who are voting. So it's often good to get guidance before that many states vote as to whether individual states can make this determination, whether it's lawful to remove him or whether they have no authority, they being the states to remove him at all. This is Colorado, but the implications of this decision will be felt throughout the remaining states in the United States to be clear.",

And certainly we know that other networks have also done the same thing. So it certainly isn't from a lack of trying that no interviews with Vladimir Putin with western media have happened since he started the war here in Ukraine. And I think there are two sorts of assertions that Tucker Carlson made, Becky that a lot of people have been criticizing. On the one hand, he was sort of hinting that he believed that people in the United States didn't know what was really going on in Russia because they weren't listening to Vladimir Putin, because what he's saying isn't sort of being broadcast internationally. But of course, we hear from Vladimir Putin on our programs all the time, whether it's his speeches in international forums whether or not it's speeches elsewhere, interviews that he gives out to you for instance to Russian media. There is certainly a lot of Vladimir Putin on the airwaves around the world. And definitely, a lot of people have been pitching interviews as well.

Certainly some of the things that he said in that video that he put out didn't exactly hint to the fact that he was going to hold to Vladimir Putin's feet to the fire if you will. But certainly in interviews with Vladimir Putin would usually pick up some nuances possibly about his thinking about the war in Ukraine also about American politics as well. So we're going to have to wait and see, but there were certain assertions by Tucker Carlson, for instance, where he said that the world's media wasn't trying to report from Russia. Well, we know that, of course, our colleague, Evan Gershkovich, from \"The Wall Street Journal\" has been in jail for a long time for doing just that. And also, there was a protest in Moscow the other day of wives of soldiers asking for the soldiers to come home where a bunch of international journalists were detained. So international media is trying, but as far as his interview is concerned, it's absolutely clear, Becky, that it's not the international media that doesn't want to talk to Vladimir Putin.

He had the option to appear today. He isn't going to and we will discuss that, Kristen shortly. Marshall, though, let me start with you. What happens in court today doesn't stay in court today.

As you mentioned, the Supreme Court arguments are within the hour. There are no cameras in the court. But there is an audio feed and we will all be able to listen. And what you will hear are three different sides here. You've got the challengers who filed this lawsuit representing a bipartisan group of voters from Colorado, Republicans and Independents who have argued that this insurrectionist ban applies to Donald Trump because of what he did on January 6th. Then there's of course, the Trump side. They have many different defenses that they are mounting. They've argued that the band doesn't apply to the presidency. They've argued that January 6th was not even an insurrection it was a riot but not an insurrection. And they've argued that all of his comments that day, no matter how incendiary, they were protected by the first amendment. And then Becky the third side here is actually the State of Colorado, the secretary of state, the top election official there, her office is a part of this lawsuit. If you have to take him off the ballot, they'll be the ones required to enforce that. They are in court today to defend the process that took place in Colorado, there was a trial. There was an appeal. And after all about those procedures, the conclusion was that Trump is disqualified. So three parties here, nine justices, as you mentioned, the court has a super majority of conservatives, including three appointees of Former President Trump. But this is so unprecedented, so historic, we're going to have to wait and hear how they chew on this.

What is surprising is how his team is approaching this case so differently than how they have approached all of these other legal cases. We saw him go into those courtrooms by choice and both the civil defamation case in New York and the civil fraud case in New York. He was yelling. He was storming in and out of the courtroom muttering to his lawyers. All of this is kind of an attempt to turn these courtrooms appear -- courtroom appearances into campaign stops. That is obviously not what he is doing today. He is going to give remarks at Mar-a-Lago before he gets on a plane to Nevada, where he is expected to win the caucuses tonight. Another juxtaposition here as we talk about both the legal and the political and how they really come together as one. But we are told that the reason for him not attending is, because it is an indication of how his team is handling this much more carefully than they've handled other trials. They had Luke court, which was practice court for these arguments for two days. They have been filling in Donald Trump throughout the week, his lawyers calling him giving him kind of an update as to what exactly this was going to look like. But he's not going to be there. And he's not going to be sitting there facing events where he appointed one third of the justices causing a rather strange dynamic so all of this to say that we don't know what Donald Trump is going to say during his remarks.
