But I spoke to a few Senators in recent days and, of course, there was a plan to operate a rule change, a temporary rule change that would allow the Senate to move most of these nominees through, except for the four stars. I think he saw the writing on the wall and probably did not want to see that happen, probably thought that would hurt him.",

But he had this changing reason, as I mentioned, for why he is doing this.He still seems to be supporting hanging onto the holds for the four stars, by saying it should be looked at individually to see if some of them are \"Woke.\" What do you think about his reasoning for that and how it risks politicizing individual promotions of generals?",

In fact, they can have that, they can have a talk and try to work it out behind the scenes. I think, at this point at least, however many four stars are left, it should be able to quickly expedite and process them through. I've argued that while Tuberville was doing this, which I thought should not have happened, it was wrong, I thought Chuck Schumer should have been moving as many officers through as he could. Hopefully, this will all happen fairly quickly. It will take some time to move even 10 officers through if Tuberville decides to hold up each one of them. But at least, there is light at the end of the tunnel now.",

Obviously, they are the most decorated of these generals and these flag officers we are seeing here.We originally had you on and I want to talk to you about what we are seeing in Israel. And Israel facing pressure from the U.S., to be more careful as it targets Hamas and to make sure that they are minimizing civilian casualties. I wanted to talk to you about that because we heard an Israeli government spokesperson saying this morning that Israel is open to constructive feedback on minimizing civilian deaths. But really, as long as it is consistent with Israel's goal of destroying Hamas. I think what we are hearing there is not a lot of receptivity on the part of Israel there. In your view, does Israel risk a lot here, if, for the legitimacy at which it is executing its war, increasingly comes into question?",

It is important, not just in terms of tactical success on the ground, but it's also important with regard to how history records this moment in time and the strategic narratives, and how they are received after the fact, and what that means for the population of Gaza going forward. So I think, for all those reasons, it is important that they take care, as much as it is important for the United States and other Western militaries to take care and conduct operations in accordance with the laws of land warfare. I would hope we would see in the next phase less use of airstrikes, particularly with 2,000-pound bombs, and more use of infantry on the ground, which would be more precise, more discerning, and take better care to avoid collateral damage, and certainly, civilian casualties.",

But it is hard to see the day-to-day combat, what is happening.Now we do see airstrikes. It is hard to tell how big those are. And are they hitting in the really, really dense civilian areas? It is hard to tell. But look, the outcome overtime we will see casualties. But they do need to take care. It is important as you conduct this war because, otherwise, again, they will have to deal with an enraged population after the fact in Gaza. Because this will end at some point. And then there has to be -- the outcome has to be some type of governance of Gaza.

He is not actually charged with trying to inspire the insurrection on that day.What he is charged with is inspiring to block the certification of the -- of Joe Biden's victory. So what prosecutors are saying, though, is that all of his comments, certainly his embrace of the Proud Boys, things that he has said about the rioters, defending them, playing, for example, a national anthem sung by members of the January 6th rioters at one of his rallies, shows his intent was to block the certification of Joe Biden's victory on January 6th. So I'll read you just a part of what prosecutors say in their finding. They say, \"Evidence of the defendant's post-conspiracy embrace of, particularly of violent, notorious rioters, is admissible to establish the defendant's motive and intent on January 6th.\" So they're using the former president's own words, his embrace of the rioters, some of the violent rioters who are in prison. Some of them who have been convicted. His promise that he might pardon them after -- if he wins office again in 2024. All of those things, they are going to use against him in this trial, which is coming up on March 4th. Again, this is something that we have all speculated about, what they're going to do to try to show try to tie Donald Trump to the violence on January 6th. This is how prosecutors say they are going to do it.",
