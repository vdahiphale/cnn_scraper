Well, Kim's mysterious sister barely left his side.Plus, a killer in custody tonight, caught by a hero K9 named Yoda. We have new images tonight from Danelo Cavalcante's capture and new details about how he survived the run. A U.S. marshal who was part of the manhunt and interviewed Cavalcante is OUTFRONT. And the monster storm is getting even bigger. Hurricane Lee, a major threat to the Northeast tonight, still tonight, and I will talk to the hurricane hunter live as he flies through that storm. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin sparing no expense, rolling out a massive red carpet for Kim Jong Un and tonight, we can tell you, Kim Jong Un is staying in Russia, another whole full day of events, is scheduled, and highly unusual. And this includes witnessing Russian military drills. Putin simply put is all in on Kim. The two leaders we now understand sat down together for more than five years. Russia -- five hours, I'm sorry. Russia state media saying they have, quote, substantive discussions and they have a lavish state dinner. In fact, they wanted everyone to know all about that. So with all the duress in Russia right now, they put out the menu for this, so everyone could see, duck salad with figs and nectarines. Grass carp fish soup, lingonberries with fine nuts. All of that put out for everyone to see. And after that, Kim then boarded a plane to travel across the vast region of Russia instead of his usual mode of transportation, a heavily armored train that goes 37 miles an hour. This is hugely significant, right? He's only traveled via plane on three prior trips aboard that we're aware of. His father had a fear of flying. North Korean dictators have really traveled by train. So to go to another country, you're spending the night, you're sleeping there, you're eating there, you're taking their planes. This is something important. And it is not just a trip for Kim to see the sights and sounds of Russia. Putin making it very clear today what Kim's visit is about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): He will visit factories engaged in the production of aviation equipment, both civilian and military. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kim's sister, Kim Yo-jong, often seen by his side, the second most powerful person in North Korea attending to every detail. An aide even wiping down Kim's chair before he sits.

Trump gave Kim a similar tour of his presidential limo, the Beast.

And President Putin has given him this global stage to step out on. So he got those images as Will mentioned, the images that he wanted for the propaganda.

And we have to assume that the last four years have been one of extreme hardship for the North Korean people.

We knew that he was armed and using a K9 we felt was a reasonable option for upgrading to deadly force.As Yoda moved in on Cavalcante, I believe the only thing showing at the time was Mr. Cavalcante's head or the crown of his head. He ended up taking a bite on the top of his head, which I know a photo's been going out around with a lot of blood. And that's the reason why the blood was there because he took a bite towards the top of his head. Now, a K9 is a bite and hold dog. So there was no holding when you bite someone on the crown of your head. Cavalcante was again bit in a lower extremity area. Yoda held.

Hurricane hunter just flew through it and couldn't find a wind gust over 90. So that's something to be happy about. But this thing could still get in some warmer water and get a little bit stronger to 100 just to the east of Bermuda. To the north here, here is Nova Scotia, Halifax, there's Maine and that's where the hurricane watch is posted. The models are in good agreement that this does not make contact in New England proper. But the hurricane forced winds, as you said, the storm is getting bigger. It's not getting faster. It's not getting stronger. It's getting wider. It's getting 600 miles wide. Now, not hurricane-force winds, but 39-mile-per-hour winds are far, far from the center of the storm. A hundred and fifteen miles from the center, all the way out to the hurricane strength. Back this up a couple days ago, this was a tiny little storm. That number was only 30 miles. But watch what happens to the hurricane force in red. It begins to go away because the winds begin to die down because it's not going to be a big monster cat 3 or cat 4 when it starts to try to make landfall. And where will that landfall be? Likely somewhere between the border between Maine and Nova Scotia. We hope it doesn't go into the Bay of Fundy. That'd be disastrous for that area there. We do know that there will be huge waves coming on shore here all across the east coast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. And another problem I'm seeing is the possibility of the wind blowing into the bay here. Here's Cape Cod right there. And you tart to fill that bay up with water.
