Intermediate scrutiny has to be an important interest. Then you can override parental rights. So, you know, let's say the parents think that children should only eat 200 calories a day. That's very dangerous to health. So that's where you would see the government has an interest is going to override the parents' decision about how to raise their children.So that's kind of where it falls. You have to look at the legal test and decide how strong the government's interest has to be to override parents' rights. But, you know, we need to know which test applies before we can put the interest up against the test to see where it all comes out. And that's what the Supreme Court is going to tell us, which of these tests applies to this law. And by the way, if they decided sex discrimination, we know it will be intermediate scrutiny. The court has never decided whether transgender discrimination is just on the basis of being a transgender person, what level of scrutiny that would apply. So that's a secondary issue here. It's possible that the court finds it's not sex discrimination, but that transgender discrimination requires intermediate scrutiny. We're waiting to hear on that as well.",

But of course, in the back of their minds, they understand that we have 50 states. They're all over the map as far as where these laws are. Some have them, some don't. The ones that have them, some of the laws are different from other laws. So they understand that when they need to set a standard here, they should be thinking about how that will apply more broadly so that other states know what to do.You don't want to have to take up 50 different cases on this issue, right? You want states to be able to get guidance from this. That said, a lot of these laws look a lot alike. These right leaning groups drafted legislation and kind of shopped it around in different state legislatures. So a lot of the language is the same. So I think whatever the Supreme Court does will likely be guidance for all the states in the nation as far as what's going to fly and what's not going to fly under the Equal Protection Clause.",

We give them our passport and our driver's license, or maybe we have pre-check and we get to fly past all that, but we've at least gone through the process.

Someone with a Russian passport came to the United States on a Scandinavian airline.So these incidents continue to happen often. You know, in the past, they've been sometimes teenagers just trying to hop around, take a flight. But this is very serious because if the person really did bypass security, then the TSA has a lot of explaining to do. Because remember, earlier this month, there was news coverage of a Russian plot. Five people were arrested in Poland of trying to have smuggle bombs onto planes that were headed to the United States. Now, those were passenger planes. But Poland arrested those Russians. So you would have thought that the system would be on high alert. I certainly would have the system on high alert. But it appears not to be because there were several layers that this person apparently bypassed, not the least of which is, of course, our TSA, which is our frontline defense. And she should have had three passport checks. One, when you check in. Two, when you go through the TSA. And the third one, because of the international flight, is just before she boards. You have to have that passport checked. So lots of people messed up here, lots.",

Thank you so much, Jacqueline.Now some of the other headlines we're watching this hour. British lawmakers have voted to approve a controversial bill to legalize assisted dying for some terminally ill patients. The measure passed the House of Commons 330 to 275 earlier today after hours of emotional debate. If it's approved by the upper chamber, terminal patients with fewer than six months to live would be allowed to take a substance that would end their lives as long as they are capable of making that decision themselves. The UK would join countries like Canada, Spain, and New Zealand, along with U.S. states like Oregon and California, where assisted dying in some form is legal. And also a first for Starbucks. The coffee chain's newest location in South Korea opened its doors today on an observation tower at the border with North Korea. Customers can sip their coffee while looking out over the reclusive country. A South Korean woman who visited on opening day said she wished she could share her coffee with the North Koreans living just across the border. Quite a view there. And finally today, the Chicago Bears have just fired head coach Matt Eberflus after yesterday's disastrous loss to the Detroit Lions. And if you didn't see it, gosh, you're lucky. After fighting back from a 16-point deficit, the Bears had a chance to tie or win in the final seconds, but with a timeout still available, they inexplicably, for no apparent reason at all, let the clock tick down and were able to run just one play when they should have been able to try to set up a field goal, maybe send the game to overtime. It just didn't happen. It melted down. Eberflus defended his clock management afterward, but the criticism was scathing, and he has now been terminated, the first head coach in the Bears' 100-year history to be fired midseason.",
