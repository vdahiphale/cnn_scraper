Elon and Vivek and I are on a text chain together. And I was explaining to them the background of this. Remember, guys, we still have just a razor-thin margin of Republicans, so any bill has to have Democrat votes. They understand the situation.

Over the ensuing hours -- and in fact, it started before Johnson even went on FOX -- Elon Musk posted dozens of times, dozens. A sampleAnd Republicans in Congress, well, they answered Elon's call. Slowly at first and then seemingly all at once, Republicans in Congress began coming out against the funding bill. And as the afternoon wore on, Musk began reposting them, saying, \"Thank you\" and \"Great.\" Of course, everyone -- especially, it seems the House speaker -- was waiting for President-elect Trump to weigh in. He finally did at 5:13 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, posting on his own social media website, quote, \"Republicans must get smart and tough. If Democrats threaten to shut down the government unless we give them everything they want, then call their bluff,\" end quote. Trump saying he would support funding the government if Congress also raises the debt ceiling for two years. We'll discuss why that's all but impossible for Johnson in just a moment. But the question that the events of yesterday raises is this: who is really calling the shots? Donald Trump or Elon Musk? And who will be calling the shots in January after the president is sworn in?

And there really wasn't a unified stance on how they were going to approach it, except for the fact that by getting spending done until March, you at least bought yourself a little bit of time to get the key nominees confirmed, to get the party to coalesce around what their critical ideas were, maybe even to get a reconciliation bill passed with kay energy and immigration measures. Have a few wins in your pocket and then figure out, OK, we have this very, very thorny debt ceiling that's awaiting us. How are we going to approach it? Which votes are we going to need to get? And to really have that strategy coalesce. Now it seems that there's a view that Trump wants all the bad things to happen on his predecessor's watch, that he wants a shutdown to potentially happen on his predecessor's watch, because it hasn't yet so far in Biden's term. He wants debt to be added to the federal ledger on Biden's watch, because one of the criticisms that Democrats have had so far is that the debt has ballooned under Republicans, not necessarily Democrats.",
