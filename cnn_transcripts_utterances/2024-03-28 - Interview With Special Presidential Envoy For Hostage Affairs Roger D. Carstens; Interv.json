Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Abroad, alone and locked away on trumped-up charges. It is the stuff of nightmares. And yet, for one year, that's been reality for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. He's being held in a Russian prison on the charges of espionage, something he and everyone who knows him denies. And now, a Moscow court has extended his detention by three more months. At the same time, in Gaza, more than a hundred hostages are still being held captive, taken during the brutal October 7th attack on Israel. Negotiations to free them and build a ceasefire have dragged on in Qatar for months. My first guest finds himself at the center of both these crises, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens. Mr. Carstens, welcome back to our program from Washington. Can I just start by asking you, what went through your mind, for what possible reason could Moscow extend Evan's detention for another three months, right at the time of this, you know, anniversary, if you want to put it that way? ROGER D. CARSTENS, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS:  Oh, Christiane, thanks for having me on today to talk about this. I'm grateful for the light that you're shining on this topic. The reason for the extension, I will never really know. If you were to ask what I hope, I would hope that they're extending it so that we have another 90-day period in which to seek ways to come up with a deal that will bring both Evan and Paul Whelan home. I can say that we've had seen in the past that once a trial starts in Russia, the Russians will usually follow through. And so, if the trial process starts with Evan, that might take us into about a seven, eight, nine, 10-month period where we may have a harder time trying to come up with a deal and make a deal to bring him home. So, I think, to my mind, I'm hopeful that the Russians are thinking that in the next 90 days they can work with us to come out with that deal that brings him home before the trial actually starts. But it's hard to get into their heads on this.",

What I can tell you is we're looking very closely at those cases. We're trying to find out more information, but it sometimes takes a long time. I mean, I have to say with Evan, it was just so right in your face. You know, he was just recently accredited again by the Russians, his visa was approved. He was arrested and the next day. The FSB put out a press release. It was pretty clear immediately that Evan was being taken and used as a bargaining chip against the United States.

I think we accept the fact that journalism is a part of our life, we embrace it. It's reasons why I like to come on shows like this and frankly, be held accountable by the members of the media. It's a part of the system that I think we all embrace. And so, the thought of expelling journalists, again, that's going to be up to someone else to make that decision.

And it appears that the United States is doing more of that. What are you -- you're doing that, you're getting more people back, but is there a deterrence that you can be confident in? I will tell you why, because I spoke to Evgenia Kara-Murza, as you know, her husband, Vladimir, who's the Russian-British citizen, another, you know, like Alexei Navalny, a political opponent of Putin's and has been jailed for his stance on the Ukraine war. This is what she told me just this week, Evgenia, about deterrence. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVGENIA KARA-MURZA, WIFE OF JAILED ACTIVIST VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:  I believe that if dictators work together, adopting each other's practices and propping each other, democracies should also bring -- join their efforts to try and curb the rise of the number of political prisoners and hostages around the world, and this cooperation could be achieved through the work of those hostage affairs offices working in cooperation, working together in different democracies to establish a set of instruments that would prevent dictators from taking hostages in the first place.

And we've been working with like-minded partners, partners and allies ever since. There's a great effort being led by the Canadians who put out the declaration against arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations a little over two years ago. And right now, we have 75 signatories who've signed up to support this effort. And we're trying to work with these like- minded countries to find tools that could be used to levy against countries that seem to take people and use them as political bargaining chips. And the goal is to -- if you can build a coalition of like-minded countries maybe 10, 20, 30, 40 countries who are willing to actually take action when a country takes a citizen of one of them as a hostage then we might find a way to raise the price of other countries taking our citizens and have this problem go away.

And I just want to be clear that Israel is in violation of U.S. laws, whether it's the Leahy laws or Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act. The law is very clear here. And I worry very much that not only -- when the administration flouts those laws, it's not only having a devastating effect for the people of Gaza, but for U.S. moral standing abroad.

We have about 15,000 people displaced by the violence, but this is on top of more than 300,000 people who are already displaced by gang violence in Haiti. The humanitarian crisis is extremely dire. The political crisis also that is piling up on top of this is not offering, you know, any relief inside.",

His goal, stated at the time, you know, late in February, was to topple the government of Ariel Henry. But, you know, during this month of March, Ariel Henry announced that his government is going to resign, the attacks did not stop. And until today, we still have police officers being killed by these gangs. And, you know, in the course of this coordinated attack that I mentioned before, two of the biggest prisons in Haiti has been, you know, left open with thousands of inmates, some of them, you know, some of the worst criminals, quite frankly, in the country released in the streets.",

We are talking about probably the worst humanitarian crisis since the 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 300,000 people. And today, as I said before, more than 350,000 people are displaced by gang violence. We have hundreds of hospitals -- I mean, six in 10 hospitals are today closed. We have, you know, the airport that is closed by the gang's violence. And on top of that, you also have the main port of Port-au-Prince, the Caribbean Port Services attacks at least twice by the gangs. And we are in the country where the vast majority of things that we consume in Haiti comes from abroad. So, when you have the airport that is closed and you have also the ports that are not working properly, that means, you know, crucial goods and crucial things that people need to function, we are talking about food, we are talking about medical supplies, we are talking about more than 300 containers of humanitarian supplies seized by the gangs.

We have this (INAUDIBLE) sort of toxic soup of different gangs doing different things, kidnapping people, ransacking business, extorting people, et cetera. But they also have some common interests.

In the past week, since the 29th of February, about 12 police stations were eitherburned down or directly attacked by the gangs and the attacks, you know, continuing. When I talk to police officers, they -- you know, these are the people set up to protect the Haitian population and they are extremely discouraged. They think like the leadership of the police is ineffective. They are on arms and unable to defend themselves, you know, correctly against the gangs that are more than -- more powerful than ever in Haiti. So, if the police is, in that stage, you can imagine what it is to be a regular Haitian going around Port-au-Prince. But not just Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, also in so many other places. I mean, I think the vast majority of the country, quite frankly, is under the influence of gang's activities, making it, you know, difficult for goods to flow, making, you know, displaced people, making it extremely hard for families to get together, you know, sowing chaos and death, you know, amongst people. The anxiety that causes. I have neighbors speaking to me about their kids, you know, kids as little as, you know, 7, 8, 10 years old regularly speaking about death and, you know, being extremely stressed if their parents goes around. And it's not farfetched ideas that, you know, even if you're not in a place entirely under the control of gangs, you know, one of the most fears -- and most important fears in Haiti today is being hit by stray bullets. And you are in a city where, you know, the vast majority of the hospitals are closed. The most important hospital, the public hospital in Port-au- Prince today is closed due to the gang violence. Many doctors are not going to work because, you know, they fear for their lives. And we are talking about a country where more than 40 percent of Haitian trained doctors today already left Haiti.

When I speak to, you know, police officers who, despite everything, despite the fact that they are not paid well, despite that fact they're unequipped, they feel a sense of duty. So many of them tell me to serve and to help. When I see regular Haitians, you now, helping and sharing what they have to help neighbors and to assist however they can, these are small indications for me that people are not hopeless, people taking responsibility, and people know that, you know, a better future is possible whenever they get together and try to do something about their own situations.",
