He wasan American born and raised in Connecticut, moved to Israel a few years ago, served in the Israeli army before actually returning to the States in 2018, attending Columbia University, only graduating last year. He was only in the area to visit friends and to be here for a friend's wedding. Where this attack happened is not far from the main road that many people use to get to places like Jericho and tourist spots like the Dead Sea. In fact, tourists often use this route. In the past, it's been a peaceful, quiet area that people regularly drive along. What the Israeli authorities say happened is, as Elan Ganeles and a few other cars were driving along that route, just near Jericho, some attackers in cars began shooting at passing vehicles. One of those shots hitting Elan Ganeles in the upper body. Medics say he died and the attackers fled and ended up burning their vehicles in the process. They are still on the run. The Israeli military is searching for them. We've heard from Palestinians that the military has set up essentially checkpoints in and around Jericho, trying to comb the area for them. This is kind of a similar attack to what we saw on Sunday to those Israeli brothers, you mentioned, who were shot while they were driving, while they were sitting in traffic. That was in more of a flashpoint place near Huwara in the West Bank. That area, that route especially has been the scene of clashes before, of attacks before. Then of course, as you noted, that rampage by Israeli settlers, setting homes and cars on fire. One Palestinian shot and killed, several others injured as a result of those rampages. As you noted, the Israeli military is sort of in a unique moment, calling them acts of terror. This is a very tense time right now, especially many people are looking at sort of what happened around Jericho. In recent weeks, it has actually seen a bit more activity around Jericho, if you remember, there was an Israeli military raid there that killed five. It is hard to emphasize, you know, we often talk about the occupied West Bank and the military activity there, the violence, the deaths. So much of that that is really focused in places like Nablus and Jenin. But to see these things spreading to places that are typically very peaceful and quiet, like around Jericho, like around the northern Dead Sea, that is very concerning, Becky.",

It's unclear what action the Russians took, except closing the airspace, obviously. Later, the Russian authorities came out and said that there were radio stations that were hacked. There were messages broadcast, talking about air raid alarms. Those were fake. Apparently those air raid alarms sounded like the ones that Ukrainians hear so often when they're under attack from Russian missiles and Russian drones in a lot of towns in Ukraine. Whether or not that was some sort of action that was going on there, the Russians are saying it was fake, the airspace is now open again.
