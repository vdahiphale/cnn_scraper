She's got a tropical storm in the Pacific, she's stuck in September along the East Coast, July- August in the central parts of the country, and more like October- November over the Pacific Northwest. So we've got a full scale of weather impacting the country.This time we're focusing in on the temperatures, and I know you've been getting outside and enjoying these cool, cool mornings we've had. And they're well below average for this time of year from Green Bay all the way to New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, but that is going to come to an end today. We start to see the temperature climb through the course of the weekend. And part of the reason why you've experienced these cool fall-like temperatures is because of the dry air that's been in place over the eastern half of the U.S. And notice how that blue and green gets replaced with more reds, yellows, and oranges. That's because the humidity levels will slowly creep up through the weekend for the Eastern Seaboard as well. Well, it's been downright hot and feeling very summerlike for central Texas. That continues today. The feels like index around 110 for many locations over the central parts of the state. Here's Tropical Storm Hone. Now it's still well to the south and east of the Big Island of Hawaii. Forty-five mile per hour winds with this tropical storm. Newly issued tropical storm watches for the Big Island as this system is anticipated to slowly strengthen and slide just south of the Hawaiian Islands. It will produce a lot of wind -- 60 to 70 mile per hour gusts from Lahaina northward into Maui County and much of the Big Island. But it certainly will be a rainmaker for this area. Good news, Kasie, because much of Hawaii has been in drought. Back to you.",

It's an economy race. It's an economy race.So I do think that potentially, what makes this a little bit different is that Kamala Harris is an African American woman and there are a couple of states in the Sun Belt, Georgia and North Carolina, where if you can really energize the African American vote, if you could really bring voters out to the polls and the restrictions passed by governors in those states don't make it that much harder to vote, et cetera --",

That -- those numbers are going to erode to some extent.There's always been eight, 10, 12, sometimes 15 percent of African Americans who voted Republican. That's nothing new. That is nothing new. Now, Obama's numbers may have gotten higher. And Biden's numbers were higher in 1990 in reaction to the four years of Donald Trump and his disparaging comments about African Americans, his non-policies, his non-diverse judicial appointments, his non- diverse cabinet, and his attacks on African American athletes. So this number has always been there, but I think it will evaporate. Now, notwithstanding that, the Harris campaign has work to do and that work is to move into communities, talk to voters, talk to disaffected voters, and to some extent, it's encouraging them to vote -- to participate and to have confidence that a president can make a difference in their lives or that government can make a difference in their lives. That's one of the challenges with many Americans. It's a disaffection with the system. Sometimes you're reading it as a disaffection with candidates but it's also a disaffection with voting per se. And I think that's the challenge in front of the Harris ticket, particularly in those communities that are going to be pivotal -- Milwaukee, Atlanta, Philadelphia, states -- cities in North Carolina.",

What people miss is the difference between 2016 and 2020.In 2016, you had two third-party candidates who ran very aggressive campaigns and picked up four to five percent of the vote. You also had depressed African American turnout in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee. In 2020, you did have a third-party candidate and turnout was elevated. And I think sometimes people miss where the swing vote in these swing states is not only these Independent voters, it's also voters who don't consistently turn out. And so I think that the factor of the third-party candidates is very interesting. Robert Kennedy seems to be on his way out of the race.",
