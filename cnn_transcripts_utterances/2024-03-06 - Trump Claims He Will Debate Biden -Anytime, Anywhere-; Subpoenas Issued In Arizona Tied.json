Plus, the breaking news tonight, Arizona's investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election getting bigger. New subpoenas just issued as investigators look into people tied to Trumps campaign. And this hour, a CNN exclusive. Our Ivan Watson spending 48 hours on a Philippine coast guard ship as, suddenly, it is confronted by the Chinese -- windows shattering, Chinese water cannons blasting America's ally ship. And tonight, the Pentagon responds. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: anytime, anywhere, any place. The former President Trump claims he wants to debate President Biden now that he is just a few hundred delegates away from securing the Republican nomination, now unopposed. This from the man who refused to debate any of his political opponents no place, no time during the primaries, walking away from the second presidential debate back in 2020. Well, tonight, Biden's campaign responding, writing that it's a conversation that they'll have, quote, at the appropriate time. Trump's sudden, his newfound desire to debate does come just hours after Nikki Haley suspended her campaign. And she stopped short of endorsing Trump.

Well, that's quite an appeal when you feel like you're lost and he really liked somebody and, you know, okay, obviously. The question is, it's more than that. It's more than the optics. It's whether Nikki Haley's supporters can look past some truly stark differences between the two and what they stand for, not just who they are and how they conduct themselves, what they stand for, like the crucial issue of NATO and Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

First, I would point to the president's record, getting the economy back on its feet, helping to build the strongest economy in the world, 15 million jobs created under his watch, all sorts of bipartisan legislation passed that so many commentators were skeptical of when he came into office. He has a record of being an extremely effective president. You've seen that play out over the past three years. But I also think the age of the president's ideas matter. As you pointed out, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, about the same age, but their ideas are very different. Donald Trump took his back 50 years, when it came to Roe versus Wade.
