This will end that battle that began back in 2015 when Trump announced his first run for president and he broke with modern precedent by refusing to disclose his personal financial information as a candidate and as a sitting president.So why are they coming out now? Well, it's the Supreme Court, in short. That November decision following a lengthy court battle is what paved the way for the release that's about to happen in just moments from now. And this is significant. Lawmakers have rarely sought to make public confidential taxpayer information. There is some precedent. Now we're going to see a whole new one today. CNN's Lauren Fox is live on Capitol Hill for CNN this morning. Lauren, what time are we expecting these to come out? That's what everyone really wants to know.",

We should talk about the importance of this moment because it is coming mere four days before Republicans take control of the House of Representatives, and we should note that this was really one of the last possible moments that Democrats could get these documents into the congressional record before Republicans take control. And we didn't always expect that this information would become public. Remember that when the Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal requested these documents back in 2019, he said he needed this information to understand how the presidential audit program worked. Last week lawmakers had a closed-door meeting in the Ways and Means Committee to try to discuss what they wanted to do with these underlying returns. They voted. They decided along party lines to release them. But obviously a moment that Republicans are calling unprecedented and coming just before Democrats hand power over to the House Republicans on Tuesday.",

We already knew that Donald Trump Jr. had sent a text message to Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, on November 5th essentially saying, you should look into the state legislators blocking the vote or electoral -- using fake electors to help Trump win. And then what he says to the House select committee when they ask him about this, he says, the idea sounded plausible to him, that it seemed like an idea that was sophisticated and that he wanted someone to look into it.So he was going directly to the person that was the closest conduit in the White House to the president, his father, at the time. That was Mark Meadows, and he was pushing this to Mark Meadows. And Meadows eventually did respond to him that he was working on things like this. We see later in other people's transcripts other actions that Meadows took. Others were recounting what they remembered from meetings and interactions with the White House chief of staff. One of them comes from Christina Bobb, she was the lawyer working with Donald Trump. And she remembered a meeting where Mark Meadows met with Senator Lindsey Graham, and Graham said, in Christina Bobb's telling, just give me five dead voters. Give me an example of illegals voting. Just give me a very small snapshot that I can take and champion. So people like Lindsey Graham at the time after the election were very interested in trying to help Trump advance this myth of voter fraud. Graham ultimately didn't do anything with the information that the campaign provided because it was so implausible.",
