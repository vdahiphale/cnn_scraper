Although we've been -- we've been tracking it sort of through our sources, you know, for some time throughout the night.Look, I mean, there's not much detail about this. I can tell you what the FSB say, which is that they've terminated the illegal activities of an American journalist. They've named him as Evan Gershkovich, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter. Here's what they say: he was on mission from the American side and had been accumulated -- accumulating classified evidence relating to one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex. He was in Yekaterinburg, which is a city about 1,100 miles to the East of Moscow, Northeast in the Ural region. There's a lot of factories around there, a lot of military factories. And so it's very possible, although we don't know for sure, that you know, that he could have come into contact with -- with some of these highly-secretive military facilities. The FSB goes on to say that while he attempted to receive secret evidence, he was apprehended in Yekaterinburg, that city. They have launched a criminal proceeding against him under Section 276 of the criminal code, which is espionage in Russia. And of course, those are immensely serious charges, carrying up to 20 years in a Russian jail if conviction is -- is found. You mentioned \"The Wall Street Journal,\" that the reaction from them; they're saying they're deeply concerned. About the safety of their reporter, not any heard any more from them yet. The State Department has not issued an official statement yet either, because obviously, Mr. Gershkovich is an American citizen, but we're expecting that very soon -- Kaitlan.",

They've criminalized critical reporting here in Russia of the Russian state. It's against the law, for instance, to criticize the Russian military. But to be clear, these are much more serious charges than that. I mean, espionage is, obviously, one of the most serious things you can be accused of as a journalist in this -- in this country. We don't know the exact details of that. But getting information secret information about the military industrial complex. I mean, it may be about military facilities, but it can also cover a whole range of other issues, as well. I mean, look, I'm sure Evan Gershkovich was doing all the things that that we're all trying to do: you know, meeting people who have got family members in the Russian military taking place. Taking part in the Ukrainian conflict, but Russia calls it special military operation. There's also sort of concerns about arms manufacturing, and whether Russia's got enough supplies and so hopefully we'll get more details in the hours ahead.",

And this is one of those moments, sadly.During the Cold War, it was not uncommon for Western reporters, American, reporters to be arrested and charged with being instruments of the state. It was usually made up. There was a very famous case in 1986 of Nick Daniloff and then for the \"U.S. News and World Report,\" who was arrested when he was doing ordinary reporting and -- on, I think, during a farewell time. He was meant to leave Moscow. He was handed a group of papers, including newspaper clippings that included some secret papers, or so the Russians, so the Soviets at the time said.

Artillery shortage hampers Russia's offensive in East Ukraine, Western officials say.

But that's not what he has been arrested for, if you believe the FSB. Look, he's a very skilled economics reporter, among other things. He used to work at \"The New York Times\" earlier in his career. And he undoubtedly, in reporting on the Russian economy, is going to end up touching on issues that are sensitive to them at a time that the economy in Russia clearly is in tough shape, thanks to sanctions.

All we know at this point is that there were, quote, \"several casualties.\" And he of course, said that \"we will share more information as available.

A congressional report published in 2018 found between 2006 and 2018, nearly 32 percent of active-duty military deaths were the result of these kinds of accidents.

And so he came here yesterday afternoon and will need to stay for a few days, according to the Vatican, in order to receive medical treatment. Now, the pope, as you mentioned, is 86 years old. When he was 21, he had part of his lung removed because of a respiratory illness, so that's something to take into consideration for this issue. We also know, of course, he has been suffering from mobility problems, causing him to use a wheelchair. Sometimes that's due to a knee problem. And the last time he was here it was the summer of 2021 for 10 days because of diverticulitis. He had part of his colon removed. So that's his sort of health situation, as it were.
