      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.New reporting on the concerns inside Trump's team, after they were caught off-guard by a sexual assault allegation made against the President-Elect's pick to lead the Pentagon. Plus, we'll speak to a source who worked inside the first Trump administration. What she saw then, and why it's even more relevant this time around. And Elon Musk, now hiring for the Department of Government Efficiency, the outside group that Trump has likened to the Manhattan Project of this era. Are you in the top 1 percent of super high-IQ candidates, willing to work 80-plus hours per week? Oh, and did I mention, you'd be working for free? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. From the halls of Mar-a-Lago, this evening, several candidates are still milling about, as President-Elect Donald Trump is slated to announce even more Cabinet picks in the coming days. But news and a sexual assault allegation about one of his most controversial choices is roiling his senior staff, tonight. I have new details on how there are real questions, inside Trump's team, about Pete Hegseth's future as the next Secretary of Defense. He was already facing questions about his ability to be confirmed by the Senate. That was before Trump's team learned, this week, of a sexual assault allegation, against Hegseth, from seven years ago. It had only been about 48 hours, since Trump announced his pick, when the transition team was brought information that aligns with what Monterey, California Police describe as an investigation into an alleged sexual assault involving Hegseth, on October 8, 2017. Hegseth had been slated as a speaker at a conference that was held by the California Federation of Republican Women. That was at a hotel, during the time when that alleged assault took place. That's according to photos that were posted on Facebook and confirmed by CNN. Now, I should note, Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case. His attorney denied any wrongdoing here. But the information was serious enough that Trump's incoming Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, questioned Hegseth, about it, during a call, this week, we're told. Wiles also asked Hegseth, if there were any issues that the team should be aware of, moving forward. That's one concern that I've heard from other sources in this world, as that there could be more information to come out. Now, it's important to recall here, just how fast Hegseth was chosen for this job. He had not been on any initial shortlist for Pentagon potentials. He was given the gig, about 24 hours after he had been summoned to Mar-a-Lago for an interview. He was never vetted by an outside firm. And I'm told, he had very little internal vetting. The Trump transition team has not signed ethics agreements with the federal government yet. That's an important part of the transition process that typically happens, when one candidate wins the election, and still works with the current administration. But what it means by not signing those agreements means that no FBI background checks have occurred. Even though Trump's Transition Co-chair was here, just a few weeks ago, on this set, saying that they would soon sign those agreements. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOWARD LUTNICK, CO-CHAIR, TRUMP-VANCE TRANSITION TEAM: It's not going to be an issue. We are ready for the transition for Trump-Vance. We are so ready.",

I remember, in Trump's first term, he was actually -- his name was thrown around for a potential Veterans Affairs cabinet position. It was quickly withdrawn in, in a sense (ph), where people didn't take it seriously. I spoke to someone, today, who was working for Trump, at that time, and said there were rumors about this. Not substantiated. They don't know. But that's something that would have been a discussion, right, when you're deciding who to put in this cabinet role? BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Yes, this is really even shocking for the Trump-world, to have had no real vetting, to move this quickly. And I think it's a sign of sort of an impending recklessness. In the first Trump administration, to be fair, he chose a lot of very well-established figures, for key posts, folks who had very distinguished records, and had gone through vetting before. This time, it seems to be go as fast as they can, be as reckless as they can be, as extreme as they can, and it's coming back to bite them. And I think what is perhaps being forgotten here is now the public is forming their opinion of Donald Trump as a leader, not as a candidate, as a leader. This is not a good start, especially when two major figures have sexual assault or sexual misconduct allegations, or facts against them from jump. I think, particularly for the women of this country, that's going to raise questions anew about what this President is going to be all about.",

But they were -- they're worried more would come out. But I think the question is, ultimately, not just that Trump's team cares, but does Trump himself care? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, HOST, \"THE BIG DEAL WITH ERROL LOUIS\" ON SPECTRUM NEWS: Well, look, Donald Trump jumped out here with sort of a speed and energy that are actually just reckless, right? I mean, there's no reason that he needed to name all of these people, in the first 10 days, right? It could have been 10 weeks. It could have been spread out. You could have put a process in place, even if it was clear, who the President wanted. He could have told the transition team, Here's who I want, but let's go through the particulars, make sure that there's nothing out there embarrassing.

People lose their life as a result? Or if it is Hegseth, for example, and he can't handle the managerial reality of the Pentagon, because he's never been close to that level of management? Or if Tulsi Gabbard does something that seems to favor Russia? You go down the list, these are all vulnerabilities that will all come back to haunt the Trump administration.

His spokesperson responded, tonight, to that comment, by pointing to the Justice Department's years-long investigation that ended without any charges. Saying in a statement to CNN, quote, \"Merrick Garland's DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn't charge him. Are you alleging\" that \"Garland is part of a cover-up?\" The question remains, tonight, though, about what happens to the House Ethic Committee -- House Ethics Committee's investigation, and whether or not its report will be released, now that Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. Joining me now tonight: Julie Roginsky, founder of Lift Our Voices, the non-profit which advocates for survivors of sexual assault and harassment. And Elie Honig, who's the former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Elie, DOJ did decline to pursue charges. And the question that Speaker Johnson was saying today, after saying initially, they don't get involved in this, and then saying today, he would advocate for no release, was, he's not a member of Congress anymore, so why would this get released? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So, it's up to Congress whether they release that report. There's nothing particularly privileged about the report. It's just a matter of what Congress wants to do. We've actually seen them change the rules. For example, you probably remember, a few years ago, Congress voted to release Donald Trump's tax returns. Now, ordinarily, those don't get released. But they took a vote, and that's how it came out. But really important to know, whether or not that document, the actual House Ethics report gets released, the facts that are contained therein are open game, as we're seeing now with this new reporting. People who were interviewed, witnesses, lawyers, they're free to come forward. And if Matt Gaetz's nomination moves forward? I don't know about all of this. But a lot of this could well come out, and it's going to cause him problems upon problems.",

It is true, DOJ chose not to charge him. But the attorney used the word, cleared. Said Merrick Garland, cleared Matt Gaetz. That is not true. DOJ -- all the time, as a prosecutor, you will have situations where you maybe have no evidence, maybe some evidence, maybe something more than some evidence, but you choose not to charge.

It's for Homes For Our Troops, which is a very special organization. All the money that they raise helps build specially-adapted custom homes for severely-wounded 9/11- post veterans. I can't think of a better cause, and I would love for you to donate to Zoom with me, in order to help out this group that does so much. Bidding is open, right now, for a few more days. You can check out all the items. They have a lot of amazing ones. It's on ebay.com/hfot. I've also posted it on Twitter and on Instagram. This auction is open until next Thursday, November 21st. I hope you'll join us. Also, this Sunday, here on CNN, the Original Series, \"How It Really Happened,\" is going to take us back to the fall of 1982. That was when seven people, in the Chicago area, died under seriously -- under mysterious circumstances. And at first, doctors were at a loss for an explanation. But they soon discovered a sinister connection. All the victims had recently taken cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, he asked his wife to go get him a couple of Tylenol. And then, a few minutes later, she took two Tylenol, and he went down, and then she went down. Both collapsed.",
