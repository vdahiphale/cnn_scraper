And this is the second time this judge has found that these emails should be released, they can't be protected specifically because they could be evidence of the furtherance of a crime. It's called a crime fraud exception to attorney/client privilege. It allows investigators to get access to things.And this really is a monumental finding from a federal judge. It does two things, potentially very quickly. Right now, Eastman is in a position where these emails could be released to the House select committee. Previously, they got emails right around January 6th. This is a much wider portfolio, the entire month of December of 2020 leading up, so, a lot of additional context that the House may not have had before. And then the second thing that it does is it has a federal judge on paper looking at documents that could be potential evidence and saying what they actually mean. And his finding is that these emails, eight of them in particular, could show a crime in progress.",

And so that is all going to go to the House. We're already seeing a little bit. And we can even look back at those previous court filings.

And conspiracy to defraud the United States, knowing what you were saying is incorrect.Important to keep in mind, though, the judge here is using a different standard. Correctly, he's using a standard that it's more likely than not. Prosecutors will ultimately have to make a decision to charge, have to meet a much higher burden to proof, proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Importantly, though, these emails, these crime fraud emails now go to the January 6 committee, very short, a skip and a hop to prosecutors who may already have them, but if not, they can now get those from the January 6th committee. And, John, it's just more bad news for John Eastman, this lawyer.

Trump's team said, okay, here's what you have in response to the subpoena, that's all the classified documents. That turned out not to be true. And, finally, in August, DOJ went and did the search warrant. So, now, what options does DOJ have if they believe there're still documents there? They can negotiate nicely, they could try another subpoena, they could do a search warrant. This option, if you believe it, is sort of a hybrid of negotiation will do a quasi search warrant escorted through Mar-a-Lago by Trump's team.

So, it's a really extreme draconian set of legislation which has been introduced, martial law, in those areas.The caveat, of course, is that, first of all, these areas are already, for the most part, under -- they're in a wartime situation. There's fierce fighting going on, particularly around the area of Kherson, to the southeast of Ukraine. But also Russia doesn't control large areas of these places as well.

This was one of the ways of voting that was presented there in that county that led to some of the highest voter turnout that that county had seen in some time. But it has come under a great deal of fire, especially from Republicans here in Texas.This letter outlines what they believe what the secretary of state says they believe is breaches of security and chain of custody and the way information was gathered from those mobile ballot boxes. But this has really come under fire from Democrats, especially in Harris County who say that the timing of this letter is, from in the words of the county judge there in Harris County, is the timing of all of this just days before early voting starts is, at best, suspicious. The Texas Civil Rights Project went on to describe this as saying that it was an effort to intimidate voters in Harris County. The Texas Secretary of State's Office said this is something that is often done and there is some truth to that, that there are inspectors that are often sent to counties across the state in moments like this. In this letter, the Texas Secretary of State's Office writes, these inspectors will perform randomized checks of election records, including tapes and chain of custody issues that will -- involved in the handling of the electronic data and ballots, excuse me, my eyes are going on me here. So, those are some of the issues. But the letter also goes on to say, John, that the Texas Attorney General's Office will be sending inspectors and a task force as well, and that is one of the issues that is really raising alarms among Democrats. The attorney general, of course, on the ballot, he's a very controversial figure here in the state, and they say that it really kind of sends a wrong message that this A.G., who's so controversial and involved in his own election, is going to be responding to questions raised by voters, inspectors, as well as people who are poll workers, who are working on that.

It's not from the doctors that treated his stroke, so I think that's important to note. But that said, I mean, I think the question for average Americans is if your primary care doctor wrote a letter to your boss and said, hey, you're good to go to work, would that be good enough for you? And I think for a lot of people, the answer is going to be yes, but I think there are still some twists and turns left in the race to see, for sure.",

And one of the things I think Obama has been very careful about when I talk to Democrats is he knows he can be a polarizing figure for independent voters. So, one of those states have in common. I think you're looking at particularly black voter turnout. If you're talking about Wisconsin, if you're talking about places like Milwaukee, I'm not sure exactly what city Obama is going to but there are several that would fall into that category. Stacey Abrams, same kind of thing down in Georgia, turning out the black vote.I think the comments that Obama has made recently in public are actually kind of pretty introspective and interesting about kind of how he sees his role in where our politics stand today, what voters are looking for from their politicians, some of the mistakes perhaps that progressive Democrats have made. But I think he's acutely aware in the Trump era of the way he comes across.",
