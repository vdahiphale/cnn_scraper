      "sentences": "There's good news for borrowers. The Federal Reserve delivering a quarter of a percentage point rate cut. It was a unanimous decision and of course, it adds to the half a percentage point rate cut that they did back in September.In many respects, that's the easy part of today. The harder part comes next, and that's the press conference that we've got in around 30 minutes time. And it's a case of the do's and the don'ts for Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. What they do want to be talking about today is the fact that they've managed to engineer what we call a soft landing. They've hiked rates, they've avoided recession, at least for now, and they're very close to their inflation target. What they don't want to be talking about, quite frankly is, is Donald Trump. Good luck with that. So where that leaves us basically is a situation where we know what's clear now is that while they can cut rates today, the future path of interest rates now is more uncertain. And what that depends on is the policy decisions of the president elect, his government, of course, and who wins the House. Very important point to that, too. At worst, let's take the worst case, if he enacts mass immigration limits, mass global tariffs, it could slow growth, it could also raise inflation. Economists generally agree we could see 1 percentage point rise in inflation next year. That's going to slow the Federal Reserve down in their ability to cut rates. But of course, all we're doing is guessing at this stage. And that's the challenge for Jay Powell today. But I will say, we are already seeing an impact for consumers, guys. I'm really closely following longer term government borrowing costs because these are very much tied to what we're seeing for mortgage rates in the United States. If you take a look at the 30-year mortgage rate chart, we're seeing mortgage rates rise right now. Now, some part of this is normal. When the Federal Reserve cuts rates, you see these borrowing costs rise, but it can also be tied to the prospect of more spending. It can also be tied to the prospect of more inflation. So that's something I think that Jay Powell will also address today, even as he does his best to avoid talking politics, avoid talking about Donald Trump, and avoid talking about the things that he doesn't know yet. We have to wait to see what the government do.",

You know, the Fed is moving towards something that's more neutral. It's been leaning against growth in the economy, trying to slow the pace at which we get inflation. It's been largely successful in doing that. And so it is now moving back toward neutral. Given what we know, I think that it's exactly in the right place. The main part of the economic landscape, however, are the unknowns, what will the incoming Trump administration do with tariffs, with taxes, with spending, and, you know, what will happen in the global economy? So they're constantly rebalancing as they find out more about the conditions in which they're operating.",

And yet, the stock market seemed to react positively to Trump's election. What's going on there?HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, I try hard not to try to explain the stock market. The stock market has two components. One, the earnings of those firms that are listed on the stock market. And if their future earnings look better, stocks go up. And two, the path of interest rates and other competitive vehicles for your savings. You can put in the stock market, you put in the bond market. So as people make different judgments about future interest rates and future earnings, you see the stock market move around. It can move a lot in a single day. And then they can reconsider it. It might pull back some. So it's best to look at the stock market over a sustained period. I think if we get to June of 2025 and you still see it rising at those kinds of rates, that would be an enormous success. But I don't expect anything that large.",

So, you know, if you lower the corporate tax rate, that means the earnings, the after tax earnings of businesses is higher and that goes right to higher stock prices. And he's also talked about less regulation in a lot of different industries, financial services, fossil fuel, the telecom, and IT industry. So less regulation means more profits, means higher stock prices. He's probably also going to take a less kind of a jaundiced view ofmergers and acquisitions. You know, the Biden administration has been pretty tough on M&amp;A in effort to improve competitive pressures in industries to get prices down. But I think the Trump administration would be less likely to do that. So that's all positive for the stock market and that's why stock prices, I think, are up to the degree that they are.",

But today, when the President said this line in the Rose Garden, the audience was not Donald Trump. It was actually the millions of Americans that he understands is feeling very disappointed and is feeling frustrated by the idea of Donald Trump coming back to the White House for another four years.The President said, you're hurting. I hear you and I see you. But what he insisted was that even though all of those feelings may be valid, the results of the election are what they are. And people around the country, even if they are disappointed, must accept those results. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree.

A lot of folks that I've spoken to essentially saying, we wouldn't find ourselves in this position had the President decided not to seek a second term and sort of stuck to that initial promise of being a bridge and a transition president. The idea being that had the Democratic Party had been able to go through the process of nominating someone under the sort of protocols that are typically used in our political system, having the full runway, basically, perhaps it would have been Kamala Harris that was nominated, perhaps not, but that we wouldn't have seen this unusual truncated Kamala Harris campaign that resulted in her lose.But there's also just a lot of anger that is being directed at President Biden himself and also some of those advisers close to him for their refusal over the recent years to tolerate any kind of criticism about his health and certainly any suggestions that the president should step aside. This is what one senior Harris campaign official told me. They said the, lack of a competitive process for a replacement that he didn't allow for that to happen. People are still angry about the shunning that they took for speaking out earlier about him. So, Boris and Brianna, Democrats are clearly starting down the process of this soul searching after the events of this week.

Jimmy Carter set in motion the deregulation that liberated our economy, much of the credit for that, goes to his successor, Ronald Reagan. But in fact, it's Jimmy Carter who began that process of deregulating the airlines and other transportation systems, all of which helped the U.S. economy in the 1980s. He doesn't get credit for it, although now historians and others are beginning to relook at his time in office. That didn't help Jimmy Carter become a second term president, just as the infrastructure bill clearly didn't help that Biden-Harris team come and have a second term.But historically, presidents, while they have to worry about four year cycles, are also the really good ones, are also investing in our future.

And he said that Donald Trump is really taking this responsibility of filling an administration and a Cabinet much more seriously than he ever did before, that he has privately acknowledged that he thinks he made mistakes when it came to his first term, and that he wants to make sure he fills those positions with people who are competent and also very loyal to him. We know that loyalty is probably the number one issue for Donald Trump.So just to talk about a few of the positions that he's currently looking at, one, of course, is going to be chief of staff. This is a critical position in the White House. It's going to be his right hand and somebody that he needs to be able to rely on under any circumstances. And we are told that the frontrunner in that position currently at this very moment is Susie Wiles, who ran his campaign, who was by his side after he left Washington in disgrace in 2021, after most Republicans were trying to distance themselves from the former President after January 6th, and hoping some of them that he would not be coming back into power. Susie remained by his side. She ran his campaign. And she ran it likely better than anyone we've ever seen run a campaign for the former President, getting him back into office, but also trying to control his worst and instincts, which we know is very hard to do. And she was obviously not always successful at that. Now, the other position I want to talk about here is attorney general. This is going to be critical in a Trump administration as it is in any, but even more so because Donald Trump wants to make sure that he and the White House have complete control over Department of Justice. He's going to need somebody who is loyal to him in that sense. So here's a list of people we're talking about right now. Again, this is still shifting. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Matt Whitaker, he served as acting AG under Donald Trump when he fired Jeff Sessions, Utah Senator Mike Lee is in consideration, John Ratcliffe, who served as the former Director of National Intelligence. Another person that we have not mentioned who's not on this list is Mark Paoletta, who is someone who's actually running the policy side of the Justice Department of Transition, just within the transition here, and somebody who a lot of people would like to see inside of a White House. So these are just the beginning. But we are told that Donald Trump might make some of these decisions within the Cabinet in the next week. So we'll have our eyes open. And we were talking to as many people as we can to hear who's in -- who's up and who's down.",

Kamala Harris actually had policies that would help Latinos, has helped Latino quite a bit over the last four years.
