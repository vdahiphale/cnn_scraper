I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Democracy appears under threat from Asia, where South Korea has announced martial law to America, where Donald Trump soon takes office again, naming a raft of staunch loyalists to his cabinet, whose credentials and character for the job are in question. In a moment, we'll bring you my in-depth interview with Germany's longest serving chancellor, Angela Merkel. But first, to Seoul and the shock decision by the president to declare martial law for the first time in four decades. Protests erupted at the National Assembly and within hours, lawmakers unanimously rejected that declaration. Senior American officials say they are very concerned by what is happening there. Kenneth Choi is the international editor for one of South Korea's major newspapers, and he's joining us now with an update from Seoul. Kenneth Choi, welcome to the program. Let's just go to what's actually the latest news, and that is the parliament has rejected this, even members of the president's own party has rejected it, and it appears that at least some of the military are withdrawing from parliament. What is the very latest from you, where you are?",

Our journalists were actually informed around 9:30 p.m. that the president will make an announcement, and nobody knew that it was going to be a martial law thing. And when he was actually saying it, everybody was so shocked. You know, we never -- I never thought that I would see the day of I'll be living under the martial law since 1981. So, it was a complete shock. Korea is like 12th largest economy in the world. We had -- we enjoyed a very vibrant democracy. And all of a sudden, you know, my freedom of speech, my freedom of expression will be all limited. I don't think any Koreans would accept that. So, you know, a lot of people are scratching their heads and there's a big question mark why the president, you know, made this, you know, announcement? And what did he really thought through?

And later in the program, we will hear from South Korea's former foreign minister about all of this. But first, Donald Trump's return to the White House signals, in many ways, the decisive end of an era with populist nationalism and a rejection of the status quo ahead. When Trump first became president in 2016, his predecessor, Barack Obama, privately told Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, that she, was now having to be the leader of the free world. But eight years later, it seems, all that she worked for, multilateralism, strong alliances, are on the way out in favor of more hardline movements on trade, migration, and much more. Angela Merkel was at the helm of Europe's most for 16 years. One of the longest serving and most powerful European leaders. She worked with four U.S. presidents, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden. She grew up in communist East Germany, behind what was then the Iron Curtain. She was a scientist by training and she governed based on facts, compromise, and pragmatism. Merkel is now opening up about her time in power, dishing on Trump, Putin, and some of her legacy defining decisions, like welcoming more than a million Syrian refugees into Germany. And I'm just back from Washington where I caught up with her on her \"Freedom\" book tour. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean,you're not shy about saying quite a lot of really interesting things that you never would have said in office. But also, we're in the United States. There's a new president of the United States who will take office in January, Donald Trump. You worked with him once. I want to start sort of at the beginning, and there's been a lot made and you've written about it, when you were one of the first world leaders to meet him. You came to Washington. And out of sight of the cameras, you shook hands. You did your thing, et cetera. In sight of the cameras, in the famous Oval Office with the fireplace between you, he didn't want to shake hands with you. And even though you asked him kind of discreetly, he just refused point blank and kept looking at the cameras. And I thought it was really interesting because you said, he wanted to create conversation fodder through his behavior, while I thought I was having a discussion with somebody completely normal. Is he not completely normal in your view? MERKEL (through translator):  I think President Trump lives off actually acting unconventionally, and in this way draws the attention of people to himself. Either he shook the hands of some of my colleagues three times longer than you usually do, or with me, he didn't do it at all. At this point in time, I had forgotten and normally he would say, well, you shake hands and that's it. But when you're in this situation, you don't -- and you don't even think about it. But with him, all of these external things, these gestures, all was -- were part of a statement because he wanted to very clearly show that outside of political talks, in these situations, he puts down a marker, whatever he means with it.",

But when you think about tariffs on steel, for example, at first, they were only talking about China and he was talking about the subsidies that China injects into the steel industry. And then, all of a sudden, we were also covered by tariffs. And these tariffs are still in place today, unfortunately. But then, he wanted to put down a marker, make a statement on this. But in spite of all adversity, we were covered by tariffs. NATO members able to pursue NATO in a sensible way, and I would hope and wish that this happens also in the next four years to come.",

MERKEL (through translator):  Honestly speaking, I never heard this and I wouldn't want to make any comment on this. I said that he was fascinated, not too much co-determination as it were, or too many other people having a say. He wanted to be the person who makes the judgment and the call.

But we in Europe are also important. The United States of America cannot do things on their own completely. We have an alliance. We have NATO together. So, this is not just something where we owe something to the Americans, as Donald Trump quite often said, but the United States of America, too, must have a vested interest or should have a vested interest. At least that would be my advice, because when we stand together, we're simply stronger, and there are so many in the world who do not want democracy.

But you also have written in your book about whatit was like to negotiate with Donald Trump. And all of this is important, not just to look back, but to look forward. Because you've talked about tariffs. Well, he has threatened already, not even in office yet, to slap huge tariffs on many, many different countries, including possibly Europe. And you've described him as a negotiator who didn't see a win-win situation. Tell me how he came across as a negotiator. MERKEL (through translator):  Well, for me, it was clear that with him there will not be a free trade agreement, for example, between the European Union and the United States of America. With President Obama, we had tried to come to this Transatlantic Trade Agreement. We negotiated that. And I didn't think that this was possible Donald Trump. I think at the end of the day, Donald Trump would always weigh what his actions mean for the American voter and for the American citizen and weigh that in the balance. And one of the issues here are high prices. So, if I were to impose tariffs on countries where I might be able to buy things cheaply and due to the terrorist prices will rise, then it will be difficult for somebody such as President Trump, and he didn't want prices to rise, at least not for been years ago. So, there will be big discussions over tariffs and the impact of that. That's very clear. But President Trump always said to his voters, also during his first term in office, that he will have a better life due to him if they vote for him. So, there are very good reasons to look at the world being sort of linked by all of these different bonds, and the United States doesn't have all of these raw materials and raw resources that they need for production on their own. They need the rest of the world for this.",

I hope and trust, at least, this was the case last time that NATO will prevail, but the request that the Europeans too or the demand that the Europeans pay more, will still be out there. Germany is now paying the 2 percent that we agreed on in Wales, but the American defense budget is way higher. And the challenge for Europe, also with regard to Russia in order to develop a credible deterrence, will be to also increase defense expenditure. So, I assume that, I have to say, that 2 percent will probably not be the end of it. And that's what I write in my book too. That's my prediction.",

In your book, you write aboutTrump's negotiation to get U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, and you essentially say that the way it was done, with no communication with the Afghan government, only with the Taliban, the fate of Afghanistan was sealed, that essentially, Afghanistan was given back to the Taliban. So, everybody's trying to figure out what is Trump going to do when he says, I can end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours or whatever. What do you think, knowing what you know about this particular individual and knowing what you know about Putin, how do you think, under these two presidents, that war is going to be ended? MERKEL (through translator):  This war is such an incredible suffering for the Ukrainian population and President Zelenskyy proved to be so courageous when on the day of the aggression happened, didn't leave the country, didn't flee, but stayed in the country and is fighting ever since for a sovereign Ukraine. I don't want to speculate. I don't want to say I can compare this with Afghanistan. I can only say the result of Afghanistan was a disaster. Because once you have an elected government, such as the Afghan government, and not include them into such negotiations. So, basically, give to those who actually violate human rights every day, and give them the power of attorney, so to speak, then later on they have all the possibilities at their disposal to set the conditions. There was no internal peace process in Afghanistan due to this, and President Biden actually accepted that and that result of the negotiations, and we saw that this didn't mean anything good for the Afghan people, even until today. But in Ukraine, well, it will depend on how Europe will sort of -- and this is -- it's sort of due to my successor, how Europe will position itself. I can't say anything on this now.",

In your book, you write point blank that Putin told you a brazen lie when you confronted him about Russian troops inside Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in 2014. And he also, at one point told you, look at what's happening in Ukraine, this is the 2004 revolution, the orange revolution, I will never allow that to happen. How can anybody negotiate with somebody who you yourself, who knew Putin pretty well, calls a brazen liar? MERKEL (through translator):  Well, at the beginning of my work as federal chancellor, that was not what he did. He did not say these brazen lies, but later on in Crimea, he did admit that, that he had lied. And that was a turning point in our relationship, quite clearly, that I had to be extremely cautious in my approach towards him. So, you cannot only trust in an agreement with him, that's absolutely correct. So, we have to give to Ukraine, in which form whatsoever, security guarantees, very clear and absolutely reliable guarantees as we did gave them when they said we're going to dispense with our nuclear power at the time. But Ukraine cannot be left without any security guarantee in what maybe we think is a peace. In my book, I write quite clearly that apart from the military support for Ukraine, it is very important to also think now of how a diplomatic solution can look like after the end of the war.",

I thought about it later on, and I think I've grown into a feminist, if you like, over time in my very own way, because there were two differences. I think I was never out there on the front fighting for feminist issue other women did that and I didn't want to as it were sort of say that I did that. And in the west, it was always said, for example, that in the GDR, we had actually participation women. There was equal opportunity, but we never actually had equal participation in power. There had never been a female member in the Politburo. So, I must say that promoting women's issue is important. And if we want to have equal opportunity, gender parity for men and women, we have to fight for it. And this is what I did over time. I am a feminist in my very own way, but I never saw it in a way that we need to push men aside. Men have to change, yes, of course, if we actually want to have a truly a world where there is true parity. They will have to take over jobs that women have done so far.",

I mean, you don't usually say I get out of bed today and that's a big task, so I will be able to manage. But I thought that this was indeed a huge task for us, but I was convinced that we can do this. And I was, as you say, bludgeoned over the head because of that. And I don't think rightly so, because there was, in a way, created this impression as if I didn't do anything in order to reduce illegal migration. But I entered into negotiations with Turkey, for example, it was simply unimaginable for me that people who are in need, in distress, individuals stand at the very sort of border of our country, and we send water cannons to get rid of them, to keep them away from the German border. And next Sunday, I give a Sunday speech saying, we hold these values of human dignity and so on. And these people have, after all, been by human traffickers under their -- threat to their lives been smuggled to Germany. And when we negotiated the E.U. asylum system and also negotiated this agreement with Turkey, people criticized me. They said, how can you negotiate something like this with President Erdogan? But well, we will have to. Also, in trying to combat this inflow of refugees and deal with it politically by negotiating with people who are not died in the war -- Democrats, as we see them, it's in the interest of the people because these days, these particular refugees are closer to their home country.

I'll still stay as president and I won't let it happen. Do you think that he will never let that happen? MERKEL (through translator):  At the time, what he said, he didn't say, I will still be there, but he said something similar to that. I said, you will not always be president either, which is totally clear. But what's true is that this was actually -- he had a point there. For me, the collapse of the Soviet Union meant that I was finally able to have freedom as a GDR citizen, but I think Brzezinski did write a book about the Grand Chess Board, and he wrote that it's going to be interesting to see whether one day Ukraine becomes a member of NATO, and he said that it was, actually, in America's vested interest. And once Ukraine is in NATO, Russia is no longer a great global power anymore. And I think that's something that Putin would sign off to, that then Russia will no longer be a great global power. That's exactly what he's aiming at. And that is a view of the world, which doesn't ask the Ukrainians what they want. I want the Ukrainians, at some point in time, to determine their own fate. And that must be our goal. And we already paid a very heavy price, and they paid a very heavy price in particular. So, there's a huge amount of work for those who will then have political responsibility on the one hand, deterrence vis-a-vis Russia, he will not be allowed to attack us, and at the same time uphold sovereignty for Ukraine, which -- and Ukraine gets certain security guarantees, how they will then what shape and form they will take is something that I obviously, at this point in time, will not be able to say.",

MERKEL (through translator):  Well, this went very quickly. My parents, for example, didn't allow me, when I was in school, to become a member of the youth organization of the Socialist Party, to become a pioneer.

So, it was shocking, to put it mildly, but then was relieved to see the National Assembly acting very quickly to pass a resolution overturning this. And so, the only step remaining in this process is for the president to accept and acknowledge that the declaration that he made on martial law is now null and void. But he -- the presidential office, I understand is currently very quiet. Citizens have gathered around the National Assembly to protest and to make their point that this is completely unacceptable, the way it's been handled, the way it's been announced. So, we'll see -- we'll get a better sense in the morning hours, but I think, currently, all sides, including some key figures in the ruling party, clearly pressing the point that this is completely unacceptable. This is an aberration.",

Again, in your early morning tweet, you said, stunned at the presidential decision. He must accept the National Assembly vote overturning it. What if he doesn't? What power does he have? It looks like, according to, you know, the information we have now, that the military is following the parliamentary decree, annulling this martial law and declaring it void. Do you expect that to hold? Do you expect the military to obey the parliament or to obey the person of the president?",

And so, the wayhis view has been shaped has been very much influenced by these hardline conservatives, anti-communists. But from that to jump to this idea that there are communist sympathizers, anti-state agents scheming to overthrow the government is completely out of the blue, completely unrelated to anything I can see happening in the country. Yes, the politics is very fragmented, very divisive, very polarized, but then, it is the role of the president, the duty of the president to be trying to bring the country back together, and he has gone exactly the opposite, more polarized, more extremist in the messages that he's been delivering to the country. And this is aside from the -- all the all the wrongdoings that are being put to -- before him and his -- and the first lady. And I think that probably was also a big part of the political pressure that he was feeling that then led to him deciding to go this way.",

I certainly hope that this will end up as being an overnight happening. But there are signs that this could go -- this -- the chaotic developments could continue for a while. But I certainly don't think that this will have any effect on the alliance. I think the support for the alliance is solid, on the part of the United States. I think on the Korean side, also, both the ruling and opposition, the central importance of the alliance to the security and the wellbeing of the country is bipartisan.
