What this memo reveals -- and this was sent to what are known as patriot members. That means members who are in the swing districts across the country. Is that what they should be doing right now is they should be arguing for what Harris will do and nothing else. I do want to emphasize that last line of this memo. It says, \"Do not waste time talking about anything other than what Harris would do as president.\" We are also getting a sense of what they do want their members to talk about, and that is Harris' record. They want to paint her as failing on the southern border. They want to talk about her positions when it comes to energy resources around the country. They also want to argue that she has been soft on some past rioters. That is the kind of argument that they want their members to be making. You can see here, though, that this is really an effect of how quickly this whole story has transformed recently. They are saying that they've never had less time to define a candidate at the top of the ticket and, therefore, they need their conference to be very clear and very united in their messaging. House Republicans are going to gather behind closed doors today. House Democrats will do the same this morning.
