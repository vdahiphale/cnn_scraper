CNN exclusively obtaining the audio recording of Donald Trump discussing highly classified documents at his golf club with people who did not have security clearances.You're about to hear Trump in his own words explain that he no longer had the power to declassify the documents, and you will hear him shuffling through papers. This conversation is a critical piece of evidence in Special Counsel Special Counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Donald Trump over his mishandling of classified information. We've got CNN's top legal political and intelligence analysts here tonight. Let's start with CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid and former federal prosecutor Laura Coates. Ladies, great to see you. Paula, I will begin with you. Let's get straight to that exclusive audio tape. What do we hear Donald Trump saying?",

      "sentences": "All right, so remember, this back in the summer of 2021 at his New Jersey golf club, and in the room alone with him are two of his states who he knows are recording everything he says because during that time, he was in the habit of having his staff record him any time he talked to journalists, members of the media or anyone working on a book.The other people in the room are two people working on an audio biography of former White House chief-of-staff Mark Meadows. At the time, it appears that the former president is quite agitated about comments made by General Mark Milley regarding Trump's feelings and his desire to attack Iran. I am going to let him take it from here. You can hear him in his own words, what he had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over): These are bad sick people, but -- UNKNOWN (voice-over): That was your coup, you know, against you. That -- TRUMP (voice-over): Well, it started right at the -- UNKNOWN (voice-over): Like when Milley is talking about, \"oh, you were going to try to do a coup.\" No, they were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. UNKNOWN (voice-over): That's right. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Trying to overthrow your election. TRUMP (voice-over): Well, with Milley, uh, let me see that, I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) This was him. They presented me this. This is off the record. But they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Wow. TRUMP (voice-over): We looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by me, this was him. All sorts of stuff-pages long. Look. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Hmm. TRUMP (voice-over): Wait a minute, let's see here. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Oh, my gosh. (LAUGHTER) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over): I just found, isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Mm-hm. TRUMP (voice-over): Except it is like, highly confidential. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP (voice-over): Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this. You attack and -- UNKNOWN (voice-over): Hillary would print that out all the time, you know. TRUMP (voice-over): She'd send it. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Her private emails. TRUMP (voice-over): No, she'd send it to Anthony Weiner. (LAUGHTER) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over): The pervert. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Please print. TRUMP (voice-over): By the way, isn't that incredible? UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over): I was just thinking, because we were talking about it. (LAUGHTER) And you know, he said, \"he wanted to attack Iran, and what.\" These are the papers. UNKNOWN (voice-over): You did. TRUMP (voice-over): This was done by the military and given to me. Uh, I think we can probably, right? UNKNOWN (voice-over): I don't know. We'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to try to -- TRUMP (voice-over): Declassify it. UNKNOWN (voice-over): -- figure out. Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over): See, as president, I could have declassified it. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP (voice-over): Now, I can't, you know, but this is still a secret. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Now we have a problem. TRUMP (voice-over): Isn't that interesting? UNKNOWN (voice-over): Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over): It's so cool. I mean, it's so -- look, her and I, and you probably almost didn't believe me, but now you believe me. UNKNOWN (voice-over): No, I believed you. TRUMP (voice-over): It's incredible, right? UNKNOWN (voice-over): No, they never met a war they didn't want. TRUMP (voice-over): Hey, bring some, uh, bring some Cokes in, please. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Margo Martin is a longtime aide and that is significant because when she went into the grand jury, they played this recording for her, and that was actually how Trump's lawyers back in March of this year found out that this recording existed at all. Prior to that, they were unaware of this key piece of evidence.I'll also emphasize that there are multiple versions of this recording because the staffers were not the only ones recording. The autobiographers were also rolling on this meeting. So, they had notes. Now, it is unclear exactly how the special counsel obtained the recording that was played in the grand jury, but it is notable, March, March, that is when Trump's lawyers learned about this incriminating piece of evidence.",

Remember, this complaint, this actual criminal indictment, deals with the willful retention of documents that should have been returned as well.The Presidential Records Act does not play the most prominent role in this conversation, but the notion of classified material or defense- related information as is defined in the Espionage Act is centerstage here. And so, the knowledge that he does not have the power to declassify what is in front of him, the nature of the conversations surrounding General Milley and, of course, the documents and the substance of it, also gives further credence to the claims that these were documents that fall under the category of defense-related information, which remember means things that would be close to the best of the United States, that would be something that our allies would not want to have out or those who wish to do us harm would love to have. And so, think about all of that context of the evergreen nature of the material. We are not creating new defense plans and war plans every day. They are mostly things that have already been decided. Of course, they will be renewed in some form or fashion. These are very sensitive materials. And so, he is fatally undermining his own defense. I will be curious to see what his lawyers ultimately articulate in the court of law. This will be the motion practice, Alisyn. We are all looking for the pre-trial motions, what comes in, what is excluded, and why.",

She is chuckling a little. But even his aide, who is telling Trump everything he wants to hear, has to acknowledge, oh, this is a bit of a problem. And as Laura just said, it undermines the core component of his defense, which is I declassify. Here he is saying, I could have, but I didn't, and I can't now.

But it's defense information that could be injurious to the security of the United States.When you have a hostile foreign power, let's take Iran, which apparently is the subject of this document, we understand, and you have a contingency plan, if we had to attack Iran, there was a situation that came up and we had to put that into -- disseminating that information, not protecting that information, could actually undermine the entire attack plan.

That in and of itself -- you know, two days ago, he tells Bret Baier the exact opposite. Oh, there wasn't any document there. You play those (INAUDIBLE) and you've got a liar on your hands, and the jury knows it. And by the way, if it is admissible, it is admissible.
