It comes as we learn Secretary of State Antony Blinken will actually head back to Israel on Friday, and that President Biden has asked Netanyahu to send top Israeli officials to Washington next week to discuss what are described as alternatives to a military offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah.And in northern Gaza right now, the Israeli military raid of the enclave's largest hospital where thousands of people are actually sheltering in dire conditions is in its third day. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us from Jerusalem right now. Jeremy, what are the latest developments first of all in this raid?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, as this Israeli military operation stretches into its third day, the Israeli military claiming to have killed 90 people whom they describe as terrorists. They also say that they have now detained and taken 160 suspects to Israel for further questioning after they detained hundreds of individuals at Al-Shifa Hospital, including, as has been reported previously, an Al Jazeera reporter and his crew. Now, the Israeli military says that they've located weapons in addition to having killed those Hamas fighters.They also claimed to have been taking significant precautions as it relates to the civilians and the patients and the medical staff at that hospital. But witnesses on the grounds have indicated that there is rampant fear of Israeli snipers, indicating that some civilians have indeed been shot by Israeli forces. The Gazan civil defense for its part says that the situation around Al-Shifa Hospital is \"very difficult,\" saying that those who are still inside this hospital, a hospital where around 3,000 people were believed to be sheltering, that they are facing severe shortages of food and water. The civil defense also says that they have been unable to reach the vicinity of that hospital where there are still believed to be injured people some of whom may be trapped under the rubble following Israeli airstrikes in the surrounding neighborhood around Shifa Hospital. The Israeli military is also pursuing major military operations in central as well as in southern Gaza. All of this, of course, with the backdrop of those ongoing negotiations to try and secure a ceasefire, which we know is desperately needed as far as the humanitarian situation in Gaza is concerned. Secretary of State Tony Blinken arriving in the region today. He is set to arrive in Israel on Friday to pursue further discussions with Israeli leaders as they consider Hamas's latest counterproposal and prepare one of their own, Wolf.",

But at the end of the day, that's not the critical story. That's the way it often gets framed.But the critical story and the critical question is, can Israel go after Hamas and the remaining battalions in a way that is considerably more humane than the way the war has been conducted in the last couple of months? That's the question. And the reality is -- and this is why I'm glad to hear that this meeting is about plans. And the reality is from the tactical level, right up to the strategic level, from the private to the general, decisions get made, what kind of munitions to use, what timetable to use, what mechanisms of the evacuation of the civilian populations are there, what ability is there to get humanitarian aid, all of those things need to be paid attention to if Israel is going to, in fact, go into Rafah. BLITZER: Secretary Blinken is also set to press Israel on getting more aid into Gaza right now as the United Nations says famine is looming very large there. Is the U.S. doing enough to help surge humanitarian aid when children and civilians are starving right now, according to all the latest reports?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Wolf. Look, the humanitarian situation inside Gaza is untenable. And every party involved here needs to do more.Hamas, of course, which has a long history of stealing aid needs to stop that in the interest of the people that they purport to represent. The United States is, of course, doing everything we can. There's airdrops happening. There's a pier being constructed in the ocean. The Israelis need to commit themselves to inspecting land cargoes a lot faster than they are doing. It does not serve anybody's purpose to have Gazans starving. It is both a moral affront. And it's ultimately not in the long-term interests of -- long-term solution to this problem. So, I would answer your question by saying every single party involved needs to stretch a lot more than they are right now to make sure the humanitarian aid is delivered.",

We have failed Ukraine. There are dead Ukrainians who don't need to be dead. There's a humanitarian situation in Ukraine that does not need to be as bad because for months now, we have been dithering.Now, the good news is I do actually believe that once we get through the budget negotiations of this week and come back after the Easter break, I do see a path. I think the speaker is serious about moving into it. But make no mistake, we've already been negligent, to use a benign word, in our support of the Ukrainians and of our support for the fight of democracy against authoritarian regimes. We've already done a lot of damage, and we got to fix this as soon as possible.",

This comes from the investigation in the Daily Mirror, which as you say the Information Commissioner's followed up on their assessing the report.We've also just heard from the hospital saying they are investigating it at every level. This is -- could be very damaging for the hospital, of course, if this sort of thing happens. It's a private hospital, very high end, they treated lots of royals, confidentiality is extremely important. So, very shocking. And I think you know the princess has been told about it. I'm sure it'll be very shocking to her. They've been very careful about keeping her medical details private. And they haven't told anyone what the surgery was for. And I think the palace would say it is very unfortunate if it leaked out in this way. But there's no evidence that there has been a leak.

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, Jerome Powell is not ready to give borrowers a break. Not yet. And no doubt. It is a very expensive time to borrow.Mortgages, credit cards, car loans, all of them are very expensive. Now, remember, the Fed started spiking interest rates at almost an unprecedented pace two years ago, trying to get inflation under control. And really since last May, the Fed has been in a holding pattern, keeping interest rates at 23-year highs. That might be good news for savers who've got money in the bank. But for everyone who's borrowing, this is added to some of the pain here. Now, Fed officials have said they're not going to start lowering interest rates until they get more confidence that inflation really is going back to normal. And so that's why investors, they place almost no chance of a rate cut today. Very little chance that the next decision on May 1. And really Americans are probably going to have to be waiting until June, July, or perhaps even later before borrowing costs start to come down. We could get some hints today from Jerome Powell. Also, importantly, Federal Reserve officials, they're going to issue new projections on where they think interest rates are going. The big question here is whether or not the Fed is still penciling in three interest rate cuts this year, or if they become concerned by higher-than-expected inflation readings and they've had to change their plans. And, Wolf, I think the ramifications here are really significant not just the Wall Street, but to Main Street, the economy at large. And you could see this playing a factor as well in the race for the White House in November.",
