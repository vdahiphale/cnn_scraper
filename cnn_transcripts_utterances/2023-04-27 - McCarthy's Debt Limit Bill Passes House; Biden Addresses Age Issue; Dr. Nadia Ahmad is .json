Went to the floor pretty confident he was going to have the votes, but there was still a question whether or not they were going to be able to pull this off. This was the culmination of work months in the making, trying to bring disparate factions together from the conservative and moderate wing of his party. There were more than a dozen listening sessions with the whip team over the course of the last two and a half months. And this is really just the beginning of the negotiation.Like you noted, this proposal is not going anywhere in the Democratic- controlled Senate. The big question mark this morning, how is the White House -- specifically whether Joe Biden is going to sit down once again with Kevin McCarthy. It has been almost 90 days since the two met. And there is new detail that we are getting that this debt ceiling could need to be increased as early as June, Kaitlan. So that doesn't leave a lot of time. And we just don't know what the path forward is going to be. This was all about rallying Kevin McCarthy's troops, showing he had unity behind him, but where does that go from here and where does that lead? We just don't have the answer as of this morning.",

If McCarthy does sit down with Biden and Schumer, and they do negotiate, how does he keep Republicans on board for whatever it is they agree to? Is that a possibility that that could be a big roadblock for him?",

And their argument was, they didn't want to deal in hypotheticals, that they believe in the speaker, that he's going to be able to negotiate with the president.But one interesting moment that happened yesterday behind closed doors in the conference is Ralph Norman, a conservative member, who has at times been at odds with Speaker McCarthy. He asked him, how do I know that this bill isn't going to change significantly? He said that what he heard from the speaker yesterday was that he is not going to bring down too watered-down version of this bill, Kaitlan.

First, we've seen up to 16 or almost 16 percent weight reduction in a type 2 diabetes population that typically has a much harder time losing weight compared to people without type 2 diabetes. And then the side effect profile is actually very reassuring because it's very similar to what we saw in our type 2 studies for Mounjaro.
