We also are reporting sirens in Jerusalem as Hamas confirms this morning that it is -- has been and may continue to fire rockets towards both of these cities.We had to evacuate this space and getting to the stairwell, which is one of the shelters here in the building that I'm in, just in the past hour. It is absolutely clear now that we are in completely uncharted territory, and this is very much ratcheting up. You've just been showing images of the Israeli strikes on Gaza, on the Hamas side. Confirmation that they have fired more than 4,000 rockets. And that is more than the total number of rockets that have been fired on Israel by Hamas in the -- in the last conflict. So, that just gives you a sense of the enormity of what is going on. You're right to report that the IDF says that the communities on the southern side of Gaza border are being secured. That has been a really big effort over the last 36 hours or so, to ensure that those communities that, of course, had been breached by Hamas militants are evacuated. Getting the Israelis, at least, to safety. And that is in the wake of this devastating picture on the ground that has emerged just other the last three days. 260 people, youngsters, killed at a music event in the desert in southern Israel. So many hostages taken from that site. Hamas says they are holding now more than 100 hostages. Islamic Jihad suggested that they are holding 30 themselves. So the strikes by Israel continue on what they describe as the military targets in Gaza as the Palestinians there, of course, and Israelis on this side of the border simply wait this out and consider what happens next. And that is very unclear. I've just spoken to an opposition member who says grounding caution is not off the table. But this is complicated given what is going on on the ground, particularly with the hostages on the Israeli side.",

Stay close buy.I want to go straight to Christiane Amanpour right now, because we are learning that the Israeli defense minister has ordered a, quote, \"complete siege\" of Gaza that would blockade -- kind of like electricity, blockade entry of food and fuel into the region. Christiane, what is your sense of what this means going forward? CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's, you know, a major ratcheting up of what they want to do. In his words, you have Gallant, the minister of defense, said, We are fighting barbaric terrorists. And include, of course, the West, U.S. and Europe and all the rest of it do label Hamas a terrorist organization. So all the Europeans and all the allies have stood very, very firmly in support of Israel's right to defend itself. This obviously being the worst single day in Israel's history since 1948, the founding of the state. That's what happened on Saturday. The 700 plus dead are mostly civilians, we understand. They include, you know, men, women, young people, old people, children. And so, too, amongst them are the hostages. We understand from Hamas that there are more than 100. We have yet to hear from Israel the precise number of hostages. And this closure, this full blockade will have an impact is really going to have an impact inside Gaza, which is already locked down. How Hamas breached that fence into Gaza from Gaza into Israel is still going to be a cause for investigation. But essentially, Gaza is completely locked down. It's got a wall, a barrier into Israel but also into Egypt on the other side. And now the Israeli defense minister says that they are going to stop, as you said, electricity, fuel, water and food. And that, of course, is going to exacerbate the humanitarian situation. There are already, according to the Palestinians, more than 400 dead there. We don't know -- mostly militants. We just don't know who they are. But this is clearly a ratcheting up, potentially before Israel, as has been hinted by Israeli officials, potentially conducts a ground invasion.",

However, we are not involved in Palestine's response, as it was taken solely by Palestine itself.\" Denying direct involvement, which has been one of the big questions U.S. officials have been trying to figure out, and yet, this was the statement from Iran's president yesterday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is a manifestation of resistance in standing up against the fake Zionist regime. Palestinian people, the Palestinian soldiers, all Palestinian groups. And the Islamic ummah really should be congratulated for this victory.

And I think thewrenching photographs and video we've seen now of the family of hostages being taken away and the way that will resonate in Israel, which is understandably particularly sensitive. We're all sensitive to hostages but particularly kind of case. It's going to be a very hard decision, because once they go in, particularly on the ground, the lives of those hostages are all deeply at risk. I think the second big dilemma he's going to face is it's one thing to go in and hunt down the Hamas leadership. It's similar to the decisions that President Bush was making after 9/11, to go in and hunt down al Qaeda leadership. But after that, of course, it turned into an occupation of Afghanistan. And we all know how that turned out. The Israelis have no desire to occupy all of Gaza. You've seen that before. And it would be violent, and it would lead to constant insurgency. So that's going to be a very hard decision. Do they allow Gaza, basically, to continue under some form of Hamas control? And then I think the third one is the one that you were just discussing with Christiane and with others, which is if Iran is involved, if at some point this spreads to the West Bank, do we risk a much larger regional war, just at the moment that the world is trying to go deal with Ukraine, trying to deal with the rising threat in China. It's the very reason that President Biden wanted to shift his focus from the Middle East and -- and turn it elsewhere.
