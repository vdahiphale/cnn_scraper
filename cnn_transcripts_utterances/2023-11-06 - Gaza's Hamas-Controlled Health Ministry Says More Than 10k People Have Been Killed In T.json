Gaza's Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the territory since the Israel-Hamas war started nearly a month ago. Comes as the IDF says their troops have encircled Gaza city, effectively splitting the Strip in half. And spar fires. Donald Trump testifies in his New York civil fraud trial. We'll have all the details coming up. We begin with a staggering death toll in Gaza. The Hamas-controlled ministry reporting that 10,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza by recent Israeli airstrikes. To be clear, CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. The ministry also announced another 25,000 people have been wounded in Gaza since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the world needs to step up its responsibility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL, UNITED NATIONS: The unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent with every passing hour. The parties of the conflict and indeed, the international community face an immediate and fundamental responsibility to stop the inhuman collective suffering, and dramatically expand humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Israel said that the ambulance was being used by Hamas. Well, now some foreign nationals, Egyptian citizens and wounded Palestinians are crossing the border. For the latest, CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us in Cairo. Good to have you with us, Melissa. So, that border crossing opened right now.

These were Jordanians, Egyptians, some Palestinian- Americans, a few Germans and French citizens as well. Remember that this Rafah Crossing for the foreign passport holders had been closed for nearly 48 hours over the course of the weekend, as a result of the Palestinian insistence that ambulances taking the most severely-wounded down to Rafah should be given safe passage. This followed the IDF attack on the Al-Shifa Hospital on Friday that saw several ambulances damaged, many killed, 15 killed at least, many more wounded -- 50 wounded at a time when the ICRC confirmed that the Palestinians had warned them that this convoy was on its way to Rafah. What you saw in the wake of that was a total stop of the outgoing traffic, at least, the aid trucks that continue to come in, but no one had been allowed to leave. And remember, Lynda, that as part of this deal to allow foreign passport holders out, this had been linked from the very start by Hamas in that breakthrough deal that we saw last Tuesday just over a week ago, had been linked to the ability to get the most severely-wounded Palestinians out. That too has resumed today. So, no doubt, under the pressure of the United States and the Qataris who have been mediating these efforts, some fresh deal has been found to get both the foreign nationals and the most severely-wounded Palestinians down that crossing, what we've seen today are 17 of the most wounded -- severely-wounded Palestinians getting through, which brings the total to just over a 100 Palestinian so far. As for the foreign nationals, it is 1,145 foreign passport holders that have now gone through the Rafah Crossing over the course of the last week, and despite that pause, bear in mind, Lynda, that we had heard right from the United States, its officials and Egyptian officials, that it is reckoned that there are about 7,000 foreign passport holders inside the Gaza Strip. So there are still many more waiting to get out.",

The workers had received permits to take jobsin Israel and the occupied West Bank and then found themselves trapped in limbo. Many of them have finally been returned to Gaza, but they're now accusing Israeli authorities of physical and psychological abuse. I'm going to bring in CNN's Nada Bashir, who joins us live from Jerusalem. Good to have you with us now. So you have heard horrific testimonies from Palestinians stranded outside of Gaza when this war broke out. They were detained by Israeli forces, now deported back to Gaza. What have they been telling you?",

In Cape Town South Africa, marine scientists are using artificial intelligence to protect aquatic life and the ocean they live in. Here's CNN's Bianca Nobilo with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Ocean off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa is home to a captivating underwater world known as The Great African Sea Forest. It's one of the most biodiverse marine environments on the planet. A desire to study and play a part in conserving this rich ecosystem is what drew marine scientists Mike Barron and Dylan Irion to Cape Town. They co-founded Cape research and Diver Development, or CAPE RADD, an organization dedicated to marine research that engages both biologists and citizen scientists. MIKE BARRON, MARINE BIOLOGIST &amp; CO-FOUNDER OF CAPE RADD: I wanted to create something which allowed people accessibility and engagement in marine conservation science without having to be a scientist. NOBILO (voice-over): South Africa is a global hotspot for the elusive shy shark.",

      "sentences": "They get their name shy sharks because when they are afraid, or under attack, perhaps by a predator, they carry themselves up in a tightlittle donut like ball and they hide their heads under their tails. So, it almost looks like they're kind of a bit shy and reframing. NOBILO (voice-over): There is very little information on these small thin creatures, so Dylan and Mike launched Fin Spotter, a high-tech shock monitoring database to help study and protect them. DYLAN IRION, MARINE BIOLOGIST &amp; CO-FOUNDER OF CAPE RADD: What we do with fin spotter is several things. We can train machine learning models, or AI, to identify what species are in an image and where they are. And then we can take that a step further and find whether we've seen the shark before or not.",

So, if we were to lose these sharks, then it couldcause massive ecological knock-on effects.

But you also tell them when they've crossed the line. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
