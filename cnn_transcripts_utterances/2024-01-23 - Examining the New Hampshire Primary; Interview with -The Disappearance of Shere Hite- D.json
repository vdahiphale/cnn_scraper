Like when Tim Scott, senator from South Carolina, endorsed him the other day in New Hampshire and he said, we need a president who can unite us. You're paying attention to who you're standing next to? I mean, it's self- evidently ludicrous. What Donald Trump doesn't represent is stability. He doesn't represent an ability to unite the nation. He is a divider. And he is promising an autocratic second term. He's running on an autocratic platform. And the implications are vast. I mean, you know, traditionally, New Hampshire has been a place where the fever breaks. This goes back to 1952, Eisenhower versus Taft, where that Republican internationalist foreign policy tradition really began, fighting off that isolationist wing of the party, which has been basically in place through Reagan, through both Bush's until Trump. And, you know, among the many implications of this vote today, because it is a hinge of history, it's one of these trajectory defining things if Donald Trump wins the nomination, because then there's a possibility, he could be president no matter how deeply unpopular he is among vast swaths of the American people.

The alternative to that, which you hear folks on the right and some folks on the far left say, is this -- you know, the goal -- peace is giving Vladimir Putin whatever he wants. Weakness invites aggression. How many more times do we need to learn that in the course of human history? And multilateral organizations like NATO, which were created out of the wreckage of the Second World War, have proven their effectiveness time and time again. And we should say very clearly, and Appelbaum wrote a whole piece about this in \"The Atlantic,\" that a Trump re-election would be designed to undercut NATO, if not withdraw the United States outright, to weaken its resolve.

And reading the book was really a revelation. It brought me into this world of female sexuality and the voices of thousands of women and their real experiences, not only, you know, the sort of biological facts of sex, but how women were really experiencing it in a male dominated society. And the things I learned in that book and the stories I read stayed with me for the rest of my life.

But what is the role that private equity is playing? What part of the healthcare market are these companies going after? DR. JHA:  Yes. So, what's interesting is that that phenomenon of health care chains coming in also can have deleterious effects. And we've seen that private equity firms. Look, at the end of the day, they're in it for one reason and one reason only, which is that they're trying to make money out of this. And their strategy generally has been short-term. Come in a few years, turn it around. And when I say turn it around, I don't mean necessarily turn the health system around, what I mean is then flip it, sell it to somebody else, make a profit.

Private equity firm made him an offer. He eventually agreed, sold it. Initially, his life got better. He didn't have to manage the practice anymore. He got a nice payout. Things seemed great.

So, let's say there are lots of cardiology practices in a community. A private equity firm comes in, buys them all up. Then it goes to the insurance company and says, if you want cardiology in this town, we own all the practices. You have to pay us a lot more. Of course, insurance companies will then just pass on those extra costs to employers and to individuals. So, what happens is people see their prices go up.

One is, so imagine you're the private equity firm, you now own all these practices, you raise your prices. An insurance company may say, OK, you're no longer in network. Well, all the patients who have that insurance no longer can come see that that physician. Or they'll say you're still a network, but your deductibles are now much, much higher. And so, what that does to patients is that they have to pay a lot more out of pocket, which for a poor person may become prohibitively expensive.

One of the easiest ways of reducing costs is reducing your staffing. Cut back on nursing staffing, it'll save you money, it can put patients at risk. I think that's clearly probably one part of the mechanism. The other thing is, you know, if you think about all the progress we've made in making healthcare safer over the last 20 years, a lot of it is putting in safety protocols, doing a lot of important things that make sure errors don't happen. Those all cost money.

How do, you know, something like central line associated bloodstream infections increase at one hospital versus another? DR. JHA:  Yes. So, central line infections, by the way, just a central line is a big IV catheter, usually use it in critically ill patients. Those, when they get infected, can be very, very dangerous. People often die because it's a very serious infection. We have made a lot of progress as a healthcare community, eliminating those infections or reducing those infections. Again, what makes a difference? Following protocols, having plenty of nurses, making sure you're really doing things to prevent those infections. We know how to do that. If you make cutbacks on nurse staffing, if you make other types of cutbacks, you can potentially set up people at risk for that. False is similar. You know, elderly people, high risk people in the hospital, they're not enough nurses around, they get up in the middle of the night, they can have that fall.

That's -- we still have 87 left in the country where there might be a more healthy market. But what happens? Is it in small towns? Is it in midsize towns and big cities? Where do we find these kinds of trends? DR. JHA:  Yes. So, market concentration, first of all, is a bad thing. And here's what I mean. Like when there's not enough competition, there's not competition for quality, there's not competition for pricing and costs. And what we tend to see in concentrated markets as costs go up, quality goes down. That evidence is overwhelmingly clear. In those 13 percent of markets where a private equity firm has more than half the market, they're not facing much competition to deliver better care at lower cost for patients. In those other 87 percent, you still have a lot of concentration. That 13 percent continues to rise.

How do we kind of look at the data and say, hey, wait, there's something going on here, the infections or deaths or falls are rising, and we see that the sort of correlation might be this? I mean, correlation is not causation. So, how do we tease that out? DR. JHA:  Yes. So, this is a really important role for an agency like Medicare. Medicare is the largest payer of health care in America. For a long time, Medicare has been developing metrics on quality and safety for hospitals, for doctors. And what I call for is when you have a new transaction, let's say a private equity firm buys up a health system, that should get monitored. Make sure that prices don't go up. Make sure that quality doesn't suffer. Make sure that adverse events, patient safety events don't go up. Those are things that are very reasonable roles for regulators, state regulators, as well as Medicare to do. I think they should be doing that much more broadly across the entire health care system.

And the whole point of our federal laws on -- against monopolies is that we know consumers do better when there is healthy competition. And that should be, by the way, totally bipartisan.

A lot of it driven by colon cancer rates going up, particularly among younger people. In terms of what we should do, it certainly means we should be screening people earlier, looking at risk factors more. You know, the question of what's causing it, not completely clear. We do know for other kinds of cancer, obesity is a major risk factor. Obviously, rates of obesity have gone up. Smoking can be a risk factor. Thankfully, smoking rates have declined in the country, but that has also flattened in certain groups. So, I would argue that we don't fully understand why we are seeing this increase.

I mean, how do we try to maybe make this a little bit more of a proactive and preventative system versus a reactive system after people have the diseases? DR. JHA:  Yes, it's -- there are several things that I think are important here. One is we've had a payment system that has paid piecemeal. It pays for visits. It pays for doctors visit or the hospitalization. We have started a ship that actually began in the George W. Bush administration, accelerated under President Obama, but still not as far along as it needs to be, which is to move payments more towards kind of a population level payment. So, you pay the health system to take care of an entire population and you pay them to keep that population healthy. That is a -- that has been a trajectory, but I think it has gone too slow. I would like to see that accelerated. The second part is something we've talked about, which is this importance of competition in health care. It turns out in most American health care markets, the market is very, very concentrated. There are not enough different types of doctors and hospitals. And what that has meant is that that focus on quality and prevention just hasn't really been there. And I think more competition in the marketplace, more of a focus on a different way of paying for healthcare, all of those things can drive it. And then, obviously, there's a role for government in a lot of European countries. We see very clear regulatory approaches that countries take on these issues.
