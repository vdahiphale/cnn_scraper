And later, Chef Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen does so much for so many in need talks to Anderson about his new cookbook and his recipe for hope. Good evening, John Berman here, in for Anderson and today was essentially day one of House Republicans Biden's impeachment inquiry. It was also day one of many in their confrontation with Attorney General Merrick Garland over the Justice Department's handling of the Hunter Biden investigation, the Department's prosecutions of January 6 defendants including former President Trump and the alleged weaponization of the DOJ. Republican lawmakers call what they are doing oversight and oversight is important no matter who is in charge ,though exchanges like this raise questions about their definition of that term.

What that means is that he's not -- the attorney general himself is not steeped in the facts of the case itself, and so he cannot answer substantive questions about it, so then he can be criticized for that. On the other hand, had he gone in the other direction and said, yes, I'm actively managing it. I am fully briefed on it.

Republicans should have a very strong hand, but they are killing their chances. They really are. I'm being honest here, they are killing their chances by seeming so extremist. I did live through this with Bill Clinton. When the Republican shut down the government the year before his re-election, it took him from a guy who was trailing in the polls, to a guy who was leading in the polls and that was just one of the four things these Republicans are doing now.

She says in a new book that Rudy Giuliani groped her at the rally he spoke at shortly before the attack on the Capitol and attorney John Eastman watched. Quoting now from the book now on Giuliani: \"The corners of his mouth split into a Cheshire cat smile. Waving a stack of documents, he moves toward me like a wolf closing in on its prey.\" Her account continues: \"We have the evidence. It's all here. We're going to pull this off.\" Rudy wraps one arm around my body closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents pressed into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach for the hand of my blazer. By the way, he says fingering the fabric, I'm loving this leather jacket on you. His hand slips under my blazer then my skirt. She goes on. I feel his frozen fingers trail up my thigh. He tilts his chin up, the whites of his eyes look jaundiced. My eyes dart to John Eastman who flashes a leering grin. In a statement tonight, Giuliani's political adviser, Ted Goodman calls the allegation \"a disgusting lie\" and says \"It's fair to ask Cassidy Hutchinson, why she is just now coming out with these allegations from two-and-a-half years ago as part of the marketing campaign for her upcoming book release.\" As for John Eastman, his lawyer categorically deny Cassidy Hutchinson's account and call the accusations libelous.

And so I think to come forward with this kind of accusation is really scary for someone, especially of that age. But I think through the course of her testifying, and finding her voice, and being able to speak her truth, she now is in a position where she feels comfortable and can come forward with her truth on this specific matter. And so I think it's kind of gross to shame any victim for why they come forward and when they do, but I think that that just goes to show why a lot of women don't choose to come forward with these types of allegations when their character is coming into question, rather than maybe questioning the person who's being accused of said crime.",

Some have even claimed that he has flipped on the former president. And Wood did not respond to us but he did deny the claims on a social media post earlier today and this is what he had to say in part. Saying, \"I have no idea why I'm being asked to testify at the trial. I've had no discussions with the D.A.'s office since I testified before the Special Grand Jury several months ago.\" Those special purpose grand jurors actually recommended for Wood to be charged in this indictment, but the D.A.'s office declined to do so. His name was buried in a more than 100-page filing from the D.A.' office related to conflicts of interest with six attorneys related to this case.

Just months away from the primary, many told John they still support the former president. Others in the independent mind and state (ph), however, clearly do not.Today, new CNN poll numbers verify that divide. The former president is still with a commanding lead, he is at 39 percent. The big change since CNN's last New Hampshire poll, four candidates now poll in double-digits behind him, up from just one, Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. They have more than doubled their 5 percent support since July. Ramaswamy is at 13 percent, Haley at 12 percent. Chris Christie, he is at 11 percent, up from 6 percent. Now, Ron DeSantis has taken a bit of a nose dive. Two months ago, he was at 23 percent. Today, he's at 10 percent. Essentially it's a four-person contest for second in New Hampshire.

She fought to get a life-saving drug for her daughter and now, she's trying to ensure that no other parent has to go through what she did. Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more on this Champion for Change.(END VIDEOTAPE) LAURA BRAY, FOUNDER, ANGELS FOR CHANGE (on camera): Four years ago, my husband Mike and I were sitting in a hospital room, when our child Abby was diagnosed with leukemia. I think anybody who has been in a life-threatening diagnosis, you know, will remember those moments. We go in, she's going to be able to have her chemo. But she is not going to have Erwinase today. How come? It's on shortage. Abby is clever. Nothing gets past her. And she just said, \"What does this mean? Does this mean I die?\" SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): She asked you that question? BRAY (on camera): Yeah, it's hard enough that my nine-year-old had to contemplate her mortality when she's diagnosed with cancer and also then wonder if she was going to survive because not enough drug was made. GUPTA (on camera): What she did next makes her a true champion for change. She put together a consortium of friends and family, and they essentially created a phone bank, calling more than 220 children's hospitals around the country and asking all of them, did they have the medication that could save Abby. Finally, someone said yes. BRAY (on camera): It was a relief and a release of all the stress and then, I felt tremendous guilt. I was haunted by the knowledge that somewhere in the country, some other mom and child was going to be going through the same hopeless conversation. We launched \"Angels for Change,\" and almost immediately people began to call. So, right now, we're in a 10-year high of drug shortages. There's more than 300 essential medicine shortages. There's four key reasons why there is shortage. The lower the price medicine, the more likely it is to be in shortage. The more complicated the medicine, if there's a history of a QA event, if all of it is made by one supplier or one area of the world, it's more likely to be in shortage. GUPTA (on camera): I think we've gotten so used to thinking about things like Amazon. They can anticipate when you're running out of toilet paper, when you're running out of dog food. You think the same thing would happen with life-saving medications. But that's not the case. BRAY (voice-over): The entire supply chain has to be engaged. BRAY (on camera): So, I thought, what would it look like to partner with a manufacturer and use prediction. GUPTA (voice-over): She calls it \"Project Protect,\" anticipating which drugs could go into shortage and producing them with other companies before it's too late. Their first effort, a $100,000 grant for the for-profit Stack Pharmaceuticals to manufacture two specific drugs. BRAY (voice-over): Potassium chloride and sodium chloride, which newborns, NICU patients, PICU patients need to survive. JERROD MILTON, CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO: It's like salt and pepper. You never think you're going to run out of those very simple things. We don't take our supply chain for granted. GUPTA (voice-over): Jerrod Milton oversees all pharmacy and clinical services at Children's Hospital Colorado. GUPTA (on camera): What if Project Protect didn't exist? What would have happened in that situation?",
