The pause in fighting is set to expire in less than 24 hours. But a source says talks in Doha with officials representing Israel, the U.S. Qatar, and Egypt were in consensus about working towards extending the current pause in Gaza. Earlier, a Hamas members said the group is striving to extend the truce by using all the cards it has in negotiations. On the fifth day of the truce, 12 hostages were released by Hamas. That includes 10 Israelis, all adult women except one 17-year-old girl. Video shows the handover of those hostages at the Rafah crossing. Large crowds can be seen lining the street, cheering as the hostages are paraded by her master to Red Cross vehicles. Two Thai nationals were also freed on Tuesday. Thailand's foreign minister is expressing his hope they would return home as soon as possible. But for those freed from captivity, the return to normal life will take time.

In particular, yesterday, according to Doctors Without Borders, MSF, Israeli troops blocked the entrance to a hospital at the Jenin refugee camp that prevented ambulances from actually leaving the hospital to go and collect injured people. And as a result, two people actually died of their injuries. There was also a video. I think you're seeing here of Israeli troops firing tear gas inside the camp, as well.

So, we're getting or we're joining convoys with other U.N. agencies that are reaching really impacted, shattered areas in the north of Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of children are still in need of supplies, they're in needs of water, they're in need of food, that they're in need of medical supplies, and hospitals are in need of medical equipment, and fuel to operate, and desalination plants need to continue operating at a better speed to make sure that we don't have a water crisis.
