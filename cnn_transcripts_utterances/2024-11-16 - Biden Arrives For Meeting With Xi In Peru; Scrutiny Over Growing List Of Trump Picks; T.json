He just arrived at the hotel where that discussion is set to take place. And the meeting is coming at a critical time for the future of the relationship between Beijing and Washington. As Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House looms over the summit of Pacific leaders. Delegates are discussing and strategizing for a future that remains uncertain. And unpredictable. And we have a team of correspondents with us to look at this from all angles. Our Marc Stewart is in Beijing. Steve Contorno is in West Palm Beach. We're going to start first, though, with Kayla Tausche, who is traveling with the president in Lima, Peru. And, Kayla, what are U.S. officials hoping to achieve in this meeting, given that it's at this late hour of the Biden presidency? KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Jessica, U.S. officials have been managing the expectations for this meeting, saying that there are not expected to be any specific deliverables or outcomes, that it's a meeting more for reflection and taking stock of the relationship and how it's progressed over the last four years, where President Joe Biden had a very clear goal, where he wanted to keep the competition between these two global superpowers from spilling over into conflict. Certainly, there have been many areas of contention, notably on cyber espionage and China's recent support of Russia's war in Ukraine that has been growing in the last couple of years. But there have also been some areas of cooperation, like on climate change and on curbing the trafficking of illicit fentanyl. And recently they have also established military level communication so that the two countries can deconflict in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, where there have been concerns of a potential accidental conflict in that region given China's operations there. So, we expect them to highlight some of those issues, Jess but certainly the incoming administration is going to cast a shadow over what they're able to discuss. There is real consternation among the Chinese delegation about what exactly awaits them when President-elect Donald Trump. returns to Washington for his second term. He has already assembled a team of hardline China hoax who are going to be setting to work executing an agenda that has been clearly telegraphed by Trump on the campaign trail that would include steep tariffs that are expected early in his term. They're trying to figure out what to expect. They're not expecting those answers from President Biden, but we do expect this to be a capstone meeting of sorts as President Biden prepares to turn the page on his own presidency. Jess.",

And Marc, diplomatic worries aside, could a new administration, could this new Trump administration empower China to show its strength on a -- on a broader level, perhaps?STEWART (on-camera): Yes, there's no question, Jessica. China is using this as an opportunity to really set itself apart from the United States to say it too is a strong world power and perhaps may be a stable alternative to the United States. In fact, before APEC even began, Xi Jinping went to Peru and unveiled this massive under deepwater port. Beijing contributed $1.3 billion. China, of course, is the world's second largest economy, and so it will be looking for opportunities if these years ahead in this new administration proved to be a little bit bumpy to say to the rest of the world, China's also a formidable partner to do business with.",

And right now, that's not Washington D.C., it's West Palm Beach, Florida. CNN's Steve Contorno near Mar-a-Lago, where President-elect Trump is considering more cabinet selections. Two of his cabinet picks in the meantime are under some very heavy scrutiny as past allegations have surfaced. Steve, how is Trump's transition team dealing with all of this? And the fact that they were caught off guard by a sexual assault allegation against Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for Secretary of Defense. STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER (on-camera): Yes, Jessica, that one in particular shows just how quickly trump has made some of these decisions and has taking a left turn that caught some of his own closest advisers and allies off guard. Donald Trump had been considering a long list of names, very traditional sort of orthodox names for dissent then secretary and attorney general, two very critical roles in his administration. But he was not satisfied with the with any of those choices that he made, someone abruptly the decision to go Pete Hegseth as does the secu -- excuse me national security advisor. No, that was (INAUDIBLE) defense secretary. And then attorney general he picked, Matt Gaetz. Now, both thus a considerable amount of baggage and some of that was known Matt Gaetz obviously has for a while been the under an investigation for sexual misconduct, alleged sexual misconduct involving a minor as well as drug use by both the Department of Justice and the House Ethics Committee. However, the Hegseth accusations that we just learned about were caught his team off guard and they are now trying to figure out just how deep this might cause problems for his nomination. And there are already concerns about several of Trump's nominees, not only Hegseth and -- and Matt Gaetz, but also RFK Jr. who has detractors on both the left and the right for positions he has taken over the years. And ex- Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who will be in charge of the Office of National Intelligence as someone who's been quite critical of our national intelligence gathering agencies over the years. So, they are marching ahead at this time with all four of these picks and they -- Trump is standing by them, both publicly and privately. However, it just shows you how much Trump intends to challenge this narrow majority they have in the Senate, where they just have four votes that can go either way that could potentially sink any one of these picks.",

As well as decisions about programs and personnel. So, this idea of like Schedule F, you know, where you would have kind of political appointee type things that would all go through the ODNI.

Having continued trust in vaccines is really important. If there are issues that need to be dealt with, and there always are with anything that one introduces. One has to be very careful. I am completely in agreement with that, I think that most people are, that we -- as long as we approach things appropriately. We need to end up in a position where the immunity against these diseases that we're so prevalent in the past continues to be solid. And that we're in a position of protecting against new disease threats that can emerge. One of the things that's characterized this last period of time is the great division of thinking and feeling in this country. So my own personal preference at the moment is to try and look upon this next period as an opportunity to heal those divides. If we can create a public dialog around issues where there's -- there's great -- are great differences of points of view, and even RFK Jr himself has made these -- these points, that, at times, he has said he's not against vaccines. He doesn't want to take peoples vaccines away from them. But he's concerned about what these other issues are. If we can reach a point where we are creating and if, through his leadership, he could provide this opportunity, appropriate forums to explore all of the pros and the cons and the ins and outs.
