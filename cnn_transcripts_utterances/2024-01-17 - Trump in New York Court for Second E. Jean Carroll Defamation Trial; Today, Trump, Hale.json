Jean Carroll, will soon take the stand and he will be watching there, feet away as Carroll testifies right in front of them, face to face, they will be, essentially.The columnist is already sued and won a sexual battery civil case against the former president, but today's case is about defamation. She is suing over remarks that he made in 2019 about her. Her attorneys claim his comments destroyed her sense of safety, ruined her reputation. But Trump's lawyers say that Carroll used the spotlight to make a name for herself. I'm joined now by CNN's Paula Reid and CNN Legal Analyst Jennifer Rodgers for more on this. Paula, let's start with you. What is going to happen? What's happening in the courtroom? What does this today mean?",

      "sentences": "So, yesterday was a pretty busy day. They were able to select this jury of nine people. The jury will remain anonymous as they assess whether E. Jean Carroll should receive damages for that statement that Trump made in 2019. Trump was in attendance yesterday, but he left before the opening statements. So, both sides really laid out their theory of the case. Her lawyers argue that he used the world's biggest microphone to attack her and that she lives in fear and is entitled to significant damages. But Trump's lawyers argue that actually her career prospered after she made these accusations.Trump did not stay, like I said, for those opening statements, but he's back again today for what could really be quite a significant day in this brief trial. And this is, of course, the expected testimony of E. Jean Carroll. Now, she testified in the trial back in May, where a jury assessed her allegations about what happened in a department store in the mid-90s and claims of defamation. They ultimately found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded her $5 million. Her testimony during that trial last spring incredibly emotional, you can tell this is something that has had a profound impact on her. But what I've seen for years and years now of covering cases related to sexual abuse, it is very difficult for survivors often to tell their story and, in this case, talk about the impact that something has had on them when the accused is just a few feet away. So, this is going to be really a pretty significant, possibly very emotional event in the course of this trial. And, of course, after she testifies, she can be cross-examined by Trump's attorneys.",

Someone had worked in communications for Ivanka Trump. Someone else worked for a moving company that serviced buildings. These three people had donated to Trump or affiliated groups. Of course, ten people had donated to Biden and affiliated groups. But it was really interesting to see the diverse array of people who were assembled.

This has been a theme with everything. Every time someone has turned to him and say something that you said has caused damage, problems, threats, et cetera, he always says, well, I'm not responsible for what other people do.

So, it will be interesting to see how they approach that number. But a lot of it's going to speak to her testimony and that of experts and just the impact that they believe that these words had on her, because, remember, he was in the White House during this time. So, he was arguably at his zenith in terms of influence and that bully pulpit. And as many of our colleagues, as many people have experienced, when he turns his spotlight, right, his ire on you, your voicemail, your email, potential people show up at your house, everything is flooded with threats, you have very stressful, scary experience.

I mean, I've spent the last day along with several of our colleagues talking to a number of Republicans in the House and the Senate about Trump's dominating win in Iowa and the very likelihood that he will once again be the party's nominee.And you're just seeing a split that we have seen for so many, so much time within the GOP. Yes, Trump has gotten more support within the House and Senate Republican conferences, more people coming out endorsing them, like his one-time rival Ted Cruz just yesterday. But there are just a number of Republicans who are simply not there yet, fearful of his impact down the ticket, including Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the number two Senator Republican, who told me that, quote, I have always been worried about Trump's viability as a general election candidate, warning, frankly, that if he's unable to appeal to the middle, which Thune is skeptical that he would be, that that could hurt their candidates down the line, particularly as they tried to take back the Senate majority. There are all hosts of other members, people who had hoped that someone else would emerge from this crowded primary field, people like Senator Todd Young of Indiana, someone who did not want Donald Trump to get the nomination, didn't want to address Trump's dominating win on Monday when I talked to him about this just yesterday. Several of those as well, there were some members from the Iowa delegation themselves, Congressman Marianette Miller-Meeks of Iowa. I just tried to ask her a question about whether she voted for Trump in the Iowa caucuses. She would not say that. Neither would Senator Joni Ernst, who appeared in a rally for Nikki Haley in the closing days of the Iowa caucuses. I caught up with her. I tried to ask her about Trump's win, whether she would support her, him at this moment, she is not willing to go there. There are other members of the Senate Republican leadership in that position as well. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear for some time. He wants to move on from the Trump era, does not want to discuss Trump much at all after January 6th. That is a much different view than House Republicans, including the House Republican leadership. The speaker of the House there, Mike Johnson, was one of the first to congratulate Trump for his victory, has endorsed Donald Trump. But that split only bound to persist as Trump moves closer to the nomination, potentially with a win in New Hampshire next week. Guys?",

We got to see the details.But for Speaker Johnson to preemptively say that whatever we do in the Senate on a bipartisan basis is dead on arrival is a total abdication of American leadership.

It's totally reckless to, first of all, tie aid to Ukraine to resolving the border issue, but especially if they're not willing to resolve the border issues. We need to deal with both, but tying them together, as Republicans have done, could result in decades of undermining American leadership around the world. This is really an important moment in history, and I hope that Speaker Johnson won't take the position that they won't accept any agreement reached on a bipartisan basis in the Senate for political reasons, just to have the issue of border security in the election.",
