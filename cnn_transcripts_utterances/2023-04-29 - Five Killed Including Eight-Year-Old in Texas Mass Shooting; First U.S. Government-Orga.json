Now five people are dead, including an 8-year-old child. This latest horror unfolded in Cleveland, Texas, about 40 miles northeast of Houston. CNN's Ryan Young is following all the latest developments for us.

Sheriff deputies have been able to talk to his wife after the shooting.But if you think about how you laid that all out, he was the man who lived next door. He was apparently firing that rifle when someone from next door asked him to stop shooting that gun because of that baby. He then apparently, according to the sheriff's department, went next door. They have a ring camera that actually captured someone entering the building. Used the gun to shoot the people execution style. Listen to the sheriff talk about this horrific crime.

You obviously this entire community is looking for a man who could be still armed. They did find other weapons inside his house. This is a troubling situation with so many families have been broken up. When you think about it 10 people lived in this home. You see the information about him there. 38 years old.

They left by themselves. We arranged a way for them to get out. They simply hopped on a bus to Port Sudan after two weeks -- of almost two weeks of barely no communication whatsoever from the American government. We've e-mailed. We've called. We've written to the White House. We've begged and pleaded for them to assist my parents who are both 66 and 69 years old, who are on a visit to Sudan. And three days in the fighting broke out and there was no way to get them out. They basically hopped on a bus to Port Sudan, took them around 12 hours. My father was held up at gun point by the RSF on the way there. It was a very difficult, emotional, traumatizing journey, and the U.S. government did not help at all. Once they reached Port Sudan they still have to go through a lot of trouble in order to get on the ships. Thankfully the Saudis were very gracious and were assisting American citizens to get aboard the ships in Jeddah.

      "sentences": "Jim, I spoke to a Homeland Security official this morning who told me there are more than 20,500 migrants in custody along the U.S.-Mexico border.This official stressed numbers fluctuate throughout the day. But this is an indicator perhaps of what is to come. That is an increasing number of migrants are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in anticipation of the May 11th date. You see on the screen there, there are now 7,000 daily encounters on the U.S. southern border. That is among the numbers that is expected to rise in the coming weeks. The reason this date is important, Jim, is because that is when the Covid-era border restriction invoked under former President Donald Trump is going to end. It's ending because the public emergency for coronavirus will also be ending. That means migrants will not be quickly expelled as they were before. The administration, therefore, is racing behind the scenes to set up a number of preparations for what they anticipate will be a larger number of people. That includes a regional processing center or more than one regional processing center in Latin America for migrants traveling up to the U.S. southern border so they can apply legally to come to the U.S. Launching programs so that migrants can also apply from where they are to come to the U.S., instead of coming to the U.S. southern border. And setting up new restrictions to be able to push people back into Mexico or to their origin country. So all of this is underway right now. And Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week, while they're doing that, they anticipate the next few weeks are going to be challenging. So a lot ahead in this space -- Jim?",

      "sentences": "Struggling for the last year now, Jim. Those figures that Priscilla just shared, those are not lost on New York City officials that are closely watching them.If they've learned anything in the last year, they're very well aware of the fact that an increase at the southern border will almost certainly translate to a significant increase here in the northeast. Specifically New York City, which continues to be one of the major, most popular destinations because they either know people here or they've heard of the services that are being provided. Already 36,000 currently in the city's care. The concern now with the potential increase in a post Title 42 world, is the daily arrivals of some 200 days is likely to increase, and with that, the cost of caring for these asylum seekers, including providing housing. Because we need to remind viewers, many of these are still stuck a year later in unemployment limbo. So they cannot work on the books to make a living. So the price tag for the city has been $817 million at least. And if these projections continue until the end of June, we could potentially see close to $1.5 billion. Not to mention what we'll see the year after. That's why there's some potential political friction here between Mayor Eric Adams and the White House as he has really increased the pressure that he's trying to put on the Biden administration to respond, at least officially. The mayor calling for a potential solution in the form of calling for the expansion of TPS protocols that could possibly include Central America, Venezuela. That is certainly easier said than done. But also calling on some sort of executive action from the White House to perhaps expedite the work authorization applications for the tens of thousands of migrants. But as many people in Washington would tell you that is certainly easier said than done. We'll have to see what happens. In the meantime, the city is hoping for about $600 million temporary Band-Aid, requesting that amount from FEMA officials to try to recover some of their losses ahead of what we'll see this summer.",

And it wouldn't surprise me if, in an effort to avoid this going to trial and having their top hosts -- Rupert Murdoch, testifying on the stand, it would not surprise me if FOX News did agree to a condition like that. Especially since a lot of the reason FOX News really wanted to avoid a correction or an apology in the Dominion case is because there was this looming Smartmatic case and they didn't want to put themselves in a position where they were conceding defeat on the Dominion before going into the Smartmatic case. This Smartmatic case is the last remaining defamation case over the lies of the 2020 election. So I think FOX News might be in a little bit more of an eager position to settle it with a correction as well as a payout.",

Carlson did a video statement on this, which I know you've seen. But let's play a little bit for our viewers and talk about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, FORMER FOX NEWS HOST: When honest people say what's true calmly and without embarrassment, they become powerful. At the same time, the liars, who have been trying to silence them, shrink. They become weaker. That's the iron law of the universe, true things prevail. Where can you still find Americans saying true things? There aren't many places left, but there are some, and that's enough. As long as you can hear the words, there is hope. See you soon.

That not only goes to show that there wasn't really one reason why he was let go by Rupert Murdoch, but there was a number of different reasons that any one of them could have been a fireable offense on its own. And that stack got way too high for Rupert Murdoch to handle and he decided he didn't want to deal with, one, the hit on FOX News' journalistic institution that Tucker Carlson presented with his coverage of January 6th and vaccines and everything else. And, two, Tucker Carlson was posing a serious legal liability to the network, from the lawsuits from Abby Grossberg, his producer, to the Ray Epps, the January 6th rioter that Tucker Carlson claimed was an FBI informant on his show, who is now threatening legal action against Tucker, his involvement in the Smartmatic case.",
