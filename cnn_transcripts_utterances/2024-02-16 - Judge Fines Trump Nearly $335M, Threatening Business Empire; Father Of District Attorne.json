The former president ordered to pay nearly $355 million and banned from doing business in the state of New York. Does Trump have the money to pay this? Plus, Fani Willis's father on the witness stand. And the question got so out of hand today that the judge was forced to reprimand one of the lawyers. Plus, what happened to Alexey Navalny? His close friend, the investigative reporter Christo Grozev is OUTFRONT. He's been working his sources all day and he has new details to share tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, $355 million. Former President Trump and his business empire taking a massive hit today, the judge in Trump's New York fraud trial, just deciding Trump must pay $354.86 million to be exact. And then there's interest on top of that that he's also now liable to pay. That could add another $100 million. And Trump has just responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: These are corrupt people. These are people that shouldn't be allowed to do the things they do. And they using this as weaponization against a political opponent who's up a lot in the polls. A fine of $355 million for doing a perfect job, for having paid back a loan with no default, with no problems. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the ones that he owns.Now, he's at risk of losing them. And Trump is facing now, one of the biggest financial crisis of his 77 years. According to \"Forbes\", Trump has about $640 million that he could use to pay this money, this fine. This decision would need at more than half of that. But then think about it this way -- what about what he owes E. Jean Carroll? That's $88.3 million. So when you add that to this, that's $443 million. I'm not even counting the interest here. That'd be 543. So for 443 is nearly 70 percent of his cash and personal assets according to \"Forbes\". And again, just emphasize 500 million, there's another hundred million dollars I'm not even counting because of the interest. It is a lot of money. And if Trump can't just pay it out of his cash, you may be forced to sell things like his Trump Tower penthouse, or as jet or his homes in Florida and St. Martin. And by the way, I should say in a deposition with Letitia James in this last year, he said he only had $400 million. So this alone would be 90 percent of his own estimated cash. This is a crippling blow to a man who promised that he would be successful if he just ran the United States like he runs his businesses. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

Now, his approach of attacking process its accusers, attacking sex abuse survivors, attacking judges, has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and limited visibility to do business in the state of New York.But that is where his interests he seems to think as a defendant and as a candidate diverge. No one in their right mind would attack a judge overseeing a case you're involved in, but he does so repeatedly and deliberately in this larger effort to try to convince his supporters and voters at large that he is the victim of election interference, and that there is an unfair system that is targeting him and them by extension. I mean, just really quite stunning, Erin, and then he continues to do this, but he must see a political benefit. But the stakes are about to become a lot higher because in a few weeks, he is expected to face his first criminal case. And based on what we saw in court in that case yesterday no indication that he's going to take a different approach there. But while there, he might be scoring some political points to this approach.

For Eric Trump, his credibility was severely damaged. For Donald Trump his refusal answer questions directly severely compromised his credibility.

So they're going to have two layers now of outsiders going over everything they're doing with banks, potentially looking at assets that are so tainted that they need to be sold.

When I learned about it, I was horrified and cried, says another. Now, I just want to screamed, she adds. But with Russian presidential elections just weeks away, Vladimir Putin seems unfazed by the death of another prominent critic. He's visiting an industrial facility in the city of Chelyabinsk, leaving his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, to field the awkward questions. According to the rules, all necessary investigations are underway, he told reporters, later suggesting that much international reaction to the death is unjustified. But for many, blame is already being laid at the Kremlin's door. Pro- Navalny protests are banned in Russia, but in neighboring Georgia and elsewhere, mourners are turning out to pay their respects and to voice their anger. Putin die, they're chanting. But it is his critics, it seems, whose lives are snatched away. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera):  Well, Erin, tonight across Russia, it appears that the police are cracking down on those well-wishers that are turning out to pay their respects and to attend vigils and to lay flowers in memorial to Alexey Navalny, OBN Info, which is a group that monitors repression in Russia, says more than 100 people across the country have been detained in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Murmansk in the north and elsewhere as well, just gives you a sense of how broad is the sympathy for Alexey Navalny across Russia tonight.",

I think President Biden said it correctly today, whatever the actual granular truth is of how exactly Navalny's death came about this morning, if it's true, but all the evidence points to the fact that it is true, then it is really Putin who caused the death because there are only two extreme hypothesis here.The most innocent one is that his death came as a result of three years of torture, three years of slowly killing him because of the unlawful, anti-constitutional solitary confinement that he was put to, that is completely unprecedented in Russian -- in the Russian prison system. Just over the last two years, he spent more than 300 days in solitary confinement, whereas the regulations suggest that you will be illegal to hold the person even for two weeks in solitary confinement. But the Putin's system found ways to keep him there more and more. He was deprived of medical care. He was deprived of any balanced nutrition even from the prison -- prison perspective, he was getting one loaf of bread per month and the rest of the time he was getting just snippets. But that is the innocent hypothesis. The most likely one, unfortunately, is that he was poisoned the second time. Now, we don't have the evidence yet with -- what we have is circumstantial clues in that direction. One of them is that if it were true that as the government has stated that he fell down and collapsed because of a blood clot this morning during his walk in the prison yard, then where's the evidence to that? Where is the visual evidence? All of the prisons in Russia are equipped with surveillance cameras. It's been 18 hours since this happened, and we haven't seen a thing. Again, this is just circumstantial but at this point, everything points to the fact that he was killed today on purpose. We're going to dig into that. We're going to -- I'm sure that we're going to find out what happened to him. But again, the burden of proof that he was -- he died on his own is now on the Kremlin's hands because four years ago, we proved they tried to kill him with chemical weapons.",
