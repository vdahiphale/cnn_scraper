You can see the Dow, some of the highest for the day, up better than one percent. NASDAQ and the S&amp;P even more impressive than that. Those are the markets and these are the main events. Struggling Starbucks replaces its CEO with the man who turned around to pull it. UAW files federal labor charges against Donald Trump and Elon Musk for threatening striking workers. And a trip to the amusement park. Richard Quest finds out how Coney Island is trying to bring summer fun back to a new generation. That looks like fun. Live from New York. It is Tuesday, August 13th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. So, tonight, Starbucks' stock skyrocketed after the company named the former head of Chipotle, Brian Niccol, as its new CEO. Now Starbucks closed up about 24 percent again on some of the highs of the day there. One of the largest one day percentage gains since it went public in 1992. Starbucks is balancing some big challenges as you can imagine and here they are. Let's start with consumers. You all know it, right? Cutting back on the spending for things like this, those iced coffees, then there are the increased cost, whether its labor, products, supply chain disruptions also affecting Starbucks. This is the one that I find most intriguing though. I mean, look at this, bad store experience. I didn't know this before. Seventy percent of all the orders from Starbucks or either on the app or in drive-thru, so that means people are looking for a place to just sit down aren't really finding it when they need to. There is all also though, the issue here about the -- in the dissatisfied customers and this is a huge issue. They tried to bring on new products like Oleato. Remember that? Olive oil in coffee, that didn't work. So many other things didn't as well. Now, Brian Niccol, he starts September 9th. I want to remind everyone that Starbucks' sales in North America are down since January, though back in 2021, he spoke to Richard Quest about his philosophy in running Chipotle and now what he might do at Starbucks. Listen to this from 2021. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He has succeeded where Starbucks has failed. In the first instance, many new products, right, that were a hit; secondly, though that digital focus, it really went viral at times with those who counted which were those young customers also, of course, the advertising that was targeted and clever. And this is the one that always amazes me, the improved operations, right? The efficiency in those locations right down to taking the pit out of the avocado. The result, the stock up more, better than 700 percent in six-and- a-half years. I will say though, Chipotle down last time I looked about seven or eight percent today.

Its sales were up 11 percent last quarter. Meanwhile, Starbucks sales down about three percent, so customers are been very discerning about where they are going. So even though Chipotle is more expensive, $15.00 compared to you know, five, six dollars, customers feel like it is a better value, a better way to stretch their dollar. And you know, you made an interesting point earlier about how Starbucks has really gone from being a sit-down cafe or a coffee shop to a place now that is more like fast food. You order on the app, then you leave. So Niccol is going to have some interesting challenges as well with trying to kind of recreate a better in-store experience. People are frustrated with the long waits on the app. So this is just kind of a fascinating trend we are seeing right now. Certainly, a surprise waking up to this this morning.",

Thank you very much for following this breaking story for us. Meantime, US wholesale inflation rose less than expected in July. The producer price index was up 2.2 percent on an annual basis, a slight decrease compared to June. Now, it is sign that price pressures are easing for businesses. The hope now though, is that those savings will be passed on to shoppers. The latest consumer price index comes out tomorrow. That is an all- important report. Our Julia Chatterley will be following all of it. And again, it is so much about this cup of iced coffee, isn't it? We really have seen that inflation has come down, but this really did quiet the markets, these numbers. Do they really believe they are going to get what they want tomorrow with that all-important CPI number? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": You raise such an important point. Once again, one data point like this shouldn't have the enormous positive reaction in the stock markets that we saw today, Paula, and you know that as well as I. But what this did seem to confirm to people was that the disinflation, so slower rising prices trend that were seeing, whether it is at the factory gate or for consumers is still in trend. And if you look at the bond markets today, they are still saying look, Federal Reserve certainly going to cut at least a quarter of a percentage point in September, and really that is all the confirmation I think that certainly investors needed. For consumer price inflation, we are not expecting to see the same kind of drop. But the hope is that again, that disinflationary trend is in play, a three percent annualized rate is expected tomorrow. That is for the headline number. For the core number, if you strip out energy, you strip out food prices, that is expected to come in at around 3.2 percent. If that is what we got, Paula, you can expect, I think another huge rally in the stock markets, the expectation of course, reconfirmed once again, even on one data point that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut in September. But for ordinary consumers out there, I understand why they look at these numbers and they are like, tell me why I should care when prices are up -- what -- on average 20 percent over the last four years? I think we've got a chart that I want to just give you a look at, which looks at some of the price rises for these things over the past two years. Transportation costs up 18 percent, electricity costs up 10 percent; shelter, which is going to be the big thing that we watch tomorrow because that is a third of the number, the hope is that that continues to come down. But, hey, people are paying for mortgage or rent equivalent 13 percent more than they were paying two years ago. Paula, that is super painful. And took to finish where you sort of started there on the coffee thing. I would pay zero for olive oil coffee, whoever had that idea. I mean, really.",

Now, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to make her economic pitch at a North Carolina rally this Friday.

You will remember former president Donald Trump had already proposed that in June and his campaign is accusing Harris of stealing his ideas. CNN economics commentator Catherine Rampell calls it a terrible policy no matter who is proposing it. She says both parties need to stop bribing voters with tax cuts. And Catherine joins us now to take on this question. You know what I'm going to say to that. I'm like, they're trying to bribe voters. OK. Well, the sky is sometimes blue, but let's get down to the actual details on this. And I think that a lot of people make good points when they say, if you are a warehouse worker for Amazon making $20,000 a year you don't get any tips. You pay $2300 in federal taxes. If you make $20,000 a year and you make those tips, you can -- you don't have tax on them, you might only owe 1,000 bucks on your taxes. It's not a fair policy by any measure.",

You know, these are all important, noble jobs, but that doesn't mean that some subset of them should essentially go untaxed. And that is one of the problems with this proposal. Another one that is easy to foresee is that it will lead to much more reclassification of income as tips. You know I should be paid in tips, you should be paid in tips, and I'm sure a clever enough accountant could figure out a way to do that and stay on the right side of the law, and thereby have our earnings exempt from income and payroll taxes, depending on which person is proposing this idea. So there are a lot of distortions here.

So that's probably the need aspect of it, but fundamentally, it is a discretionary category. And I think one of the reasons Pandora has been doing well in the recent years, it's not just the last quarter, is that we keep investing in a great experience with the brand. We have a clear positioning. We stand for something quite unique I think in the jewelry space. And more and more consumers are realizing this and coming forth and interacting with us, and sort of fundamental driver of our success so far is essentially built on getting more people engaged in the brand.

One would be to use jewelry as a part of your styling. So let's assume that you buy a new piece of clothing, a bag, or shoes and whatnot, and then you want to kind of add a little spark to that with a styling accessory which would be jewelry in this case. So that's one of the kind of reasons why you entered the category. The other reason would be when you're looking to commemorate something that's really important for you. And we call that jewelry that has a particular meaning to you. Normally, I used my wedding ring as a great example. Of course, not a particularly fanciful piece of jewelry but the affection I have to this is very high. So the emotional kind of connection I have with this piece of jewelry is important to me. Most brands are kind of positioned on the styling side of things whereas Pandora has chosen to play on jewelry with the meaning so we're a little bit on our own in that space and this is incredibly important that you cannot try to own something that's unique about a brand because it is a very, very fragmented market with lots of choice for consumers to stand out and do something that's important for consumers is an important thing for any brand really.
