Is he working with somebody else who's already got a plot underway? Then there'll be the concern is he himself through his actions going to inspire others to try to do something, even if he's not in communication with them? So, there'll be multiple layers of this, but the immediate thing will be, who was he talking to in the past 24, 48 hours, where has he been and what's he been doing?",

But yes, the ISIS threat is real. So, what was missed? We know that officials really saying, well, he didn't work alone. Well, if you know that already, was he -- who was he communicating with? Did you miss those communications? And then the fundamental we were discussing earlier that Al Qaeda and ISIS have been telling their supporters go out and do attacks with vehicles at speed in pedestrian areas. And the bollards protecting Bourbon Street in the heart of New Orleans, they were down that night. Now, officials say they were in the process of being upgraded, but on the night of a major public event with a huge, known gathering of people, that's, again, I think, something security intelligence, are going to look at. Did the attacker know those bollards were going to be down? How did he know? I mean, he will have invested a lot of time and effort. It appears if the bollards had been up, he would have been thwarted.",

So, I'm sure there will be competing interests the city that wants to project itself as somewhere safe for tourists to come to. They have a short window of opportunity to do that before people's attention move on and people think of New Orleans as being unsafe, against the notion that there's more digging to be done to find out more about this attack and more about potential associates, more about things, weapons, explosives that may have been stashed by him or by others that could later be triggered.",

However, South Korea's transportation ministry was able to reveal just one specific detail about what they've heard on the voice recorder. And they told us this, they can't verify, they cannot verify the specific timing of when the cockpit and control tower had difficulty communicating. Now we do know, before landing, the control tower warned the plane about birds in the area. Minutes later, the pilot called out, May Day, May Day, May Day, and then bird strike. The plane would then crash a short time later. Now, as for the police searches of the airport and airline offices, a search warrant was issued on charges of, quote, professional negligence resulting in death and injury. That's according to South Jeolla police and South Jeolla is the province where the crash happened. So, what we're looking for in the days ahead is a concrete time frame on when the flight data recorder is going to be sent to the United States. It is too damaged to be assessed here in South Korea. The NTSB is taking the lead on that front of the investigation. Certainly, a somber start to the new year here in South Korea, the headlines and the pictures in the paper certainly tell it all. So many families and loved ones leaving offerings on these tables that are just steps away from the crash site in memory of the victims.

That's because Russian gas is no longer flowing to Europe through Ukraine. A transit deal between Kyiv and Moscow has expired. Despite the war between the two countries, Russian gas have been moving through Ukraine, supplying what Brussels based think tank says is about 5 percent of the EU's total gas imports. European officials say the EU has been working with countries for over a year, preparing the end of the gas deal. Clare Sebastian joining us more details, and it's pretty symbolic, Clare, isn't it?

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Actor, Justin Baldoni, who also directed the hit movie \"It Ends with Us\", is now suing \"The New York Times\" for $250 million, launching a counter attack in an escalating controversy with his co-star Blake Lively. Baldoni and his team saying the newspaper was party to a quote, vicious smear campaign by Lively who filed an earlier complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on set and retaliation during the promotion of the film. It's just the latest salvo in an ongoing dispute between the two actors that erupted during production of the movie, in which Baldoni plays Lively's on-screen abusive husband. The complaint filed by Baldoni and a total of 10 plaintiffs, including his producing partners and publicist states. \"The Times\" relied almost entirely on Lively's unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence. Lively's original complaint was filed with the California Civil Rights department almost two weeks ago and was first obtained by \"The New York Times\". It alleges Baldoni and his team tried to destroy Lively's reputation after she raised concerns about repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior by Mr. Baldoni. \"The Times\" published their article December 21, highlighting excerpts from the Civil Rights Complaint, including text messages from a crisis PR manager for Baldoni, that say, quote, we can bury anyone. \"The New York Times\" telling CNN, they will, quote, vigorously defend against the lawsuit, saying our story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails.",
