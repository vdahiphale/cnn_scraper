This after conservative hardliners once again scuttled Kevin McCarthy's plans.Initially, the House GOP was planning to vote on a stopgap measure to fund the government and included a number of conservative priorities. But McCarthy had to reverse course once he realized that he did not have the votes to move forward. Now they do have a new plan that they're trying to pursue next week. A number of McCarthy's allies outlined that strategy with reporters in the capital on Friday. Their plan, as of right now, is to try to pass individual, long term spending bills, as many as they can. And the hope there is that they could get some more conservative hardliners on board with a short-term plan to avoid a government shutdown. But the challenge with that plan is that all of those bills are dead on arrival in the Senate, something that Kevin McCarthy has warned members would not work in their favor if they're not able to pass anything in order to have leverage. And furthermore, over on the Senate side, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has now taken steps to advance his own short-term funding bill, something that's likely to include Ukraine aid and disaster money. So that could really tee up a showdown with the House. Let's take a listen to what Schumer said to our Manu Raju about working with Mitch McConnell on a bipartisan plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The plight of migrants has been a main focus for Pope Francis, who's wrapping up a two-day visit to Marseille, France. He's visiting with French President Emmanuel Macron soon. On Friday, the pontiff told reporters that the treatment of migrants arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa i, quote, \"cruel and lacking in humanity.\" CNN's John Allen joins me now from Rome. So John, the pope again getting involved in the controversial issue of migration, in an issue dear to him, of course. Take us through his meeting with Macron, who isn't exactly a radical liberal on the issue. JOHN ALLEN, CNN SR. VATICAN ANALYST: No, in fact, Kim, I think we need to take a moment to reflect on the fact that we are going to be witnessing a grand historical irony today. Traditionally, when a French president meets the pope, politically speaking, that's considered an effort to reach out to the Right in France. That is, to cultural conservatives. Today, however and many observers believe that Macron hopes this meeting is going to help him on the French Left. That is, he will be meeting with the world's leading champion of the rights and the human dignity of migrants and refugees at a time when his own government is taking an increasingly hardline position on the issue. Yesterday, in Marseille, we heard Pope Francis talk about the Mediterranean Sea as a huge cemetery. That's a reference to the estimated 20,000 migrants and refugees who have died, trying to make that crossing since 2014. We also heard him condemn the fanaticism of indifference. And today, we are expecting the pope to use even stronger language on the migrant question. Now what difference that is going to make to Macron's policies remains to be seen. But it is clear that the conversation between these two men today, Kim, is going to be robust and probably a bit challenging.",

So I think it's no surprise to anyone he's pushing this message. As you indicate, it's a tremendously divisive issue, not just in France but all across Europe. And so far, the pope's efforts to promote this policy of welcome and of incorporation of migrants and refugees hasn't done much to stem a strong anti-migrant tide across Europe. Whether today, he is going to turn a corner, remains to be seen. But at least, it is clear, I think, to all observers that Macron is going to hear today a challenge from the world's probably preeminent moral voice on this question. And he'll hear a message that will not sit entirely comfortably with the policies that his own government is pursuing, Kim.",

For weeks now, Ukraine has been stepping up strikes on targets in Crimea, like this hit on a military shipyard earlier this month, badly damaging the Russian surface vessel and a submarine, being repaired in a dry dock. Ukraine has also been degrading Russian air defenses, destroying at least two sophisticated S-400 systems placed in Crimea, another setback for Russian forces.

So now he's allowed almost 0.5 million Venezuelan migrants to apply for work permits.But Republicans argue that protecting recent Venezuelan migrants from deportation will just encourage more to head north. Are they wrong here? REYES: Well, I'm not going to go out so far to say they are wrong but we do know that there is no tangible link between specific U.S. immigration policies and an influx of migrants from particular countries. And that's per the Migration Policy Institute. As I see, it there is a tremendous benefit at, at least in New York City to allowing these people temporary protected status. Because that means the most important thing, is they can work right away as opposed to having to wait a minimum of six months. That means they can get off of social services. That means the taxpayers' burden in New York state and New York City will be lower. That means they can start contributing to society, paying their taxes, finding their own homes and not putting this tremendous strain on the city, which I mentioned, we all know it's unsustainable. And until we see more of a federal response, more of a response from Congress around all of these immigration issues, that's the status quo. And Congress, through their inaction, got us to these problems. And Congress, they offer the only way. Out but so far, we are seeing a complete abdication of their responsibility around these issues.",

But one thing is for sure.No matter who has been in the White House or who has had control of Congress over the last few decades, our immigration policies are centered around deterrent strategy and also a strategy of securing the border first. The idea that we're not going to make any type of move on immigration reform until the border is completely secured. But those policies have failed for over 25 years. It seems like, if lawmakers were truly interested in a solution, they might try a different approach. Because what we have up to now clearly isn't working. It's going to take a lot more effort and cooperation and compromise to move the needle on this issue. Sad to say, that's not really something that is practically or politically very viable or realistic in this Congress right now.",

The Asian Games without question are a very big deal in this part of the world but especially for China.According to state media, the government has spent a lot of money on venues. They are sleek, they are modern. But above that, this is an opportunity for president Xi Jinping to tell the word that China is open for business and, two, that it's also in a position for dealmaking on its own, especially now that the COVID restrictions, that we saw here for about three years have been lifted. And as such that is why we saw that face to face meeting with the president of Syria and Xi Jinping. During that time, some agreements were made, including China pledging to support Syria in its rebuilding and also to integrate Syria more fully in its Belt and Road initiative, an economic and infrastructure program that really has been at the center of China's economy at least in most recent times. But again there is this message that the pandemic is over. You can come to China. You can be a visitor, you can be a tourist. That's why we are seeing people from more than 40 countries, athletes from more than 40 countries participate here. People are not wearing masks, they are not wearing (sic) social distancing. That is a big shift from the past, especially from the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, when very much a bubble type system was in place. What does remain though is very tight security, even in our walks and our drives around the perimeter of the Asian Games complex. There are a lot of restrictions; movement is very limited. Nonetheless, the focus is on sports. The opening ceremony is tonight. It's a moment that president Xi Jinping and other leaders from Beijing, pretty safe to say, hope the focus is on sports and not some of the economic problems that are plaguing China right now.",
