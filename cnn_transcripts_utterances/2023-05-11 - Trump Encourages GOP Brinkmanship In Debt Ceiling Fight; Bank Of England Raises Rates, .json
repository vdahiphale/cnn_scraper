The S&amp;P, relatively flat. Those are the markets and these are the main events. Former President Donald Trump urges Republicans to default on the US debt if they don't get an agreement on budget cuts. The US ambassador accuses South Africa of supplying arms to Russia. And Italy holds crisis talks, yes, over spiraling pasta prices. That's not the name of the pasta. The co-owner of Rome's famous Roscioli joins me live. And live from CNN Center, it is Thursday, May 11th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Tonight, Donald Trump is urging Republicans not to compromise as the US approaches its debt ceiling. Now, at last night's CNN Townhall. The former president said a US default, you know what, may not be so bad. Yes. That's what he said. He also said Democrats will, in his words, cave in the GOP demands for sharp spending cuts. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer said Trump's comments make a default more likely. Now, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase says a default would be, in his words, catastrophic. Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg, the bank is preparing with weekly war rooms. That doesn't mean that it isn't a concern for Mr. Trump. He told Kaitlan Collins that the debt ceiling should be used for political leverage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't go over the cliff, we don't have the global financial crisis, et cetera.I think that just because it's been resolved before, that's not necessarily a safe precedent to apply to the current situation, for a number of reasons, including that the Republican Party, the party that's holding the debt limit hostage right now, it is the same party in theory, that has held it hostage in 2011, but the composition of the party has changed a lot. It has gotten much fringier. There are more people who maybe are not so worried about defaulting on our debt, or maybe even a few of them are maybe even excited about the economic catastrophe that could result. I think that's not the mainstream in either party, but I think that there are more members who are either indifferent to these consequences or might even seek them out. Remember, also that McCarthy has a very thin margin in the House. So there are very few votes he can afford to lose. The party has already sort of made clear that if he tries to make a deal with Democrats, that he will lose his speakership, so the political dynamics are different this time around. Biden has also drawn a red line in the sand and said, look, we're not going to negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. You want to talk about budgets, we can talk about budgets, but we're not going to hold a gun to the head of the global economy, which I think is, you know, in general, a rational way of looking at the situation if you assume that Republicans won't pull the trigger. And I just don't know, you know, I've increasingly been hearing about some kind of gimmicky off ramps that might be used, things that some of which came up in 2011 and were widely dismissed and have been dismissed this time around as well. Things like, well, couldn't Biden just mint a trillion dollar coin and just add that to the money supply and be done with it or invoke the 14th Amendment? Those carry considerable legal ambiguity. So, it's not clear that that would solve the situation we've got.",

Now, the Central Bank raised rates by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent. That happened today, Governor Andrew Bailey promising to stay the course on inflation, which remained eye-watering really, 10 percent -- above 10 percent in fact in March. It is falling more slowly than anyone had hoped, mainly because of persistently high food prices. Clare Sebastian has been following all of this from London. Really good to see you, Clare. And you know, okay, the Bank of England admitted it got it wrong, all say the term by a city mile, but this new forecast, what do they say is actually driving growth?

It is starkly different from for example, even the Euro area,which is at seven percent, the US at 4.9 percent. They were asked specifically about this, and look, it matters because energy prices are coming down for everyone. So why the lag here in the UK? And the deputy governor actually explicitly blamed the way the regulator here sets this price cap that suppliers can charge household. That means that they sort of bake in this lag into the system. They also talked about how energy is used in the food supply chain that that has kept prices persistently high, but food prices almost 20 percent inflation in March, Paula, so even if they do have like the rest of inflation by the end of the year, prices are not coming down, they are just growing less quickly, so this is really serious for UK households. As for inflation in general and what that means for interest rates, well, they didn't actually steer on future interest rates at this meeting. Clearly, they're admitting that they're having trouble forecasting in this climate, but they did leave the door open if inflation stays persistently high.",

Now, the ambassador told reporters the US believes weapons and ammunition were loaded onto a Russian vessel named Lady R. That ship was seen docked at Simon's Town Naval Base near Cape Town in December. Now the allegations ratchet up pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa over his ties to the Kremlin, and of course, his position on the invasion of Ukraine. Senior international correspondent, David McKenzie joins us now from Johannesburg. You have been following certainly the South African policy in this conflict for some time. Is there any concrete proof here and given the accusations, what is at stake? I mean, as you reminded me, it's quite interesting the way this came out publicly, and that these accusations are -- you know, came out at all.",

And the fact that the ambassador said that he is confident, in fact, he said, \"I'd stake my life on it,\" that they have evidence that there were weapons and arms put on this cargo vessel that had this very mysterious arrival in South Africa in December. At the time, we were all wondering, what was this all about. It was to a naval base in Simon's Town, and usually cargo vessels go to the civilian port, just on the other side of the peninsula to Cape Town harbor. So already, there were some questions being asked then and opposition MPs said they had evidence that there was goods taken off and placed back on or placed on the vessel in the dead of night. And now this official, very senior diplomat here in South Africa, of the US government, basically accusing South Africa of arming the Russians on a vessel that was targeted by sanctions by the US Treasury. So it is a serious allegation. Now, there haven't been any evidence and actually I just was speaking to the president's spokesperson here in South Africa and I asked him, but why have they said that they are instituting an inquiry in this matter if it happened in South Africa's own port, surely they knew what happened. And he said that: \"US intelligence services said they had evidence that they would only provide to a credible investigation. And more of the earlier statement, they said there was an agreement that an investigation will be allowed to run its course, and the US intelligence service would provide whatever evidence they had in their possession. It is disappointing that the US ambassador had to go public like this, a public posture. So I'm sure there will be more of this story coming out, but you do feel and sense in those comments on camera by the US ambassador, his frustration at the US relationship with South Africa when it comes to the issue of Russian invasion of Ukraine. And you did say there is a neutrality of South Africa, but there is at least circumstantial evidence the US would say that they are taking sides in this conflict, not remaining neutral -- Paula.",

I think that what happens in terms of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve is going to say a lot in terms of whether this is over, what happens to the real economy in terms of concerns about a real severe slowdown or even a recession, because all of that could add even more stress. But I think these comparisons with 2008 are off. I talked to the top federal consumer watchdog in the United States today, Rohit Chopra, he leads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and he told me: \"We're not in 2008.\" He said, \"2008, we saw really hundreds of institutions that could have failed, but didn't because of a really direct taxpayer funded bailout.

They are being smarter about their content investments after doing what, you know all of their competitors did over the last several years, which is just create tons and tons of content to attract subscribers. Now the focus shifts more toward generating a profit. They've been pretty firm in stating they will get to break even in the direct-to-consumer business by the end of fiscal '24. So it's about six quarters from now. They've got a big cost savings plan going on. They actually indicated last night, they may exceed their five and a half billion dollars' worth of cost savings. And the advertising tier, I think is very important for Disney. We don't have a lot of detail on it yet, but it is using smarter data, using automated ad buying processes. It allows Disney to generate a lot more advertising revenue on that subscriber base. So for Disney plus subscribers, you can get an advertising tier, which is probably going to stay at a lower price, certainly relative to the ad free price, which is going to go up, I think they indicated quite a bit more into the back half of this year and the next year. So there are ways that they can you know, manipulate their subscribers to sign on to the right types of services, generate the right types of advertising revenue. I think there is upside for Disney over time, but the next quarter still, next quarters in not so great. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now Pakistan's supreme court has ordered the immediate release of Imran Khan after ruling his arrest on corruption charges on Tuesday was illegal. But the former prime minister will not be allowed to return home. CNN's Sophia Saifi has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The Pakistan chief justice of the supremecourt has come out and said that this is for security reasons. Imran Khan is going to appear before the Islamabad high court on Friday, which is a lower court here in this country. Pakistan's information minister, even before their ruling by the supreme court, had come out and said that the court is favoring Imran Khan and that by allowing Khan to be released, they will be allowing Pakistan to burn. There has been many days of protests, of violent protests in the country. The Pakistan government had called the military, provincial governments have also called in the military. There are troops all over the capital, as well as other major cities, off the country. We are waiting to see whether there will be any further protests. When Khan was in court, his party, the PTI, had called for calm and peace and for no gathering. But we are hoping that that happens and that stays over the night and stays, also on Friday, because Friday, as you know, is the day of afternoon prayers, where people gather. It is a half-day, people have a holiday afternoon. So there is fear of potential protests, potential clashes not with the police but with the military. And we are just going to have to wait and see how this plays out in an incredibly fraught time here in the country -- Sophia Saifi, CNN, Islamabad. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

OK, you are looking right now at live pictures from Manhattan. There you go. Not a bad day there. Some of the world's tallest office towers. You see them there. And part of that iconic skyline, even though it is the middle of the workday, right? And think about it, a lot of those buildings right now are half empty. The real estate firm JLL says about 75 million square feet of office space is vacant in New York. That's about 16 percent of what is available. The reports say the number in London is 28 million square feet or about 8 percent vacant. And in Hong Kong, its nearly 7 million square feet, which comes out to about 10 percent vacant. Now one architect says it's now time to rethink how cities work. Carlo Ratti says we are at the dawn of what he calls a playground city, where pleasure takes priority over productivity. He says hybrid work is here to stay, so we must make our cities worth exploring. Carlo Ratti joins me now. Thanks so much for being with us. This is really interesting to so many of us. And I was struck by you writing that, look, if you look at New York, right? It's undergoing a metamorphosis, from a city dedicated to productivity, to one built around pleasure. What are the consequences of that? Because it's not just New York, right?",

So somehow, you know, it's not that we need to convert everything. But if we can convert the towers, well, it depends on your psychiatry. You're right; some of the technologies from the '60s and '70s with very big floor plans would be more difficult. We might have different types of programming.
