Adam Laxalt received more than 8,000 votes, or about 35 percent of that batch. That put Catherine Cortez Masto in the lead statewide by more than 5,000 votes. At that point CNN called the race.

So, that is what we're seeing play out in the public is these allies of former President Donald Trump come out and call for a delay in the Senate leadership election that is scheduled right now to happen on Wednesday.As of now it has not been delayed. And as of now Mitch McConnell is expected to become the minority leader for the Senate in this election. But still, noteworthy that these Republicans are coming out and publicly slamming the results of this election and placing blame on McConnell. Take a look at what Marco Rubio, Florida senator, tweeted this week. He said, \"The Senate GOP leadership vote next week should be postponed. First we need to make sure that those who want to lead us are genuinely committed to fighting for the priorities and values of the working Americans of every background who gave us big wins in states like Florida.\" And also want to note, Boris and Amara, that there were two -- three other Republican senators who sent a letter urging members of the Republican conference to postpone their leadership election, saying that they need to have serious discussions about what went wrong in the 2022 midterms ahead of the 2024 presidential election. So really note worthy, this will be tomorrow, this week, the first time that Republican -- that Congress comes back since they've been gone campaigning for the 2022 midterms and Republicans are set to have their first in-person meeting on Tuesday.

We haven't called that yet. To be clear it's expected though he's going to have a small margin which is why these dozens of members of the House Freedom Caucus are coming out and calling for priorities that they want for McCarthy for his vote and members being, of course, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy.

And part of this leadership battle is fascinating because it's not just a battle about who should be the best leader moving forward after the failure of the midterms, but it's between the Trump Republicans and other very conservative Republicans, who should take the blame for what just happened.

And for more on what we can expect, let's bring in CNN White House Correspondent M.J. Lee traveling with the president in Bali. Hello to you, M.J. So, it seems like for President Biden, at least the first few days in Asia was all about laying the groundwork for this meeting with Xi Jinping. What can we expect? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, I think that is a fair assessment. You know, Air Force One is in the air now. The President is headed from Cambodia to here Indonesia where he is, of course, going to be attending this very important G20 Summit. And there is so much on his agenda, it is going to be a busy few days for President Biden.

But there's no question that this bilateral meeting between President Biden and Xi Jinping, his counterpart in China, is going to be a highlight from this summit. We know that obviously, these two leaders have known each other for a number of years. Even going back to when President Biden was vice president, they've spent a fair amount of time together and have had phone calls and video meetings since President Biden came into office. But it is notable that this is going to be the first time that the two leaders meet face to face since President Biden became president.

And what they did was they coordinated him as essentially, dictator for life. And inside that process, he purged all of his rivals and elevated all of his cronies and assumed what we can basically call totalitarian power, OK. That means he's showing up in Bali stronger and more confident and more bold than ever before.And we saw what happened in Russia when Vladimir Putin got totalitarian power. It didn't work out well, OK. He made a lot of bad decisions, became more aggressive. And that's the fear. We don't know what Xi Jinping is going to do. But what Biden is trying to do is he's trying to urge him not to go down the Putin route especially when it comes to Taiwan. The problem, of course, is that because Xi Jinping is more powerful than he's ever been, and the United States is seen as less present in the region despite Biden's visit, I don't think there's anyone who would say that President Biden is going to be able to get in there and convince Xi Jinping to change anything or to slow down at all, or to change his red lines.

No one thought that Russia was going to invade, but then they did. And this is what happens when totalitarian, aggressive dictatorships feel emboldened when they feel like the world is not going to come to the aid of the small democracy near them. And that's what might happen in Taiwan.So, they're calling on the West, especially United States to look clear right at this guy, Xi Jinping, is the totalitarian dictator that he is, and then respond accordingly by giving them more help before the attack, before the thing devolves into a war. We should have learned from Ukraine that our deterrence is not enough. We should have learned from Ukraine that the only thing that totalitarian aggressive dictators respond to is strengthen deterrence and when you make clear that you're not going to tolerate their aggression. And we're not there with China yet. That's what the Taiwanese believe. And I tend to agree with them. So, to the extent that the Biden administration can have this frank conversation with the Chinese leadership, that's all to the good. We have to talk. We can't be in a world where the two superpowers can't deal with each other. At the same time, we have to be clear-eyed and realistic about the China that we're dealing with, and the Xi Jinping that we're dealing with. And it's not the same as it was when Vice President Biden met Vice President Xi ten years ago.",

But according to bankrate.com, as the Fed has increased interest rates, the average credit card APR climbed over 19 percent. That was just this week. It is the highest rates since Bankrate dot coms database began in 1985. The last time it touched 19 percent, which was an all- time high at the time, was July 1991.Joining us now to discuss is Ted Rossman. He's a senior industry analyst with bankrate.com and creditcards.com. Ted, we appreciate you joining us bright and early on a Sunday a record-setting average APR. How do consumers manage that? What's your advice? [06:45:19] TED ROSSMAN, SENIOR INDUSTRY ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM AND CREDITCARDS.COM: My top tip would be to get a zero percent balance transfer credit card. So, this allows you to move your existing high- cost debt over to a new card with a zero percent promotional rate lasting as long as 21 months. Examples include the Wells Fargo Reflect the BankAmericard and the Citi Diamond Preferred",

The best way to use one of these cards is to avoid making any new purchases. They may try to tempt you with zero percent APR on new purchases as well. I say don't do that. It's just hard to hit a moving target. Move your debt over, divide what you owe by the number of months in your zero percent term, and try to stick to that level payment plan.",

But it often takes nine months or more for these rate hikes to filter through. We have to remember too, the Fed didn't really get serious with these jumbo 75 basis point hikes until June. So, it's going to be some time. We saw some evidence last week in the latest inflation report that inflation is coming down slightly, but we definitely need to see more progress in the months to come.It seems that the Fed may start to dial back the pace of these increases and give them more time to filter through the economy. But I think we could be stuck with high credit card rates for the foreseeable future.",

Whether it's a zero percent balance transfer card or whether it's a low rate, personal loan, or maybe nonprofit credit counseling agencies like Money Management International can really help you get out of debt.Don't make it worse during the holidays. If you have credit card debt, pay that down, set a good budget, maybe use cash or debit for your holiday purchases. Those store credit cards have especially high- interest rates. Some of them are at or even slightly over 30 percent. SANCHEZ: So, I actually wanted to ask you about that because often it's really tempting. You know, if you are shopping in person or even online, you go to checkout. And then there's this opportunity where you get a store credit card you could save sometimes 20 percent on your purchase and seems like a good deal, but you're saying not so much.",

That should be a priority on any card, but especially on store cards because of the high rates. The other thing though is that a lot of store cards have lesser rewards and lesser signup bonuses. So, if you can pay in full, you might be better off with a more general-purpose travel or cashback card.One time that store cards can work for you is if you pay in full and you're loyal to the store. So, you're going to shop there and you're going to routinely get five percent cashback on your purchases, let's say, or if you get a nice discount off a really big initial purchase that you can pay off. A coworker recently saved $1,000 on new appliances using this tactic but you have to pay in full and avoid the high rates.",
