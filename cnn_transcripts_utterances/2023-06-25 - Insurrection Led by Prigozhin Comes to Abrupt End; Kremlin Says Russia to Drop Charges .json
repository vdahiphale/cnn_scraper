At this hour, Moscow is calm after an insurrection led by mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin came to an end as suddenly as it started. So, that is video of Prigozhin's Wagner mercenaries shooting in the air as they pulled out of the city of Rostov-on-Don Saturday. Now, earlier, the Kremlin said it cut a deal with Prigozhin to stop the march of his forces to Moscow but not before an apparent clash between Wagner and Russian troops which was followed by a fire at this oil refinery, which is now extinguished. So, under this deal, the Kremlin says Wagner troops will not face any legal action but they'll sign new contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry, while Moscow will drop its charges against Prigozhin, who will go to Belarus. Wagner's leader says he agreed to that in order to avoid bloodshed. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has condemn the actions of Wagner chief, saying bloodshed could have happened and that extreme measures would have been needed to stop the uprising. Meanwhile, the U.S. says the insurrection was a huge challenge to Putin, but that it did not change Russia's nuclear posture. All right, CNN is covering this story from all angles.

Kremlin watchers expect him to crack down even harder to head off any future threats to his authority. Joining me now from London is CNN's Nathan Hodge, formerly our Moscow Bureau Chief.

He has built this myth around him that he is the man who brought Russia back from its knees after the chaos of the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and his public image is incredibly closely handled, closely managed. That's important to bear in mind that in Russia, essentially, protesting the war, going out with a sign is potentially -- it's illegal. Criticizing the military in Russia has been outlawed. But Prigozhin has now appeared on the scene, basically taking up arms, moving toward Moscow, in open rebellion. There's no other way to put it.

By outsourcing parts of your foreign policy to Prigozhin, whether it be mercenaries in Syria or in Eastern Ukraine or operating troll farms, it gave the Kremlin sort of a level of deniability.Now, what's happened now is that Prigozhin was steadily, during the course of the war, because of the apparent competence of Wagner, at least in seizing some parts of Ukrainian territory, such as Bakhmut, he's raised his public profile. He's got sort of a folksy style in the way that many Russians sort of see -- they find sympathetic in a way that Putin always used tough guy talk. Prigozhin also speaks in a sort of, kind of blunt, I mean, say, almost prisoner-speak. But that's sort of seen as cultivating this tough guy image. So, where does that stand now?

You know, there's been incursions by armed Russian groups, basically, saying that they are there going in to liberate their own country from his rule.

So, it's very interesting. And I would warn people that are anxious to see Putin dethroned, if this guy were to take over, he is a bloodthirsty SOB. REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ):  Ukraine is a really good example of what happens when you actually have a country that is unified by an idea. They were invaded, and they stood together and fought. Russia basically had insurrection, nobody fought for Putin, which tells you which is the weaker country right now and which is where on what side the United States should be on. The Russian plan has always been for us to stop us, as I say, United States and the west, to stop supporting Ukraine, to actually just wait us out. They think that if they wait us out, eventually Ukraine was (INAUDIBLE) the money and then they could overwhelm Ukraine. Now, we know Russia is actually internally weak.

The only reason it didn't escalate further is because Prigozhin decided to de-escalate. And, finally, we clearly see the demise of the Wagner as an independent for personnel in the frontline. I mean, they will either disintegrate or they will be joining the Russian regular forces, which means that they will stop existing as an independent facility.

And U.S. officials, as well as western and European officials, they were caught off guard by the speed with which this occurred late Friday night and into Saturday. It was not clear just how far Yevgeny Prigozhin would be willing to take his grudge against Russian military leaders, though it is something that U.S. and western officials had been watching very closely over the last several months, as Prigozhin and as Russian military leaders have been feuding over the war in Ukraine with Prigozhin accusing Russian military leadership of essentially leaving Russian troops and Prigozhin's troops to die without sufficient equipment and ammunition. Now, U.S. officials scrambled on Friday night to get a hold over what was actually happening and emergency meetings were called across the entire government about the rapidly unfolding situation.

And Lukashenko has paid President Putin back by, essentially allowing him to use his country as a satellite state during the invasion of Ukraine.President Putin has launched attacks on Ukraine from Belarus. He has housed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. And now he is going to be hosting what is President Putin's greatest challenger since he took power over two decades ago. There's still a lot of questions, though, surrounding this deal. Most of the information we know comes from the Kremlin itself. We've heard very little from Prigozhin. The last images we have are the ones that you played of him believe leaving Rostov-on-Don, with crowds cheering him. He did, of course, acknowledged that he's pulled back from that march on Moscow. But what role will Yevgeny Prigozhin play in Belarus? This is a man who has been loud, who has been bombastic, who has been antagonistic. You cannot imagine that he will go quietly into the night. The first question is what semblance of control will he have over Wagner troops, if at all? Part of the deal is that all Wagner mercenaries need to sign a contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense. That means they're going to be absorbed into the Russian army. But will that work effectively? The second question is what role does he continue to play, if at all again, in the conflict on Ukraine? Regardless of the future of Prigozhin, the damage he has done here is done. He has dealt a blow to President Putin. He has for months showed up the Russian army, and now he's shown up President Putin himself, sending those tanks right towards Moscow, being accused of treason and then seeing the Kremlin do a U-turn. And we know, Kim, what President Putin does to his enemies, to those who are perceived to have any threat against his power. He jails them, he poisons them, he disappears them.

Once it was kind of going on, that was kind of middle of the day yesterday. So, there was discussion and there was a lot of chatter throughout it.And part of it is the Russian information system. They tried -- the Kremlin tried its best to keep it out and keep mentions of particularly Prigozhin limited. But they weren't ever -- they weren't able to limit very successfully mentions of Wagner Group. And so, it was very clear they're being discussed. And they didn't know the details of it. There was -- and I think for many, what exactly happened, and how it was negotiated, this is probably going to remain murky for many of them.",

So, that was clearly a lot of support there.When it got into Moscow, there wasn't popular support for him. And, actually, as they started to kind of over the last few days message about this, and as this was becoming more of reality out there, support for him was taking a very sharp negative turn, suggesting that he didn't really have the popular support that he would need if he wanted to fully go through with this and get the defections from the Ministry of Defense that he would need to really unseat so Shoigu, the defense minister.",

A lot of people in the west, for example, can get polish T.V. And so there's a limit that he has.And so what he's often tried to do is just confuse the story. He's going to have to create a new narrative out of this. And so this will be probably -- perhaps this becomes an excuse for why they're having trouble in Ukraine on the battlefield, or he'll return to the kind of predictable narrative around it that would suggest that this was a western-led and inspired coup against Putin. So, he's going to have to re-narrate it. He's not going to be able to cut off information. Russia is not China in that respect.",

So, as the war has dragged on and become more costly from a Russian casualty point of view, I know that you found the public sentiment in Russia has turned more negative. You've said in the past that a single event like a big reverse on the battlefield, for instance, doesn't change overall support for the war, but this insurrection, the fact that Russia came so close, perhaps, to civil war, and Prigozhin exposing the central myth of that so-called special operation. What effect do you think that that might have on some support for the war?",

Because, you know, I think what I was previously referring to as a large battlefield event, not that this like almost insurrection within Russia. And what I think this probably does is destabilize Putin's like sheen of power that he has. He's not as powerful as he tries to project and as many in the west think he is. He relies on a whole network and a system to work favors that he's holding in place.And now that they have one case of someone going after him and at least, right now, it looks like, getting a brokered deal and simply being sent into exile, that normalizes some probably more attacks on Putin's power. The Russian people itself might, as individuals in Russia have said, is that they really dislike this infighting in there. This is -- they can't ignore it now. It's very much a part of the popular Russian view of it. And that could just further erode some support. We'll be tracking that pretty closely over the next few weeks to see whether this does have any impact.",
