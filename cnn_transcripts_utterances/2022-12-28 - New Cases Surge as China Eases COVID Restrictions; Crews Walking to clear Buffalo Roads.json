This news also means that many Chinese nationals living abroad can finally go home. It is a bittersweet victory after so much sacrifice. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANG (voice over): The world's harshest Quarantine is no more as COVID sweeps through China; the country is scrapping quarantines for inbound travelers from January 8, and promising to gradually restore outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines and China this year lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice in where you go or what room you get. Once the door is closed, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers spray disinfected in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is not allowed for breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away.

At least 34 people died in the area among the 59 storm and cold related deaths across the United States. And now Buffalo is facing a flood threat as warmer temperatures move in and all that snow begins to melt. Well officials there just gave the press an update last hour CNN's Athena Jones in Buffalo for us. What did we hear? ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Becky, I just want to show you the amount of snow we're dealing with. Look behind me you can see a mountain of snow it is several storey's high. It dwarfs some of the two storey houses that we can see down the street nearby. And we're told that trucks have been dumping snow there since the snow clearing began. And that now they're already moving on to a new pile. They're afraid that this one is getting too large. But that just gives you a sense of just the job ahead. City officials and county officials - every single street in Buffalo has at least one lane clear by tomorrow morning. And the reason for that is to make sure that emergency services can get to everyone who needs it and that city can begin to return to normal. As you mentioned, the death toll has raised now 34 people dead. And authority is saying that least three of those people, two men and one woman are on identified, so they're asking families to call the police if they have a loved one who is missing. Another thing the National Guard is out they started at 9.30 this morning going door to door in neighborhoods that lost power, even neighborhoods that may still not have power, though most power has been restored. They're going door to door to check on folks to make sure that they're doing OK. We also know that authorities are going door to door to do wellness checks of people who called 911, or other EMS emergency services during the height of the storm and couldn't be reached because the roads were impassable. We know that more than 400 of those calls took place, those calls that went unanswered. And so that is part of the work that's being done. Authorities are saying that the driving ban remains in effect here in Buffalo, so that they want people off the streets so that they can do, they can do this clearing of the roads as much as possible. They're also doing dialysis run. So people who need you know kidney, which have kidney disease and kidney illnesses, they're making sure that those people can get treatment, they're going to reevaluate the driving ban overnight. And as you mentioned, one more point to make is that it's already warming up. Its freezing now, which I believe is zero Celsius, and the temperature is only expected to go higher. It's going to rise by about 20 degrees over the next couple of days. And so authorities are saying that there could be a rapid melting of the snow that's piled up in some places, it's more than 131 centimeters high, so a meter, a little over a meter high. They're worried about that causing flooding. And so that is another reason it's so important for them to clear these roads as much as possible and as quickly as possible, Becky?",

Well, migrants looking to call America home will have to wait after the U.S. Supreme Court kept the restrictive policy Title 42 in place at least for now. The Trump era policy put in effect during the early days of the pandemic allows border agents to expel migrants to their home countries in the name of COVID prevention. Well, the U.S. Supreme Court will allow Title 42 to remain while legal challenges play out. In El Paso, Texas officials have been preparing for a surge of migrants. CNN's Leyla Santiago joins us from El Paso, where thousands are Leyla, quite frankly, waiting in limbo. Let's talk about those who you've been speaking to today. We can talk about what the City of El Paso has been doing, to try and cope.

Because on the other side of the border, as CNN has reported, there are tens of thousands of migrants waiting in Matamoros and Reynosa and - just on the other side of El Paso waiting to try to get in. Another thing that many of the migrants will tell you are that they wanted to come in legally. They wanted to turn themselves in and be processed legally through the system. But that Title 42 just does not allow that. And for that reason, many of them say they're coming in wherever they can on the border. So we continue to see the sidewalks lined with many of the migrants. There is some law enforcement presence here are actually kind of bring you around to show you. We this - police car just arrived here and you can see some of the migrants kind of moving around wondering what will happen next? I've got to say I've not seen that yet before. But this adds, again, to the uncertainty, the anxiety. I mean, the city will tell you that NGO shelters will take and have enough capacity for a lot of the migrants including migrants like this, but they fear getting onto any sort of bus or transportation because of the uncertainty not knowing where they will end up not knowing where they will go, Becky?",

Cuba's bull sharks not only beautifuland essential to the environment, they're also attracting visitors to the country. CNN's Patrick Oppmann heads the Coast of Cuba for a new perspective on what are these underwater predators? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Usually they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean. But sharks are the reason why we have come here to the waters off eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world. But the ones we see mostly curious, swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guide - says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them. The shark is the perfect machine the perfect predator he says. It's inspiring, emotional and satisfying to interact with them. Marine biologists say robust shark populations are necessary to maintain healthy coral reefs. In 2015, Cuba placed restrictions on shark fishing. What have an increasing number of countries in the Caribbean to realize that sharks are not only important to the environment, but a way to track visitors? OPPMANN (on camera): People in the Caribbean used to commonly catch and kill sharks, either for food or because they were considered a nuisance. But warmer countries in this region are now taking steps to protect sharks. It's not just about conservation. Shark tourism visitors specifically coming to a country to dive with sharks can generate millions of dollars in revenue. OPPMANN (voice over): Just before her first dive with sharks, Canadian Tourist Carrie (ph) tells us she's been terrified of them ever since seeing jaws.",
