It is Tuesday, February 13th.And this morning, millions of people in the Northeast are bracing for a powerful winter storm. More than 900 flights already canceled across the region. This storm is part of the same system that pounded the Gulf Coast and the Southeast over the weekend. In play for heavy snow today, Eastern Pennsylvania through northern New Jersey and southeast New York up to southern New England. Boston has declared a snow emergency. It is closed all its public schools. And New York City is expected to see its biggest snowfall and more than two years. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is live in New York City Central Park. Derek, how's it looking out there?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Good morning, Jessica. The snow that you see behind me is going to drastically change the landscape. Not only here for New York City but many of the coastal cities along New England and stretching along the East Coast. And I get the sense, just talking to people here that they, theyalmost yearning for this snow. It's been so long since they've had a proper snowstorm in New York City. We're in Midtown Manhattan right now, Columbus Circle behind me. You have to go back to January 2022, the last time that we had two inches of snow. That's enough snow to cover the ground in Central Park to my right or Columbus Circle. That's a long time. So people want snow, right? And we may get enough snow in one hour. That's enough snow, maybe more than what we've received in the entire day over the past couple of years. So yeah, people are anticipating the snow and it is common. National Weather Service was concerned that this morning maybe that rain would kind of take over before the snow fell. Well, I'm happy to report that these are big, fat snowflakes that are falling here in Midtown Manhattan. We've got to use an umbrella to protect our camera. I mean, just get a look at how heavy the snow is coming down and guess what? This is at the peak of rush hour -- well, and we should be working into that here in the coming hours. So let's get to look at the radar because I want to show you what's going on. And I just give you a broader perspective. Remember I talked about how the rain transition to snow a little bit earlier than we anticipated. That means the potential for more snow exist here where I'm standing in New York City. So, there's that snow shield right now. You can see that shading of white. Let's zoom in a little bit closer and go right into New York City. The I-95 corridor, yeah, just getting blasted with these big snowflakes as well in Long Island. But notice towards Philadelphia Phil rain, that's a lot of blue, a lot of green. It's going to take a little longer for you to experience these snowflakes. But the official forecast we have here, five to eight inches of snow, that is -- well, the potential at least four more snow than we've seen in over two years. And you can see that in Boston, totals have come down. In fact, yesterday at this time, we were in a winter storm warning, that has been dropped or lowered or downgraded to a winter weather advisory. We're only anticipating three to five inches. So you can wake up with a sigh of relief. Here in New York City, they anticipated the snow so much that they deployed 700 salt trucks in and around the city before the first snowflakes even fell, helping pre-treat the roads here. And, Jessica, you know, the kids, they got the short end of the stick, unfortunately. They have to have remote schooling today.",

Jess, good morning. Thanks so much for getting up early with us. Let's jump right in here. A legal observer suggests that D.C. circuit ruling was pretty comprehensive. It was unanimous.

They have a range of options that range from rejecting this stay to saying they wont review this case at all, to fast-tracking and review or doing one on a normal schedule. But as you said, given how unanimous that ruling was last week, legal observers and people watching this closely aren't expecting the Supreme Court to issue a broad sweeping ruling in Trump's favor, although we will just have to wait and see what exactly they do.",

Thirty-three percent believe he should have immunity.

It boosted him and it frankly frustrated his opponents in the Republican primary.There is some polling that suggests that if he can get convicted of a crime that could turn some voters off, that could turn swing voters away, and that is something that Trumps campaign frankly appears to be concerned about. They are trying to delay these proceedings as much as possible to push them off in the hopes that perhaps they can delay them, you know, beyond the presidential election, and into next year.

So this is a sentiment that is new for President Biden.Now, these two leaders have known each other for, for decades. They have had their differences of opinions in the past, but certainly what we have seen recently is this concern from the Biden administration that the recommendations, the guidance that they are giving to Benjamin Netanyahu are simply being ignored. Take, for example, according to some of those sources, the fact that they were hoping that there would be a lower intensity campaign up from the Israeli military last month, we had heard the Biden administration pushing for a more targeted operation for less casualties, the Israelis, from their point of view, had, had agreed to that and said that they were scaling back. But the reality is we haven't seen that when it comes to the sheer intensity of the bombardment in Gaza.
