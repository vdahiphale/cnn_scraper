Remains from the crash site have been taken for forensic testing, Russia says. Prigozhin was on the passenger list. But was he on the plane? And was this, as many speculate, a consequence of his brief mutiny against the Kremlin? Nick Paton Walsh is in Ukraine, where Prigozhin's Wagner Group has been a major player. Russia expert Jill Dougherty is in Washington. Nick, let's start with you. What do we know about the crash and how likely are we to get confirmation that Prigozhin was indeed on that plane?",

Certainly over the period of time that President Putin has been in charge, from the outset. You know this character well. If indeed, Prigozhin is dead, how will this affect Wagner as an organization?

      "sentences": "That's a big question. I think the easiest one is to talk about Wagner. If you take the last two months, theKremlin has been pretty methodically trying to deal with what do you do with Wagner after the rebellion? So officials, Russian government officials, have been going to Africa, for example, and saying, we will still be there, we will still resupply some site of assistance to you, security assistance, et cetera. They have methodically dismantled part of the PR and press operation that Prigozhin had. Then, of course, with the fighters themselves, there were at one point about 25,000, roughly 4,000 or 5,000 were sent to Belarus. So in other words, this period, which seemed kind of quiet, was actually something that Putin was doing, it appears, pretty methodically, dismantling and reorganizing and trying to figure out, how do you keep the military together with this kind of semi military force? So that part is easy, I think. What it means for Russia, I think with Putin at this point, those ideas that he was weakened by the rebellion, these words kind of fail. I don't think the word is weaken but there were questions about his leadership. And now you have, if this is Putin, you have severe, very violent repression of Prigozhin and his movement, you can say this movement, that I don't think that necessarily shows that he's stronger, either. I think what it shows is the situation is getting more and more, let's say, black and white intense. And the use of force is increasing. So, yes, Putin, if this is correct, again, has disposed of an enemy, which he had to do, a person who's not loyal to him. But does it mean that he's stronger? I think the system is more brittle in the end.",

That's coming up next hour. Well Russia, of course, is one of the founding members of the group of nations known as BRICS. And now, that sort of loose bloc, as it were, is expanding. At the end of their summit in Johannesburg, the South African president announced the five-nation bloc has invited six new countries to join. They are Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where CONNECT THE WORLD is programmed from. During the summer, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the five founding members, stated their desire to rebalance the geopolitical order and move it away from what they perceive as Western dominance. David McKenzie has been reporting on BRICS all week for us and he joins me now from Johannesburg. It's fascinating, this.

You've had very unified response from the leaders of the founder members to add those countries. And, if you look at those countries, it's somewhat of an odd collection. Not necessarily all would be placed in the same basket, particularly if you look at Saudi Arabia and Iran, who only recently started talking, thanks to Chinese mediation. So you should see this as a win in particular for China, which seemed to be the country with the most at stake for expanding this. But all the leaders had something to say. Of course, Cyril Ramaphosa will be seen as brokering in part this expanded number of nations. You had President Lula saying the relevance of BRICS is now confirmed by adding all of these different countries. The prime minister of India saying they were always behind the expansion of BRICS and that it will strengthen the organization. There was an open question mark as to whether in fact India wanted to expand this grouping. And President Xi, for his part, as we expected, says this will bring a new vigor and a new start of the BRICS arrangement. President Putin, who had to attend the conference remotely, because he faced possible arrest for war crimes here in South Africa. He came in remotely and, despite his removal physically from this present group of leaders, he certainly got to play the statesman. Take a look.

I would like to assure all our colleagues that we will continue the work that we have started today, expanding the influence of BRICS in the world. I'm referring to the establishment of practical work with new members of the organization and with those who work in the BRICS sphere as outreach, with our partners who, in one way or another, pay attention to cooperation with our organization and would like to work with us together.

So this -- we've got a lot more to report on, on this. But for the time being, David, thank you very much indeed. This is not without consequence, of course. From the golf club to the jailhouse, just hours from now, Donald Trump is set to travel from New Jersey and to surrender to authorities at the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, Georgia. The former U.S. President already has a bond agreement in place and his team expects it shouldn't take him very long to be processed. Nine of Trump's 18 codefendants have already surrendered, ahead of the 12 pm deadline on Friday. The big question is, will Trump be treated the same way as the others who were fingerprinted and had their mug shots taken? For the latest, let's get you to Nick Valencia, outside of the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta. And Nick, look, it's probably, in the big scheme of things, not that important as to whether we get the fingerprinting and the mug shot but it's -- given who Donald Trump is, given that he's a presidential contender -- at least for the Republican Party at this point, 40 points ahead of his next rival -- it is symbolic that we may be looking at these images today.
