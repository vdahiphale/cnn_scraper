The international airport in San Juan and hospitals around the island are running on power generators. Malls have closed for the day. And public transportation really has come to a halt because of all of this. Now, power outages have long been a -- a running source of frustration on the island since the collapse of the power grid back in 2017 after Hurricane Maria. Luma and a second private company have long come under criticism for failing to improve the electric system. Now, in a statement, Puerto Ricos Governor Pedro Pierluisi said, quote, \"We are demanding answers and solutions from both Luma and Genera who must expedite the restart of the generating units outside the fault area and keep the people duly informed about the measures they are taking to restore service throughout the island.\" Pamela, Luma said that an issue with a faulty underground -- underground line was to blame, and already the company is pushing back this timeframe.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is fighting to keep his gavel. Even with an endorsement from President-Elect Trump, Johnson can only afford to lose a single Republican vote in what will be a historically divided Congress. And so far, he's not there. Kentucky Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who has been critical of Johnson's shutdown deal with Democrats, tweeted, quote: \"I respect and support President Trump. But his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan. We've seen Johnson partner with the Democrats to send money to Ukraine and authorize spying on Americans and blow the budget,\" end quote. And here's Texas Congressman Chip Roy earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): I remain undecided, as do a number of my colleagues, because we saw so many of the failures last year that we are concerned about that might limit or inhibit our ability to advance the president's agenda. I respect, like Thomas, that President Trump supports Mike. I like Mike. He's a good friend. Right now, I don't believe that he has the votes on Friday. And I think we need to have the conference get together so that we can get united. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because, guess what, the electoral certification is supposed to happen very soon, January 6th.Joining us now to discuss, Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky, and Republican strategist, T.W. Arrighi. Thanks for coming on this New Years Eve. So, T.W., first to you. Mike Johnson joked earlier this month about his future, saying anyone who can get 218 votes can have his job. Do you think he should be concerned or does he hold on, in your view? T.W. ARRIGHI, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes, to be honest with you, I think a lot of this is much ado about nothing. He has Donald Trump's support, and that means he will have the support of the conference. Let's not forget, it was just a few weeks ago that he won the endorsement of the Republican conference. Yes, our majority is small. Is it possible he fails on the first vote? Yes, it is possible. But it won't be a drawn out, McCarthy like episode because we have too much work to be done. And -- and we cannot stand in the way of Donald Trump's agenda, especially in the first 100 days. We remember what a cluster it was during the McCarthy vote. So we don't need to repeat this. I think it's -- you know, these guys, like Chip Roy and Thomas Massie, they love poking their heads out in times like this and flexing their muscle in our slim majority. But it's noise. It's a grift in many ways. And I don't think it holds much water. BROWN: I wonder what you think about this, Julie. Because, you know, look, Democrats have said they've lost trust with Johnson, with the spending bill. The fact that he pulled it from the table, the negotiated bill with Democrats. At the same time, any Republican House speaker is going to be in a very similar predicament in many ways, being beholden to Donald Trump and apparently Elon Musk as well. Do you think that that Democrats should step up and -- and help support Johnson?",

That's just the cold, hard truth. So anybody trying to delay enacting the Trump agenda is really going to be the catching a lot of heat from Donald Trump directly. And I don't think they want that or the country needs that. So, yes, look, there's no other alternative. It's Mike Johnson. Mike Johnson will be the next speaker of the House.

I think it means that \"OAN\" and others like \"Newsmax\" are going to have a prime seat.I think it means people like Candace Owens, potentially, and others who have podcasts who are MAGA-friendly are going to have prime seats. And I think that anything that's called the legacy media that doesn't step directly in line with the Trump agenda is not going to have a prime seat. And look, quite frankly, I don't blame them because one of the big problems, I think, for the Biden administration is that they spent way too much time engaging people like Peter Doocy on FOX News and having these little back and forths that didn't benefit him getting his message out. It just benefited the people at the podium being able to show them TikTok and wherever else that they could spar with FOX News hosts. But the reality is the media landscape has changed and they are speaking to an audience that is incredibly bifurcated now. And so the reality is that if they want to talk to their audience and shut everybody else out, that is a smart political strategy. It's not great for the country. It's certainly not great for the people that they represent. From a political standpoint, though, I understand where they're coming from.",
