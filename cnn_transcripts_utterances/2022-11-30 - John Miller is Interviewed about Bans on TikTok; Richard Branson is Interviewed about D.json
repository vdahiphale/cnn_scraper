We don't often talk about the risks you've taken to fight for equality around the world, the work you've done with Nelson Mandela on the elders, trying to talk to Saddam Hussein, the climate change work you've done, trying to abolish the death penalty, all of these things as well.Talk to us about how that plays into, if you're too cautious, you're really not living.",

So, you know, if there's -- if there's a war going on, I mean, you know, you mentioned the Saddam Hussein, you know, I - I thought it was worth giving it a shot to try to stop the war by trying to persuade Saddam Hussein to step down and go and live in Iraq for the rest of his -- sorry, go and live in Libya for the rest of his life. And using contacts with King Hussein of Jordan. He basically agreed that he would go if we could send two elders to go and talk to him and Nelson Mandela agreed to go, Kofi Annan, who was secretary general of the United Nations, agreed to go. And, sadly, the bombing started just before the trip took place.But as a result of that, we set up the elders, which is a wonderful group of men and women who do go in to try to resolve conflicts, who do talk out on climate change, who do try to address the problems with the world from a moral standpoint rather than from a political standpoint.",
