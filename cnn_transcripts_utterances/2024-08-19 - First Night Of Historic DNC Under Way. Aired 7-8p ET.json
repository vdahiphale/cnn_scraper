There are metal fencing that is just beyond the ridge of that parkway there.What we know apparently some of the protesters tried to breach that area. They lifted up the metal gates and they were met by officers four people have been arrested, one other person has been detained. So then they brought in the riot gear officers to come in and clear out the park. You can see some of the protests because you were sort of left behind here at this point. But we'll show you some of the video that we shot in the middle of this because it was chaotic at one point when you had about 300 officers, all marching out creating a circle in this area and they really wanted to make sure they cut this perimeter off and shut this park down. This is where the protesters want to return. But we'll walk you this direction because I want to say something. You can see in the distance, that's the United Center. That is one of the gate lines that has been set up as a perimeter to make sure people can just go wherever they want to go. That's where some of the protesters tried to jump over it and they tried to breach it. That happened within the last hour or so. Then after that, we've been asking folks to back out of this park because obviously it was a situation where officers were trying to arrest folks. Actually, the superintendent of police is just over here. He was talking to his officers earlier, actually doing the commands as this was all going down.

So there are moments I think when people around him wonder whether he has gotten his due.

Now the goal of this convention, of course, is to keep the momentum alive and that she has been riding for the last month or so. But yesterday when she was campaigning in Pennsylvania, making her way here to Chicago, she said that she is still the underdog in this race. I am told by a senior adviser that was it intentional description. She does not want Democrats to be so sort of caught up in this exuberance that they think it has an easy race.

The fact that we have the kind of job growth that we haven't had in my lifetime, the fact that in the industrial Midwest where I grew up, where they told us that we were done forever making things, that we now have investments in factories, and manufacturing jobs like we haven't seen since the Kennedy administration.

You know, we were in on the floor in Milwaukee kind of watching that whole process. Just how much has changed in the 30 days.And when you talk to Trump advisors, they make very clear on some level, as one told me, the forward president was a little bit nostalgic for what the race actually looked like a month ago. And that adviser said understandably, so. I asked if the expectation was that he would be watching the president's speech tonight, his former opponent and while they've been coy, the campaign is really focused this week on a very significant swing state run through critical states, counter-programming, at least trying to counter program the Democratic National Convention. One advisor said, of course, he's probably going to watch. Why? Well, that nostalgia is certainly in play. You see it on social media. The former president constantly posting on Truth Social about the former -- about President Biden, about what he calls a coup just a couple of hours ago. You see it when he talks, consistently talking about his former opponent. As one official put it today, Erin, they thought they were going to win rather easily just a month ago. Its understandable that it would still be focused in on some level fixated on the current president, while his campaign clearly right now is moving sharply to focus on Vice President Harris, their attacks throughout the swing states that he'll be bidding visiting, and J.D. Vance will be visiting over the next couple of days. What's interesting here, just a couple of hours ago, during his event, it was a small event. It was really supposed to be policy-focused on the economy and on energy. But the former president said something that was interesting, he said on his way to Pennsylvania, he saw the report House Republicans put out saying that they'd found impeachable offenses against President Biden, something the former President has constantly talked about over the course of the last several months. Well, they found no explicit wrongdoing by then Vice President Biden, no direct quid pro quos. The former president made clear on a speech that was almost entirely about the economy and energy, he wanted a significant portion also to summarize the findings of that House Republican report. Clearly, the current president who will be speaking tonight, that the former president is expected to watch, very much still on his mind -- Erin.",
