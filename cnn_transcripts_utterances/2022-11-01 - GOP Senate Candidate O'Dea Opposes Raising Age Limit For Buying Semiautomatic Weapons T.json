And in this final stretch of these races, one key issue, for voters, is now surging to the front of the pack of issues, according to polls, and that issue is crime. Tonight, we're going to try to explain why this issue seems to be resonating, with so many voters, and we'll investigate whether the perception of rising crime matches reality. So, let's begin by examining this through the lens of one particular high-profile assault. David DePape, the man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi, last week, he entered a not guilty plea, just a few hours ago, to all state charges, during his initial court appearance. According to the alleged assailant's own words, quoted in an affidavit, DePape's main target was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. A sharer of far-right conspiracy theories, DePape allegedly intended to break her kneecaps, with a hammer. Today, DePape's attorney, addressed reporters, outside the courtroom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADAM LIPSON, DAVID DEPAPE'S ATTORNEY: There's also been a lot of speculation, regarding Mr. DePape's vulnerability to - to misinformation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Top Republicans condemned the Pelosi attack. They disputed that rhetoric played any role, and instead pointed the finger, entirely, at the issue of rising violent crime rates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the bigger question for us tonight is this. Is life in America, actually more dangerous than it used to be? Here's what we know, about crime, at the national level. After years of decline, national rates of violent crime did rise, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2019 and 2020, the Trump years, the U.S. homicide rate rose about 30 percent. That's the highest increase recorded in modern history. Then, in 2021, during Biden, the homicide rate rose 4.3 percent, according to the FBI. But the overall violent crime rate, not only counting homicides, all violent crime, well, that actually declined by 1 percent, nationally, according to the FBI. So, nationally, it appears homicides are up. The overall violent crime rate is slightly down. Regionally, though, where you live? Well, that's a mixed bag. Take Oklahoma, where the Democratic candidate for governor, Joy Hofmeister, she's the one running against Republican incumbent, Kevin Stitt, on the issue of crime.

But when The Frontier, the Oklahoma City newspaper, fact-checked her, she was right.And Oklahoma is hardly alone. The Major Cities Chiefs Association says, in the first six months of this year, robberies and aggravated assaults, increased in cities of more than 500,000 people. But this is where statistics can often be used to make whatever point you want to make. The Major City Chiefs Association says murders are down in aggregate in the 70 urban areas, they looked at. But for 30 of those 70, murders are up, and those include Atlanta. There're big races in Georgia right now. And Denver, big races in Colorado. Milwaukee, Governor and Senate seats, on the line, in Wisconsin. When crime rates go up, local prosecutors pushing criminal justice reform policies, they often get blamed. Is that fair? It's usually a lot more complicated than that. Take Boston, where the District Attorney stopped prosecuting non- violent offenses. What happened there? Violent crime decreased by 15 percent, in 2021. And take two cities that increased their Police budgets. Indianapolis, Indiana, and Mobile, Alabama, they increased their Police budgets, and saw an increase in violent crime, last year. Now, look, the economy clearly ranks as the top issue for voters, as we head into the midterm elections, in one week. But in the latest polling, from CBS News and YouGov, 65 percent of you said the issue of crime will be very important to your vote. A separate poll, released by Gallup, last week, finds Americans are more likely now than at any time, over the last five decades, to say there's more crime, in their community than there was a year ago. 56 percent of you say there's more crime where you live now than last year. 56 percent. And that's a trend that's been building over the last few years, since 2020, when Joe Biden was elected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Not everyone, out there, agrees.While according to Pew, only a third of White Democrats say violent crime is important to their votes, a third of White Democrats, 81 percent of Black voters, in general, say violent crime is important to their votes. There's another important set of numbers, here, for you, to keep in mind, which might explain why Republicans are trying to capitalize on crime as a campaign issue, right now. In that CBS poll, I just mentioned, 46 percent of you said Republicans' policies would make you feel safer from crime, compared with 30 percent, who said that about Democrats' policies. You might be able to attribute some of that imbalance, perhaps, to voters' distrust of Democrats, after the whole \"Defund the Police\" campaign.

Anyone, who sincerely, candidates or otherwise, want to know the truth, about our elections, are welcome to find them in many ways. Yet, at the same time, we see only politicians and that the top three Republican candidates for Republican for Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State in Michigan are all peddling election lies, and have, in many ways, built their careers on doing so, in an effort to, in my view, gain control, over our elections, for the future, and ensure that the people's will doesn't stand in the way, of their own partisan agenda.",
