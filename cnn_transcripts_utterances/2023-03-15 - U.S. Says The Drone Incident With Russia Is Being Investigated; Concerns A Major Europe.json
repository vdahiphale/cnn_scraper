Tonight, the U.S. says the drone incident withRussia is being investigated as the Kremlin attempt to retrieve the wreckage from the Black Sea. We will have more on the diplomatic fallout. Then concerns a major European bank may be in trouble when spooking investors leaving global markets in turmoil. Plus, protests against Israel's planned judicial reforms continue, as Prime Minister Netanyahu shortens a planned trip to Germany. We'll explore why. But I want to begin this hour, taking a quick look at the stock markets, because banking fears are spreading and spooking investors. I want to look how indices look right now. Dow Jones down only 1 percent or so, 325 points up, one point actually earlier on the day, it was down almost 600 points. The Nasdaq has just turned green in the last few seconds in fact, and the S&amp;P 500 is down almost 1 percent. But, you know, this is all happening after shares, if you remember, of Credit Suisse crashed more than 20 percent Wednesday to a new record low. We'll be getting to this story in a lot more detail, and the fears, of course, of contagion here in Europe, as well as in the United States. But first, exactly what happened over the Black Sea between a Russian fighter jet   and U.S. surveillance drone is a matter of fierce debate at this hour. The U.S. State Department says it suspects the collision that brought down a U.S. drone similar to this one here you're looking at, was probably unintentional, more due to the incompetence and recklessness of a Russian pilot than a direct aggression. Other U.S. officials say they don't know for sure. One saying even it wasn't on purpose. If it wasn't on purpose, the pilots aggressive behavior was intentional. Now, Russia denies any collision ever took place, but U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said just moments ago, he was very clear when he spoke with his Russian counterpart, and this is what he said. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the United States will continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows. And it is incumbent upon Russia to operate its military aircraft in a safe and professional manner.

So Kiley, weheard in the last 30 minutes or so from the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, as we heard there, as well as General Mark Milley. Just tell us a bit more about what they had to say about this incident. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well listen, they very clearly called this a hazardous   episode and talked about the pattern of aggression that the U.S. and some of its allies have seen from Russia in international airspace is, over the course of the last few months or years. But this, obviously, this incident is still being investigated. We heard from Chairman Milley saying that it's very clear that the aggression of Russia was intentional. In such that they poured fuel onto this drone, they obviously were seeking to intercept the drone. But what he said is not clear at this time, just as of yet, is if it was intentional of them to come into physical contact with the drone if these Russian aircrafts were actually trying to create a collision that then led to that drone going down. That is still remaining question here. But the U.S. is still continuing to investigate this, and we heard from Milley explaining that, this drone is not going to be easy to recover. He said, it's dropped into the Black Sea and is probably now down in the depths of 4 to 5,000 feet.",

We don't have a specific timeline for that, but the fact that they have come out, you know, earlier today, even before this press conference and said that they erased that data is significant. And even though, there are pieces of this drone that are in the Black Sea, what we heard today is that the drone probably broke into a lot of different pieces. So, we have heard from the Russians saying that they're going to try and recover it. Of course, the U.S. Is also saying it's, you know, exploring options to recover it. But whomever actually gets its hand on this, U.S. officials right now are downplaying any significance to actually getting pieces of this drone at this time.",

So, that's a positive aspect here. But it's very clear from Secretary Austin's remarks that he warned the Russians not to engage in this kind of behavior again. Now, whether they heed that warning or not, of course, is another issue. When it comes to this specific case with the MQ-9 Reaper, it's also pretty clear to me that, you know, the basic idea that -- the theory that we have right now, that the intercept itself was an intentional act, the actual collision was perhaps not intentional. I believe that's probably accurate. At least, based on the information that we have right now, and it seems that both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, reiterated that and in essence said, they're giving the Russians, you know, like slight benefit of the doubt, if you will, on this particular issue. But they definitely resent the fact that the Russians came in, intercepted it and were so close to the MQ-9, and in essence, forced it to land.",

So, they were using some techniques that, you know, look a bit strange to us, but they were trying to modify the flight path by doing this, and they were also trying to damage the aircraft.",

I mean, it's -- you know, clearly, the recovery would be very difficult, and the fact thatthe U.S. Navy does not have any surface assets in the Black Sea at the present time, that also makes it logistically difficult. General Milley did allude to the fact that there are allies of the United States around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, to name a few of them, and that becomes, you know, the possibility, at least, that those countries would be asked to help with this. But I don't believe that they really have the capability to mount a recovery operation at those depths. So, that might be the last best hope, if you will, to recover this aircraft.

Now, Ukraine'sforeign minister says incidents like the apparent U.S. drone downing are inevitable, as long as Russia controls Crimea. Dmytro Kuleba told the \"BBC\" that the Black Sea will not be a safe place until Russia is kicked out of Ukraine. The country's defense forces are trying to do just that. Earlier, they shot down a Russian military plane near Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian officials. The battle for the eastern city, of course, is raging and constantly changing. Ukraine's deputy defense minister, I should say, says it's premature to draw conclusions about the state of the fighting. And here, you can see the immense scale, of course, of the damage. The chief of the Russian private military company, Wagner, says his fighters captured a small settlement north of the city, but he's complaining again, that Russian officials are not sending enough ammunition. Now to our other top major story this hour. Concerns about another major bank in trouble, this time, a European one, have brought fresh turbulence to global stock markets. Shares of banking giant Credit Suisse hit a record low on Wednesday, dropping more than 20 percent after its top investor, the Saudi National Bank said it won't issue any more funds to European markets, closed down sharply, lower, as banks shares plunged. The U.S. Treasury Department says it's monitoring the situation at Credit Suisse. Meantime, Wall Street is in the impact. The Dow opening the day with a decline of more than 500 points. Though, it has eased, as we showed you in the last few minutes. Well, we've got team coverage on this with Rahel Solomon standing by for us in New York.

Financials speak for we are a strong, stable bank, stop worrying.\" But given the share price news we've seen today, the share price was down over 30 percent at one stage. I have never seen Credit shares -- Credit Suisse shares trade at $2. They've been trading at a $1.57, at one stage. I think at this stage, we can expect to hear something from the Swiss National Bank, often amid the regulators in Switzerland, even if it's simply to say, the bank is fine, everyone needs to stop worrying, because this panic we've been in, and it relates to broader issues in the sector, but they are pummeling this one bank.",

So it is somewhat, you can look at the Nasdaq there, pretty much flat, I should say. And the S&amp;P down 1 percent or so. Shares of Credit Suisse crashed more than 20 percent on Wednesday to a new low. The major U.S. indices have been down all day. Banking stocks, also down and it's all related, of course, to the SVB bank we saw last week and fears of contagion. We shall keep an eye on those numbers. Indeed, on the markets tomorrow when we get more details on Credit Suisse and whether the bank, the central bank and the government will step in. Now Israel's president is making a new attempt at brokering a compromise over the Netanyahu government's judicial overhaul plans that are bitterly dividing the country. Isaac Herzog addressed the nation just moments ago, warning the country was on the brink of civil war. And plans to weaken the judiciary have triggered fierce protests as we brought you here on the show. We saw more today around the Tel Aviv airport. Protesters attempted to block roads, hoping to disrupt prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's departure for Germany. His trip has been delayed and cut short by one day. Let's bring in CNN's Hadas Gold, live in Jerusalem for us this hour. So Hadas, do we know why Netanyahu decided to shorten his trip to Berlin?",

And then a few hours later, it was allowed to be published, this information under a gag order, that a roadside bombing that happened on Monday, where a civilian was seriously injured happened in the northern part of Israel, not far from the border with the West Bank. The Israeli military says it was actually carried out by somebody who came into the country, sneaked across the border and came from southern Lebanon. They say that a few hours after that person placed that explosive device and it detonated, they caught a ride back up toward the border, where then, because of security checkpoints that were poured out as a result of this bombing, they were stopped by soldiers. They were subsequently shot and killed because they had, the Israeli military says, a suicide belt on them, as well as a rifle and a gun. The Israeli military didn't say whether the forces saw him pointing the gun at them or that they thought he was about to detonate the belt. They said essentially that they believe he was a threat to them. That's why the person was shot and killed. Now Israeli military says they believe there is a Hezbollah connection but they've not confirmed this because they essentially say, anything that comes out of southern Lebanon Hezbollah must be involved in. We've not heard from Hezbollah yet about sort of claiming a responsibility from this. But this is a very unusual security incident to happen. Perhaps somebody like this across the border, the sort of explosive device. The Israeli officials say is something that is not typically seen in this region. Some Israeli media are citing that it's more seen in Lebanon and in conflict between the Israelis and Hezbollah. This is very concerning because when you talk to Israeli security officials, especially, while so much attention is on the West Bank or some, Gaza, when it comes to security issues, the biggest fear that many of them have, in terms of regionally, is southern Lebanon, is Hezbollah and what a major conflict with Hezbollah could look like. Partly because of the arsenal that Hezbollah has, they have many and many sophisticated weapons on their hands. Isa.",

But they do take some elements from what the coalition government wants. You know, for example, increasing the number of judges that would need to vote to be able to overturn a law. And there are a few other elements in there that do bring in with the coalitions say they want, while also sort of toning down the full level of the overhaul that, as it's currently planned out. And also, he once again gave a very impassioned speech, warning about civil war, warning about the country being torn apart, worrying about families being torn apart and saying that there needs to be a red line to this. He also mentioned actually the security incident that we were just talking about, saying that Israel's enemies are seeing the disunity and are taking advantage of it. Essentially warning that Israel's own security is at risk because of these internal's disputes. But within minutes of the speech wrapping up, it wasn't a very long speech. We're already hearing from Netanyahu's government, essentially rejecting it. The cabinet secretary tweeting that, you know, this was the president's own proposal. This has not been agreed to yet. And we're hearing from other ministers, of course, speaking on behalf of Netanyahu's party, saying that the proposal, as the president laid out, they say, only perpetuates the existing situation and does not create the necessary minimum balance. So a proposal brought out and almost immediately, they are coming out and saying, this isn't the proposal that we will agree to. So not clear yet whether there is a path forward for some sort of compromise.

There was tear gas, there were water cannons used by the police against Imran Khan's supporters. And they've so far been unsuccessful in detaining Khan. Now Khan's legal troubles stem from the fact that he's been called to make various appearances in court and he has not done so. Arrest warrants were issued for his multiple non-appearances in court and he has said his lawyers have made the argument that, because of the assassination attempt against Khan in November last year, it's not safe for him to travel to Islamabad high court, in the city of Islamabad, about four hours away from Lahore where Khan is in residence. They said that there are threats to his life and the best way to do it is by a video link. The courts are not happy with that, so there's been a back and forth between the various courts and Khan's legal team. Khan has separately said in an interview with CNN, he spoke to me. And he said that this is the government which is inciting violence against his supporters. It has absolutely nothing to do with the cases and violence is what we've seen. The information minister, Myanmar Enzi (ph), has come out and dismissed Khan's claims. Khan went ahead and said this is because the government doesn't want elections to take place. The information minister has said that this has absolutely nothing to do with the elections and it's just a simple court appearance that Khan needs to make and one that he's avoiding, as a coward. Now we just need to wait to see the lower high court has said that the police will return to Khan's residence tomorrow morning at 10 am.

So it almost seems that in love and in war and in diplomacy, everything is fair, especially when your coffers are empty and you need money. Perhaps you can dump the diplomatic ally that you had cultivated for the last 80 years and go with this archrival, China. Looking a little bit more the bigger picture, however, Isa, I think this was not a surprise. It was not expected but it's not a surprise because the president of Honduras herself had already said in the campaign trail in 2021 that he intended to open diplomatic relationships with Beijing. So it doesn't come as a surprise and it comes after Chinese investment in Latin America has grown massively over the last few decades. And as a consequence, China's diplomatic weight in the region has increased a lot over the last decade or so. We've seen up to five Latin American countries switching their allegiance from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China. This morning, I was able to speak with an analyst who's an expert on the relationship between China and Latin America here in Bogota. He said that it's happening not just when the United States are looking elsewhere but other countries like Europe, the United Kingdom and the entire West are not paying enough attention to Latin America.

When you talk about investment in infrastructure, investment in green development, these are the types of investments, foreign direct investments, that these countries are looking for in the international arena.
