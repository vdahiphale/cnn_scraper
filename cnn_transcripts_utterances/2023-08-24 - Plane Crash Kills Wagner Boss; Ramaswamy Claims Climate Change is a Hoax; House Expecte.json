And here's what an eyewitness said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I heard an explosion or a bang. Usually, if an explosion happens on the ground, then you get an echo. But it was just a bang. And I looked up and saw white smoke. One wing flew off in one direction and the fuselage went like that. And then it glided down on one wing. It didn't nosedive. It was gliding. I was afraid it would fall into the village. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A Putin confidant used to interfere in elections in the U.S. allegedly, extending influence in Africa, fighting on the toughest parts of the frontlines here in Ukraine with his brutal Wagner force. And this plane crash, extraordinary. The information on open source about what the plane was doing, the catastrophic moment that appears - that appears to have occurred causing it to plummet down to the earth. And as you said yourself, the wreckage so, frankly, horrifying that two of those bodies have yet even to be found.That is part of the difficulty here of working out what indeed has really happened. Yes, Prigozhin is said by Russian officials to have been on that plane, along with a coatary (ph), frankly, of his inner henchmen in Wagner. Extraordinary that they put themselves all on the same plane. It's just perhaps they felt that after the failed armed rebellion two months ago that the threat potentially against them from Putin's inner circle may have diminished. But it is remarkable to see these images of the wreckage spread over a mile-wide area. And morning already occurring amongst Wagner followers on telegram channels and indeed outside Wagner's headquarters. No final confirmation of his death, but that is something we'll only, frankly, hear from Russian state officials and Russian media. And they are in the service of Vladimir Putin, the man who Prigozhin crossed like no one else has done in the last 23 years in which Putin has been in power. So, a stark moment for Vladimir Putin potentially. Whoever was behind this plane crash, fingers are being pointed at him here in Ukraine and also in Russia too, suggesting this was essentially Putin's revenge. No evidence for that, but it would entirely be in keeping, frankly, with Putin's conduct in the past. He's poisoned allegedly critics, taken out critics for much lesser offenses than that which Prigozhin was guilty of. And the fact Prigozhin seemed to be at liberty for two months startled many. A key moment, though, because this is clearly Putin perhaps thinking that Prigozhin remained a threat and deciding to risk angering all those who followed and believed in Prigozhin by this particular decision. The final facts, still unclear, but a remarkable moment to gain in Putin's Russia. Back to you.",

Putin is on record saying that the one thing he cannot forgive is betrayal. And so, eventually, if this is what we think it is, then Prigozhin got his punishment for betrayal.And it's a signal to all the other people around Putin that this can happen if you try to betray the man at the top. As David said, this - this is a - this is a country that's run essentially as a mafia state. But mafia bosses are always looking over their shoulder. I don't think the fact that Prigozhin was allowed to live for two months is going to change people's calculations. But if the war in Ukraine continues to go badly or doesn't go well for Russia, then other people in the close circle might begin to get ideas.

So, we could see some action on that front as soon as today potentially in the form of a letter. And then a little bit more down the line we're also told that the House Judiciary Committee is planning to move a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move either criminal or civil cases from the state court to federal court. That was something that was actually first introduced after Trump was first indicted by the Manhattan district attorney, but it has gained new steam in the wake of this latest Georgia indictment. But we should point out here that lawmakers don't have a ton of jurisdiction over state level issues. And even on the federal level, they have run into some resistance in trying to intervene in these ongoing criminal matters, which is just really extraordinary for Republicans to be trying to do this.
