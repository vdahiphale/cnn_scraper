It's record high. The Fed has been speaking and tonight we have a special show from the Airlines for Europe Conference. Those are the markets. The main stories of the day: Ryanair's chief executive tonight tells us expect prices to go up five to 10 percent because of delays from Boeing and Airbus; however, he has full confidence in the Boeing chief executive. The fed still forecasting three interest rate cuts a year. The chair says higher for longer were very much the message of the day. And Lufthansa's chief executive, Carsten Spohr, he is confident, but that worst of the strikes are over he says, but look on the staff, the strikes hurt the business. We are live tonight in Brussels. It is March 20th. I'm Richard Quest and in Brussels, of course, I mean business. A very good evening to you from brussels tonight. Why am I here? Well, it is the A4E, the Airlines for Europe. It is their annual meeting and it is a chance for us all to really get to grips and talk to the top airline CEOs about what's happening in the industry. Boeing and the problems on the woes of Boeing are very much on the minds, not only as a question of safety, but Boeing's commercial plane unit has seen its Q1 performance amongst the worse that it has been two years. Slower 737 production and compensation made to airlines for the grounding, whichever way you look at it, Boeing has been having difficulties either from safety or because of delays in delivering aircraft. And for the airlines who use Boeing as part of their fleet. Here at the Airlines for Europe, they are very clear about one thing, they are unhappy about it, and it is putting pressure on the system.

This year, as a group of airlines, we are carrying probably six, eight percent more passengers than we did this time last year. So we are complaining about things that haven't been addressed. ATC reform hasn't been addressed. Protection of overflights hasn't been addressed. We still have this ludicrous environmental taxation in Europe that only applies to European short haul flights. We exempt long-haul flight and we exempt transfer flights, which account for the vast majority of Europe aviation CO2 emissions. I mean, I think it is absurd. You have airlines calling for a level playing field, but don't even pay the environmental taxes on their long haul and transfer flights, so there are issues that need to be fixed. I think we have a new European Parliament, new Commission getting elected later on this year, but while we are making those points, we are still delivering growth. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Richard, I think he is doing a good job of finding that balance. It was great news today and I think that's why stock markets reacted so positively. What we heard from the Fed was that they are raising their growth forecasts for this year and next year. They are lowering slightly, admittedly, their unemployment rate forecast for this year. Yes, if you look at core inflation, which is that inflation number when you strip out food and energy, they raised that slightly for this year, but the bonuses, despite some concerns going into this meeting, they still say they plan to cut three times this year and there were those that felt that they may have to say, hey, you know, the inflation pressures that we've seen recently mean we may only cut twice this year and they didn't say that.

They are still facing higher prices than they were significantly higher than two years ago. Mortgage rates, credit cards are far higher and they are feeling the pinch and continue to feel the pinch.

The country's data watchdog now says it is assessing a breach of confidentiality reported in \"The Daily Mirror.\" The British tabloid reported that at least one hospital staffer allegedly tried to illegally access Kate's private medical records while she spent 13 nights at the London Clinic Hospital in January after planned abdominal surgery. \"The Mirror\" says the hospital informed the Palace and launched a probe into the allegations and did a statement to CNN. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: \"We can confirm that we've received a breach report and are assessing the information provided.\" On Wednesday, the UK's Health Minister, Maria Caulfield warned that hospital staff could face prosecution. MARIA CAULFIELD, BRITISH MINISTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WOMEN'S HEALTH STRATEGY: You're only allowed to access the patient notes you're caring for and with their permission and there is really strict rules, information commissioner would take enforcement action against trusts or primary care practices, but also as individuals practitioners, your regulatory body.

To be honest, they're all absolutely pissed off at the problems with both Airbus and Boeing. The delays that mean that they can't have their growth forecast, open new routes, carry more passengers as planned. But that realism also tells them there's very little they can do about it so they have to circumnavigate, they could protest, and they can take the compensation. For the time being, though, on the question of safety, they are all unanimous. There are no problems with the planes. All it needs to happen is they need to be made properly and delivered on time. The last bit not so easy. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for this Wednesday night. I'm Richard Quest in Brussels. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. I'll see you tomorrow in Brussels.",
