More than 100 Republicans will join her this afternoon in Bucks County. That's outside of the main city of Philadelphia. Her message is expected to focus on patriotism, unity and upholding the Constitution. Then, on Fox News, Harris will sit down with anchor Bret Baier, marking her first ever interview on the right-wing cable network. That interview is set to air at 06Harris has already been stepping up her media appearances this week, speaking with Charlamagne tha God on his popular radio show, \"The Breakfast Club\". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And by voting in this election, you have two choices, or you don't vote, but you have two choices if you do. And it's two very different visions for our nation, one mind that is about taking us forward and progress in investing the American people, investing in their ambitions, dealing with their challenges, and the other, Donald Trump is about taking us backward.

We have Alayna Treene and Eva McKend joining us from Washington, D.C.Eva, let's start with you in the Harris campaign. Talk to us a little bit about what the strategy appears to be today. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rahel, we're going to continue to see Harris lean into this country over party message in an appeal to Republican voters. The Vice President plans to blast Trump for previously calling for the termination of the Constitution. She'll also warn of the threat a second Trump term poses, in her view, and slam her rival for his comment that the military should handle the enemy from within. And she'll be joined at today's event by Republican, former Congressman Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, among others. But listen, not everyone thinks this is the right strategy. You have in some corners of the Democratic Party that believe that the resources should instead be channeled to the base of the party, that the money, the energy, the time, that is the most valuable asset that a candidate has, should be in places like Atlanta or in urban centers in North Carolina. But, there are others in the campaign, leading the campaign that still believes that they can appeal to these Nikki Haley voters, these conservatives that just are not going to vote for the former President.",

      "sentences": "That's right, and we did. It was pre- taped. So, we were able to get some of those excerpts ahead of time as well. Look, I mean, I think, first of all, having this town hall, be with it all-female audience, is obviously notable, and it comes as Donald Trump and his campaign are really trying to make inroads with women voters. They know that they have a problem with the widening gender gap, given that many female voters are supporting Kamala Harris.Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisors, they tell me that -- essentially, they acknowledge, I should say, that a lot of women don't like Donald Trump as the man himself. They don't like his rhetoric, but perhaps they think they can win them over by touting his policies and the issues. However, Donald Trump didn't necessarily stick to that strategy yesterday. Instead, he leaned into his dark and divisive rhetoric. One very notable moment, Rahel, was when he talked about and actually tried to define what he meant when he said over the weekend that the greatest threat to this country is not our foreign adversaries, but the enemy from within. I'm going to read you some of this quote because I think it's pretty striking. He said, quote, \"It is the enemy from within, and they're very dangerous. We have China. We have Russia. We have all these countries. If you have a smart President, they can all be handled. The more difficult are, you know, the Pelosis, these people, they're so sick and they're so evil.\" So, look, clearly, he is acknowledging himself that he was talking about political opponents, Democrats, people like the Pelosis. And it comes as a lot of his Republican allies in recent days have been trying to defend that comment from Donald Trump, they argue, because, remember, Donald Trump had said he would even send in the military to maybe deal with the enemy from within. They were trying to argue his allies that he was talking about rioters, people protesting in the streets, things that we've seen in the past, that presidents have done to help tamp those down. But, Donald Trump, in his own words, said that he was talking about his political opponents. And so, I think it's very important to keep that in mind. I think one other notable thing, just to mention there, is that, remember, a lot of Donald Trump's Republican allies have also been blaming Democrats' rhetoric for what they argued led to the two assassination attempts on the former President's life. They have argued that they haven't gone as far. But, I think clearly, this is very dangerous rhetoric as well from Donald Trump.",

The latest strikes today came in the city of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon. At least six people were killed. More than 43 others were injured in this strike. And you heard from the Lebanese Prime Minister's Office, accusing the Israeli military of intentionally striking this municipal building while officials were having a meeting about emergency relief. There has been no response from the Israeli military so far to that specific claim.But, what they do say is that they were targeting underground Hezbollah infrastructure, specifically infrastructure for Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces. And we know, of course, that Hezbollah does have some underground compounds beneath buildings in Lebanon. In this case, though, the Israeli military effectively putting the blame on Hezbollah for the civilian death, saying that they are using civilians as human shields. We don't -- we can't independently verify that at this stage, of course. What we do know, though, is that the Israeli strikes across Lebanon are bringing a rising toll on civilians across the country. There were also strikes in northern Lebanon, where multiple children were killed yesterday in a strike on a Christian village. And overnight, we also saw strikes once again in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the southern suburbs known as the Dahiyeh, where the Israeli military also said they were targeting a Hezbollah weapons storage facility.

In addition to that, of course, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the roughly 60,000 people who have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel, as questions mount about where this is all going. We are seeing that this Israeli military operation on the ground in southern Lebanon, according to the Israeli military, is targeted on just the border areas, to remove the immediate threat that they say Hezbollah could pose in terms of an infiltration capacity into northern Israel.But, we are already hearing calls inside of Israel for this ground operation to not only continue, but also to expand. And so, as both sides continue to escalate, with Hezbollah still firing hundreds of rockets a day into northern Israel, major questions about where this all ends, and whether or not this ground operation will result in sufficient pressure on Hezbollah, or perhaps if the Israeli government will choose to expand that very same ground operation.

First, an Air India plane from New Delhi to Chicago made an emergency landing in Canada after the airline says a security threat was posted online. Also Tuesday, Singapore scrambled fighter jets to escort an Air India Express flight away from populated areas before it landed. The airline said that it received an email that there was a bomb on board. Both threats turned out to be hoaxes and are under investigation. Boeing hopes that an infusion of cash will keep it afloat. The jet maker is facing a series of crises, including a strike that shut down one of its factories. That means that Boeing will not be able to deliver all of its planes as promised. The cash-strapped company said that it would borrow $10 billion from several banks and try to bring in another $25 billion by selling off stock and debt. Boeing's issues are not expected to have much of an impact on the average American flyer. A representative for Kylian Mbappe calls rape allegations against the French football star totally false and irresponsible. His lawyer plans on taking legal action against the Swedish media making it public. The press and a national TV station cited a police report and documents obtained that Mbappe is suspected on reasonable grounds of rape. The alleged incident happened in Stockholm earlier this month. The 25- year-old Mbappe calls the media reports fake news. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has presented his victory plan to his country's parliament. The plan has five points that he thinks will strengthen Ukraine's position to end Russia's war. The heart of the victory plan is Ukraine's desire to get invited to join NATO. It also outlines provisions to strengthen Ukraine's defense, implement a non-nuclear strategic deterrence package, and grow Ukraine's economy. Zelenskyy was unable to get more support from European allies after meetings last week, but says that his plan will pave the way for more peace talks.

When you look at it, some of it looks like a movie scene in terms of all the destruction that we've seen over and over again. They're still trying to supply water, get power back to so many different people in that community. We know 1,300 homes still without power, I'm sorry, 13,000. That's after a million people had lost power three weeks ago. And you think about the 1,500 first responders that are still flowing through that area and try to help find people, 81 unaccounted for people. 117 people died during that hurricane.

There are still power outages, and there are still people who are dealing with tremendous issues when it comes to getting gas. So, you add on the fact that the teachers are not immune from this. You got to get staff back into place, hopefully get these schools up and ready to go. We're told tomorrow will be the first day for many of those students.But, obviously, as you can understand, as much as Florida has been hit and some of these people still drying out themselves for the second storm, will those kids even be ready mentally to deal with the rigors of going back to class room after these hurricanes? So, it's really just the devastating effect that keeps going on and on as, of course, a lot of the country has moved on.

As our reporter was just sort of walking through there, for those who live in the southeast who have experienced both of these storms, this -- these back-to-back storms, Helene, Milton, how does repeated exposure to trauma affect a person mentally? DANA ROSE GARFIN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPT. OF COMMUNITY HEALTH SCIENCES, UCLA: So, repeated exposure is especially difficult because people are not given that time to have that natural recovery process. Human beings are extraordinarily resilient, even in the face of very traumatic events. However, when we experienced traumatic events back to back to back or repeatedly over a period of time, people are not given that time to recover, and they are become overwhelmed, and they are at higher risk for long-term psychological problems from those exposures.",

Of course, not everyone will experience psychological symptoms in the aftermath of a traumatic event, but many people will. And for a lot of people, those symptoms can dissipate over time. So, it's not necessarily a red flag in and of itself if you experience some of these symptoms. However, when they start to cause impairment and you really are unable to function, that's when you might want to say, hey, I need to look into this, whether it's talking to a friend, family member, clergy member, or seeking more formal psychological care via the form of a psychologist, a therapist, either online or in person.",

Now, CNN has been given an exclusive peek behind the scenes of the new series, \"Family by Choice\", just one of many new shows winning over audiences in South Korea and beyond.CNN's Mike Valerio reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In this beautiful Sunsplash (ph) Cafe outside of Seoul, the scene is set. (VIDEO PLAYING) Our CNN team granted rare exclusive access to what this production crew hopes will be South Korea's next hit show. It's just a taste of the new Korean drama, \"Family by Choice\", where childhood friends form their own chosen family, and a reunion 10 years later leads to romance. HWANG IN-YOUP, ACTOR: Hi CNN. VALERIO (voice-over): It could be the friendliest set I've ever seen. Director Kim Seung-ho telling us, laughter is encouraged to offset the scripted drama. And from behind the curtain, lead actor Hwang In-youp takes a quick break to talk to us. IN-YOUP (Interpreted): It's a drama about healing each other's trauma, recovering from it, and finding happiness in the end. This can be a little spoiler, but from the moment we get back together, the romantic side of the story becomes the main part as the story gets more serious. VALERIO (voice-over): And things are getting more serious for Korean shows worldwide. Squid Game season two returns in December, and Netflix says Korean shows and movies are its most viewed non-English titles, ahead of Spanish and Japanese, according to Netflix data from the second half of 2023. YUN KI-YUN, CEO, SLL: I never even imagined that Korean dramas, having a language barrier, can be pervasive to the global market. VALERIO (voice-over): Yun Ki-yun is the CEO of SLL, the studio behind \"Family by Choice\", as well as the Korean thrillers Hellbound and All of Us Are Dead, both on Netflix. He says it's the delicate, emotional storytelling that often makes Korean shows so popular with global audiences, and adds K-Pop music led to an even bigger fascination with Korean series and movies. KI-YUN: Thanks to PSY, BTS, and BLACKPINK, they raised the curiosity from the K-Pop fandom. VALERIO (voice-over): The industry across South Korea hopes will see more Korean shows on more streaming platforms. Yun hopes his new series, \"The Good Boy\" about athletes-turned police officers will be a hit on Amazon and lead to stronger ties with the platform. \"Family by Choice\" is out now across South Korea, and Hwang says he is up for the challenge to make this show an international hit. IN-YOUP (Interpreted): It's unbelievable, and I am grateful for all the love and interest. Now I'm left with my homework or challenge to make the content more exciting and living up to expectation. VALERIO (voice-over): Mike Valerio, CNN, Yeoju, South Korea. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
