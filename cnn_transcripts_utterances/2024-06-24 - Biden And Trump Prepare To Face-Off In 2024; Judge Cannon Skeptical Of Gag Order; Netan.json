We're breaking down the signals she seems to be sending about her eventual ruling. Plus, the United States Supreme Court just added two more days to its calendar to release blockbuster opinions. How soon could the high court's decision on Trump's immunity claim be revealed? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in \"The Situation Room.\" Right now, the president of the United States and his predecessor are a little over 72 hours away from making history on the debate stage in Atlanta.

But first, let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's in Florida near Mar-a-Lago covering the Trump campaign. Kristen, how is Trump managing expectations right now?",

But when you look at the polling, you know, Republicans and Democrats come at the democracy issue from very different perspectives. And that's sort of an evenly divided issue. And you pointed to Trump's economic proposals that Joe Biden no doubt wants to highlight. So, too, does Donald Trump, probably. He wants to focus in on his proposal to cut taxes. We know that in much of the polling that is out there, Americans give an advantage to Trump over Biden as it relates to the economy, to immigration.

I think for the former president, it's going to be fundamentally important Wolf for him to showcase his ability to be a statesman and his tone will matter to a lot of those independent and swing voters. People are very concerned about the economy. They're very concerned about immigration.

But the abortion rights issue is one that unifies the Democratic base, which is also, you know, part of Joe Biden's mission here.I agree with Joe, though. I think one of the reasons that the Biden campaign was eager to have this general election debate earlier than any previous general election debate was to get that side-by-side contrast with Trump on the stage out before American voters now to try to shake them by their lapels and say the election is happening and this is your choice. I will say part of the Trump campaign strategy, in my understanding from talking to people in Trump world about sort of saying we'll debate you anywhere, anytime, anyplace and accepting this debate invitation was also because they think that side by side contrast on the stage benefits their candidate as well.",

He is capable of getting through 90 minutes and talking about a vision, talking about policy. But this is where Joe Biden needs to be working on strategy is trying to pull the other side out of him. There's not an audience that's going to make him want to be bombastic. So it's going to be really discussing issues. You know, the moderators are going to ask about January 6th. You know, they're going to ask about, you know, criticizing our institutions. And that's where I think he's most likely to slip into that sort of rage and retribution side of himself.

Phase C being presumably the governance of Gaza, how it will be controlled with regard to security and how public services will be provided.

Of course, what they want is Hezbollah to move back off the border and stop shooting rockets at them because as we know, 60, 80,000 or so Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel.",

You have a presidential debate coming up here with CNN with a couple nights. This topic will be I'm sure, as part of that discussion. Netanyahu how's trying to balance domestic politics, he has two prime objectives that the Israeli people want, free the hostages and defeat Hamas. And in some ways, those two are in conflict. And he has his own coalition he's trying to hold together at a time when Benny Gantz, just walked out a couple of weeks ago. And it's important to keep in mind that the Minister of Defense, who you rightly said is here this week is the one who said publicly, look, we need an end plan for Gaza. We need to know what the end state is, who's going to govern, what's it going to look like down the road. And Netanyahu has yet to offer that.",

He's saying that because the appeals court didn't issue what is called a mandate before a jury was impaneled at the trial court level. And the jurisdiction was never transferred back to the trial court. Therefore, a trial never should have happened.He actually writes in this filing that all of his three felony convictions should be vacated because of this procedural mix up. Look, the trial court has already said that any issue dealing with the appeals court wouldn't impact the jurisdiction of the trial itself. Therefore, this attempt does look like a long shot attempt by Hunter Biden to wipe away his felony convictions and get a new trial. But at the end of the day, we'll have to see what the court ultimately does rule. But Hunter Biden again trying to get his felony convictions overturned and getting a new day in court.",

There's a related case brought by a January 6th defendant who has challenged the fact that he was charged with obstruction saying that's not what the law was designed for.Now that depending on how it's decided, could also have an implication to the former president. There's also a big outstanding question about abortion, one that could have significant repercussions for the election in November. It's a question about what do you do when you have restrictive state laws that come up against more permissive federal laws specifically in Idaho when it comes to emergency room care, also outstanding questions about the power of federal agencies, and the regulation of social media.

CNN's Nick Payton Walsh reports on the apparently coordinated acts of terror that killed at least 20 people and injured nearly 50 others. We want to warn our viewers, some of the images in this report are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice- over): It's the horror of Putin rose to power pledging to eradicate, but still nearly a quarter of a century later haunts him now. Pitched battles in the southern region of Dagestan, where likely Islamist militants attacks Jews and Christians in synagogues and churches over hours in which police struggled into the night to gain control. We still have an incomplete picture of what sends security services into a frenzy Sunday, as evening prayers began. But it is clear the flames spread along Dagestan's coast down to this synagogue in southern Derbent. And police were also targeted. Their ranks stripped thin by mobilization to Putin and other war in Ukraine. Russia security services keen to emphasize their swift reaction, releasing this video of them securing the assumption of Our Lady Cathedral in Makhachkala. Dagestan used over two decades to scenes of mangled metal and police hunting militants. But this time, absorbing whether Putin's war in Ukraine had taken away the security forces from their own home streets. And the disturbing news that three of the gunmen were related to a local official one his son, another a nephew, and a third cousin, a local MMA fighter. A key victim, Father Nikolai, pictured here, apparently having his throat slit. Amid reports there was a hostage standoff for a while. The deaths announced so far, mostly police leaving questions as to whether more civilians have been killed when they came to evening worship. And the main suspect here, ISIS-K yet to claim the attack, and officials slow to name them. Of course, we understand who is behind the organization of these terrorist attacks, he says. We understand what the organizers were trying to achieve. Extremism has long cursed Dagestan, the Boston bombers partially linked back to here, and it's militants in 2013. And police have long been ferocious in their response fueling yet more extremism analysts say. Yet in 2022, protests erupted and so many Dagestani men was sent off to Ukraine. And so now, the old agony of terror, perhaps made worse by police being thinned out for Putin's long war of choice. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
