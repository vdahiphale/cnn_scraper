We're learning about what could be in a possible deal. Then I'll speak with the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. He's been praised for his bravery on October 7th before being taken captive by terrorists. How his family is fighting for his release. Later, from anti-Semitic tweets to amplifying conspiracy theories. Elon Musk is facing backlash -- how the billionaire is fighting back. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. This is \"One World\". Senior Israeli government ministers are meeting right now to discuss a potential deal to free dozens of hostages being held by Hamas. Sources tell CNN a deal is very close and could be announced before the day is done. The plan would require Hamas to release 50 Israeli women and children. In exchange, Israel would agree to a four or five-day ceasefire. Israel would also release scores of Palestinian prisoners it is currently holding. The first hostages would be released on Thursday. The source close to the talk says Hamas has indicated that the 50 hostages in question are alive. Just moments ago, we heard from U.S. President Joe Biden on this, and he seems very hopeful that a deal could be close. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We're now very close, very close, right. We could bring me some of these hostages home very soon. But I don't want to get into the details of things because nothing is done until it's done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Somerelatives expressed anger and frustration during a meeting Monday night with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet. We are covering this developing story from multiple angles. CNN's Becky Anderson is in Qatar for us where the negotiations have been playing out for weeks. But let's start with CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Israel for us. Jeremy, so talk about what is happening right now. Who, specifically, in the Israeli government is meeting and going over this potential deal.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a three-step process before Israel's full cabinet actually looks at this deal and approves it.In the last hour, we know that Israel's wartime cabinet, which includes figures like Benny Gantz, the former defense minister who was brought into this emergency government to oversee the war, they have been meeting first to discuss this potential hostage deal. And now, at this hour, we expect that the full security cabinet will meet, and then it will be followed by the full cabinet next hour. And that is when we could see, potentially, the Israeli governments' green lighting this deal, which, as you just mentioned, could see the release initially of 50 women and children being held hostage by Hamas over four to five days in exchange for a pause in the fighting and the release of three Palestinian prisoners for every one Israeli civilian hostage. But what is also clear is that there will be at least some opposition to this deal in the Israeli government. At least two far-right ministers in the current government by the Israeli Prime Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security Minister and Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister, they have both suggested that they are opposed to the current deal because of the release of Palestinian prisoners saying that it could put Israel's security at risk going forward. Now, regardless of this, what is very clear is that this pause in fighting is not being described as a ceasefire, neither by the Israeli government nor by Hamas officials, and that is very much because both sides appear intense on continuing the fighting after this pause, after the release of hostages, after more humanitarian aid makes its way into Gaza. And what we are also on standby for is a potential uptick in the fighting before that temporary pause actually goes into action. If you look at the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before ceasefires, before pauses in the fighting, what you typically do see is an increase in military activity, oftentimes from both sides, in the hours before a ceasefire goes into place. Already today, we have been watching as battles have been raging in northern Gaza at the moment, all is calm but we will certainly be monitoring in the hours to come whether that changes. Bianna.",

      "sentences": "Well, in what would be the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since this conflict began, since that massacre of Israelis onOctober the 7th and the subsequent death of 13,000 Gazans -- 75 percent of course, of whom are women and children and the elderly, this would be a huge breakthrough if later this evening, Doha time, there is an announcement on this truce in the Gaza Strip. Jeremy was absolutely right to point out that the wording on any announcement is likely to be a truce, an agreement on a truce -- a four to five-day truce in the Gaza Strip. What would that allow for? That would allow for the pillar of which, that would allow for the release of some 50 hostages, mostly in the first instance, women and children likely to be mostly children in the first instance, Israelis and some dual nationals, as I understand it. It would also allow for the entry through the Rafah border crossing of some 300 trucks a day of aid. So, this is a truce allowing for the release of 50 hostages, the incoming aid, which is so vitally needed. And that would be allowed for by a secession or a truce, a pause in the Israeli fighting on the ground, the Israeli activities on the ground, and for periods of time in the air. When we say periods of time in the air, we are talking about Israeli drones that are being flown primarily for surveillance, would be taken out for about six-hour periods. Why is that one of the demands from Hamas? As we understand it from multiple sources, that will allow Hamas to effectively get round to try and identify where other hostages that they are not holding at present are being held by other groups and possibly other families in Gaza. And that's really important because to come back to what we ultimately know, there are 240 or so hostages being held in Gaza. Civilian hostages, and this is what this deal is about, and soldiers. And Hamas is identifying, making that distinction between civilian hostages and soldiers. Israel wants to know where those hostages are effectively, or at least their identities, their I.D.s, and whether or not they are alive. And this truce period, as the mediators have explained, it will allow for Hamas to get round to understand more about where these hostages are or who they are. That is how complicated and difficult this has all been in the midst of what has been a very, very hostile conflict. So, bottom line, as things stand, you can expect in, you know, the near coming hours that diplomatic sources have told me there will be, they hope for, they hope for an announcement on a deal to at least allow in principle a significant number of civilian hostages to be released from Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.

COREN (voice-over): The reason this left-bank operation is so important for Ukraine is to open the road to Russian-occupied Crimea and to protect the nearby city of Kherson. A year ago, the Russians withdrew from Kherson using the Dnipro River as a defendable natural barrier between the two sides. But in the last month, attacks on Kherson have intensified to the point where the region's military governor told me there were 700 incoming rounds in one day. This is revenge, and now it's felt more, he says, because our soldiers are already on the left bank and our civilians are feeling this revenge. Three hundred thousand used to live in Kherson. Now, less than a quarter remain, including 56-year-old Inna. She cares for her invalid mother and her four-year-old grandson. Twenty-four hours a day, it's scary. When it's quiet, it's even scarier than when there is shelling. She says she lived through eight months of Russian occupation and will endure this, as well. Our main task is to survive, she explains. That was the priority during the occupation and it's the same thing now. We have to survive. A daily struggle for a population that's being constantly terrorized. Anna Coren, CNN, Kyiv.

He covers politics and foreign policy for Axios. Barak, great to have you on. So, I've just been following your reporting, as we noted in this hour. The defense ministry there, the war ministry, is going over and discussing this potential deal. And from your reporting, it appears the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and the War Cabinet have agreed to it. It then goes to the Knesset as a whole, where it does appear that they will get majority support. So, once that happens, what happens then? When can we start seeing things actually implemented? BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL AND FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Yes, Bianna, so I think the full government is convening, I think, as we speak, or they're just about to, and they're going to approve this deal. It's very clear, even though two far-right parties that are part of Netanyahu's coalition already announced that they will vote against it. Those are six ministers out of more than 30 ministers, so it's not going to jeopardize the deal, but that's still an interesting point, that there are six ministers who are going to vote against it. But when the deal is approved, there's still a process of 24 hours where Israel will make public the names of the Palestinian prisoners that are going to be released from prison so that these Israeli civilians could appeal to court against their release. Only after this 24-hour period the whole process can start to be implemented. The Palestinian prisoners would be released. Some of them will be released in the West Bank. Some of them will be released to other countries abroad, it's of their own choosing, and some of them might go to Gaza.

And in some ways, this is key, it's a dream come true for the people at Media Matters because it could allow them to use the litigation discovery process to force X to divulge all sorts of embarrassing, damaging, private information that it would much rather keep secret. And so, legal experts are wondering exactly what Elon Musk is intending to do here given the great potential for this lawsuit to backfire.",

We've seen silence from others. I don't know that many we've seen just completely end their relationship with X. What do you make of that?",

But I think it's very notable that other major companies like the NFL, Wendy's, State Farm, \"The Washington Post\", there are several major companies that have been completely silent as Elon Musk has promoted conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, as he's endorsed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, as he's leveled relentless attacks and smears against the free press. Companies like the NFL -- they're trying to avoid weighing in on this controversy. I'm not sure how long they'll be able to. And really, frankly, given the values that these companies purport to stand for. You know, you have a company like \"The Washington Post\", which is supposed to speak truths of power, whose own reporters have done journalism showing the hate speech that's drenching this platform, X. You know, you wonder when they really should speak up, when they owe it to their employees and their subscribers and fans to speak up in the face of such hatred.",

I mean, she has decades-long relationships with these advertisers. And so, our reporting indicates that some of these advertisers, a groundswell in the terms, in the words of one advertiser, they've approached her and basically said, you should resign. You should just leave X now and try to save what's left of your reputation, because if you stay there longer, you're going to get caught up in Elon Musk's, you know, you're going to be collateral damage essentially for Elon Musk, who has no care in the world, it seems about the damage caused by promoting some of these conspiracy theories and engaging with some of these hateful accounts. And so, they've urged her to quit. At the moment, she's indicating that she's not going to leave, that she's going to stay. But it will be interesting to see how long she does ultimately remain in that post.",
