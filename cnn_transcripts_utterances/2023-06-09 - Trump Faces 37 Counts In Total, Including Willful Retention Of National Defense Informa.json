Prosecutors in this indictment alleging the former president intentionally, knowingly retained hundreds of classified documents, secrets that include information about the U.S. nuclear weapons, about vulnerability to attacks, plans for potential retaliation against a foreign attack.And this indictment lays out how these secrets were strewn about Mar- a-Lago, everywhere from a ballroom that was actively hosting events, to a bathroom, to a storage space. One of the really interesting things about this indictment is it included photos to illustrate just how vulnerable these secrets were. That one photo where you see in a storage room, they have documents strewn across the floor. We're talking about secrets in those documents that were only meant for a handful of very close allies. Now, this indictment also lays out two incidents where Trump allegedly shared classified information in person with people who didn't have clearances. The first incident that prosecutors cite is the one you and me and Katelyn Polantz broke just last week, that's that meeting in his Bedminster Golf Club in the summer 2021, where he tells people that, yes, I have sensitive information, and, yes, he seems aware he can't declassify it. But then there's a second previously unknown incident where he allegedly shares a classified map with someone who works for a political action committee. And I think this is so significant, all of these new details, and Jack smith, we heard from him for the first time today, and he reminded people that we need to enforce the laws that protect classified information because it is a matter of, in his words, life or death.",

This is just few of them. Even though his legal team, I am told, has warned him repeatedly that everything he says publicly could be used against him, he is going after Jack Smith today calling him deranged, a Trump hater, labeling him a thug after he made that brief statement that Paula referenced there about this indictment. The former president saying he looked weak and sheepish. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in New Jersey where the former president is in his golf club tonight.

So, I would be weary when you're going to represent Donald Trump that this is what you get. Of course, we've been covering him for years. Lawyers tell him to do something, and he often does not heed that advice.Now, I am told by advisers who are close to him that he is defiant behind closed doors, that he is ready to fight this. This morning, he went out and played golf. He watched part of the video, the Jack Smith video. He even thumbed through the indictment. However, I am told that advisers and those in Trump's orbit are a little bit more hesitant than they were yesterday after seeing those charges. Again, this isn't everybody but there was a lot of rallying behind the former president that we saw yesterday. A lot of these allies getting out there, making statements, saying that this was a political hoax, a witch hunt, all of what we have heard before. Today, it was a little bit quieter. When I was talking to these allies, they said, we have to wait and see. I was told by at least one ally that it felt like the weight of the actual legal implications was there now. That wasn't something they had felt yesterday. Yesterday was all about the politics. We're going to fight this, we hope we get more money, like we saw through the Manhattan indictment, we hope we get a boost in the polls. Today was about, what does this actually mean for Trump legally, and what does this actually mean for a 2024 campaign? And I will note, nothing in his campaign is changing. He has two events tomorrow. He'll be in Georgia. I'll be there with him. We expect him to address this.

This is not a hush money. However, you view hush money payments, and I don't know how one would answer that question, national security secrets, battle plans, material that is obviously extremely sensitive, the disclosure of that and the lying about where that was and whether it had been turned over, is a whole different level of severity than the New York county indictment.",

One can argue in the Manhattan case that trying to apply federal crimes to elevate the state case to a felony, that that leads one into federal jurisdiction issue. One can't make that argument here. I think it's going to depend on how tough the judge is to both sides. And judges should be tough to both sides when it comes to moving cases forward.

So, I would not expect that a trial that's about the classified documents case and that is addressing the charges in this particular indictment is going to get into business dealings or sort of other ancillary matters that maybe came up during the course of their investigation. But the job of the prosecutors is look at the elements of the particular federal crimes that they're charging, including a substantial number, over 30 that pertain to the mishandling of national defense information. And so they're going to be looking at the elements of those crimes and having to demonstrate how they prove those based on the evidence that they have, in addition to the obstruction charges and the conspiracy charges related to obstruction.So, I think the trial itself is going to be extensive and the trial is going to be complicated. And I think that gets in a little into the question on timing that Kaitlan was talking about in her last interview, which is national security cases don't proceed quickly, even if the special counsel is asking for a speedy trial. The fact that there are over 30 documents that are classified documents that are referenced in this indictment alone means that this trial will include classified information. And there's a whole -- so, I won't get into it now, but there's a whole set of laws, excuse me, that pertain to how you have to deal with classified information that's in a trial.

My strong suspicion is that the 31 here were specifically chosen because they both show the severity of the acts, their sensitive -- I think 28 of the 31 are top secret.
