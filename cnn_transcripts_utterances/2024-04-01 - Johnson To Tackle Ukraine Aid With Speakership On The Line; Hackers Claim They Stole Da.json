Beginning today, California is requiring larger fast-food operators to pay their employees $20 an hour. CNN's Natasha Chen is outside of McDonald's in Los Angeles. Forgive me, Natasha, I threw you off there. Natasha, talk -- let's talk about this because you know, a lot of folks are wondering, is this going to lead to higher prices and so on. In California, they have gone ahead and done this. And now, workers who do a lot of hard work in these types of businesses, they're going to be making more money.",

Some franchise owners have already told me in the past few months, they've already increased prices by about four to seven percent across the board in anticipation of today when they have to pay more for their workers. So, you're going to see that.But there is a limit. They tell me they can't just charge $20 for a happy meal. There is a limit to what the customer will pay. So, in some cases, I'm being told some people will cut back worker hours. Some people will implement new technology like using self-service kiosks or AI in the drive-thru to accommodate for this change. Now, this does apply for any owner of a fast-food restaurant chain with more than 60 nationwide locations. So, if you're a mom and pop with just one store, you don't have to do this. But you do have to compete for the same workers so that may increase wages across the board. Workers we've talked to say this is a huge win. This has been hard fought for several years. I've been following this. And so -- one worker, for example, works at a McDonald's with her mother. Her father is a construction worker. They've been in the same apartment since the 90s. And she's hoping that today, this will help them move to a more comfortable place that perhaps she can afford to buy coffee once in a while. But for business owners, this is a huge, huge increase all of a sudden because if you take a look at the minimum wage in California, as of January, it's $16. Federal minimum wage, a lot lower, but that hasn't changed since 2009. But changing from 16 to 20, let's hear what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT RODRICK, OWNS 18 MCDONALD'S LOCATIONS: This is such extraordinarily unprecedented territory that 15,000 businesses in California are about to embark on.

So, this is indeed a stunning breach because we're talking about 100,000 people, some of whom were incarcerated and their relatives. And the goal that hackers say is to find out more about what happened to Navalny in his final hours on Earth. And that could mean contacting relatives, someone who might know him.

These new numbers are forcing a mini reality check.I say mini because, despite the loss of 18 percent as we speak, we're still talking about a stock that has skyrocketed about 200 percent so far this year. It spiked in January when Donald Trump ran away with the Iowa caucuses and up again as the company went public. So, here's the latest numbers that are concerning investors. Truth Social owner Trump Media lost $58 million last year. And it generated very, very little revenue, just $4.1 million in revenue. Put some context around that figure of revenue. If you look back at what Twitter generated when it went public about a decade ago, in that final year when it went public, $665 million. More than a hundred times what Trump Media has been able to rake in. And some of this is not shocking because we know the Truth Social is struggling. I mean, it is shrinking. Monthly active U.S. users on iOS and Android down 51 percent year over year. It's not just much smaller than Twitter. It's even smaller than Threads. And I think all of this just underscores why there's a lot of warnings out there about this stock, right? One professor told me it's a bubble. Another basically called it a meme stock.
