      "sentences": "So, we expect to hear from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken fairly soon here, and it'll be informative to get the U.S. perspective because we haven't heard from the U.S. other than to say they have received the response. This will be critical to see how the U.S. views negotiations. Hamas waited 12 days to respond after President Joe Biden put a U.S.-backed proposal on the table, that Israel had at least openly largely accepted and said it would go forward with.The U.S. was very much at least confident that Israel was on board with this. The question, where does Hamas stand? Hamas finally responded fairly late last night, in which it says it was open to agreements, but also according to a source familiar with the talk, had proposed amendments to parts of the deal itself. Now, Israel, in response to Hamas, had rejected the deal, put forward by President Biden. Now the question, how does the U.S., how do the Qataris, how do the Egyptians view it? And that is what we are waiting to see. Blinken didn't come here hoping for a major breakthrough, but he also doesn't want to see this process that's ongoing right now fall apart and that will be the key. We'll get a better sense of how Blinken views it perhaps after he speaks. And then we'll see if this leads to meetings, negotiations, and if there's an effort to push this forward here, or if like so many times we've seen in the past, it all falls apart in the details.",

A week ago, there were large fires raging across northern Israel and it seems there has been another escalation starting last night when Israel carried out a strike which killed Hezbollah Commander known as Abu Taleb, as well as a number of other Hezbollah militants.In response, we are now seeing a barrage of rocket fire, approximately 200 at this point, launched by Hezbollah into northern Israel. A number of fires have been started by those rockets, according to Israel police and they've had to evacuate some homes in some areas in northern Israel because of the spread of those fires. It is fairly easy to see, I think behind me it is hot and dry, so those fires are in prime condition for spreading. This is another escalation over what we've already seen. There had been, of course, in recent months, sort of a diplomatic effort to find an off-ramp here; that clearly failed sometime ago. And now, the only question is how far does this rise with a border already very much on edge.",

Commission of Inquiry, they have released this two damning reports totaling more than 200 pages with their findings and one report focuses on the October 7th attacks on Israel, where they found that Hamas and six armed Palestinian armed groups, and they say some instances as well, Palestinians in civilian clothing committed war crimes they say, including intentionally directing attacks against civilians, murder or willful killing, torture, taking hostages including children.They also, Amara, identified what they say is \"Patterns indicative of sexual violence\" and concluded that these were not isolated incidents, but they were perpetrated in similar ways in several locations, primarily against Israeli women. And then you have the reports on the Israel's military operations in Gaza. As you mentioned earlier, this mostly focused on events from October until the end of December, and there they found that Israel had committed, they say, war crimes and crimes against humanity, accusing Israel of using starvation as a method of warfare. They say that they found that Israel had enforced this total siege of Gaza that amounted to a collective punishment of a population. They accused Israel of intentionally directing attacks against civilians and civilian structures. And here they say that they found, Amara, that the immense number of civilian casualties, the level of devastation in Gaza, they say that this was the result of a strategy of -- to cause maximum damage, disregarding the rules of war, proportionality, distinction and adequate precautions, that this was disregarded, and other crimes as well. They accused Israel and Israeli forces of sexual violence, extermination, murder, or willful killing, forcible transfer and more. Now, the Commission has accused Israel of obstructing its investigation, saying that it did not give it access to Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories. But Israel for months has made its position, Amara, very clear saying -- accusing this Commission of being anti-Semitic and anti-Israel body, and they said that they will not cooperate with their investigation. And as you mentioned, today, the response coming from Israel to these findings saying that the U.N. Commission of Inquiry showed systemic anti-Israeli discrimination, again, rejecting accusations against the idea of saying that the Israeli forces adhered to international law and that they carry out their own investigations and they say that it disregarded in these reports and its findings what they say is Hamas using civilians in Gaza as human shields. And on the accusation of sexual violence, Israel says that it is outraged by attempts to draw a false equivalence they say between Israeli soldiers and Hamas, and we are waiting to hear from Hamas, for its response on this, Amara.",

U.S. President Joe Biden is set to leave for the high-stakes meeting later this hour. We are watching for that and we are hearing the group of seven democracies plans to focus on how to use frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.

So, it is vital that Zelenskyy has not only the equipment to fight the war, but actually to power the country, to keep people in jobs, to keep the economy turning over.But look, President Biden isn't alone facing electoral challenges. You have President Macron arriving from France who has just called for a snap election in his parliament in just a couple of week's time. You have the British prime minister incoming, who has an election on July 4th. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, arriving here with facing elections next year. You have the Japanese prime minister coming in here facing calls from the opposition to call a snap election because of irregularities within the prime minister's party. So, the whole picture and the faces around the table at the G7 by this time next year could be wholly different. I think one that seems to be have a certainty of a place at that table is the host this year, Giorgia Meloni, another of the list of leaders coming here. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President, also vying to extend her job within the European Union.

Of course, those are nothing (inaudible) not a new dynamic for the negotiation.Usually, there is space for negotiation because after all, it is negotiation to reach an agreement, a deal. There is no absolute response, yes or no. So we wish that this time of negotiation will be the shortest. We wanted to have more momentum and movement.

And if not, what exactly is the U.S. diplomatic strategy now to try and keep these talks alive and bring the parties closer together?And secondly, the U.S. has put all the emphasis on pressuring Hamas, at least publicly. But do you think it might be time for the U.S. to put more pressure on Israel to move them closer towards accepting the permanent ceasefire that Hamas has asked for, even if that allows the group to survive in some form? And prime minister, even with the elaborate three-phase deal that is being created to try and bridge the divide between Israel and Hamas, we still seem to be stuck on the fundamental question of a temporary versus a permanent truce, which is effectively, will Israel allow Hamas to survive this? Do you think these negotiations can really be salvaged? And what is the risk to the region if these talks continue to fail? Thanks.",

The biggest takeaway was from this last question where you heard the one of the reporters ask Secretary of State Antony Blinken whether or not the deal is dead as a result of Hamas making amendments to this latest ceasefire/hostage release proposal, which was backed by the U.S. and is also backed by the U.N. Security Council. He didn't say the deal is dead but it has injected a fresh air of uncertainty and maybe more pessimism.Let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann, who has been listening into this as well. What was your takeaway from it?",

      "sentences": "Very much what you're honing in on right now, Amara. And this was what we were waiting to hear, how do the U.S. -- how does the U.S. view Hamas' response and how do the Qataris. And it is clear from what Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he puts the blame if this fails at this point, right on Hamas, and that's because he says in Hamas' response, they have asked for what he called numerous changes. He did say some of them are workable while some of them are not.He also pointed out both in his opening statement and then in response to that last question, that Hamas has previously accepted proposals and then in subsequent rounds of negotiations blown past the positions which they already had. And that, of course, he says has not helped negotiations as and it hasn't helped to bring about a ceasefire. He was then asked about this right at the end there in the last question we listened to, is it at Hamas' feet and he said -- let me look at my notes here for a second -- he said, look, if you have to go back, back again and again to the same group in the negotiations and they change their own positions, he then said you have to question whether they are proceeding in good faith or not. He also said, Israel has accepted the proposal that is on the table as has the U.N. Security Council. And therefore, he concludes it is on Hamas to accept this. Now, because they haven't given a response that is a clear acceptance or a rejection according to the Qataris, the U.S., he says as will other negotiators keep trying to push forward to try to bridge the gaps. And both he and the Qatari foreign minister and prime minister say this was possible, and this will be the focus of the efforts. Now, he didn't mention Israel when he started talking about day-after plans, but it is clear that is what he is referring to because members of Israel's own government have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of not having a day-after plan and that is obviously a necessary part of this. An immediate ceasefire hopefully then leads to a permanent ceasefire, but that can't happen without adapter plan. He says the U.S., in the coming weeks, will put forward its own day-after plan that will include ideas, proposals on governance, on rebuilding, and on much more. So, that is also a key part of what Blinken put forward here. So at least from the U.S. and the Qatari perspective, there is a path forward and they are going to try to expand that and move forward with it. Again, Blinken said that there were numerous changes proposed by Hamas, some are workable, some are not. The Qatari foreign minister and prime minister said, there is space for negotiations here and they will try to bridge the gaps. We will see in the coming days if that is possible or if, as we've seen too many times before, this all falls apart on the details of what is on the table right now.",

So again, it raises questions as to why Hamas is coming back and asking for numerous amendments as Anthony Blinken said.Could you remind us what is in this deal that the U.S. backed because there is a -- this is a three-phase proposal that Israel and the U.N.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Amara. Positive and better than expected which, of course, is really encouraging because, listen, inflation remains the number one problem in this economy and arguably the number one frustration among voters. So, we've found out that consumer prices went up by 3.3 percent year-over-year in May. Now, that is not good, right? That is well above what is considered healthy and the pre-COVID pace. But, that is an improvement from 3.4 percent in April.It is better than it had been anticipated. The real surprise is the month-over-month figure that showed prices did not budge in May. There was zero inflation. We have not seen that in almost two years. You have to go back to July of 2022, the last time that this figure was unchanged. And again, that is better than expected. And this was really driven by the fact that gas prices have gone down, right? That is big news and that is very important. It is not just gas prices though, we've also seen some other improvements. We saw price drops month-over-month for air fare, new cars, recreation, and clothing. Now when you dig in a little further, economists like to look at what is known as core inflation, which excludes food and energy. It is looked at as a better indicator of where inflation is going next. And again, we saw some improvement there, not healthy overall, but still core inflation was up by 3.4 percent. That's the lowest since April of 2021and again, that was better than expected. Now, all of this was received well on Wall Street. We saw Dow Futures at the last check, up about 300 points. That's compared to basically no change in Futures before these numbers came out. So investors are celebrating this. Obviously, it is not all good news. There is still some problems, of course, shelter, for example, remains way too high, the cost of rent and buy. We've also seen that the price of going out to eat continues to go up. So, we need to watch all of them at. But, Amara, I do think big picture, these are some encouraging news, some glimmers of hope on the inflation front.",

Today's Inflation Report though certainly helps. Now to be clear, the Fed is not likely to cut interest rates today. There is almost no chance. I just looked and even after these numbers came out, the market is pricing in less than a 1 percent chance of a cut today. The big news is what happens -- what does the Fed say about the future, where are interest rates going next.And this is one of those meetings where the Fed releases those interest rate projections. That happens in every other meeting. It is known as the dot plot. Now previously, back in March, the Fed was penciling in three interest rate cuts this year that would have been great for everyone concerned about the high cost of borrowing, rent, mortgages, car loans, credit cards. That does not seem likely just looking at the calendar. But, today's report does keep alive the chance that the Fed will cut interest rates twice this year. So investors are going to be really paying attention to whether or not the Fed is still projecting three cuts, is it two? Is it one? It is a very big deal, Amara, for the economy. And frankly, it could even play a role in the election coming up.",
