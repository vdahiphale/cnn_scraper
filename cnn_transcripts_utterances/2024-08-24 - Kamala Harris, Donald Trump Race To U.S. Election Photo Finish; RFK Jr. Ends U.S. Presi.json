So I think it's definitely something to keep an eye out on. But another caveat here is that a lot of this polling was done when Biden was still in the race, and part of RFK's draw among voters was that voters were disillusioned with both candidates the rematch between Trump and Biden, I'm curious to see if some of those numbers have since moved with Kamala Harris in the race, jolting some excitement into it and giving candidates an option that is not a rematch from 2020 and something that they were not excited about.",

They were still grappling with what to do with President Biden. Nobody knew if the transition to Harris would be seamless, how the VP rollout would go and then the convention.So Democrats are quite thrilled with how things have been going, but they are mentioning that they should not get complacent, and noting that they're still around 75 days left until this election, and I'll tell you, Amara, I talked to a lot of House Republicans who say that this is a honeymoon period for Kamala Harris, that Democrats are currently on a sugar high, and that they believe that around Labor Day, this is going to die down. Polls are going to recalibrate, and we're going to have a real, true sense of the election.

I'm sorry, Democrats, independent leading Democrats are revved up right now. They're fired up. They were excited about the convention.But let's also realize we are still in that sort of beginning period of the Harris campaign. Again, I keep saying it because it's so shocking that this campaign is only four and a half weeks old, which is such a small amount of time when you talk about a presidential election cycle. So, I think the polls are a still recalibrating from the change at the top of the ticket voters getting to know who Kamala Harris is, deciding if they're going to support her. That was a big focus of the convention, trying to reintroduce and redefine Kamala Harris on the national stage. Of course, she was known being that she was vice president and a senator, but this is in a new light. This is now with her as the presidential candidate, so it's a whole new introduction for her. So I think it's entirely likely that there will be a bump in the polls for Kamala Harris, perhaps down ballot Democrats in the days to come. But again, Republicans are guaranteeing that this is what they call a sugar high, this is the honeymoon period, and that things will go back to normal and recalibrate and we'll have a stronger sense of the election. That's, of course, their prediction. You know that that's not based in fact, we'll have to see if that pans out.",

So you've got those Tropical Storm watches and warnings in effect for several of the islands there. One of the key components here is going to be flooding. It may not make direct landfall in Hawaii, but it's going to get close enough that a lot of those outer bands are going to push a tremendous amount of moisture. And so you're talking six to 10 inches on the Big Island, especially if that comes in a short period of time there could lead to mudslides, landslides and not to mention just the flooding component. Now, part of that is a good thing. We've got a lot of Hawaii that's experiencing drought right now.

The police had originally categorized all this as a rampage, but then later spoke of a terror attack, and then sort of downgraded that to just an attack, because they say that it appeared as though the attacker deliberately stabbed people into the neck area. So they don't believe that this was someone who was just on some sort of rampage. They believe that this person was specifically looking to kill people. Now, so far, three people have been confirmed to have been killed, eight people wounded, some of them severely wounded, and it appears as though the perpetrator got away. But there is a big manhunt going on right now. There was one person taken into custody, but then released because he was obviously not the perpetrator. Just a quick word and that area in Germany, manhunt could be pretty difficult, because it is the most populated area in all of Germany, the sort of Rhine-Ruhr area, and there's a lot of really good rail and automobile links. But it's also very close to the borders of Belgium and Holland, so quite easy to slip across the border there. The Germans are saying that they're doing everything to try and get the perpetrator. The German chancellor has spoken about this, the German interior minister, both of them saying they're absolutely shocked or gave all the necessary aid to the local police. As you can imagine, Germany very much up in arms about all this.

AMARA WALKER, CO-ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING WEEKEND:  A.I. images of fake political endorsements are going viral across social media, sowing discord and misinformation. Images like this of Taylor Swift appearing to endorse Donald Trump was posted by Trump himself even though Swift hasn't endorsed Donald Trump or anyone else in the 2024 election. New data into CNN shows fakes like that and more are exploding online right now. CNN's Marshall Cohen has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Good morning. The internet is swamped with these fake endorsements. They're spreading widely and sowing confusion on social media. So, researchers from the news literacy project, a non-partisan group, they analyze more than 500 unique examples of election misinformation. They launched a searchable database a few days ago, hoping to raise awareness and combat the lies. We look through the data and found that about one in ten of their examples were fake endorsements like these. Take a look at this, just last weekend, Donald Trump shared these A.I.-generated images of Swifties for Trump.  Many of these images simply aren't real. They were made by a computer and designed to deceive the voters. But it's not just Trump. The misinformation is coming from all angles. Here's another viral post from earlier this year claiming that Taylor Swift endorsed Joe Biden. So, she did support him in 2020, but she hasn't weighed in yet for 2024. And here's one more. Check out this photo-shopped image of actor Ryan Reynolds supposedly wearing a shirt supporting Kamala Harris. Some fakes like that are pretty easy to spot, they're pretty rudimentary. Others are far more sophisticated with A.I. technology. Posts like these regularly rack up millions of views online including on Twitter, which is now called X. This is the first presidential election under its new owner, Elon Musk, who has dismantled many of the company's safeguards against disinformation. The A.I. chatbot on that platform called Grok(ph) recently rolled out a new feature allowing users to generate their own A.I. images with just a few clicks, which is clearly making the problem worse. For their part, Facebook and Instagram say they are spending billions of dollars on election integrity, and they say they're cracking down on A.I. images appearing in political advertisements. But ultimately, it comes down to us. If you see pictures of celebrities wearing a political shirt or holding a political sign or claims from some random Twitter user about a shocking new celebrity endorsement, you should probably take a closer look before you hit that share button.

What's not clear at this point is whether Martin will enter a guilty plea and his state charges where he's facing second degree murder charges. But after the hearing, we did reach out to the Shelby County district attorney, and this is what they told us, quote, \"we expect that at the appropriate time, Martin will enter a similar plea in state court.\" Now, of course, Martin was one of the five former Memphis police officers involved in the violent arrest and beating death of Tyre Nichols back in January of 2023. Those officers initially claimed that they pulled Nichols over for reckless driving. But in the 17 months since that incident occurred, that's not entirely clear. What is clear, however, is what was captured on police body camera, and it shows those former police officers repeatedly kicking and punching Nichols. Now, we are still waiting to hear what happens with those three other officers involved in this case and whether or not they will change their pleas. The clock is ticking. This federal case is expected to begin on September 9th with jury selection. Nick Valencia, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, if you're in the market for a house, mortgage rates have come down, they should go down even further.If you're trying to pay off credit card debt where there's record high interest rates, this would mean you get a break there. Now, Powell also struck a cautiously optimistic tone about the prospects of a soft landing. He said that there is, quote, \"good reason to believe that inflation will get back to 2 percent while the jobs market stays strong.\" So, that would essentially be the soft landing that we've all been hoping for, and that looked elusive for the longest time. Powell signaled that the Fed is not looking to see any further weakness in the jobs market, and he suggested that they would be prepared to come to the rescue should it be needed. He noted that interest rates are high and that gives the Fed a lot of firepower to lower them if that's what's needed. Back to you.",
