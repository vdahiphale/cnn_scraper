The country's prime minister says it is at war with Hamas after an unprecedented shock attack by the militant group. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the declaration after Hamas launched thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel. And militants stormed across the border, taking what Israel's military says are hostages, and prisoners of war. So far, the latest reports has 200 Israelis who are reportedly killed.Nearly 1,500 more have been confirmed injured. Israel has responded, with airstrikes into Gaza. This residential tower in Gaza city collapsed. Palestinian health officials are now saying that there are 200 deaths there and more than 1600 people have been injured. The casualty numbers on both sides, Israel and Gaza, are expected to rise significantly in the next few hours. And the last few moments, Hamas says it fired 150 rockets towards Israel. This is what Israeli military sp okesperson said after what a former IDF person called Israel's, Pearl Harbor moment.",

We've got also potential politically for some kind of emergency government to be formed.Leader of the opposition Ehud Olmert has held conversations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on that very subject. And of course, because you have this right-wing government in place, it would inevitably will respond. But I think perhaps even stronger than perhaps it may ordinarily have felt the need to because it needs to show that security is something that it is very much on top of, despite, of course, the surprise on this attack. And they'll be plenty of questions about the intelligence failures about whether the government was asleep at the wheel as a result of its push for this judicial overhaul for the past nine months, but i think, right now, the questions or the expectation is that there will be a focus on the military response and potential for a ground incursion into Gaza.

What is happening in Israel, what is happening in the West Bank? He will absolutely have his eyes on the wider region. You heard there again, from my colleagues.The concern about Hezbollah's involvement, the concern about this stepping up from southern Lebanon and this escalation growing. This being a wider conflict and what is so extraordinary to imagine right now, Richard, it's just two weeks ago, just about two weeks ago. Prime Minister Netanyahu was standing at the U.N. security council, saying that there was going to be a historic peace deal with Saudi Arabia, that it would make a quantum leap in terms of the peace in the region, that there was concessions, understood, that would be made to Palestinians in this deal, and that that could change this region. Instead, we are looking at a very, very different shift. One, that of course, leans again towards those militant groups, towards Hezbollah, towards Hamas. And within that context, I want to bring you two reactions that I think are the most important right now. The first from Saudi Arabia, if we could pull up that quote, if I could read that out you. The kingdom is repeating its previous warnings of the dangers of the situation blowing up as a result of the continuing occupation and depriving the Palestinian their legitimate rights, and the repeated and systematic provocations against the sanctities. Again, this is a statement from Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry. Saudi Arabia was asking for concessions for Palestinians, prime minister Netanyahu, again just two weeks ago said he was on a brink, on the brink of making a deal with them - QUEST: Uhm - Okay",

Let me update you please with the events of the last few hours. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his country is at war after Saturday's sudden and unprecedented land sea, and air attacks carried out by Hamas militants. So far, we know at least 200 people in Israel have been killed. Hundreds of people have been injured by the rocket fire coming in from Gaza. The Israeli military says its troops continue to fight in at least half a dozen locations. Hamas also claims to have captured dozens of Israelis, including soldiers. The former spokesperson for the Israeli defense forces is calling this attack a Pearl Harbor moment for his country. Today's events are also being called Syria's historic failure on the part of Israeli intelligence. Yossi Mekelberg is with me.

The counter-argument, of course, and we are seeing the beginnings of the counter-argument, coming from the Israelis, now in terms of the air strikes against territory in Gaza, is that continued violence, particularly out of the Gaza strip, means that they are trapped into this deathly embrace, in which they don't allow the Gaza strip to flourish, because they can't risk a flourishing Gaza strip, because a flourishing Gaza strip might continue to pose an existential threat to the state of Israel. And, that is the argument that Hamas makes. Ultimately, they are opposed to the existence of Israel that isn't the position of course of more moderate Palestine's groups taking on the West Bank, Richard.",

His first, in a video, (INAUDIBLE) he says, he basically says Israel -- United States stands rock-solid with Israel and Israel, and it has Israel's back. Interpreting what that means, at the same time as not giving, if you will, a nod and a wink and a blank check to Benjamin Netanyahu, for a full-scale military invasion, is a core aspect here. How to support Israel, in its moment of, a dark moment of need, but not let it run off to the races?Kevin is back with me. He is at the white house. Very difficult, for Joe Biden, who was absolutely clear, that there is no blue water, between Israel and the United States, after this attack.

There was not a lot more that he could say, as he hopes to avoid any escalation in this crisis, and in fact, as he hopes the crisis will diffuse. Obviously, I don't think we can expect that from Prime Minister Netanyahu, in the hours ahead, but it is certainly a goal of President Biden, to ensure that this crisis doesn't spiral into some further regional conflict.And I think that is the president's objective, as he is responding today. He did speak on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier this morning, the readouts from both sides, didn't necessarily get into a whole lot of detail, really kind of saying what the president eventually came in front of the cameras to say, later in the day. I think the real questions, that American officials are asking today are, what avenues President Biden might have, to ensure that this doesn't escalate further? What are the diplomatic openings for him? And, you heard him in those remarks say that he would be in touch, or American officials at least would be in touch with leaders from countries like Egypt, Qatar, and other countries in the gulf, that might have some leverage with the Palestinians, to lean on them to try to talk to their counterparts, to see what they can do to ensure that this conflict doesn't get more out of hand than it already is. That is the traditional role of the United States, in these conflicts, is to act as a broker between all of these parties, and to come up with some kind of cease-fire. And President Biden did that the last time violence like this flared up, in the Middle East, in 2021.",
