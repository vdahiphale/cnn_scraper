I'm Jake Tapper in Washington with a special live expanded edition of STATE OF THE UNION, where the state of our union is bracing for what's next.New this morning out of the Middle East, Israel's war cabinet is meeting this hour to decide how to respond to Iran's unprecedented overnight assault. That's according to an Israeli official. Israel says that Israel and other nations intercepted at 99 percent the more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran directly from Iranian soil during its five-hour strike on Israel overnight. The U.S. intercepted more than 70 of those attack drones and at least three ballistic missiles, according to officials. President Biden is set to convene a meeting of the G7 today to coordinate what he calls a united diplomatic response to Iran's brazen attack. It was a night of booms and flashes, of light and explosions over Israel, as air raid sirens wailed. Israel says a 7-year-old girl was injured by shrapnel. And the rockets did not come just from Iran. More than 55 were fired from Lebanon into Israel, according to the Israeli military. Biden met with his national security team in the Situation Room late into the night, getting minute-by-minute updates as the attack unfolded. Biden also speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling Netanyahu that Israel should consider this a win, since nothing of value, in terms of targets, was hit, according to a senior administration official, and the United States would not participate in any offensive operations against Iran. Iran says the attack was in retaliation for the April 1 strike on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed senior Iranian military officers. Now the Middle East and the world is on edge for what comes next. Let's bring in CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward in Tel Aviv. Clarissa, what's the latest on the ground in Israel?",

It proved itself that, together, we can work to save lives. And that is exactly what we did. When they fired some 300 rockets, missiles, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and explosive drones towards Israel, they had only one thing intentioned, death and destruction of Israel and Israelis. So, as we look forward, and we need to keep that -- those ill intentions in mind, we also need to think that we don't necessarily need to believe what they are telling us. The fact that they have announced that it's concluded, we have had rockets fired at us by one of their proxies this morning from Lebanon by Hezbollah. So we don't necessarily take their word for what -- for more than a pinch of salt, Jake. We have to navigate what we're -- what is good for Israel. Currently, the government is going considering the route forward. The IDF, of course, will lay the opportune options on the table for the government to decide, and we will operate accordingly.",

General Kurilla was here over the last few days, and the coordination under the American leadership helped put this coalition together, which was a successful coalition, with the Brits -- the British and the French and regional players, that felt that Iran has ill intentions, has a very hostile attitude towards the region -- towards -- excuse me -- regional stability. And, therefore, they felt -- those players felt that it was relevant for them to step up. I think what is more important is to look forward and see the strategic alliance that can actually benefit and grow from this, and I think that is something to be positive out -- to have a positive attitude as we move forward. It was undoubtedly an unprecedented attack against us, but the unprecedented coalition that came together, it is really, really -- I would say it's a very, very strong sense that Israel is receiving this level of support and understanding. And as we move forward, we understand and expect that those that are concerned about Iran's actions need to be concerned about their actions in Lebanon, with Hezbollah, need to be concerned about their actions with the Houthis, need to be concerned about Iran's actions in the sea as they conduct attacks against the maritime route, and need to be concerned about how they are empowering everybody that is a radical player in this region like Hamas.",

Christiane, how much is Israel's calculus being shaped, do you think, by the fact that it's already fighting a war in Gaza and in its north battling Hezbollah?",

He was just talking about a ring of fire in Iran and the rest of it.But I did hear and CNN did interview former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. I interviewed the former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy, and they both said that Israel, the Netanyahu government, needs to basically take its time, think, realize that it won this round, as you have all been discussing, because none of those projectiles, missiles, drones actually reached any target of any consequence whatsoever. There were no injuries, except, unfortunately, apparently for a little girl, and that was because of anti-aircraft missile shrapnel, according to the Israelis. And what Barack has said is that Israel has to look at the whole picture right now, in other words, that it is at war in Gaza. It hasn't finished there. It does have its hostages still there. It hasn't got them back. The border between Northern Israel and Lebanon is very volatile. So all of these things have to be -- according to Barak, former prime minister, former head of the military, et cetera, have to be taken into account before rushing to some kind of response to Iran. So too did the former Mossad chief. He said you can't have a -- quote -- \"revenge attack\" on Iran right now. And number one priority for Israel and for this government should be to get the hostages back. So, at least those two elder statesmen are saying what they believe should be the next political and diplomatic moves.",

But this is, yes, crossing the Rubicon. I think the most interesting and important and consequential comment that came out of Iran today was the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying that this has changed the equation, i.e. -- and we know that, in 45 years of the Islamic Republic, Iran has never directly responded or attacked Israel. There has been a shadow war going on for decades. Israel has attacked inside Iran, has used covert operations to kill and assassinate scientists and militaries and this and that, but there's never been from the other side. So this is a potential shift that could increase the chance of miscalculations, unless they step back from the brink now.",

I think that's been happening privately, but I think it's also helpful for it to be clear publicly that it's not acceptable for Hamas to continue day after day the torture of hostages and their families. I just met last week with Rachel Goldberg-Polin, whose son Hersh has been a captive since October 7. It's important to remind folks every day that this horrific situation in Gaza has in no small part continued because of Hamas and that their use of civilians as hostages and human shields has contributed to this being as terrible a situation as it has been. We're also calling on our partners in Israel to flow humanitarian aid into Gaza and to partner with us in making sure that we avoid humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. In the regional context, it's important to remind everyone that Iran has been behind all of this, that they have equipped and trained Hezbollah, which even today is continuing to attack Israel, the Houthis, which have continued to attack regional shipping, the Iranian militias in Iraq, which continue to threaten the American presence in Syria and Iraq. So, coming up with a way to de-escalate tensions, to defend Israel and to resolve the conflict in Gaza is the hard and important work that President Biden is leading today.",

I think that's the point that Israel needs to focus on. And I would say this too about this escalation, this fear of a wider war. The administration fears a wider war because it's worried about gasoline prices in the United States. It's worried about the left wing of the Democratic Party. The fact is, Israel has been in a wider war since October the 7th, which the administration has resolutely refused to recognize. If you don't understand the strategic environment, you can't possibly respond to it effectively. This theater of operations has five battlefields at the moment, certainly Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis closing the Red Sea international sea traffic, the Hezbollah attacking Northern Israel, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Now we see Iran itself. And even yesterday they hijacked, I believe it was a Philippine ship on the high seas. So there are five sources of pressure here. It's not necessarily the world's most effective alliance, but it's one battle plan, which the Iranians call the ring of fire.

I think -- people often ask me, well, if you don't think Trump is qualified to be president, why not vote for Biden? Look at Biden's actions in the past 24 hours, trying to persuade Israel not to respond. This is a measure of two candidates, neither one of whom is qualified, at a point of enormous threat, not just to Israel's national security. To be clear, what's happening in the Middle East is a threat to American national security. And we should be standing at Israel's side to deal with the threat of Iran.",

I'm Jake Tapper.And we are following the ongoing response to the Iranian strikes against Israel overnight. With us now, Robin Wright, who's a contributing writer for \"The New Yorker,\" and CNN retired analyst -- military analyst retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Sorry about that. Let's start with the first question. Do you think, Robin, that Iran anticipated Israel's ability to strike down 99 percent of these missiles and drones that it sent into Israel? Do you think they knew that their attack was going to be so unsuccessful? ROBIN WRIGHT, \"THE NEW YORKER\":  They absolutely knew what Israel's capabilities are. They knew the prospect that they would get anything through was probably limited. But this was something that Iranians felt they had to do in response to Israel's killing of senior generals in the consulate in Damascus. The question is, how far is Iran willing to go? In 2010, when the United States killed General Soleimani, it was -- the Iranian response was one-and-done. That's what the United States hopes happens this time, that it ends here. But I think we have crossed a threshold. The shadow war that has played out between Iran and Israel since 1982 is now in the open. There's no going back. For a long time, it was rhetorical, and now the threat is very real and likely to play out again in the future.",

Israel has lots of options. President Biden doesn't seem to want them to do it. Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, take the win. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that's right, Jake. And one of the key things to think about here is, there are those asymmetric capabilities that both sides have. The Israelis can go after the Iranian nuclear program using cyber means, a la Stuxnet, like you alluded to, or they can do something in terms of special operations-type missions. But the key thing that they're going to have to figure out is, what kind of response do they really want to do? How are they going to really set things up for the future? Because, at some point, they're going to have to figure out how to live with Iran, whether it's in a peaceful way or whether it's in a perpetual state of conflict.",
