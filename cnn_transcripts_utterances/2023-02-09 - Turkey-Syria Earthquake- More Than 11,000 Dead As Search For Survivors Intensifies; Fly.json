There are hundreds of volunteers,municipal workers, all here to try and help those in the earthquake zone. You can see them right here. They`re packing food. Everything you`re looking at here has been donated by individuals, by families, by businesses donations that people want to see go to that affected area. So, they`re packing these boxes really with the basics. I want to show you here. We`ve got diapers, clothes, juice boxes for kids -- I mean, anything you can imagine, mostly, of course, non-medical aid here, just individuals and businesses doing what they can. Of course, Turkey is receiving help from dozens of countries. I think over 70 countries have pledged help to Turkey, but there is a sense that Turks want to help each other, real community spirit here. Volunteers tell us they`ve been able already to send dozens of trucks, tons of aid and it just keeps coming. An absolutely humongous catastrophe, the scope and scale of it almost incomprehensible, and so, there can never be enough of this help. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These duties fall under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration known as NOAA. Now, part of the mission of NOAA is to better understand storms and the potential impact they may have when they make landfall. And one way NOAA pilots collect data is by flying over hurricanes and sometimes directly into them with special equipped aircraft through their Hurricane Hunter Program. Fasten your seat belts y`all, this could get bumpy. Time to learn some more as we go navigate some unfriendly skies above the storm. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. CMDR. DANIELLE VARWIG, PILOT/NOAA CORPS:  Flying over a hurricane, it`s otherworldly. It gives me a little bit of euphoria. Pilots are taught to not fly near these things and here I am flying at 45,000 feet above it all for the sake of national safety.",

Sports history was made Tuesday night when Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James became the NBA`s all-time leading scorer, breakingthe record of 38,387 points set more than 38 years ago by another Lakers legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. LeBron entered the league out of high school in 2003 as an 18-year-old from Akron, Ohio. And now at 38, he`s still going strong. He`s been a driving force for creating change from speaking up on social justice issues to creating the I Promise School in his home state. LeBron is also known for his actions off the court. Our CNN 10 special guest Omar Jimenez is in Los Angeles covering this historic moment. (BEGIN VIDSEOTAPE)",

LeBron James now the all-time leading scorer in NBA history,and he would be the first to admit that he didn`t think he would be the one to break what some thought was a previously unbreakable record. But when you look at everything LeBron has done over the course of his career, who else would it have been? And the moment came on a Tuesday night. And when that happened, when he hit a fade away off the left elbow, almost nothing but net, he ran to center court, raised his arms in triumph as an entire arena cheered him on, likely many more watching from home. He came to the center court and was greeted by his family as a crowd chanted MVP, he was emotional as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the person whose record he now eclipsed, embraced him and greeted him along with the NBA commissioner. And when you look at LeBron James`s legacy, the on the court, of course, will be respected and always remembered. But the reaction and the embraces that he had once he crossed that milestone or emblematic of who he is off the court. And for many, all of those come together in the legacy that is LeBron James. And when you talk about the historic milestone that was crossed, it wasn`t just a moment in NBA history. For those watching and that have followed him all around the world, this was a moment in history. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
