Plus, with Iowa caucuses fast approaching, how Republicans there are weighing their choices or, in some cases, changing them. CNN's John King joins us with the latest on our election series all over the map. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with a close-up and unfiltered look at life and death in southern Gaza. Our Clarissa Ward and her team are the first of many western media outlet to go there without an IDF escort. Their reporting airs with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Israel, holding what he described tonight as a, quote, \"intense and detailed\" conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet. The conversation centering on, among other things, shifting to lower-intensity, more surgical strikes, something President Biden underscored today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ten weeks ago, she was studying engineering at university, helping to plan her sister's wedding. Today, she is recovering from the amputation of her right leg. Her family followed Israeli military orders and fled from the north to the south, but the house where they were seeking shelter was hit in a strike. (LAMA (ph) speaking in foreign language.) WARD (voice over): \"The world isn't listening to us,\" she says, \"Nobody cares about us. We've been dying for over 60 days, dying from the bombing, and nobody did anything.\" Words of condemnation delivered in a thin rasp, but does anyone hear them? Like Grozny, Aleppo, and Mariupol, Gaza will go down as one of the great horrors of modern warfare. It's getting dark. Time for us to leave -- a privilege the vast majority of Gazans do not have.

But it's tough for them too, Anderson.And we talked to the doctors about the number of patients they have who are in such a serious situation that they really need to be evacuated to Egypt. And every day, they're petitioning the Israelis for permission to get them out. Sometimes they're able to do that, sometimes they have to wait days and days. Sometimes they never get that permission. We talked to them about a 19-year-old boy who lost both of his legs.

And they are literally hermetically sealed into this tiny strip, which is incredibly densely populated, 1.9 million people displaced. Two- thirds of the casualties are civilians that is so striking.

General Clark, I want to talk about the Israeli military campaign in a moment. First, just as someone who has seen a lot of war, commanded troops, seen the impact of war on civilians, what do you make of what we are seeing in Gaza? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's certainly a humanitarian tragedy. It's a terrible dilemma for the Israelis. It was brought on by Hamas first, by starting the engagement. It's -- these people have been held there because Egypt wouldn't let them leave. Israel wouldn't let them into the Negev somewhere, so they're pinned up in there, and Israel is determined to finish the job against Hamas. Hamas could surrender, this would stop tomorrow. So we have to remember that Hamas is not just a group of terrorists, it's also the government of Gaza and has been, and has used its population as a weapon of war to embarrass, intimidate the Israelis, and to put global pressure on the United States and others who are trying to stop this conflict.",

I mean, there's not some central office that's making these decisions.And I'm wondering is that -- I mean, is anyone looking at the big picture or is it each, you know, individual act is assessed for, okay, we think this target is worth this, and therefore, we're willing to strike it and reassess the casualties will be, you know, commensurate to the value of the target.",

And then you assign the mission to an aircraft with the right ordnance. Now, in addition to those preplan, you're going to have the on-call mission. So people in contact are getting fire from a certain building. Can you identify it? You have a laser designator. Can you put it on the building or do you give its grid coordinates and the pilots overhead? And maybe he has the right weapon. Maybe he doesn't have quite the right weapon, but there's a certain urgency to it. He comes -- rolls in on the target any way. It's a combination of these things. But I just can't imagine, Anderson, that the Israelis aren't doing everything that they can to commensurate with their interpretation of their mission to reduce these civilian casualties. They're getting so much pressure from all over the world, plus from the United States. I'm sure they're doing what they can. But they've said they're going to eliminate Hamas.",

That was the bulk of the day before the jury deliberated before about 3-1/2 hours and was clearly getting into the nitty-gritty of the numbers. They looked at how an expert had determined $48 million should be the amount at least that he should have to pay. And what one of the lawyers for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, Michael Gottlieb, what he argued to the jury was that Rudy Giuliani was a powerful person. He was an attorney for so long, he was so successful, he should have known better than what he had been doing after the election. He should know what defamation is, and he should have known that this was a sustained campaign of lies that would deeply hurt them, that he was using his platform and orchestrating this in a way that was totally unfair and inappropriate for these women.

Donald Trump won New Hampshire and the rest is history. But Donald Trump came in second in Iowa. Essentially, that's where he proved he had appeal among Republican voters.This was the electorate then. More than half the electorate was men in 2016. If more than half of the electorate on January 15th is men, Donald Trump is likely to win and win big. You have to see what's the composition of the electorate. Haley's only chance is women. Is if women finally decide and you hear it, when you're on the ground there, they don't like the toxic tone, they want to move on. Even some of the voter of Trump twice and say they would probably vote for him against Biden in November. They just want to move on. So that's the who. And then it's the where. If you just look since 2016, this is the 2020 election that Trump won Iowa quite easily. But since 2016, the massive growth here, especially in Des Moines and the suburbs around it. Now they're not all Republicans. But when you're there, it's -- you know, I've been doing this, this is my 10th presidential campaign. When I go there now, it is a very different place from when you went there, even four or eight, but it's particularly when you went there 30 years ago, that's the fastest growing part of the population. And we know from 2018 and 2020, the suburbs are Trump's kryptonite. Do enough people turn out in the suburbs? Or do Republicans come out to vote against Donald Trump? And it's interesting. Again, this is anecdotal reporting, but that farm was down here, a tiny county. Priscilla Forsyth is out here, a Republican county. Is there a movement? Is it enough?

It was defaced with graffiti that included a swastika inside of the Star of David at the base of the monument, according to the local nonprofit that built the monument. In Oakland, California, the city's largest menorah was destroyed and pieces of it were thrown into a nearby lake, according to images and video from the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area.
