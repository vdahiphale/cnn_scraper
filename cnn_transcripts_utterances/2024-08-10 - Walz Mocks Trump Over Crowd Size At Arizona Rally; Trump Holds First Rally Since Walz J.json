To be sure, I would rather be Donald Trump in this scenario.

They were sheltering, according to Gaza Civil Defense, roughly 6, 000 people in this Tabeen Islamic school and mosque compound inside Gaza City. A number of them had actually arrived recently being dispatched from northern Gaza, where the IDF has recently issued evacuation orders again.Now according to Gaza Civil Defense, there were roughly 200 people who were gathered in the room to pray fajr when this strike occurred. And the footage that we are seeing, and I should warn our viewers, it is very distressing footage indeed. It is truly horrific just showing so many people scores of people, body parts, blood all over the floor. We have been able to confirm just through going through that footage that there were certainly women and children among the dead, according to Gaza civil defense. 11 children killed, six women killed, a total of more than 93 killed, although the Al Ahli Bandhani (ph) Hospital, where many of the dead were brought, have said that they expect that number to rise because there were a number of body parts that were brought in that they haven't been able to identify yet. Now the IDF I saying that the target was a Hamas control and command center that they killed between 20 and 25 militant leaders from Hamas and also Islamic jihad. We can't confirm if there were combatants among the dead, and we also really can't confirm the exact death toll. But we did manage to find in some video from the footage the remnants of one munition used. It's a U. S. made GBU-39 small diameter bomb. It's produced by Boeing, and this is important because it comes just one day, Fredricka, after the U.S. decided to release more than 3.5 billion in military aid to Israel. Understandably, for the people in Gaza right now, there is a huge, and across the region and the world, a huge amount of outrage, a huge outcry. And while diplomatic efforts have been turbo charged in the past week to try to get everyone together to get these ceasefire talks across the finish line, you can understand that for many, there is real skepticism that that will be possible and that incidents like this only create more tension, more anger and fewer prospects for peace.",

So far today, Hezbollah claims eight strikes on Israeli targets along the border, and we're hearing reports that they've launched another strike using lots of drones on Israeli targets. And of course, Israel has struck multiple times in southern Lebanon as well. As far as the effect of that strike on the school this morning in Gaza that killed at least 90 people. Yes, the worry is it will impact the efforts to really revive the ceasefire and hostage release talks. Now, CNN contributor Barak Ravid is reporting that the U.S. is really putting, stepping up its effort to try to bring about a resolution of this crisis. Brett McGurk, the National Security Council Coordinator for North -- for the Middle East and North Africa, is reportedly going to Cairo.
