That is the new reporting in \"The Washington Post.\" It highlights a deal that one of Trump's current lawyers, Chris Kise, reportedly wanted to make months ago with the Justice Department. According to \"The Post,\" Kise wanted to, quote, quietly approach Justice to see if he could negotiate a settlement hoping that Attorney General Merrick Garland and the department would want an exit ramp to avoid prosecuting a former president. \"The Post\" says this came last fall after the FBI found more than 100 classified documents at Mar-a-Lago in August. Trump refused. So, the attorney, Kise, he never reached out. A Trump insider who \"The Post\" says was part of dozens of document discussions puts it this way now, quote, we didn't have to be here.

But the timing to me is really important here because we have to remember, there was about a year's worth of time when it was only the archives, no DOJ involvement, and archives was negotiating with Donald Trump. If someone had gotten to him back then and said, OK, you need to come clean, let's get in touch with The Archives, let's make it all available, let's give it all to them, I do think there's a good chance this could have gone away without criminal charges. And we know that because the few documents, the 15 boxes or so of documents that Trump did turn over to The Archives before DOJ got involved, none of them are part of this criminal indictment, none of them are charged.Now, at a certain point in early 2022, DOJ gets involved. And at this point Trump's still playing games, still obstructing justice. And then comes the subpoena where Trump gives a partial response. That's in June of 2022. Trump's team turns over 38 documents, but there were still many, many more. And so a couple months later, in August 2022, they do the search warrant. I think, at that point, by the time DOJ is serving subpoenas and search warrants, even if Trump's team had wanted to come clean, too late by then.",

The only Hispanic candidate in the race. So he makes the argument that he represents a new face and a new moment for the Republican Party. He was re-elected as mayor of Miami. Now, it's largely a ceremonial mayor position. Most of the power in Miami resides in the county board. But he has been the face of the city government there. But he also explained why he's running in an interview on \"Good Morning America.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I have a different message than what other candidates have. I'm generational. And that generational is a buzzword, but as someone who has implemented generational change to create prosperity in the city. I'm someone who was the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, so I know the problem that 85 percent of Americans who live in cities and 91 percent who constitute the GDP of this country are going through.

The big question for him, though, will he make the debate stage in August? The first Republican debate is August 23rd. And candidates must have a wide variety of donors, some 40,000 individual donors from 20 individual states. So, if he makes that, he will be on the debate stage in August.
