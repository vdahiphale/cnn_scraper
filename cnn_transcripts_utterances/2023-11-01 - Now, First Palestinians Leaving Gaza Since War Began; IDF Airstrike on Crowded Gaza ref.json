It's not clear yet where all of those passport holders are or are headed but still they've departed Gaza. This has been a huge question since the start of this war. Why was the crossing locked down the way it was? Who was holding it up? And when were foreigners going to be allowed to evacuate? This important move was brokered by gutter and came about after Israel, Egypt and Hamas all reached agreement. Ultimately, we're told, it will allow up to 500 foreign nationals, some Americans, to leave Gaza. We have seen ambulances moving injured Palestinians out since this news broke. That is part of the deal as well. We're continuing to follow exactly how that is developing. Now, let's talk about northern Gaza, the other major development this morning. Israel is defending itself this morning, saying that in the strike that left this crater, it took out a major Hamas target. It took out a Hamas commander and other Hamas militants. But the strike also hit around about and at a refugee camp in Northern Gaza. This crater that you're looking at, we're told, is where dozens of Gazans were reportedly killed and injured. Now, body bags of all sizes have been seen. One witness has described seeing children carrying other children from the rubble. The IDF this morning defending its actions, saying that this is one of its military targets, saying that they believe that many civilians had evacuated the refugee camp. Let's start first with the Rafah crossing and the major developments there. CNN's Becky Anderson is live in Doha. She's joining us now. Becky, you're learning more details about how this deal was brokered, about how it came about, and what the terms of this deal are. What's the latest?",

So, this is good news in these Qatar-led negotiations between Hamas, Israel and Egypt, in conjunction with and coordination with the United States.So, as we understand it, as many as 500 foreign nationals and American citizens, we can't stand up exactly how many at this point today and how long this process will take. But, certainly, we are looking at as many as 500 foreign passport holders being able to leave Gaza, getting in through that Rafah crossing. And then the process is, through that Rafah crossing, you then get into Egypt. As you rightly pointed out, about 110 foreign passport holders to date at this point having crossed from Gaza, but as I say, this is a process. You've got to get through the border crossing and then out the other side. And, obviously, delegations are waiting for those who are getting out today on the other side. We know that Jordan, for example, has activated its evacuation plans for its citizens in Jordan. And there are other countries involved, as we understand it today. There could be as many as 400 American citizens or dual citizens with American passports who are hoping to leave with their family members. One U.S. official tells us that could be as many as 1,000 people. But at this point, as we understand it, it is not the American citizens or dual passport holders today who will be leaving. But as I say, this is a process and the expectations are that those American citizens will be able to leave within the next 24 hours. Again, I have to say caveat here, we are not entirely sure of the actual numbers, but there are certainly, you know, a significant number of people now getting out of Gaza on their way into Egypt. As I say, hard-earned by these Qatar-led negotiators in coordination with the U.S. to get to where we are at this point. Kate?",

So, just imagine the impact, the pancake, the rubble, the rebar, and there is a lack of resources. There is a lack of help on the ground. Food, fuel, water, much of that has been cut off because of a complete siege imposed on the Gaza Strip. Hospitals and paramedics and ambulances, they are on the brink. That means, oftentimes, you're looking at the survivors of this attack digging with their own bare hands, looking for their family members. Now, comms were also severely disrupted right after this attack. So, we're only just starting to receive some of the images of what took place last night. I just got one video of a man just screaming because he realized three of his children -- all three of his children were killed in these airstrikes. There are countless families, countless moms and dads that will be burying their children over the course of the next couple of days. And the doctors in the hospitals, they're describing these horrific injuries, burns, severe cuts that they are trying to treat with very little medical care. You hear an outcry and outrage from the international community. Israel's military has, of course, said they were targeting a senior Hamas commander, as you mentioned, and we did, as CNN, push Israeli military spokespeople on the question of civilian casualties.

And many people I talk to think this is a very long operation, particularly if you're trying to reduce casualties.The second timeline, though, is the diplomatic and humanitarian patience for the kind of suffering you're seeing in Gaza. The fact that residents are beginning to have to try to loot United Nations store rooms and storehouses is telling you something. The devastation you're seeing on television is telling you something. But, really, that attack yesterday where Israel, if you take them at face value on their statement, that they killed a very senior Hamas leader, presumably was responsible for the awful October 7 terror attack, but made a conscious decision to do it even though they knew there would be extraordinarily high civilian casualties or there was a high likelihood of it, tells you something about where their calculus is versus the rest of the world. I'm not sure that the United States facing the same choice or other western countries facing the same choice would have necessarily taken the shot given the presence of so many civilians right in that area and understanding that that's exactly the choice Hamas wanted to force them into.",

We expect that could be later this afternoon, possibly slipping to tomorrow. It just really depends on how long this expert witness is on the stand.But when Don Jr. does testify, he will be the first of Donald Trump's three children, adult children, who will be testifying in this case. And like his brother, he's accused of being involved in these financial statements that the judge has already found to be fraudulent. So, the attorney general's office alleges that Don Jr. had signed and certified that these financial statements were accurate beginning in 2017 when his father became president, and that he also signed his name to annual certifications to banks saying that Donald Trump's net worth was above $2.5 billion dollars. Now, Don Jr. has previously testified in a deposition last year, so we have a sense of what he's going to say. And as it relates to those financial statements, here is what he said under oath before. I had no real involvement in the preparation of the statement of financial condition and don't really remember ever working on it with anyone. Now, he also said he never reviewed the statement, he never approved the statement, even though he did sign the statement. And as it relates to those bank certifications, he testified that he signed those after he was assured by accountants and lawyers that it was accurate. So, he is distancing himself from these financial statements that are at the heart of this case. But, you know, he will be called to the stand once this expert testimony wraps and then be testifying, you know, on direct examination, under oath before the judge, potentially as early as this afternoon. After his testimony wraps, his brother, Eric Trump, will testify and that will be followed by his father, former President Trump on Monday, and then Ivanka Trump on Wednesday. After that, the New York Attorney General's Office is expected to rest their case. But as far as we're waiting today to see how long it will take until Don Jr. gets on the stand. Kate?",

It's good to see you, Jonathan.I'm going to read for everyone how you describe what you're kind of looking at with the Trump family after all of this legal trouble. You write in part along with the other reporters on this piece, Trump's four-year presidency and the tumultuous period of investigations in criminal and civil litigation since he left office have reshaped much of the Trump family's wealth, business and dynamics with one another, according to court filings, financial records, emails and interviews with people close to the family. What more are you learning about the family dynamic at play here and how it's shifted? JONATHAN O'CONNELL, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Yes, I think before Mr. Trump got into politics, the path for some of his eldest children was fairly straightforward. Ivanka Trump clearly had taken a really big interest in the company. She was dealing with a lot of his bankers. She was designing things. She was developing real estate, so were her brothers. You know, they all had a role in the company. You could sort of pick a path forward for them. Of course, he wins the presidency, and that's one big sort of evolution for the family. Ivanka goes to Washington with him, Don Jr. becomes the sort of star in MAGA media, and Eric Trump is back in New York running the business. Now, they're going to have to go through another evolution, particularly with this New York fraud case. The money that they have all tied up in New York real estate and other real estate is really -- it's not at risk for them losing it, but they may lose control of those properties. They may not be able to operate as a business in New York anymore, and some of the children are no longer interested in the business anymore. So, they're going to have to figure out what this legacy of real estate that Mr. Trump started with will happen to it.",

You know, Eric has been running it for the past four, five years, six, seven years really now. on a day-to-day basis. Does he still want to run whatever that company is going to be once it gets to this trial, if he's able to? Again they may not be able to depending on how the judge rules here. Does Ivanka Trump care about this company anymore? Does she care about real estate anymore? Does Don Jr. care about real estate anymore? If none of the members of the next generation of the Trumps want to run this company, then at some point they should start maybe thinking about what they're going to do with it. I mean Trump has already sort of stopped developing things. He doesn't build things anymore, really. He manages the properties that he has but he's turned to politics naturally. And this old -- you know, the empire that made him famous is now sort of orphaned until they figure what they're going to do with it.",

But what do you see -- and she's also distancing yourself and trying to from this civil fraud lawsuit, for sure. Why is that what do you hear specifically about Ivanka Trump if she's being successful in this effort?O'CONNELL:  I just have not seen any interest from Ivanka Trump in operating the business or being involved in the business sense, really, she went to Washington. You know, and she is obviously come very committed to her family and her children, she lives in Florida now, you know? Her to attorneys have said in this case that the only time she's been to Trump Tower in the last six, seven years have been a cup (ph) periodically once or twice a year for a few minutes to visit old staff, that sort of thing. But I don't -- you know, this there's no expectation, I don't think, from the public that she will take over you know the Trump Organization. Now, I think that seems like a chapter from her past. In terms of what she does in the future, right, to me, it's a blank canvas. She obviously has some, you know, experience in business, she has experience in politics, and right now, she seems to be happy being in Florida with her family.",
