      "sentences": "Now, what would it mean for Nikki Haley to win in New Hampshire? What would it mean for Donald Trump to win in New Hampshire? Well, let's look at history, because New Hampshire is known to shake things up a little bit. When you look at past primary winners, it likes to, Anderson, as I believe Jack Heath told you earlier today, when you think you've written the headline, it's going to switch it up a little bit on you.Over the course of the last seven cycles, you look at what's happened in the Republican primary, including incumbents, and what you've seen is John McCain in 2000, with the exception of McCain in 2000. Every single Republican, including those incumbents who won New Hampshire, went on to become the Republican nominee. Several of them became president, including Donald Trump back in 2016. But it's the two McCain races that I think people like to focus on, particularly given Nikki Haley's profile and what she's pushing for in this state. McCain back in 2000 won independents three to one in a race, stunning the favorite George W. Bush, and moving that race on to South Carolina, a particularly brutal battle that Bush ended up winning on his way to the nomination. And then back in 2008, McCain's campaign was left for dead, had a Lazarus-like revival in New Hampshire, once again riding independents to the win there. So, whether or not Nikki Haley can repeat that, certainly that would be a roadmap to do so. But what about those who have won in the state and have gone on to have become the presidential candidate? Margins here are critical, and margins underscore strength. Reagan in 1980 winning by more than 27 points. McCain in 2000, that shocking upset, more than 18 points. Interestingly, Trump in 2016, although he only got 35 percent of the vote, won by nearly 20 points. Can he do better than that? This time around, the polling would say he's in that vicinity right now, his team clearly pushing for a major win. And what would a major win look like for Trump? This is what's interesting. When you look at the size of the electorate in New Hampshire for past primary wins, Trump has a very real chance of surpassing Reagan, getting more than 50 percent. That would be very noteworthy, and that would cause his team to once again reiterate their calls for Nikki Haley to drop out of the race. Obviously, Haley trying to keep him well below that. But whatever happens tonight, she's making clear she is going to move on to New Hampshire. As you look at this map right now, we wait for everything other than Dixville not to start to fill in. Haley's team has already placed a half million dollar add by in the state of South Carolina, making clear her team will be heading there after the race tonight. And what's interesting, Anderson, obviously, is that Nikki Haley is the former governor of South Carolina. That is her home state. That should be a place of strength. Except for the fact that back in 2016, Donald Trump, and again, a very significant race, Marco Rubio getting the endorsement of Nikki Haley, Jeb Bush having his brother come in, the entire Bush family come in to try and bolster his chances. Donald Trump won the state by 10 points. Donald Trump has the endorsement of most of the top Republicans in the state, including the governor, Harry McMaster. One interesting point that Haley has repeatedly made, one, she's got time, almost a month, to try and build a campaign in that state. Also, she's beaten McMaster in the governor's race in 2010.",

And I think going into South Carolina, that is her home state. She is not going to want to show up there with the poll numbers as they are now, even though it's a month in the future, and show up there and all of a sudden have a really weak showing. I mean, I don't think that's going to give her any credit. And so there is this sense that this could end up being a general election fight right away.The one thing I'll say, though, is that I think there's just a lot of voter apathy. I know that the Democrats feel that if they can focus on Trump, that might galvanize people, might focus people's attention, and think, man, we don't want this person again for their base. But I think there is a sense already that he's a known quantity. We've been through Trump once. We can survive him again. And I just don't know that that's going to have the same effect as it did before.",

And so, we'll have to see what the number is today, which, let's be clear, the number that she runs up today, if it's in the 40s versus if it's in the 30s, will impact what kind of earned media, what kind of, you know, media resources are devoted to her. What kind of donor interest remains focused on her. So, it's an important state, but it's not a make-or-break state.It's coming to South Carolina. And South Carolina's primary is the most reliable bellwether for who becomes the nominee. One thing about the South Carolina primary that's different than Iowa and New Hampshire is that more than three quarters of a million people will participate in the South Carolina primary. In 2016, 745,000 people participated in it. You're talking about a primary today that's going to have 330,000 participants. And I don't -- I mean, I don't even know how many people participated in Iowa. I think 100,000 people.",

But there are a lot of strange things that are happening, including Nikki Haley's fundraising going up. She has acquired a bit more money in just -- even since Ron DeSantis has dropped out.The kind of if I'm in the Trump campaign, I'm deeply worried about the undeclared, the independents, the people who are kind of at the margins, who are just who are expressing this real anti-Trump sentiment, not perhaps about what it indicates about Nikki Haley. But what is it -- what is Nikki Haley's candidacy expressing about Trump's ability or appeal during the general election? And then, of course, I do think that as even as the Republican Party is using this as a strategy to motivate its base, there's also the reality of how do Trump's indictments and criminal activity and just overall behavior and anti-democratic sentiment, how do those things play out amongst a general audience? So far, what we are seeing, they do not play well. And I think if you're Nikki Haley, you're thinking about all of that. You're also thinking about the reality that, yes, you may actually have to drop out. But what also can I get from this? That's the thing we haven't really talked about. What does Nikki Haley get out of all of this? You know, besides the fact that maybe she'll be president, right, or maybe she'll be the nominee. But what does she get?",

That's the reason why so many other candidates have gotten out of the race because they do want to save face in a way that maybe could preserve their relationships with Donald Trump or preserve their ability to try again in 2028. So, I think that's part of her calculus. Yes, she can stay in through South Carolina, but if she's setting herself up for what polls say could be a defeat in her home state, does she drop out to say, I don't want that on my record. Let me see what I can do to preserve opportunities for me in the future.",

And that just came out. So, we're trying to sort through that right now to figure out where exactly he'll be. His plan was to be in the courtroom, to fly to New York tonight after his watch party. And again, be in court for the E.G., defamation case tomorrow. Just another sign of how he is balancing this.Now, I did talk to members of his senior staff who essentially told me that they are feeling very confident when it comes to New Hampshire. But one thing I do want to point out is that I actually traveled with Donald Trump in January of this year -- of last year, excuse me -- when it was his first campaign stop in New Hampshire. And there was not a lot of excitement at that time. The room that we were in was filled with Republicans from New Hampshire who essentially just said that they were ready to move on from Donald Trump. It's a very different environment today. And that's part of why his team is so excited, so confident. They are really feeling that there is a movement or at least a movement in terms of enthusiasm when it comes to the former president. And I do want to note that this is a very different place that they're in just in the last two weeks. They were very concerned about Nikki Haley. They had seen those poll numbers. They did believe that it was closer in New Hampshire than it had been in any other state in terms of margins between him and any of his opponents. However, they did hit her and they hit her on two different top issues, particularly immigration and Social Security. And that's what they're crediting essentially his raise or rise in the polls in recent days to was those attacks was to those ads that they put out. But again, feeling confident. The big question, of course, being whether or not he could, you know, essentially take this home or put this to bed tonight.",
