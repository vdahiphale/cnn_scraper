The Supreme Court unanimously ruling today that he cannot be removed from the ballot in Colorado or really any other state for that matter. And really, with the ballots already printed up and Colorado voters along with 15 other states heading to the polls in a few hours from even now on Super Tuesday, there was really no time to waste. All nine justices agreed. Is it a judicial love story in the making? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This time, the so-called liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a concurring opinion, basically told their colleagues, quit while you're ahead, you had them at patchwork. See what I did there? You were waiting to see what I was going to do, weren't you? You were all trying to -- you were leaning into your TVs going, how is Laura Coates going to bring Jerry Maguire back to the Supreme Court? You're welcome, America. Well, they agreed that there was going to be some chaos if every state gets to decide whether Trump can be on the ballot. They got to have consistency. That's going to come from Congress, they said, not the states. Otherwise, you've got this, well, not a hello, but patchwork, and that was as far as they wanted the court to go. But I mean, tell a baby not to cry. The rest of them, all but Amy Coney Barrett, that is, said, you know what, I see your patchwork, and I raise you -- instructions for Congress on what they ought to do next. Now, we call that legislation, but forgetting for being a little bit cynical here, show me the money, figuratively speaking. We've seen what happens in the Supreme Court, puns to Congress, right? Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act comes to mind as exhibit number A. We're waiting for that new preclearance formula, right? Are you? Well, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Donald Trump's third nominee, agreeing that the court went too far, maybe wanting to stop also at the hello patchwork, but also taking time in an issue with her liberal colleagues -- quote -- saying, \"In my judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency. Writings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.\" That's interesting. But now is the time to take the temperature down in a politically charged environment. I wonder why now of all times. What other cases were decided during politically-charged times? Bush v. Gore? No. Roe v. Wade? Overturning Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision? How about Heller, Second Amendment case? Citizens United? Hmm. I guess you had me at a little bit of whoosah for a second, a different one we got to focus on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think that's a great start for establishing the facts for Congress to now pass legislation based upon the work that we've already done and the work that every court that has actually looked into these issues has agreed with. Everyone that has looked into the facts of January 6th has agreed that it was an insurrection and that the former president engaged in it.
