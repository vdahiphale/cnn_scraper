Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin with Beijing tightening the screws on Hong Kong. After a top Chinese intelligence official was chosen to lead the territory's national security regime. Now, this comes as China bolsters efforts to track down the leaders of the country's pro-democracy movement, putting bounties on the heads of outspoken activists. Western nations have condemned the move. British Foreign Minister James Cleverly saying this earlier this month, we will not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the U.K. and overseas. The U.K. will always defend the universal rights of freedom of expression and stand up for those who were targeted. He also called on the territory to remove the controversial National Security Law, which is the sweeping legislation brought into force in June of 2020 after years of large pro-democracy demonstrations. Hundreds have been arrested under the law. Amnesty International says it has \"devastated the city's freedoms and created a human rights emergency.\" But Hong Kong says it is essential for national security. Earlier this week, I spoke with one of the dissidents living in exile. Nathan Law was forced to flee his home after helping lead protests in Hong Kong. Nathan is one of eight activists being sought by police who are offering $128,000 for information leading to his arrest. Here's our conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they have -- they will implement this law to basically go after people who they think may help Taiwan or may help countries that China doesn't like. So, there will be a big wave of persecution of foreign entities, workers and foreign NGOs, or even people, they see them as spy, no matter whether they are truly or not.

They've wanted me, putting a bounty on me, arresting my former colleagues or harassing the people that I love. There's definitely a step up. And therefore, the International Community should react in a stronger way. There are a few actions to combine, the British government, including sending a diplomatic call to the Chinese embassy to answer all those questions. I think those are steps forward.

I do believe that unless there is a big change in Mainland China, unless they understand that the pathway that they are taking forward is no longer working, it is really difficult for us to have a turning point in Hong Kong. So, for me, I've always told all these political policymakers that when facing problems in Hong Kong, the crux is in Beijing, and we have to double down on pressure to them. We have to reduce our reliance with them and we have to make sure that they understand what they're doing, it's going to harm themselves, so that we can have a future in Hong Kong.",

And those people, they felt a sense of danger, a very immense sense of danger and they decided to adopt force, to self- protect. It's easy to condemn them, but, well, it's much more difficult to find the crux of it and try to change it and try to make a way out.

But what I've learned over the many years in my work is that even though we know what's good for us, know the things that we \"should be doing\" from a personal finance perspective, one, sometimes we do act outside of our best interests, but two, sometimes things completely outside of our control impact what we're able to do with our money. And we're seeing what happened with inflation. So, I think a lot of people are feeling the pinch. They're having to spend more in areas that they didn't necessarily predict over these last three years, like food, especially. And that is where a lot of people's money is going.

The rate of inflation, when it comes to tuition, is astronomical.

And if you're not sure who your servicer is, you can go to studentaid.gov and you can find your account dashboard and you'll be able to go to your loan services section and see who your servicer is.

So, you know, when you're feeling overwhelmed by your finances, just pause. And this is going to sound really silly, but pause and take a deep breath. And in that moment, find the ways that you feel safe, find the ways that you feel secure. When your chronically stressed like that, what happens is when you make financial decisions, big or small in that state, you're making them from a place of stress and anxiety and not from a place of cognition. When that happens, what you do is you \"make bad financial decisions,\" right, because you're in a bad state. And then, it's a vicious cycle.",

But one of the big downsides is the size of our country is that everyone is always trying to make a buck off of everyone, and that permeates our culture. Our culture is just -- it's steep and saturated in that idea. And we're even seen it with student loans. It doesn't make sense to be profiting off of our citizens in that way. If we help them, if we educate them, if we arm them with skills, with trades, with knowledge so that they can go into the marketplace, they can actually, you know, add value, create companies, be healthy, effective workers, again, that is going to be better for the economy overall. And I think that the way that we're doing things right now is incredibly short sighted.
