A new hour of \"CNN News Central\" starts now.FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Straight ahead, Israel carried out a military strike inside Iran last night in retaliation for an Iranian drone and missile attack last weekend. We'll have the very latest and in-depth analysis. Donald Trump's hush money trial now has a jury, with opening statements on track to start as soon as Monday. And U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is putting policy over politics, a move that could cost him his job. All right. We're following breaking news this hour. The U.S. is confirming that Israel has carried out a military strike inside Iran. An Iranian official says its air defenses intercepted three drones near an army base in the central province of Isfahan. The UN nuclear watchdog says no nuclear sites were damaged. Iranian media showed calm scenes in the city of Isfahan, as well as Tabriz in the northwest. Israel is not commenting. But, it has been vowing to retaliate after Tehran launched a barrage of drones and missiles against Israel over the weekend. Last hour, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only say the U.S. was not involved in any offensive operations. Speaking at a news conference from the G7 summit in Capri, Italy, Blinken said the G7 is focused on de-escalation of the conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: All I can say is that, for our part and for the entire G7, our focus has been on the escalation, on avoiding a larger conflict. And actually, that's been true since day one after the horrific events of October 7. A big part of our approach has been to prevent the conflict from spreading, to avoid escalation everywhere, and that's a common policy across the G7, and it's very much our approach now. So, we've been engaged in efforts to avoid escalation. Those efforts will continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And then, speaking of relationships, the Israeli opposition leader is criticizing far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben- Gvir for appearing to ridicule the strike in Iran as perhaps not going far enough. So, this kind of public airing of grievance, is it representative of how divided the Israeli government is right now?EL-GAMAL: Right. Of course, the Israeli government is split, because you have these more extremist elements like Ben-Gvir who were always agitating for more military action and for more confrontation. But, Ben-Gvir is not really a serious voice. I mean, everybody knows that he is an extremist. I mean, by Israel's own standards, he was on trial for supporting terrorism and he is just not really seen as a voice that Netanyahu needs to listen to credibly. If you look at more respected voices from the Israeli establishment, including former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, they've all been saying, this is enough. We need to de-escalate. Israel cannot go to war. We have already a massively deteriorating situation in Gaza that we need to deal with. We have this Rafah operation that the U.S. is against. We don't know if we're going to go through with that. The international community, before the Iranian strikes on Israel, was talking about conditioning of military assistance to Israel or suspending assistance. Israel has not really been in a great place because of its actions in Gaza. And so, the last thing that it needed was to aggravate the international community even further, including its closest ally, the United States. So, I think it's fairly easy for Prime Minister Netanyahu to brush aside Ben-Gvir's comments right now and say, listen, I retaliated. I made it clear to the Iranians that we know where their nuclear sites are. We can strike them if we want to, but I have chosen not to escalate things further. And that way, he looks a bit more responsible, frankly, than he has been looking over the last several weeks and indeed months.",

Speaker Mike Johnson, whose political future rides on all of this, says the House will likely vote on the bills themselves on Saturday. Lauren Fox is joining us live now from Washington.

This has become so contentious, though, that last night, in the House Rules Committee, three Republicans actually voted against advancing this. Typically in the Rules Committee, it's just a procedural vote. Even if you don't agree with the underlying legislation, it's typically the responsibility of the majority to get this process moving, to get the debate started on the floor.Those three Republicans voted against doing even that. That meant that Democrats took this very unusual step of helping this legislation get out of the Rules Committee. The reasoning for that, they argue, is that this set of bills is so essential that they have been waiting so long for it that they don't want to take any risks. They can wait no longer. They cannot wait for the Republican Party to unify. Today, we expect to see a very similar scene on the floor when they vote on this rules package. We expect that it's going to take more Democrats and perhaps Republicans to get this across the finish line. Tomorrow, we will see the final vote.

On the other hand, I think that the threat against him is extremely real in this moment, and what potentially could unfold over the next days or weeks. I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene has not said when or if she is certainly or definitely even going to force the vote to vacate the Speaker. But, if she does, it is likely going to fall on Democrats to decide whether or not they want to save him. And there are a handful of Democrats who have already made clear that they don't want any more chaos in their chamber.And if Mike Johnson continues to be on this path of passing the Ukraine aid, making sure the government was funded just a month ago, that puts them in a position perhaps where Democrats might feel like they want to help Mike Johnson. Now, it may not be every Democrat. A lot of progressives I've talked to have said, we are never going to do that. But, there are some who are running in swing districts who might view this vote as both the right thing to do and perhaps a electorally convenient thing to do. And so, I think that that is going to be worth watching. I think the other question there is, if Mike Johnson is saved by Democrats, how effective can he be as a Republican Speaker, as a fundraiser in an election year for the Republican Party? Fredricka.",

But, an Iranian general is saying that there were -- the explosions were the result of air defense systems shooting at what he called a suspicious object. Separately, one Iranian official is confirming that three drones were intercepted by air defense systems in the area of Isfahan.Meanwhile, Syrian state media is also reporting that the -- that Israel struck air defense systems in Syria. So, confirmations at least that there were hits to a Syrian -- an installation in Syria, where we know that the Iranian military also maintains a presence. But, there is no question that, overall, there is clearly an attempt by the Iranians to downplay the significance of this to not even fully acknowledge that Israel carried out some kind of attack inside of Iran.

Paris right now, Fredricka, is under this extra layer of control, because already there has been this -- ever since the terrorist attacks the last few years we've had here in Paris and elsewhere in France, what they call the Operation Sentinelle, these are military personnel who go about the streets of France to try and keep things under control. About 3,000 of them are in the streets of France any given time. That was doubled after the Moscow attack.So, there is the sense of the highest alert possible here on the streets of Paris. And very quickly, you would have seen security forces enter that part of Paris. These are the Western neighborhoods and sort of Shiite parts of Paris, where this consulate is, and they would have been very quick in arriving there, both the military personnel and of course this elite police unit that I mentioned, the BRI, to try and bring the situation under control.

The big problem, I think, Fred, is that the only way to really protect the integrity and the jurors going forward, and the same concern the prosecution has expressed about the witnesses, there really has to be a much stronger, clearer kind of gag order imposed on Trump's activities.

But, I do think that even in the jury selection, even in the prosecution's view about witnesses, you're seeing the effect of him not being restrained for such a long time, and that's going to continue to happen throughout the trial.

But, let's talk about how -- what jurors have to do. I mean, they're going to have to really listen to, we through a lot of forensic evidence about accounting, questions about the law, how it should be applied. But, because we understand this to be a fairly well-educated jury. Perhaps that was the intent behind why the attorneys decided this is the kind of makeup of the jury that we want.How much pressure is on the jury to quickly -- to be quick studies of the law, of forensic evidence, of accounting, and all of this kind of minutiae that ordinarily people might not be well versed on?",

Sometimes that can change with the type of case you have.But, I think what the prosecution will need to do here is jurors will want to understand the basic facts of the story, and when they're talking about documents, finances, that needs to be presented in a very straightforward way. Here is the payment. Here is what they called it. Here is why it wasn't what they called it, and then use the actual human beings to really give life to that.

They have more than 200 million people living in this state alone, Fred. That's almost two thirds of the population of the entire United States. And when you look at the massive size of the electorate here in India, just think about this for a second, 968 million people. That's almost three times the population of the U.S., or you can add up the United States, the European Union and Russia combined, and you still wouldn't reach the number of eligible voters here in India, a massive country with a population of 1.4 billion people, a lot of them voting and many of them voting today.Phase one here in India of a seven-phase electoral process wraps up in about 15 minutes or so. That's when the last poll is closed. And we were at a polling site here in India's most populous state earlier today, and we consistently saw long lines throughout the day. It's really extraordinary when you think about how India actually orchestrates this incredibly complex ordeal of getting these electronic voting machines within two kilometers of every single eligible voter here in India. Sometimes, it means literally climbing mountains, climbing up the Himalayas, traversing through remote, bumpy roads, abandoned forests, remote deserts, even crossing rivers on foot. That's how they get these voting machines within two kilometers of every single person who decides to cast their ballot in this election. And the last election back in 2019 had a record high turnout here in India of 67 percent. Some are estimating that this election could be even bigger. It's certainly going -- expected to be even more expensive than the last election in India, which was almost $9 billion, the cost of the vote here in India, even surpassing the hugely expensive presidential elections in the United States. So, big money being spent by candidates on the campaign trail, and a lot of expectations as to who is going to come out on top. But, I can't talk about that on the air, Fred, for another 13 minutes because of reporting restrictions that are in place here in India that prevent us from talking while the voting is taking place about who is ahead in the polls. That, by the way, is just one sign of the crackdown on press freedoms that has been continuing under this current Modi administration, which has already been in power for 10 years with two terms.
