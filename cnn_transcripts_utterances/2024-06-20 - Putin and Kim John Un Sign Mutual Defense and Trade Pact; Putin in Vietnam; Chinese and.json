Putin's trip to Asia comes a week after the U.S. and other allies hit Moscow with new sanctions intended to isolate Russia for the war in Ukraine.Before arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam's Communist Party newspaper published an op-ed by Putin in which he wrote of his gratitude for Vietnam's so-called balanced position on the conflict in Ukraine, as well as its search for a peaceful settlement. High level meetings with the Vietnamese president, prime minister and Communist Party chief are now set for the coming hours. It seems Putin arrives bearing gifts. He says Russia is ready to help develop Vietnam's nuclear power industry. The Russian president earlier wrapped a two-day state visit to Pyongyang. by signing a new treaty with North Korea, which includes a mutual defense pact, similar to a Cold War agreement between the North and the former USSR. With relations between Moscow and Pyongyang now the closest they've been since the fall of the Soviet Union. Let's bring in CNN's Beijing Bureau chief, Steven Jiang.

And if you recall back in November, North Korea had actually conducted a very successful satellite launch two months after Kim Jong Un and Putin had actually met.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Vladimir Putin is scheduled to meet with Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi in the coming hours after a two-day state visit to North Korea. The Russian president wrote an article for Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper, thanking Hanoi for its balanced position on the conflict in Ukraine. Putin is also offering to help Vietnam develop its nuclear power program; wants to expand tourism between both countries. A new treaty between North Korea and Russia could see diplomatic relations heading back to their peak during the days of the Cold War. Before leaving Pyongyang, the Russian president and North Korean leader signed an agreement which includes a mutual defense pact, similar to one between North Korea and the former Soviet Union. That's raising concerns that Russia could help develop Pyongyang's illicit nuclear program. And North Korea could increase supplies of munitions for Russia's war in Ukraine. Details now from CNN's Matthew Chance, reporting in from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (through translator): This was carefully choreographed pomp and ceremony. A lavish welcome in North Korea for the Russian president. In Pyongyang's central square, tens of thousands cheered, waving flags and balloons as their own ruthless autocrat, Kim Jong-un, stood shoulder to shoulder with the Kremlin strongman. It's been 24 years since Putin's last visit here. Now, international sanctions and war have driven him back. Later, the two leaders signing a strategic alliance treaty. Unwavering, they called it, heralding a new and dangerous phase in cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang. \"I've no doubt this powerful treaty will be very constructive,\" declared Kim Jong-un. \"Strictly peace-loving and defensive,\" he said. Putin clarified: \"The partnership includes mutual assistance in the event of aggression.\" That's similar to NATO's Article V, raising concerns Ukrainian attacks on Russia could invoke the clause. Already, U.S. officials say Russia is using North Korean ammunition to sustain its barrage on the Ukrainian front lines. Moscow and Pyongyang deny arms transfers, which would be in violation of U.N. sanctions. The Kremlin needs all the help it can get to win its conflict in Ukraine. What North Korea may get in return is also concerning. Its space ballistic missile and nuclear programs, used to threaten the U.S. and its allies, would benefit from Russian technology. The Kremlin says Pyongyang hasn't even asked for help in the most sensitive areas. Back in Pyongyang, the only tech being transferred so far seems to be automotive, the Kremlin gifting Kim a Russian-made limo in which Putin then drove him around during a brief interlude. But then it was back to the business of state-sponsored flattery. Putin and Kim, stone-faced at times, sat as the captive audience clapped along to patriotic Russian and Korean songs. Both leaders, opposed to the U.S. and its allies, are isolated and sanctioned by the West. In Pyongyang, at least, neither looks like a pariah. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
