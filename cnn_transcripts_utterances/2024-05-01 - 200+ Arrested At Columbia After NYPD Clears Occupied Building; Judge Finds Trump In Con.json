What does it take to clear the people outside? What does it take to get the non-students who are on the ground off the campus again?And they came up with a plan. Columbia gave them a letter authorizing them to come onto campus and to take police action. And what they did was they showed up within an overwhelming force -- literally, hundreds and hundreds of officers and every kind of piece of equipment they could possibly need on the idea that their theory was if we bring a whole lot of people, we probably won't have a whole lot of resistance. And that's what they had. They were able to make arrests without any injuries. They were able to breach the barricades that had been built by the students holding the building, and others, and arrested about 45 or 50 people inside the first floor, cleared the rest of the building, which was barricaded on every floor but basically empty. And you've got 234 arrests from Columbia last night and another 45 up the street at City College. It was a busy and long evening.",

They used pliers to sort of break in so that they could get to the protesters who had already broken windows.(Sirens blaring) Just give me one second here because this is normal New York activity here with the sirens going. That having nothing to do with Columbia and what's going on on campus. Now, I want to ask you about what's happening at the UCLA campus because we have just seen this scene overnight of violence breaking out between counter-protesters who are pro-Israeli and the folks that are pro-Palestinian inside of the encampment. And now you've got police on the ground. How do they go forward here and try to keep it similar to what happened here, whereas there is no injury? Keep things calm but do the business that the university wants them to do.",

And I know you spent a lot of time on the West Coast covering law enforcement, so you know the difference.But New York City is 35,000 police officers and if you need 1,000 police offers for an operation you can amass that many. And if you need another 1,000 you can have them there soon enough. A very different situation in Los Angeles. There is a place where you have 9,000 cops patrolling a city that's a third larger, in terms of geography, with half the population. So they weren't on campus. They have to wait in the same way that New York does to be asked to come on by the campus. UCLA has its own police department, as do most of the universities out there, but they're very small. So what you're going to see out there is a mix of cops from the California Highway Patrol, from Beverly Hills, from Santa Monica put together as a mutual aid team. And the question is do they stay and separate these protesters and counter-protesters, or do they handle the situation and leave the campus? And then, of course, you run the risk of this coming back. Even at Columbia, where you are, the administration from the university sent another letter saying could the police leave a holding force behind -- a smaller force, obviously -- until after graduation? Because they don't want to have to clear this building, clear the quad, and then have that come back and have to clear it again.",

In fact, he hasn't even made appearances on the days where he's not required to be in New York.But he will make his -- held his first campaign rallies today in the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin. These are states that he won in 2016 but lost in 2020 and they are focusing on, again, this go-around. And this will be our -- really, our first chance to see how Trump manages to balance the trial and the trail. With these appearances today, we will get sort of a glimpse into his strategy as well for navigating the gag order that has been a problem for him in recent weeks. Obviously, yesterday, the judge ruled that he had to pay a $9,000 fine. We will be closely watching to see how he responds to that today on the campaign trail. It's worth noting that he did remove about a half-dozen Truth Social posts tied to the gag order that were under -- that were raised as a concern by the prosecutor. So we'll see how he responds on the campaign trail. But as you mentioned, this appearance is also coming after this remarkable lengthy interview with Time magazine where Trump sort of gave a preview into what you could expect into his next term as president. I want to run through a few of those things. He said -- he suggested that states could punish women for getting an abortion and they could monitor their pregnancies. He wants to leave all these abortion access decisions up to the states. He would mobilize the military and local police to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. He also said he would pardon every person accused in the January 6 violence, including those already convicted or those who have pled guilty. These are hundreds of people who have been found guilty or have pled guilty to violence and charges related to the riots that day. And then he was asked, as you mentioned, about the political violence we saw in that day and whether he thinks that could happen again. And he was somewhat evasive and noncommittal to preventing violence. Let me read you his exact quote. \"I think we're going to win. And if we don't win, you know, it depends on the fairness of an election. I don't believe they'll be able to do the things that they did last time.\" So, clearly, leaning on the conspiracies around the 2020 election and not committing to preventing violence or calling down his supporters in 2024, John.",

First up, a new hearing on more allegations that Trump violated the judge's gag order. And Judge Merchan, just yesterday, slapped a fine on the former president -- $9,000 for nine violations. And he also ordered Trump to remove the offending social media posts.And there was also a warning attached that basically came down to if Trump keeps violating the gag order he risks ending up behind bars. Joining me right now is CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson, and criminal defense attorney Bill Brennan. He represented Donald Trump in his payroll -- Donald Trump's payroll corporation in the 2022 case. It's great to see you guys. Thank you for being here. Joey, let's first go inside the courtroom and what kind of played out yesterday. Reporters -- CNN reporters inside the courtroom -- they noted how intently and closely the jurors were paying attention to the witnesses that were on the stand. And I -- that's -- to me, you have to kind of read the body language and obviously, you can't speak to them, but it is always so interesting and important to kind of try to read into that.

You want those jurors to have that wimble the neck, you know -- watching back and forth the volley of the question and the answers. And I don't think we have to guess how he's being painted or perceived. The witness on the stand yesterday -- I think it was Davidson -- said I didn't trust Cohen. And Cohen is a polluted source. He's going to take the stand being convicted of lying to Congress, a convicted felon, and he's got an axe to grind with the defendant. He went from a sycophant to Donald Trump to now somebody who is kind of out to get him. And jurors pick up on that. Jurors pick up on when a witness seems to have skin in the game. So I think Cohen could be a disaster for the prosecution. And if you take it so far -- if you take the witnesses that we've heard from so far, all you've really heard is that Cohen went out and got a home equity loan on Cohen's house without telling Cohen's wife. And Cohen negotiated a deal with Davidson and the AMI people. And Cohen formed a corporation. The banker said he never spoke to the defendant. He never heard from the defendant. You know, there's a strong narrative here that the defense could craft that Cohen went rogue and he was looking for a little pat on the head from his boss and he came up with this scheme on his own.

And they are going to be asked to draw the reasonable inference that this was about Cohen, who was the fixer, fixing things for his boss at the behest and at the direction of and because he was involved in trying to -- he, being Trump -- had full knowledge of what was happening.

There's been repeated violations. The thousand-dollar cap is a joke. At the end of the trial, win or lose, the defendant is going to spend a day or two in jail. Just kind of a -- just more form over substance. So I really would take Judge Merchan very seriously. And I've represented the former president a couple of times. I would say to him knock it off.

This afternoon, they will announce whether they are keeping interest rates steady for the sixth time in a row or if a cut in rates is coming as they continue to deal with stubborn inflation.With me now is Jeanna Smialek. She is the Federal Reserve and economy reporter for The New York Times. Jeanna, thanks so much for being with us. I think I framed that the wrong way. I think zero percent of people are expecting an interest rate cut today. So what will you be watching for from the Fed? What words, what guidance? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE AND ECONOMY REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, this meeting is all about what comes next. So coming into this year we all expected that the Fed would be making interest rate cuts, really, already. They had predicted that they were going to make three cuts over the course of 2024. That has obviously had a big curveball thrown in it by the fact that inflation has been unexpectedly stubborn in recent months. And so what we're watching for today is any signal from the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, about how they're thinking about that stubbornness and what that's going to mean for the trajectory for rate cuts. Are they still going to be able to make the three cuts? You know, it seems like that's less and less likely with each passing move. Is it possible that they could start considering a rate increase if things continue going in the wrong direction, and sort of what is the standard for making that change?

And typically in an environment like this where we have mortgage rates up above seven percent as a result of those high Fed rates, you would expect home prices to be really cooling pretty dramatically. You would expect the stock market to really be suffering dramatically.And what we've really seen -- you know, April's stock performance notwithstanding -- is the asset prices just aren't suffering that way. Stocks remain pretty close to all-time highs. We've seen home prices actually, yesterday in a surprise outcome from the sort of home price data that we all watch -- actually ticked up, which is not what you would expect in an environment like this. And so, people who have those assets -- people who hold that wealth are really feeling a lot better than they usually would at this point in a cycle. You know, they're not optimistic about the economy but they do feel -- they tell us in surveys they feel pretty good about their personal finances. They expect to see their incomes rise over the next year. And so, those sort of positives for richer people are really sort of muting the impact of these Fed interest rate increases. And that -- you know, that opens a big question for the Fed. Is our policy rates high enough to really weigh on the economy? And if they are, how long are they going to have to stay here in order to really sort of wrestle down growth in a way that will cool inflation? BERMAN:  These are tough decisions the Fed has to make.
