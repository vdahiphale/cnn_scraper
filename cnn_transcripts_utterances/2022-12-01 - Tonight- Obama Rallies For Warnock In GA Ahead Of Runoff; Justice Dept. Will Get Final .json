President Macron is in Washington for the first official state visit of the Biden presidency that includes a big fancy steak dinner tonight. This meeting though also happening at a time of high tensions between the United States and France and the United States and Europe, most of that over economic issues, back to that as soon as the two leaders emerge.Tonight though, the former president, Barack Obama, returns to Georgia to try to fire up voters ahead of next Tuesday's Senate runoff election. Obama's visit marking the second time the former president will campaign the Democratic Senate incumbent Raphael Warnock in his race against Republican Herschel Walker. As of this morning, get this number, more than 1.1 million voters have already cast early ballots in the runoff. Our reporters back with us, that early voting tomorrow is the final day of early voting. Stunning, more than 1.1 million votes cast. Barack Obama goes tonight and we know why. It's hard to get people to turn out in a runoff election. They just voted a month ago. You're trying to get them turn out again. Barack Obama will do it in person in a rally. If you're a Georgia voter, especially if they think it's possible. You might vote Democrat, you might get a phone call from another Obama, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it's a big deal, because Democrats will have subpoena power. Committees will not be evenly split anymore. So it will be a lot more power in the Senate now.And so the case that they're making it is -- there's a lot more to gain for Democrats here, which is why they're going all in. You're seeing it with the spending, too. There's been more spending for Raphael Warnock than Herschel Walker. That said, it's still a lot of money floating around there, but it is and it's still tight. So they're really going --",

So we'll see if she says anything, but that's going to get media attention. But what's so striking, I was at the rally at the former President Barack Obama did in the week before the midterm, the first election here and it's used as an organizing tool.Yes, it's important to see the former president but there were clipboards, iPads, other things, people signing up, everyone who came to see him, they're going to be used as volunteers for the weekend to knock on doors, do fun working, et cetera. But there's only 24 hours left of voting at the end of the night of a -- of the early voting. So can everyone get in and early vote, at the same time, it's interesting.

But I did meet quite a few folks who voted for Brian Kemp, and then voted for Warnock for Senate or left that ticket blank because they didn't want to vote for either.
