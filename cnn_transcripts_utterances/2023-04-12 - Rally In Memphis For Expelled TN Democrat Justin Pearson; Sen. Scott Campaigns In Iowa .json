Right now, in Memphis, a rally is underway to support the expelled state lawmaker, Justin Pearson.He was one of three Democrats who faced expulsion from the Republican- dominated State House after they protested for gun reform in the chamber. And last week, the GOP super majority voted to kick Pearson and Justin Jones out of their seat. So on Monday, Jones was voted back into his seat, a temporary measure until a special election can be held. And in the next hour, we'll find out if Democrats can make it a two for two, a vote to give Pearson his job back on his -- back on the docket in Shelby County. CNN's Ryan Young is right there at the rally in Memphis right now. So, Ryan, what are you hearing amidst the crowd and the people who decided to come out and rally today?",

This crowd plans to march all the way to the Shelby County commission meeting where they all plan to sit inside and try to push Justin Pearson back in. I'm talking to people who live in this area. They believe Justin Pearson will get his seat back. This protest has lasted a little longer than what they expected. They're now going to march that mile to that commission meetings, so hopefully to get Pearson back in. Then the plan is to take it either by FedEx or by hand back to the state capital so we can have the swearing in moment again on the state capitol steps. Abby, this has played out so unbelievably, in terms of the rocket that these two young men have been on since this vote happened. You had the vice president show up here. You've had leaders from across the country talk about this movement. And then you had the governor of the state calling for common-sense gun laws. In the entire time, the push has -- pushed this crowd into being a multi-generational, multi-colored sort of combination of people. And now you're hearing folks talking about trying to vote to change the supermajority. All this. Abby, happening at a very historic place. This is the Lorraine Motel and, of course, with where Dr. king was killed. So the march is getting ready to start. We're going to walk up. In the next half hour or so, maybe even the next hour, we'll find out whether Justin Pearson will get his seat back -- Abby?",

That is notable because, earlier today, the Republican lawmaker launched a presidential exploratory committee, moving one step closer to formally entering the race for the 2024 Republican nomination. And in his announcement video, Scott said that he will not back down from defending conservative values. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): I know America is a land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. I know it because I've lived it. That's why it pains my soul to see the Biden liberals attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also because he's standing at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, the sight of where the Civil War first shots were fired. And he mentioned that in the first words of that statement. What do you make of that choice, positioning himself on this issue of race in a party that I think you would agree, is still predominantly white?",

There's Trump and then there's everybody else.And right now, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, and all the other names are in the everybody else, along with Ron DeSantis. And there's no question that Ron DeSantis is in a different polling universe right now than Senator Scott or Governor Haley or anyone else. So I think what the people in that other bucket are trying to do is emerge as the one. The one thing that's true is that fragmentation -- if Scott and Haley and DeSantis and Pence and Pompeo, Asa, and all these people stay in for a long time, that kind of fragmentation wi8ll almost guarantee Donald Trump the nomination. He's already going to be difficult to beat, even if it ever gets down to a one-on-one contest. So I think that other bucket, the non-Trump bucket, they've got to get down to one person. And you look, Tim Scott has the kind of message in candidate skills to make a go of it. But again, Ron DeSantis right now, in that bucket, is, by far and away, the leader of it. But that's what campaigns are for, to see who can rise up over a period of time.",

It means that the president's $46 billion drug budget that he proposed to Congress, some of that could be used to take a closer look into the role Xylazine is playing in the opioid crisis. And Dr. Gupta also told me that, right now, while we're looking at Xylazine, there could be other contaminants out there. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. RAHUL GUPTA, WHITE HOUSE DRUG CZAR: Xylazine is one of the contaminants in Fentanyl. But there could be others. So I think with declaration of emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit Xylazine and illicit Fentanyl that we're going to respond quickly.
