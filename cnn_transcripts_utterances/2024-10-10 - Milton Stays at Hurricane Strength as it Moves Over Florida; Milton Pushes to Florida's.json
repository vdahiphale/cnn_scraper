      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us. Top of the hour here. I'm Erica Hill in New York. My colleague, Victor Blackwell, is in Orlando, Florida, as we continue CNN's live breaking news coverage of Hurricane Milton.The storm itself weakening, but it is still packing a powerful punch as it makes its way east across Florida, now a category one hurricane, and bringing with it damaging winds and dangerous flooding. Nearly three million customers across the state are without power at this hour. Milton, of course, has been tearing across the state of Florida for hours now after making landfall last night near Siesta Key on the west side of the state, just to the south of Tampa and St. Petersburg. We are starting to get a sense of some of the damage left behind by Milton's destructive winds. The pictures that you're looking at right now, that's what's left of the roof on Tropicana Field. That's the home stadium of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. As you can see there, it is in tatters. This is the same stadium that had been prepped earlier in the week to be used as a base camp. You see all those cots there. It was set to be used as a base camp for emergency responders. Tampa's fire chief says the danger posed by Milton's winds have also prompted officials to stop emergency services until it is safe for first responders to be out there on the ground. And we showed you the roof damage there in St. Petersburg. There's more where that damage came from. Take a look at this. This is a crane. You see it there. It crashed into the side of the building and then also down onto a street. And that just gives you a sense of the power of these destructive winds and why the winds are such a major threat from this hurricane. And speaking of threats, the hurricane itself is spawning more than two dozen tornadoes across the state of Florida, including a number of them on the east side of the state. And this is long before Milton made landfall on the west side of Florida. In St. Lucie County, the sheriff there says there have been multiple fatalities after a tornado tore through a retirement community. We have reporters standing by in some of the hardest hit areas across Florida. I want to get straight, though, to CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam, who has a closer look at Milton's path at this hour. Derek, good morning.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica, we're just getting word that now over three million customers in the state of Florida are without power because of the force of Hurricane Milton. And this is all because of a combination of factors, not only the wind, but the tornadoes that swept through on the outer bands. You saw them on your TV screens just a moment ago.Every single hurricane that makes landfall in the U.S. has its own identity, its own character, characteristics, I should say. And I think when we look back at the history of Milton, we're going to see that, yes, storm surge was a component, but I believe that the tornado outbreak that precluded it, as well as the flash flood threat that is ongoing now, will also be a big part of this story. I mean, look at the rainfall totals here in St. Petersburg, 18 inches of rain, several inches of rain falling in a matter of an hour. So we have had over a foot of rain in Clearwater Beach, Tampa also receiving just shy of 10 inches of rain. And this has prompted the National Weather Service to issue this flash flood emergency. You can see parts of Hillsborough County included within this. This is all because the exact path of the storm brought the heaviest access of the rain right here. You can see it basically from Tampa Bay slicing through the Central Peninsula into the Orlando region before exiting off the East Coast. This is an area that we've seen over 10 inches of rain. This is a radar estimate, but you can see the totals I just showed you a moment ago have easily topped almost a foot and a half of rain, and it's still raining in many locations. So the eye now pulling off the East Coast of Florida as anticipated. So they're getting this onshore components along the Atlantic seaboard of Florida. You can see Daytona Beach gusting to 83 miles per hour. That's tropical storm force, though, in terms of the sustained winds at 62 miles per hour. The current National Hurricane Center update has this as a category one. So still a powerful storm, but it's going to exit very quickly this morning and we're going to be left with the cleanup efforts and also the flash flood that will be ongoing as so many inches of rain have fallen from this storm -- Erica.",

We're working diligently and trying to do search and rescue. Right now, as you can imagine, we have 50 mile per hour gusts, and it is quite dark.

But do you know if there were evacuations, if people left these mobile home communities, which are historically vulnerable to hurricanes and tornadoes ahead of the storm?LAMAR-SARNO: Well, we did not institute active evacuations. What we did instead is provided several shelter locations for the community to go and take shelter in some of our high schools in the area so that they had a place to go. And we encouraged that for the last 24 hours, I believe.",

LAMAR-SARNO: Sure. When we've had downed traffic lights, we've had homes hit with tornadoes. We have downed trees, downed power lines, water on the roads. Our rescue teams, our first responders are doing a great job, and we're doing a great job responding to that and continue to do so as we speak. Just trying to play it safe and make sure that everybody's staying safe out there. But those are some of the calls we're getting consistently, and we're still in it with the 50-mile-per-hour wind gusts.",

We just got an update from the National Weather Service of sustained winds of 82 miles per hour on the east coast of Florida along the Flagler and St. John's County line with gusts up to the lower 90s. So this is still a very strong storm at the edge of Florida as it moves off the coast.We are certainly still feeling the wind and rain here in central Florida as this storm continues to move eastward. I want to check back west though with my colleague Randi Kaye who has been in Sarasota throughout the entirety of the Hurricane Milton preparation and now through the storm. Randi, what are you seeing there and what are you hearing from local officials there, if anything? Here in Orlando, they're getting their police back on the roads to start to respond to some calls. Do you know if officials there, the police, fire rescue, are able to get out yet?",

We're still waiting to get an update from local authorities, where Randy is, about the severity of damage. But what do you know about Milton's effect on Venice? Tell us what's happening there. MAYOR NICK PACHOTA, VENICE, FLORIDA (via phone): Thanks for having me, Victor. So right now, we've got what they're called practical first-in teams. And they're going to be deploying out onto the streets to clear roadways. You have to think, there's a lot of downed trees, a lot of downed power lines, most of the areas without power. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to get those arterials cleared up, so that we can get responders in there to start doing assessments. It also isn't quite daybreak yet. So we've got to wait for a little bit of a light to help us kind of do some more of this hard work to get in and get the assessments done. But for right now, the tactical first-in teams, they'll get out on the streets, and they will start clearing the roadways so that we can start getting our responders out there.",

We tell everyone we want them to go, and we impress upon them the danger in staying behind, and that implies, you know, limited resources.We shut down our water supply to preserve the integrity of our infrastructure. So we did see probably within the last 24 to 48 hours, a significant increase in evacuations. We did fill up some of the shelters. I know the one closest to us was full. So I think that we saw a lot of people start to really heed that request there at the very last minute. You know, thankfully, you know, that we want to make sure to get everybody to a safe place.

And you being out on the roads right now only increases the potential for us to have to work harder to do rescues and take time away from clearing these roads so that we can get the necessary resources here to start getting the power grid and the utilities back up and running.

We heard from the mayor of Longboat Key, a bridge damage there as well. Of course, a crane, a crane down in St. Petersburg, Tropicana Field, the cover there, the roof blown off. So these are just the first reports of damage. And I'm seeing some green and blue flashing behind this hotel, which means a transformer blowing as we're seeing the wind and feeling the wind here in central Florida. We'll continue our live special coverage of Hurricane Milton after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
