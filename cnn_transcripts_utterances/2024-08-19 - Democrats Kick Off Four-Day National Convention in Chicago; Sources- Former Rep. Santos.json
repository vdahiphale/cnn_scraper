Let's get right to CNN's Brynn Gingras who joins us live from outside the courthouse Islip, New York. Brynn, what's happening in the courtroom?",

Our colleague Mark Morales inside that courtroom where you just said it, the former Republican Congressman expected to plead guilty to at least some of those 23 charges that were handed down to him from the U.S. Attorney's Office last year. Now listen, Boris, he, George Santos, has been adamant that he would never, ever, ever take a plea deal when these charges came down in two separate installments.Even last week when he was in court for a pretrial hearing, that trial expected to start just a couple of weeks from now when the U.S. Attorney essentially said they had dozens of witnesses that were going to come forward against him, he still maintained his innocence. So something has changed. Now we're not sure which charges he might be pleading guilty to. We're waiting for that. We don't know when sentencing could happen and we don't know what that punishment will look like. So those are all questions that we are waiting to find out. What we do know is that we expect him to give some sort of allocutions, some detailed explanation of what he is pleading guilty to. So we are, of course, waiting for that. But what a dramatic fall from grace from this former congressman of the third district here in New York. Of course, he has been charged with stealing the identities of donors and using that money to buy lavish things for himself. He's been accused of lying about his employment record so he could reap the benefits of some COVID benefits among a number of charges. So we'll see exactly what the U.S. Attorney's Office has to say. We possibly could hear from them as well as possibly George Santos once this hearing all wraps up. But we are standing by at the moment. Again, that is happening right now in the courtroom and we'll continue to bring the very latest -- Boris.",

Because the current policy, unfortunately, is that our government is sending weapons that the Israeli military is using to kill civilians, and that actually goes against both U.S. law and international law.So, as an uncommitted delegate, I am desperately trying to get the Harris campaign, the DNC leadership, to urge Vice President Harris herself to articulate a new approach on Gaza so that we can save lives and so that we can re-engage key voters in Michigan and in swing states across the country who need to hear an updated approach so that we can beat Donald Trump in November.",

And so what I want to hear from Vice President Harris is, if she doesn't support an arms embargo, then I want to know what she does support.And at the very least, I want her to support implementing existing U.S. and international law that prevents U.S. weapons from killing civilians. That's what's happening right now. It's illegal. It's immoral. Democratic voters don't want it to happen. And Democratic voters in Michigan, especially, 101,000 of us have raised our hand and said, this is a top issue for me. So as someone who desperately wants to beat Donald Trump, I was in the Capitol on January 6th. I was a Capitol Hill staffer. I know how dangerous he is and how dangerous his white supremacist agenda is. I want to beat Trump. I want to help Vice President Harris do that by urging her to adopt a policy that will allow for us to reengage those voters who feel deeply betrayed by the Democratic Party's support for the Israeli military killing civilians.",

I'm proud to be one of those Democrats for Palestinian rights.An outstanding request that we have with the DNC that we're hoping to hear back about, that we haven't heard back about yet, is that we need to see a Palestinian American leader speak from this stage. It's important that Palestinian American leaders are plenty of excellent Palestinian American leaders. Right here in Chicago, there's a state representative, Abdelnasser Rashid, who is a strong progressive leader who we need to hear from. Or Representative Ruwa Romman from Georgia. Or Representative Iman Jodeh from Colorado. Or delegate Sam Rasoul from Virginia. We've floated all of these names to the DNC, and we tell them, hey, these all would be excellent folks to hear from, from this stage, so that they can speak about their own experiences in this party and speak about the need to value Palestinian human rights. We haven't heard back yet from the DNC. We're hoping that they'll honor that request.",

Of course, you can watch all of it tonight right here on CNN. Poll after poll shows that after Biden dropped out of the race, his party has been re-energized by Harris' campaign.

And you see that Harris was down a point a month ago. And now nationally, she's up by three points. And more than that, Donald Trump has actually dropped back a little bit. It's not just that she's gaining from undecided voters. She's even taking a little bit of Donald Trump support. Definite momentum for her coming out of this, going into this convention.

But I think the clear thing that we should take away from this is she could be commanding a majority of the vote coming out of this convention.
