And just today, George Clooney writing in The New York Times about his change of heart toward President Biden, writing this: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'Big Effing Deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney, who co-hosted that fund-raiser that raised $14 million in Los Angeles three weeks ago, says that what Biden does not have on his side is time and that's something that cannot be reversed. And for his part, Rob Reiner saying this: \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country, but democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\" And then, this morning, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, saying to reporters that he is deeply concerned about Biden's prospect of winning in November after just in recent days saying that Joe Biden is the nominee and the Biden campaign putting that in a press release this morning. And, Boris, I have just learned from my own sources that organizers for a convention lunch in Chicago that would feature high-dollar donors, they have decided to scrap that event. It was a relatively small event in the grand scheme of things, but it captures the mood of the donor class right now, which is flashing bright red warning signs, especially in the deep blue part of the country, that many of these donors do not feel comfortable tapping their networks and asking them to max out when enthusiasm is waning and they're not sure what the convention will look like -- Boris.",

We cannot, in my view, we cannot allow the alliance to fall behind. The fact is that so many of my -- let me put it this way. I'm very pleased that, today, all NATO members are making the pledge to expand our industrial base and our industrial capacity, like our defense spending commitment. This is a critical step to maintaining our security, the first time ever every NATO nation is pledging to develop plans for defense production at home. That means, as an alliance, we will become more innovative and competitive. And we're able to produce more critical defense equipment more quickly than -- and we should, that we may need it. You know, we will not be surpassed, we cannot be surpassed by anyone when it comes to our readiness. Here at home, Americans have seen the power of investments like these. In my administration, we have already invested $30 billion in defense manufacturing to restart or expand production across 35 of our states. We're investing billions more, the result, stronger supply chains, a stronger economy, a stronger military, and a stronger nation. Let me close with this. This new pledge sends an unmistakable message to the world that every NATO member is committed to doing their part to keep the alliance strong. We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together. And that -- we're investing in our future strength to ensure NATO will always be ready for whatever threats we will face should be a clear message we're making to the -- sending to the world. So I want to thank you, every NATO member, for your commitment, for our shared security. And I will now ask the press to depart so we can get started. JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL:  Thank you very much, President Biden, for those remarks.",

At one point, the president seemed to try to get away from the scriptand very quickly changed his mind and veered right back into it. Obviously, this comes as there are a lot of questions about the president's mental acuity even from within his own party. So let's get the latest from CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox, who's with us on Capitol Hill, because, Lauren, today an eighth Democrat came forward essentially calling for the president to remove himself from the top of the ticket for the White House in November.",

Instead, what you are seeing is Democrats very carefully coming out, one by one, stating their position on the president. And, look, there is a minority, obviously, of Democrats who have outright come out and said that Biden needs to remove himself from the top of the ticket. There's also not that many Democrats who are just forcefully saying that Biden is the best person to beat Donald Trump. What you are finding is much more solidly in the middle ground, many Democrats making the case that Biden needs to make up his mind. What's interesting about that, of course, is the fact that Biden and his campaign have made clear that they have already chosen to stay in this race. But I think this is an interesting tap dance. I actually just talked with Senator Peter Welch of Vermont as I was walking over here and asked him. \"It seems like you keep saying you hope that Biden makes the right choice, but he's already stated what his position is.\" And here's what Welch said to me just moments ago -- quote -- \"I'm hoping the concerns that are being expressed are being heard, even if not yet acknowledged. I want him to look at the evidence and make a hard decision. He's earned that.\" And I think the last piece is really key here, because a lot of Democrats, they like Joe Biden, they believe in Joe Biden, they are proud of what they have been able to accomplish with Joe Biden. But here's Senator Joe Manchin laying out his view. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You have been very supportive of the president, but you say he needs to go out and show the American people he's up for another term. I'm curious, Congresswoman, do you agree with Speaker Pelosi -- with former Speaker Pelosi's comments this morning? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI):  Well, I haven't actually seen the actual comments or talked to her this morning, but my understanding of what she said was, Joe Biden's got to make the decision. And I am in total agreement. There's one person that can make this decision. That is Joe Biden. He's got to show the American people he's got the stamina, he's up to the job, and go out and do it. And I also think, from what I have heard, but in conversations, for 13 days, Donald Trump and the Republicans have loved watching every minute of this discussion, and we have got to get back, as a party, as leaders, talking about what's at stake in November, and doing the contrast in positions and what could happen if we do elect Donald Trump as president. And we have got to get back to that dialogue. The Republican Convention is next week. I can't -- their theme on Monday is make America wealthy again. I cannot wait to talk about the cuts he wants to give to the billionaire class and how he doesn't want to do anything for working men and women in this country.

But as long as we keep wringing our hands and letting this drama continue and not talking about the issues that are at stake and the future of this country for the next four years, that's what we have got to do, get back to talking about the substance. Joe Biden has said what he's going to do. If that's what he's truly going to do, he needs to put this to rest with leadership of the Congress, with the caucus. He needs to talk to everybody.

They look at the two options on the ballot as having a very different view of the U.S. role in this alliance, but also the U.S. role in the world, in Europe as relates to Russia, in Asia as relates to Taiwan, and China. They are looking at this election as an inflection point. And I will tell you that I heard quite the same going up to several months ago, right, even prior to the presidential debate, as they saw an election that was, at a minimum, quite tight. Now, in the wake of that debate, many folks in this room now increasingly doubt the chances that President Biden is reelected. So they're bracing for the possibility of an enormous change in the U.S. role in this alliance. Now, you will hear different views as to how big that change will be, whether, for instance, Trump might attempt to pull the U.S. out of NATO or just reduce its role. But big change is coming they see with this election. And that's why what you're seeing here really is a waiting game for what the effects of the election will be.",
