High Commissioner for Human Rights has also pointed out that grave human rights violations, many of which could amount to war crimes or other atrocity crimes, are being committed by both sides in this conflict. The Sudanese armed forces have also been involved in these violations including indiscriminate aerial bombing, so both sides are really showing complete disregard for the safety of civilians and indeed it's astonishing in a way that the situation in Sudan is receiving so little high-level international political attention. The U.N. humanitarian chief, humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths, warned the Security Council last Friday that five million people could face catastrophic hunger in some parts of the country over the coming months and for the first time the Security Council has finally adopted a resolution on Sudan calling for a truce during Ramadan, which has so far been ignored and also unhindered humanitarian access. And it's very concerning that the UN humanitarian response plan for Sudan is only five percent funded. It's really urgent that that funding gap is closed and also that donors start giving more direct financial support to the grassroots, first-line responders on the ground in the emergency response rooms.",

Now, another focus for President Biden while out west was trying to shore up support among Latino voters. Latino voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate in both Nevada and Arizona. The president traveled down to Arizona to launch the campaign's Latinos con Biden- Harris initiative. It's an organizing program to really try to mobilize Latino voters heading into November. The president needs to build up support with those groups at a time when former President Trump has really tried to make some inroads in the community, a coalition that typically has helped Democratic candidates.

General Mark Milley, the top U.S. general at the time, and GeneralFrank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said they pushed the State Department for plans around an emergency evacuation and ultimately pushed them to declare that, to order that NEO earlier and begin getting out Afghan civilians that had the ability to enter the U.S., as well as, of course, the embassy and American citizens who were in the country. McKenzie specifically said about a month earlier, in July 2021, he became concerned about the State Department's ability to carry out a NEO, a noncombatant evacuation operation. The order finally came on August 14th in the final days of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. One day later, leaders of the Afghan government fled the country. And then, of course, we all saw the final pictures of the U.S. withdrawal, including, of course, in the closing days, a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate to Kabul's International Airport that killed 13 U.S. service members. McKenzie and Milley essentially blasted the State Department and said that order to conduct the NEO should have come earlier. DOD was ready for it. They had planned for an evacuation, knowing it was a possibility. But the order itself had to come from state. GEN. KENNETH MCKENZIE, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND (RET.): Orders to commence the noncombatant evacuation operation, bringing out our embassy, our citizens and at-risk Afghans were received on 14 August. These dates are important because I believe that the events of mid and late August 2021 were the direct result of delaying the initiation of the NEO for several months. In fact, until we were in extremist and the Taliban had overrun the country. As you are aware, the decision to begin a NEO rests with the Department of State, not the Department of Defense.",
