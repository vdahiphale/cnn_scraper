Sanjay, are these all connected? Why is this happening? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This is kind of amazing. If you look at just the number of prescriptions that have gone out there, it's skyrocketed. These drugs have only been around a few years now, but just take a look at sort of what's happened over the past few years. Close to two percent of the population of this country has been prescribed this medication at some point. That's shocking. I mean, these are huge. And obviously, even around the world, this is prescribed a lot. As you prescribe more and more, you're not surprised to get more and more sort of accidental poisonings, overdoses, and things like that. But I want to show you something else that I think is important here. You started to see the numbers go up. In March of 2022, all the shortages started happening and what happened as a result? Pharmacies came in and they started making their own. They started making their own compounded sort of versions of this that were not tested for safety and efficacy. And you started to see the poisoning rates go up at that point as well. So that may be part of this. I think a lot of it also has to do with -- I don't know how many of you have actually seen the Ozempic pen. So this is it. You open it up, you put a needle on there, and then you dial in the dose that you're actually going to give yourself. You do that. So people starting to work with this may say hey, look, it's working. Let me give myself more and more of this.",

What this is doing -- that hormone is called GLP- 1. That this drug is doing is saying let me just sort of make the body make that hormone so the body thinks it has just eaten. So that's essentially -- you feel full. You don't have an appetite. That's how it works.It also slows down the intestines so you're not moving things as long -- as well, and that's why you feel full also. And as a result, these are the sorts of symptoms that people might have as a result of having all of what I just described work too well. That's sort of the issue.",
