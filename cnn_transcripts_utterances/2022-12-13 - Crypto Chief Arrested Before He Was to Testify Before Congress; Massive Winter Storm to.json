U.S. Attorney Damian Williams confirming the arrest was based on a sealed indictment filed by the Southern District of New York. A person familiar with the matter tells \"The New York Times\" the charges against the 30-year-old former billionaire include wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering. And the SEC is now saying they, too, have \"authorized separate charges relating to his violations of securities laws.\" Bankman-Fried once considered one of the most powerful figures in crypto before his company suffered a liquidity crisis and filed for bankruptcy last month, leaving at least a million people without access to their funds.

I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was. ROMANS (voice-over): The former FTX CEO teamed up with a slew of high- profile celebrities and TV ads in Super Bowl commercials promoting crypto. The key question for investigators: whether FTX misappropriated customer funds when it made loans to Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, Alameda Research. FTX's new CEO, John Ray, paints a picture of a crypto empire with virtually no corporate controls and a shocking lack of financial and other recordkeeping. Ray, who is set to testify today before the House Financial Services Committee, wrote in a prepared statement the collapse of FTX is due to power left \"in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals.\" BANKMAN-FRIED: There was no person who was chiefly in charge of positional (UNINTELLIGIBLE) customers on FTX, and that feels pretty embarrassing in retrospect.
