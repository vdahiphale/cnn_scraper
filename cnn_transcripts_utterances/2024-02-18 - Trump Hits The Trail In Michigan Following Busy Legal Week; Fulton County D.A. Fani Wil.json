I want to bring our panel back to talk more, because interestingly this morning, we heard Liz Cheney direct a sort of line of comments at Speaker Johnson about this Ukraine package. And I thought it was very pointed and interesting. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Mike Johnson ought to search deep in his conscience, understanding exactly what's happening, the slaughter that's happening in Ukraine today, the extent to which the Ukrainians are on the front lines in this battle for freedom. And history will look back at this moment and ask, what did Mike Johnson do? (END VIDEO CLIP)",
