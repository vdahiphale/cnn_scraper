Tonight, shockingscenes in Brazil after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro storm the country's congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court. We have a live update from Sao Paulo just ahead. Plus, heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine as Russia claims to capture key territory near Bakhmut. And accusations are flying as Britain's Prince Harry previews his tell-all memoir. What we're learning ahead of this highly anticipated release. We begin with the fallout from what's being called a terrorist attack on the fourth largest democracy in the world. Brazil's president is back at work today in a vandalized presidential palace, determined to show political stability after a mob stormed all three seats of power. Many are comparing the riots in Brasilia to what happened in the U.S. on January 6th, that insurrection. But a spokesperson for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says they, as in what happened in Brazil, was even worse. Incredible. Supporters of former leader Jair Bolsonaro overran the presidential palace, congress and the Supreme Court on Sunday, claiming the recent election he lost was rigged. Officials say at least 70 people were injured, hundreds were arrested. Security forces have now dismantled a protest camp of Bolsonaro supporters, saying that it was used as a de facto headquarters for the attacks. Bolsonaro, who is currently in the U.S., says the pillaging and invasions of public buildings crossed the line. Yet, critics though accuse him of essentially laying the groundwork for months with his repeated claims of fraud. Our Rafael Romo has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over):  Brazil boiling over. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed key buildings in the country's capital, Sunday, breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country's seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil's flag, yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a run-off election last October where he lost by less than 2 percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least, one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil's congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago described the events as barbaric, and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, PRESIDENT, BRAZIL (through translator):  Those people that we call fascists, we call them everything that's abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters and they invaded the congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path.",

In fact, since the attacks on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, analysts have been saying that there is a high risk that something similar could occur in Brazil. Bolsonaro is clearly inspired by Trump, and after the attacks in Washington, Trump's son actually said that, quote, \"with better planning, the invaders could have achieved their aims.\" So there is clearly rooting for the attackers back then. Bolsonaro has not accepted explicitly the legitimacy of the Biden government in order to produce this narrative that without presenting any evidence that the elections were rigged. And he has not really done enough to defuse the sentiment among many of his supporters, that he should remain in power. And thousands of Bolsonaro protesters have explicitly called for military coup in Brasilia over the past weeks. So it's quite evident that there was a risk that, that could happen. And when yesterday, protesters began to march for several miles, the police and the armed forces could have certainly done more to prevent this from happening. So I think a lot of evidence suggests that there may have been connivance, or at least tacit support for the attackers.",

People say that he may have done thatto create sort of a plausible deniability, in saying, well I was not in the country, I can't really support -- I can't really control my supporters. But I mean, over the past years, he has fanned the flames of polarization, has consistently said that the electoral -- the voting system in Brazil is vulnerable. And that has led to a profound sense of chaos among many of his supporters who were unsure whether they could trust the vote. So in a sense, the quality of public debates and discourse has deteriorated quite significantly over the past years. So, I think he is clearly the central figure in this. Now, investigations will begin now as to how to address the problems that the protesters or attacks reveal. Because this is also a symptom, not only of millions of Brazilians who think that Lula is not the legitimate president, but also of profound anti-democratic sentiments in the military police and the armed forces. And I think that will be one of the key challenges that Lula will have to face now that he is president.",

They're all going to be having a regional summit. Migration concerns, of course, top of the agenda as the U.S. faces a record-breaking surge of crossings at its southern border with Mexico. Our White House correspondent MJ Lee is in Mexico City. So MJ, just walk us through what President Biden hopes to achieve.

He arrived here last night in Mexico City, and then this evening right behind me at the national palace, he is going to have his bilateral meeting with the Mexican president. And then the two leaders will be joined by the Canadian prime minister for a ceremonial dinner. You know, obviously, this is the first time that the U.S. President has visited Mexico since 2014. And the U.S.-Mexico relationship has been really fraught at times, particularly during the Trump administration. So, you can definitely expect that President Biden and the Mexican president, when they are together, they will try to highlight areas of cooperation between the two countries, the fact that there is goodwill between the two countries. But you are right that the issue of migration is going to be top of mind for the two leaders, and it is an incredibly a complicated issue for the two countries. Take for example, the fact that just this last week, the Biden administration announced a new immigration policy, an expansion of the so- called Title 42 program. And a part of that agreement was Mexico agreeing to accept up to 30,000 migrants back into Mexico. People that are rejected at the U.S. border coming from poor countries. And that really sort of highlighted the political reality for U.S. President Biden, that this is an issue, the record number of migrants trying to go into the U.S. border. That it is a problem that he simply cannot solve on his own. He needs partners like Mexico to try to keep the situation under control. He of course, has also called on the U.S. Congress to take action and take on comprehensive immigration reform. Which is, as you know very well, has been incredibly elusive in Washington D.C. And then I think you make a really good point, that, you know, yesterday, when the president went to the U.S. southern border for the first time, he went to El Paso, Texas. This was a trip that was meant to show the president sort of taking in with his own eyes what the situation is. But the optics ended up being very delicate and fraught there too, and ultimately, he ended up not seeing or meeting with any of the migrants at the border and sort of seeing some of the images that our colleagues have been reporting on at the U.S. southern border for the last several weeks.",

This is the only goodbye Mohammad Mehdi Karami's family got. No final visit, no justice. The 21- year-old Kurdish Iranian karate champion was executed by the Islamic Republic this weekend, along with Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a volunteer children's coach. They were convicted of killing a member of Iran's Basij paramilitary force during a protest in November. Death sentences handed down after what rights groups say are sham trials based on forced confessions extracted under torture. Karami's parents had taken the risk of speaking out in social media recordings, begging the state to spare their boy's life. The ruthless Republic has shown no mercy. At least for young men hanged, many others facing execution by a regime that appears to be using the death penalty to crush dissent. Among them 19-year-old Mohammad Boroughani and 22-year-old Mohammad Ghobadlou sentenced to death by this notorious judge, Abolqasem Salavati, nicknamed the Judge of Death, sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019 for harsh sentences he's issued activists, journalists, and political prisoners. On Sunday night, a crowd gathered outside the prison where Ghobadlou and Boroughani are being held after activists reported their execution was imminent. Seems of sheer bravery as the crowd Chant against the regime, in support Ghobadlou's mother, risking it all to try and save her son. No one really knows how many protesters have been sentenced to death, more than 40 according to CNN's count, but the real number is believed to be higher. And this past week, new sentences were reported by activists. Mansur Dehmardeh, a disabled member of the Baluch minority, was sentenced to death, one of many arrested during these ongoing raging protests in the city of Zahedan. Activists are urging the international community to do more than just condemn these executions to try and save the defenseless on death row to save their families from this unimaginable pain.

What this plane does is overcome the tremendousforce that it takes for a rocket to get through the lower levels of atmosphere. And then, when it reaches launching altitude of about 35,000 feet about an hour into the flight, it will angle up to almost 30 degrees, then it will drop this rocket away. It's about 70 feet long, they'll drop it away. And about four seconds after it drops away, it will ignite and jump forward to about 8,000 miles an hour. This is a technically difficult maneuver and the plane has to peel away to make sure it's not caught up and all of that. But once that happens, it will fly down toward Portugal, then down to Antarctica. And then it will set up these satellites in what's called a heliosynchronous orbit, meaning basically they will, for example, pass over London at the same time every day or over Los Angeles at the same time every time they pass over so they're matching up with where the sun is. So, if you want to get pictures, you want imaging, you want something to compare day after day after day, that's what use this kind of orbit for.

The idea that they can go to all sorts of places that have an airport and say, hey, if we can launch our jumbo jet here with some support, we can launch a space mission from your country from an airport. That's really unusual and hasn't been done before. So, this could open the door for many others to get out there and get into the space game. If, if, and I say this not as a warning but as a simple fact, if it works, they've launched this six times, five of them successfully, every time, it's been out at Mojave Desert here in the United States. This is the first one they've tried away from their home base. This remains technically a very, very challenging thing to do.
