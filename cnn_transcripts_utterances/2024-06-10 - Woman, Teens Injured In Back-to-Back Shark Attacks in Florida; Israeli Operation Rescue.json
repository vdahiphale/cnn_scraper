New warnings, this morning, from North Korea, as tensions with South Korea escalate overnight. North Korea sent balloons filled with trash across the border. That was in response to what it calls psychological warfare by South Korea. South Korea announced it will resume broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda in border regions.

Three people were injured in two incidents in Florida on Friday, and a man died in Hawaii on Saturday.This is what we know. Authorities say, a 39 year old man died, after what they describe, as a shark encounter off the coast of Maui, the first fatal attack in Hawaii since a snorkeler died there in 2022. The day before, two separate attacks happened in Florida in an area between Destin and Panama City Beach in the span of less than 90 minutes and only about 4 miles apart. According to authorities, a 45 year old woman suffered significant trauma to her midsection and pelvic area, as well as the amputation of her left lower arm. In the second attack, the victims were two girls between the ages of 15 and 17. The first victim suffered what officials described as significant injuries to one upper and one lower extremity, both requiring the application of tourniquets. The second victim has minor wounds to her right foot. Walton County officials said what happened is both tragic and terrifying, but historically, shark attacks are exceedingly rare.

It's expected that this could impact about 750,000 to 800,000 undocumented immigrants at this moment. And it comes as it could potentially appeal to Latino voters in states like Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia. But this also comes as the administration is trying to shore up support not just with Latinos, but also progressives and immigration advocates. Many groups expressed frustration with President Biden's executive action last week that essentially shut off the asylum process for undocumented immigration immigrants who are coming to the country illegally when a certain daily threshold is met. You've heard progressives who said that that is similar to policies that were adopted during the Trump era. And groups like the ACLU have threatened to sue the administration to try to stop this.
