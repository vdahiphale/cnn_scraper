Because that is the problem. And I do think that that is the issue that women often have to face when they're in positions of power. Are you too scary? Are you going too hard? She did a very good job. I would say at the beginning of her speech, I thought it was kind of meandering because we were re-introducing her to a country that should have already known her.

And we have gotten an influx of folks who have been applying to be a part of that and volunteers who want to do this work on the ground and a lot of this comes from the vice president and the fact that her authenticity and her calls to action really hit home for people across the country.  A few days after she became are presumptive nominee, I went to Las Vegas, Nevada for a few office openings as a surrogate. You get a memo that tells you a little bit about the event and said, each event will have a hundred people. I show up and there's 450 people at the first one. I had to speak to three overflow rooms. I started working in politics at the age of 18 as a field organizer, you know, to be honest, most of the time, a room full of volunteers skews a little older, but when I was in those rooms, it was truly diverse.
