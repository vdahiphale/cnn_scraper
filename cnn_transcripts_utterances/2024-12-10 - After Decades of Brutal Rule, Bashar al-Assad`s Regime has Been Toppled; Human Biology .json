Protests demanding change spread across Syria in early 2011. The regime cracked down turning peaceful protest into slaughter. The U.N. found what it called massive evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity. Responsibility at the highest level of government including the head of state. The chaos spawned countless local militias and opposition forces. In the mayhem, the ultraviolent Islamist group ISIS gained a temporary foothold spewing its nihilistic terror over the border into Iraq. U.S. and Iraqi forces confronted and ultimately crushed them but didn`t challenge Assad`s brutal authority. Russia, too, joined the fight. Assad and his allies Hezbollah from Lebanon, an Iranian militia, were losing ground, committing more forces than any other country with barbaric internationally condemned ground and air assaults. Russia turned the tide in Assad`s favor. But when Russia`s forces went to war in Ukraine in 2022, the clock on Assad`s rule began ticking down. By late 2024, his other main allies, Iran and Hezbollah, were bloodied by over a year long war with Israel. Assad`s fortunes plummeted. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Answer is Venus, where one day is 5,832 hours long. To space news now, where more and more people will be traveling as commercial space missions only continue to advance, with many future missions planned for new frontiers like Mars, scientists are focusing their research on the effects of space on human biology, and especially on how it ages the human body. CNN`s Nick Valencia gives us a look at the self-contained experiments scientists are monitoring in space. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the spirit of exploration, outer space may hold the answer to some of humanity`s greatest questions. What causes aging and can the process be altered? Human tissue samples called organoids are now in orbit at the International Space Station, and identical samples are back on Earth at Oxford University`s Space Innovation Lab. This experiment will allow researchers to compare and analyze data from both samples to study the aging process and the impact of microgravity on it. Inside the International Space Station, a box containing human tissue samples serves as a controlled environment.",
