The court will hear arguments in late April and that means a trial date before the November election really now in serious doubt.We have CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider with us now on this. A lower court, the DC Circuit of Appeals unanimously striking down Trump's immunity claim. So why do you think the Supreme Court has decided to go this route?",

They haven't weighed in on whether a president can be immune from criminal prosecution based on alleged official acts.And that's really what they've narrowed this question down that they're going to be addressing the week of April 22nd to. You know, were these alleged official acts? That's what the president's team has insisted on, that the president or the former President Donald Trump was acting in his official capacity all around the January 6th Capitol attacks. Jack Smith's office had repeatedly said, no, those weren't official acts and you're not immune from prosecution. So it is a very important question that the Supreme Court has never addressed, never settled. They'll do that this year.",

Remember, initially, the judge in this case set the beginning of this trial for March 4th. That would have been Monday.Obviously, that's not happening. That's all on hold. And it's going to get pushed back significantly. The court will hear those sometime the week of April 22nd, they likely won't issue a decision until mid late June. And then even then, the judge in this case had said, even when I get the green light to proceed, we're still going to need probably about three months to go over pretrial motions. So three months before really the trial could start, which would put this likely in late September as the earliest that this case would start.

I want to get your perspective on the phrasing of the central question that the Supreme Court has decided to take up. But let's actually look at it.It says, quote, whether and if so, to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office? Does that give you any indication, any window into how the justices are already thinking about this case?",

And then there's going to be all the usual stuff you do before a trial. And as you know, you and your reporter discussed a moment ago -- Brianna did. Realistically, there's all sorts of motions and limiting and jury instructions and other issues before a trial. I just do not see Judge Chutkan pushing forward with a trial in, let's say, late September, early October, that could potentially stretch all the way up until the, you know, eve of election until early November. I don't see that happening. Is it possible? I suppose. But I wouldn't bet on it. And I don't think your viewers should expect that that's going to happen.",

It exploded to become the largest wildfire that Texas has ever seen and the second largest on record nationwide. It has killed at least one woman, an 83-year-old grandmother. And at nearly 1.1 million acres, the Smokehouse Creek fire surpassed the 2006 East Amarillo Complex fire, which also scorched the Texas Panhandle.

She is one of the many residents here in Fritch, Texas, who are left picking up the pieces of their lives. I should note that 2006 fire that you mentioned also devastated this area. So they are going through this again. We met one gentleman yesterday. His name is Danny Williams. He's a 30- year resident of Fritch, Texas. He was home when that fire rolled through on Tuesday and described the terrifying moments. He even shared some of the video that he shot of those terrifying moments when the flames went down the street, you know, as he tried to get away to safety. Now, his home was miraculously somehow unscathed in all of this. But the four homes across the street, his neighbors, his close friends by now, completely damaged. He also described jumping into action when the flames came through, running across the street to his friend, his neighbor, also named Danny, knocking on the door, getting that man to safety. Danny survived. His home completely destroyed. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We are expecting wind gusts of up to 30 miles an hour.And that could completely hamper firefighting efforts. And it could also get those small outstanding blazes that weren't put out to spread.

      "sentences": "Happy Leap Day. February 29th only happens once every four years, so it is kind of special. Lots of people and businesses celebrate Leap Day in different ways, but this extra day always triggers questions about why it happens and when it was created.Joining us now for answers is Bill Nye the Science Guy. Bill, great to see you. Thanks for sharing part of your afternoon with us. What's the math and the science behind leap years? Why do we even have them? BILL NYE, \"THE SCIENCE GUY\": It has to do with how many times the Earth spins or how many times it orbits the sun. So let's say that this is the sun and this is the Earth. The Earth is spinning. As many of you know, I've met people in the United States very recently who think the Earth might be flat. Earth's not flat, everybody. Anyway, the Earth is spinning, going around the sun. You might presume that it would spin an even number of times for every time it goes around the sun. Our moon spins once for every time it orbits Earth, but this is not the case with the Earth and the sun, and it's largely due to the friction of tides in the ocean and so on and the action of the moon. But with this in mind, people realized that they could add a day now and then to make the calendar correspond to the number of spins of the Earth. And this seemed like a great idea for the first 1,500 years of the modern era. But when you add a quarter of a day every year, so that every four years you're adding a day, you're adding about 11 minutes, 14 seconds too much time. In other words, as the Earth goes around the sun, instead of presuming it's here -- instead of presuming it's here, the Earth is actually there, not quite as far by 11 minutes and 14 seconds. And this was figured out in 1582. Who could forget? Pope Gregory XIII specified October 4th was followed by October 15th. So if you were a landlord, this is great. You owe me another month. If you're a tenant, no, I don't. And so, there were literally wars about it. Now, understand, everybody, the astronomical situation. Nowadays, we use the constellation Pisces so that we observe it when it's on the other side of the sun from us. Now, if you are astrological, if you're in Pisces, it means the sun rose through the constellation Pisces. By the way, this is not to scale, by the way.",
