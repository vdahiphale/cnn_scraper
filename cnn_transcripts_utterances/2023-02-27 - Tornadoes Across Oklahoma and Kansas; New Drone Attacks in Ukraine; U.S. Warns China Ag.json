This after severe storms ripped across Oklahoma and parts of the central U.S. This morning, more than 50,000 without power in the region. At least nine tornadoes touching down in Oklahoma and Kansas. Wind gusts equivalent to a category three hurricane, about 120 miles an hour battering Texas. Ahead, the latest on the storm's and what's to come. Plus, at least two people are dead, three others wounded after a drone attack in Ukraine. This as the U.S. is now warning that China will face penalties if Beijing provides Russia with drones and ammunition, as U.S. intelligence indicates, to aid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. We do begin this hour with the latest on those severe storms and tornadoes. CNN's senior national correspondent Ed Lavandera, he's in Norman, Oklahoma. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers standing by with the latest forecast. We do want to begin with you, Ed. You know, some pictures there, just alarming. Tell us what you're seeing on the ground.",

The good news is, no deaths being reported in the various storms that were dropping out of the sky throughout much of the night.We are in Norman, Oklahoma. This is where one of the confirmed tornadoes touched down. The sun is out. Residents are now starting to come out of their homes, or come back into the neighborhood, to begin the cleanup process and to really kind of assess the magnitude of the damage here. And you can see just how ferocious the winds and the debris flying through the air, smashing car windows. This piece of plywood stuck in the tree is -- was ripped off of a home somewhere around here. And it is just stunning to see the site for -- in many of these homes. There's cars flipped over a few blocks away from where we were. We were just at one house a little while ago that had the entire back part of the house ripped off. The refrigerator was in the backyard. Just, you know, stunning sights. And this was a neighborhood that took a direct hit from this tornado that touched down here in the Norman, Oklahoma, area, just south of the Oklahoma City area. But this was a storm line, Jim, as you mentioned, that really started kind of in the Texas panhandle and just blew through the state last night. It was moving incredibly quickly. You talk about the wind. There was 114-mile-per-hour wind gusts measured in the Texas panhandle town of Memphis, Texas. And all of that system moving through here. So, it was a treacherous, dangerous night for many people here as they are beginning the cleanup process. And, of course, this is a rare outbreak of tornadoes in February. This is the kind of scene and site that people here in Oklahoma are used to seeing in late April, in May, perhaps into early June. But this is just kind of the way things are right now when it comes to these weather patterns, the intensity and the ferociousness of the storm, I think, is still very staggering for many residents here to kind of comprehend.

I mean, I think we're just moving spring a little bit farther and farther into the end of winter as we begin to warm the climate. That's just -- we're just going to see this. We're going to see the progression of the severe weather start from the south earlier in the year, move to the north earlier in the year.We've had about nine tornadoes. I think some of them may be the same tornado reported in two different towns. But now this system has moved past St. Louis, into Indiana and also into Ohio for today. Not the same type of ferociousness we had yesterday. Jim, those storms were moving at 85 miles per hour. Not the wind generated, the storm itself, many of them, moving 85 miles per hour from the southwest to the northeast, giving those residents only minutes worth of warning. Even though the Weather Service was putting these warnings out, mile after mile ahead of the storm, the storms were just moving so very, very quickly yesterday. There's your threat of severe weather. Maybe a little bit of a tornado threat into parts of Ohio, especially around Columbus. Central Ohio. The Scioto River Valley. [09:05:01] But then the snow comes in for New York City. Yes, I said snow. And even for Boston, it could be two to four inches in those cities by morning, making a slow commute certainly for the people there. Part of the cold on the one side, the warm on the other. They don't like to mix. You shake the oil and vinegar dressing together.

There's (INAUDIBLE) saying firmly that they are sending what they believe Ukraine needs for this fight right now. Not necessarily everything that Ukraine wants.

But over the course of (INAUDIBLE) President Biden here, two different U.S. aid packages totaling around $2.5 billion with what the U.S. believes that Ukraine needs for this fight right now. That is primarily going to be artillery ammunition, more artillery pieces (INAUDIBLE) the famous HIMARS (INAUDIBLE) javelins to shoot tanks.

I wonder, when you look at this consideration by China, according to the U.S. assessment, what do you believe China's aim is here? Does it see an opportunity to bog down the U.S. and its allies in this war? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jim, good morning. I think that's exactly what they're trying to do here. We have to keep in mind that China and Russia both are looking at this in a very different way, through a very different lens than we are. And what that really means is that they want to create a different world order than what currently exists. So, what the China and the Russians both are looking at is, they want a world order in which they are the more dominant players. And when you move that into Ukraine, this is the theater that this conflict has gotten hot in, and you see that, you know, in the area around Bakhmut and Wilidar (ph) and all these other areas, there is a movement to really bring the mass of the Russian forces forward. And all the offensive operations that they're doing could really benefit from a Chinese resupply effort. And if that happens, that would be a considerable escalation. It would also provide the Russians with a lot more firepower than they currently enjoy.",

They're starting to move in from Poland and the Swedes have indicated that they're going to be providing some as well in short order. So, that means that the training has progressed quite a bit. It also means that on the battlefield the Ukrainians will have some tanks, but they won't be nearly the 300 to 500 that the Ukrainians have actually asked for. That will come eventually. But it's not going to be there in time for a major offensive to benefit from them, a major counteroffensive from the Ukrainian side. So that's -- it's really a dueling clock situation. The Russians have one set of clocks, the Ukrainians have another. And the Russian one is dominating at the moment.",

However, the -- of all the theories that they have examined, they believe that this is the most compelling one. Now, that intelligence, of course, was shared with the entire intelligence community and it did not cause other agencies to change their assessments. Notably, of course, the CIA still has not come to a conclusion one way or the other about how this virus originated. But, you know, ultimately, the U.S. intelligence community has said before that it's going to be very difficult to come to a definitive conclusion about how this pandemic started without that robust cooperation from Beijing, which they have not gotten to date. It has been very difficult, as we know, for scientists and for the international community to kind of gain access to that original site in Wuhan where it is believed that the pandemic did begin. And according to a 2021 intelligence report, the data that the U.S. has been studying from afar just likely is not going to be sufficient to come to a definitive conclusion about the origins of this pandemic, Jim.",

It is a mess in East Palestine, but officials there from the EPA, to the state government, to the county government, to the city, all of them now working seemingly in conjunction to try to figure out how to clean this thing up.
