And he understands, meaning the judge, understands that someone who's going to cooperate doesn't have clean hands. Someone who's immersed in the swamp of dirtiness and corruption, if true, if true, is someone who is going to be potentially responsible and have baggage.So, I - you know, it's valuable to cross-examine, and you should cross-examine Cohen on these - this -- his history that he lied and perpetrated other crimes.

Very few weather models that meteorologists look to actually picked up on the rapid intensification that it actually went through in a 24-hour period.It was impressive. It took advantage of a very narrow swath of ocean warm temperatures at about 88 degrees Fahrenheit. And that's significant because for rapid intensification to carry on, it actually needs to be 80 degrees or higher. And it found just that water and strengthened rapidly, 165 miles per hour. This is the first category five landfall to impact the eastern Pacific. The strongest storm to strike the Pacific coastline of Mexico. And the fastest 12-hour rapid intensification for this area. It is that 12-hour window where it rewrote the history books, rapidly intensifying by 90 miles per hour. But the overall picture in a 24- hour period, 115-mile-per-hour strengthening. That is incredible. Mind-boggling to be quite honest. Acapulco, not only a tourist destination, but it has a residency of about 1 million people. So with a direct hit like this over a major metropolitan area, we're starting to see the first visuals of the damage that was left behind, not only by the wind, but also the storm surge. It's a category two now. It is weakening rapidly. One hundred and ten mile per hour winds. That is starting to interact with the mountainous terrain of the Geraros (ph) state. It will rain itself out. But the damage has already been done. Taking people by surprise and taking the meteorological community by surprise, as well. This was not really forecast to happen. It blew up from a tropical storm to a monster in a period of 24 hours. This is the new normal that we're getting used to here, John, climate change and the fingerprints written all over it.",
