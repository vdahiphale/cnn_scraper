Hunter Biden is back in court and the first witness in his federal gun trial is on the stand. Plus, the new Wall Street Journal article on President Biden's fitness for office, how the White House is responding. And you are looking at live pictures from NASA. In this hour, Boeing will make its third attempt to launch two astronauts aboard its first ever Starliner rocket to the International Space Station. We will bring you the launch live. But, first, witness testimony is underway on day three of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial. Yesterday, prosecutors used Biden's own words against him. They played portions of an audio book of his 2021 memoir. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON:  I possessed a new superpower, the ability to find crack in any town at any time, no matter how unfamiliar the terrain. It was easy.

      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, we just saw just a short while ago, Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden's ex-wife, arrive in court. We expect that she is going to be the next witness after the defense has finished cross examining the FBI agent who the prosecution has used to establish a lot of that evidence that you just talked about. They introduced the infamous laptop. They showed pictures and video. They showed text messages from people who they say he bought drugs from. They showed the gun. They showed drug paraphernalia, crack pipe, all of that displayed in a very large screen for the jury to see.And the prosecution is trying to use all of this to overwhelm jurors really with what their point is, which is that Hunter Biden knew he was struggling with addiction. There were eight times that he was in and out of addiction centers and rehab centers over the course of four years. And so he should have known when he filled out the form in October 12th of 2018 that he did not qualify to buy that gun. The defense is still cross-examining the FBI agent. And one of the things they're driving home for the jurors is that the prosecution doesn't have any evidence that on the day he bought that firearm that he was using drugs that day. As a matter of fact, all these text messages, all of the -- a lot of the evidence that they have is from weeks and months before and after the purchase of the gun. So, as you can tell from Abbe Lowell's -- the defense attorney's point, the prosecution has not proved their case. And so we expect that Kathleen Buhle is going to be the next witness. She will talk a lot about that drug evidence that is part of this case. Alisyn.",

The bottom line is that you cannot have a weapon -- you cannot lie with respect to having a weapon in the event that you're addicted, you're not supposed to have it. If you have an addiction, you check a box, that's lying because you are addicted, according to him, right? And so, ultimately, at the end of the day, it's simple for them.From a defense perspective, they're leaning into a whole bunch of other things in terms of what I just spoke about and whether or not at the specific time at issue he was actually addicted. And if he wasn't, then he shouldn't be convicted, according to the defense. We'll see whether or not that plays out and whether or not the jury ultimately accepts that argument. Remember, very briefly, the jury, largely African-American, the jury from Delaware, and the jury getting a very good dose of the issue of addiction and what it does to people and how it changes their minds, attitudes, and points of view.",

So, if you believe in states' rights, except when a jury in that state convicts your nominee for president, you might be in a cult. If you claim you back the blue but want to defund the police when the police go to your nominee's house to retrieve national security secrets, you might be in a cult.

And you could have asked him anything. He works on ending gun violence, and instead they showed themselves as only being interested in defending Donald Trump.And I just thought it's quite crazy that you would look at 34 felony convictions, by the way, the real number is 408, because 12 jurors 34 times decided he was guilty. So, you would look at that as a victory, and that you would try and use the attorney general to make some point about a conspiracy you think that DOJ isn't on with the state of New York.

Once they get the audiotape, then they're going to want the videotape. Once they get the video tape, they're going to want them to be polygraphed.

And Alisyn, we've seen this before because this is how swift removals happen. But, literally, it's happening right now.And I want to set the scene for you because this is the Hidalgo port of entry it. What you see is the crossing from Hidalgo, Texas to Mexico. Now, in the distance, beyond the cars that are crossing into Mexico is a white bus. That white bus arrived moments ago. And from talking to one of the agents on scene, he explained to me that this bus with migrants, and these migrants are going to be swiftly returned back to Mexico. Now, this is the first time that we've seen here on the border of what could be the first actions of Biden's executive order actually going into play, actually being seen on the border with the swift deportations. Now, we've seen this before. We saw it back in 2021, and that's one of the reasons why, Alisyn, we wanted to be live here at this port of entry because we've seen how these swift removals happen. Now, there's a lot of nuance here that I've got to get into, and that is because the number of migrant apprehensions at the U.S. southern border is above that 2,500 threshold. What happens is whenever migrants cross the border illegally, they are still processed, they are still fingerprinted, background checks are still happening, to make sure that there's no national security threats. But if that migrant does not express fear, then that migrant is very swiftly removed. And, Alisyn, those swift removals This is what we're seeing right now. That white bus that is filled with migrants are -- they're going to walk back into Mexico. They're going to be escorted back into Mexico. And, again, this is happening a lot faster because of this executive order. What could take days, weeks, months before, it's happening very quickly right now, because of this executive order.

ART DEL CUETO, V.P., NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Well, I mean, first and foremost, it doesn't do enough of what it should do, right? They put a limit on the numbers, but, realistically, what needs to be done is everyone coming across should be detained. Yes, everyone coming across should have their day in court, and they should look at the asylum claims if they truly have one. But you need to do that while detaining them, not by releasing people. In addition this, bill, it exempts child trafficking, if you look at it. Look, we've been down here on the line. We've seen this for decades. A lot of these unaccompanied juveniles, many of them being 16 and 17 years old, they're going to continue to come, and those are the things that are exploited by the criminal cartels, by the smuggling organizations.
