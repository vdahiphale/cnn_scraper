Israeli Defense Forces now claim they have killed a Hamas commander amid a barrage of 250 strikes in Gaza today. It comes eight days after Hamas terrorists brutally slaughtered and kidnapped hundreds of innocent Israeli citizens. The death toll from those attacks has now grown to include 30 Americans among the more than 1400 killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has invited President Biden to visit Israel as Israeli forces prepare for a ground offensive. And I'm joined now by my colleague Erin Burnett live in Tel Aviv for us. Erin, what's the situation on your end right now?",

Those airstrikes just today, and they say another Hamas senior commander was killed in those strikes today. The IDF spokesperson just joined us, Jim, obviously saying that they've killed about 10 senior Hamas members thus far since the beginning of this war, but that there are many more to come. Still calling them dead men walking, which I think reflects still the sense of revenge and quiet rage, which is so palpable in this country where things are essentially still at a standstill, while they're waiting, waiting for something to happen. And of course the U.S. secretary of state will be coming in to the country again to meet with Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu tomorrow. We all, of course, watch and wait, the whole world does, and I want to bring in our chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward into this conversation as well. Clarissa, I know you are in Ashkelon just north of that Gaza border. And what are you seeing tonight? I mean, you know, we've been watching and watching and the build-up is to incredible and so powerful, and yet still we wait.",

We have been hearing jets overhead and we have been talking to people inside Gaza where the situation appears to be rapidly spiraling out of control into what one U.N. commissioner called an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.We spoke to a 22-year-old dentistry student. She lives in the northern part of Gaza. That is the area that Israeli forces have asked to be evacuated. She said that she and her family have not been able to leave their home yet because they don't have anywhere to go. They're concerned about the fact that there is no place in the south that has electricity, that has water. I should say that Israeli forces have said that they have turned the water back on in southern Gaza but so far it's been very difficult to get a picture of whether or not that is happening with one group in Gaza saying that basically because there is no electricity to power the pump, it's not clear that even if the water has been turned on that water will be coming out any time soon. So clearly a situation which is becoming untenable for the people of Gaza. There is a lot of fear. There's a lot of chaos. There's a lot of confusion. We heard our own Jake Tapper spoke earlier with the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. who said that they are trying to help facilitate the creation of a kind of large humanitarian zone that could potentially offer some refuge to, in his words, hundreds of thousands of people. But for a number of reasons, it's clear that that hasn't happened yet. It's being complicated by the fact that the Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt has not been opened yet, even to let in that desperately, desperately needed aid -- Erin.",

But the girl who I spoke to, the 22-year-old dentistry student, she also talked about this broader reluctance of many Palestinians to leave their homes because they're fearful that they won't be allowed to come back.They're fearful that this is going to be another Nakba, as the Palestinians call it, meaning the catastrophe, referring to 1948 when 700,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes.

So you can see why that fear is so palpable in addition to the historical context that you give to it.Clarissa, today here in Tel Aviv, you know, we had continually heard explosions in Gaza. Honestly, a little bit less of that. But there were more incoming rockets than there have been any other day and frankly in a couple of instances there were no siren warnings at all, and then rockets just landed, which has been unexpected given the Iron Dome System.

This is the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and that's why we're seeing rhetoric I have never seen before from any Israeli official, from the military, even from, you know, the more liberal left-wing.

And now it understands that on the one hand, if it goes for such an operation, then they're going to be a lot of casualties both on the Israeli side obviously but also on the Palestinian side.It will create a lot of international anger and criticism. On the other hand, if Israel doesn't go on such an operation, first, you know, Israeli public opinion is going to go nuts. That's for sure. It's going to be huge pressure on the government. There's already huge pressure on the government. But more important than that, other countries in the region, Iran, Hezbollah, other Israeli adversaries and enemies, will look at it and say, oh, the Israelis are weak so now it's our time to try and do it also.

So I just don't see that. And I'll tell you even more, another hard truth. I don't think that getting the hostages out is the top priority of the Israeli government right now.

This just into CNN, for the first time since the terror attack last Saturday in Israel, the president of the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abass, is condemning the deadly Hamas attack in Israel. Abbas says actions do not, quote, \"represent the Palestinian people,\" end quote. His comments were made in a phone call with the president of Venezuela. We'll have more on all of this in just a few moments. So stay with us on that.In the meantime, the mother of Noam Sagi was kidnapped from Nir Oz Kibbutz when Hamas invaded Israel eight days ago. They were supposed to celebrate her 75th birthday together in London. But she called him saying she was headed to her safe room. That is the last time that he heard from her. And Noam Sagi joins us now. I just want to offer my thoughts to you. I can't imagine what you and your family are going through right now. Really appreciate you joining us to talk about this. Have you heard any new information since you last heard from your mother? What can you tell us?",

This is a safe room that in the kibbutz everybody have, which is designed to protect them from shelling. And she went in. You can't lock this safe room.So in reality, she was probably fighting, holding the door handle. Some people held that handle for eight hours. But she's, you know, as you said, nearly 75, and supposed to be to celebrate her 75th birthday.

They just cannot be part of that, in a world where we accept that we all share that anyone's values of life is not more important than others. It is just absolutely unimaginable that kids, 9-month-old babies and kids, and elderly, frail, taken under mobility scooters, some of them with cancer, some of them with Parkinson's. It's the longest trip they had to take for a long time. All the way past the border and into Gaza. They need to be out now. Not because they're Israelis or Jewish or not because they're anything. It's because we're human. And as humans, that is the basic code of conduct that we expect from anyone on this planet. There are some things you don't do. And if you do them, you cannot be part of what is going on here. So I want to use the platform. I want you and I want everyone to look inside themselves and check in with themselves.
