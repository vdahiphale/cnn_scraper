In 1969, student protesters at Harvard took over and occupied university hall, marching school officials out of the building. The primary difference between then and now, the scale of the violence. While skirmishes have broken out at UCLA, and some other campuses during the current demonstrations, these protests have been for the most part, peaceful. In the Vietnam era, violence broke out routinely and on many campuses, students often brawling with police. PROF. JULIA REUBEN, HARVARD UNIVERSITY:  Disciplining students, calling in the police, having protests removed, that tended to increase the sympathy for protesters, build the size of protests and also increase the voice of more extreme activists.",

In May 1970, on the campus of Kent State University, Ohio National Guardtroops opened fire on student protesters, killing four of them and injuring several others. Days later, during racial injustice protests at Jackson State College in Mississippi, Police fired at a dormitory, killing two students and injuring a dozen others. Possibly a closer comparison to what`s going on now took place in the 1980s, when students across America protested against apartheid in South Africa. They called on schools to divest themselves from companies groups that supported the apartheid regime in South Africa, much like students are now calling oncologists to divest themselves from Israeli linked companies. Another dynamic that hasn`t changed across these arrows of protest. PROF. LAUREN DUNCAN, SMITH COLLEGE:  They`ve got a lot of energy and they`re idealistic and they like to protest when things feel unjust or seem unjust to them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Answer is bacteria. The number of bacteria, did you know, that you have in your mouth is more than the total number of humans on Earth. That is wild. All right, is there a sustainable alternative for fashion? Maybe fabrics with 0% animal or plastic? Is that even possible? Well, actually it is. This London-based biotech company, Modern Synthesis, has developed a way to create low-impact textiles using bacteria. Yes, you heard that right, bacteria. But to create raw materials using this process at a mass scale like the fashion industry would need, it will be costly. Just how much is the question? Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
