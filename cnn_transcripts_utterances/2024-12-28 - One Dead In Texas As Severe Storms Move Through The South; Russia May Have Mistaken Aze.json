The powerful Stovepipe tornado hit McCall Creek near Jackson just hours ago. It is part of a deadly tornado outbreak leaving a path of destruction across the south. We know at least one person is dead in Texas, just outside of Houston after the storm hit there earlier today. Back in Mississippi, drone video showing homes reduced to shreds. And tonight, a rare what's being called, quote, \"particularly dangerous tornado watch\" is in effect stretching from parts of Texas all the way to Alabama with more strong tornadoes expected tonight as the storm moves east. Rafael Romo has more on the devastation across the region, but we're going to check in first with meteorologist Tyler Mauldin, who has been tracking this storm. We're now starting to get more and more video to see what's happening on the ground, Tyler. But what are you seeing there on radar?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's because this storm system is going from a discombobulated, ragged system to more of an organized one, indicative by the line of storms coming into Mississippi and Louisiana.We still have the tornado watch up for Louisiana and Mississippi. That is the particular dangerous, particularly dangerous tornado watch. Very rare. The reason why is because there's a lot of unstable air out ahead of this system for it to feed off of. In fact, we're seeing this line of thunderstorm activity. Pretty much all of it is warned with either a severe thunderstorm or a tornado warning. And then out ahead of it, you have these supercells that are getting their act together. Going to take you on a tour of the radar. Let's go around the horn here. All the orange polygons, severe thunderstorm warnings. In the pink polygons those are tornado warnings. I do want to call out this one just to the south and east of Jackson, Mississippi, because it earlier had a tornado debris signature, meaning that we could see debris on radar, then pushing up to the north just to the east of Vicksburg. We also have a tornado warning. Very strong line coming through Vicksburg right now. A lot of thunderstorms, a lot of lightning and very strong wind associated with that line. We have a level four out of five threat for this area. The reason being is because the unstable air could lead to long-lived, violent and strong tornadoes. EF-2 or stronger. In addition, we could also see 80-mile-per-hour wind and some large hail, too. We're going to continue with that threat overnight. Then, as we get into Sunday, the threat diminishes slightly, but we still have the potential for severe weather from Georgia all the way through the Carolinas. The system goes eastbound. You see some drier air coming in, and by Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, we begin to see it wane. And eventually, come Monday, it's a thing of the past. Typically, we would see this kind of activity during the spring time, during tornado season, but it is not totally unheard of, Jessica, to get some December tornadoes. We mentioned this earlier, Jessica, this is the last weekend of 2024. This year has been well above average for tornadic activity. Bill mentioned that during his story last hour. So it's very fitting that we are ending 2024 with this tornado outbreak.",

Putin called the crash of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane, quote, \"a tragic incident,\" and confirmed Russian air defense systems were active when the plane attempted to land in Chechnya. But it is still unconfirmed what caused the crash. Video and images, though, of that plane wreck, show holes consistent with damage from shrapnel.

So really feeding into those questions around whether or not this plane was in fact mistakenly targeted by Russian anti-aircraft systems, that has certainly been a key line of inquiry we've been hearing from U.S. officials, as well as, of course, reports from Reuters, citing multiple sources who are, according to Reuters, familiar with this investigation that is ongoing, saying that they believe that may well have been the case, that the plane was downed by Russian air defense systems, potentially mistakenly. And, of course, as you mentioned, there has been a lot of questions around the holes that have been seen in the fuselage and the wreckage of the plane, which analysts and aviation experts have said could be consistent with shrapnel damage as a result of an explosion. So clearly, a lot of questions up in the air. We know that the two black boxes have been recovered, which will provide investigators with crucial data and evidence, but it could be a few days, potentially even a few weeks before investigators are able to give a full conclusion.",

The closest thing you think we'll get in terms of accountability from him and from Russia? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, I think so, Jessica. I mean, when you compare it to what the Russians said and did not say after the MH-17, the Malaysian Airlines disaster and shoot down in 2014, and going all the way back even to Soviet days back when the KAL 007 airplane was shot down in 1983, the Russians or the Soviets never apologized for anything that they clearly had done in this case. So this is somewhat of a remarkable half admission, if you will, by Putin, that something bad happened to the aircraft while it was in Russian airspace.

Some of their equipment is quite modern, but if you don't interpret the radar picture correctly, if you don't have other information to help augment the radar picture, then you can make mistakes like this.And no system is perfect.

He was then surrounded by those officers, and they began to punch him in his face, in his chest, in his buttock and his groin. They also kicked him. They wiped his face with blood -- with the blood on his face and they also put a cloth into his mouth.

Reid Hoffman came in with that $2 million to support the write-in campaign for President Biden's renomination. Once again, the way billionaires have the kind of undue influence that they have. Plus, you had a super PAC that came in for days supporting Dean Phillips before the election.So, sometimes these things are not quite what they appear to be. The reason I think, that I'm the best person, actually, for this job is because I've traveled all over this country and I have been up close and personal with what people have been going through. I don't think that the political system in general, and I don't think that the Democratic Party either. In fact, the problem is that it President-elect Trump has a very good way of coming across as though he cares. Somebody has got to bear witness to the incredible suffering that is going on out there. And that is what I've had the opportunity to do. When you have one in four Americans living with medical debt, when you have over half of our bankruptcies as medical bankruptcies, 46 percent of Americans saying that they live with hunger. When we have over a million people who are rationing their insulin, when we have people unable to live working with just one job and supporting a family, this is the kind of thing that the Democratic Party should stand for. The Democratic Party should be bearing witness to the incredible hardships that so many people are experiencing in this country. And I feel as someone who has not only been out all across America, very extensively, traveling, bearing witness, seeing what's going on with people, as well as someone who has experienced the inside of the belly of the beast, as they say, of the way the system works, particularly the culture of the DNC. I think that I'm the one who has the information, the visceral information, to know how we reconnect with the American people, how we serve the American people best and what's most important, how we win in 2026. Because Donald Trump has created a collective adrenaline rush. He has a psychological and emotional sway on masses of Americans, millions who have not only been drawn over to him, but millions of Americans who have been drawn away from the Democratic Party. So, we have to change the Democratic Party. If you want a change in the Senate and the House and the White House, then you're going to have to have a change in the Democratic Party.
