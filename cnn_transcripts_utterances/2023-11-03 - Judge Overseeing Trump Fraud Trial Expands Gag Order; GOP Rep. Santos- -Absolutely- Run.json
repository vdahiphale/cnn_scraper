      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.A New York judge, expanding a gag order, to include Donald Trump's attorneys, now warning them to stop talking about court staff, as a quote, \"fired up\" former President is set to take the stand, on Monday. Plus, Israel rejecting new U.S. calls, for a humanitarian pause, in Gaza, then taking responsibility, for a deadly strike, outside the largest hospital there. And CNN, going one-on-one, with indicted congressman, George Santos. His response, after surviving a second attempt, to expel him from Congress. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, there is high drama, in a New York courtroom, just before Donald Trump is set to take the stand, on Monday. The former President is preparing to testify, before the judge, who has already found him liable, for fraud, in the civil trial that is threatening his entire empire and, really, his whole identity. Trump is quote, \"Fired up,\" ahead of that testimony. That's according to his son, Eric Trump, who I should note also just wrapped up his own testimony, after his brother, Donald Trump Jr., was also forced to testify, this week. Technically, this will be Trump's second time, going on the stand, here in New York. And it's going to be a highly anticipated moment. There are a lot of legal issues, surrounding Trump. Of course, it's easy to get them all confused. But remember that this is the same judge, who told Trump, that he was not quote, \"credible,\" after he was on the witness stand for about three minutes, and then, fined him $10,000. The judge said that was because Trump violated his gag order that barred him from speaking, about court staff. He's been criticizing one clerk, in particular. And now, there's another chapter in that saga. That limited gag order has now expanded to include Trump's own lawyers, Christopher Kise, Clifford Robert, and Alina Habba. All three are now banned, from making statements, about confidential communications, between the judge and his staff. At the heart of this is that same clerk. Judge Engoron, today, admonished those three attorneys, saying that they, and, I'm quoting the judge now, \"made... repeated... inappropriate remarks about my Principal Law Clerk, falsely accusing her of bias against them.\" And this gag order is widening, another gag order in Washington, that's in that federal election interference case there, has just now been temporarily frozen, tonight, for the former President. More on what that means in a moment. But I'm joined now by the former Superior Court Judge, LaDoris Hazzard Cordell. Judge, I'm so glad you're here, tonight, because I'd love for you to just start by explaining, how unusual is it, for a gag order, to be expanded, to include the attorneys? LADORIS HAZZARD CORDELL, FORMER CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE, AUTHOR, \"HER HONOR\": Well, Kaitlan, I wouldn't characterize it as a gag order at all. I'd categorize it as the judge giving a reminder, to the lawyers, in the courtroom, to abide by courtroom protocol. Mature adults do not call out, name-call, say lies about the judge's staff. I was on the bench, for nearly 20 years, and presided over hearings, and motions, and trials, thousands of them, and never once did I ever have a lawyer call out my staff. And I'm especially concerned, about the lawyers, because every person, before they become a lawyer, has to take a bar exam and pass it. And part of the bar exam is the professional responsibility section, which deals with ethics, and which deals with conduct, of an attorney, in the courtroom and outside of the courtroom. So, when a lawyer does this, as in this case, this lawyer needs to have a refresher course on that. So, the thing that comes up to me though is why would a lawyer do this, and so aggravate a judge, where the judge is the sole decider, of the Trump's fate, and then the fate of the alleged empire. And all I can come up with is that it is a strategy. It is a strategy that they're using, when they know they're losing, and losing badly, when their ship is sinking. So, they need to disrupt. They need to find a way that this trial can either be interrupted, or can be reversed on appeal. And maybe that's by so aggravating, and irritating the judge, that the judge loses it and shows bias.",

There's no other rational reason for them to do this.And so, the judge could, for example, start saying things, or even using body motions that show the irritation, and the bias, that he's building, against the other side. And that can be sufficient for a reversible error. But I do believe this judge, because he's been on the bench, a long time, and has likely had lawyers, and litigants, in his courtroom, that have been obstreperous and have been juvenile or immature? And he's apparently found a way to deal with them. So, I don't think this strategy is going to work for them. Trial judges, basically, the good ones, basically have a mantra that they follow. And it is be long of fuse and thick of skin. And, I think, this judge is following that mantra.",

And their role is to research cases, to advise, give opinions, regarding their various legal issues that come up.So, is it unusual, for a judge, to have a law clerk that is giving information to the judge, when the judge requests it? Absolutely not. These are hard-working lawyers. And actually, to get to this position, you have to be highly qualified, to even be there. So no, there's nothing unusual about it.

And that's because a federal appeals court has temporarily frozen that one, in Washington, D.C., which essentially means, I believe, until the oral arguments, and tell me if I'm wrong, that Trump is now free to criticize potential witnesses, in this case.",

Because we know when Trump says things, it's dog-whistle, not very well disguised, to his followers, to go after these people. So, I'm really bothered by the fact that there is a stay that was issued. But when it is issued, it means there is no gag order. He is free to continue doing what he was doing before then, which is to call out people, call names out and, I believe, endanger the lives of these people that he is talking about.",

Why it was Donald Trump Jr., then Eric Trump, then Donald Trump is testifying, on Monday, but his daughter Ivanka Trump is not? Why wouldn't they save Donald Trump, for last, basically?AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, I think, part of that is Ivanka Trump was challenging, whether or not she would testify. She raised an objection, and actually be -- citing her young children. That was why she would be unable to get away, it would be a hardship. So that's why she may be out of order here, as opposed to the natural build-up. Why you would have these folks testify? I mean, this case was really about the intent behind the fraud. As you know, the judge has already found, in this what's called a summary judgment motion, which is basically a finding before trial, that there was fraud, repeated fraud, based on the documents. Now, the question is, was there intent behind the fraud, with these additional causes of action? Did Don Jr. did Eric, and did the former President intent to defraud individuals, whether it came down to loans, or the like? And that's what really this is about here. All these folks are on the stand, also, because it's a civil case. If this were a criminal case, you couldn't force the defendants, to get on the stand. Here, in a civil case, where unless they plead the Fifth, there's not criminal exposure, you can get them all on the stand. And that's why they're all there now.",

And by the -- oh, I should say, public Donald Trump. We've seen the Donald Trump of the rallies, who is boisterous, who is offensive, who is aggressive. And then, we've seen a Donald Trump, in deposition testimony, who was a little bit actually more controlled, about his words, who gets a little slightly more soft-spoken. I don't know which Trump we're going to see. I think that depends, in part, on their strategy. If they think that all is lost with the judge? Because again, this is a judge trial, not a jury trial, so only one person deciding the President's fate. If they think all is lost, they may decide to go in a more aggressive, public-facing strategy, where it's not about what's happening with the verdict. But they're trying to either elicit a response from the judge. They're playing to the media. They're playing to the base. They're looking for political backlash.",

Now, the publisher of that book is suing him, accusing him of violating the terms of their agreement, because in the book, he obviously includes false statements, about the 2020 election. I'm confused by this is happening now. I mean, part of the -- one chapter opens with a sentence in all-caps. \"I KNEW HE DIDN'T LOSE.\" We knew that this was out there. They obviously knew that he was going to make these claims, in this book. Why are they suing him now? And, I mean, do they have an argument? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, I think what's odd about this lawsuit is that it's based on public reporting, that Mark Meadows has taken a different posture, in private, with the Special Counsel. It's not based on anything that this publisher can actually prove yet. But I think, frankly, it's everything coming home to roost for both sides. Mark Meadows' lies were clear, when this book was written and published. And the publisher nonetheless decided they were going forward with it. Mark Meadows now is having to face up to the lies that he told, meaning he's got to decide, in responding to this lawsuit, is he going to say, \"I was lying in the book,\" or \"Now, I'm lying to Jack Smith,\" and what he's told, presumably under oath, if the reporting is right. So, I think, frankly, you have a publisher, who was willing to accept lies up-front. And you had a writer, in Mark Meadows, who was willing to tell those lies.
