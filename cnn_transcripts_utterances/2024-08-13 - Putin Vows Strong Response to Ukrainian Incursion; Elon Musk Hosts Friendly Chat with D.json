And while their forces are making gains, Russian President Vladimir Putin is vowing strong retaliation. Plus, little policy and a lot of insults. Donald Trump dishing out attacks during a two-hour interview with Elon Musk. To tell you about what the former President had to say about his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. And water on Mars. New evidence suggests there may be a deep reservoir beneath the planet's surface. Well, difficult and intense. That's how Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is describing the offensive into Russian territory, that has taken Moscow and much of the world by surprise. Ukraine says it has seized as much land   in a week as Russia has so far this year. And now, a new Russian district southwest of Kursk is urging its residents to evacuate as Ukrainian troops continue to push forward. The Ukrainians are relishing this moment. We are seeing videos like this one. Ukrainian forces deep inside Russia, throwing their enemy's flag to the ground. Russia's President calls this an attempt to destabilize his country and promises to quote, \"kick the enemy out.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator):  The main task is certainly before the Ministry of Defense to squeeze out, knock out the enemy from our territories and together with the border guard service, ensure reliable protection of the state border.

And so, there are fragments of it getting out. We do occasionally hear about a settlement here or there from Russian military bloggers or locals seeing Ukrainian forces moving into it. And that works in two ways. It's a huge benefit for Ukraine because they're able to create chaos, confusion, a lack of certainty about where Russia needs to send any military forces that they have abroad, and a sense of panic and fear amongst Russian civilian population who simply don't know where the next place where Ukraine may push is going to be. And two, I think that just increases Kyiv's ability to have an impact along this whole border area, because they're essentially making it very hard for Moscow to use the limited forces that it has in an effective fashion.

I think in the first days of this, there were deepconcerns about whether Ukraine was wisely using its limited resources in a cross-border incursion like that. What were they aiming for? What were they going for? But in my assessment, that's kind of evaporated over time. Because they've had a week now of stark embarrassment, where Russia is clearly unable to prevent these Ukrainian forces from moving around areas that have long been secure. They haven't seen invading forces since the Nazis. And so that, I think is an operational information win for the Ukrainians if they're able to hold territory and use it as a bargaining chip with Russia going forwards, that's one possibility if they're able to hit infrastructure that could potentially have a long-term benefit as well. But at this point, there's not really a sense that they have to pull out in any particular time soon. That may be the case when Russia gets its sort of forces into play here from other areas. But for now, they continue to advance. And I think the longer that sense of Russia no longer being a 10- foot tall giant maintains the greater, the justification of Ukraine doing it in the first place is and the stronger it makes Ukraine look. Remember, we've had a year of bad headlines for Ukraine from a failed counteroffensive to rolling frontline, they head   back into Ukrainian territory that Russia advancing in the Donbas area. This is a stark success. It's one that as far as we can tell, it's not come at enormous Ukrainian casualties, they've clearly lost some troops as they've moved around. And it's one that has shown Russia's military machine to be frankly, a bit of a mess, very inflexible, very immobile, fixated on certain grinding battles in the Donbas, and ultimately its border forces unable to control its borders, the simple task of keeping its citizens safe, they simply aren't up to.

And of course, it's still a day away from  taking place, and much can happen between now and then. And it does appear that the United States wants to put up the appearance that something is being done to end the bloodshed in Gaza, and perhaps to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from responding to Israel's killing of those two senior officials. One here in Beirut from Hezbollah, and of course, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. But there are fundamental problems with these talks. For the -- one, on one hand, you have Hamas, the leader of which is now Yahya Sinwar in Gaza. And of course, he's the man who has the hostages, he has the final decision. It's very difficult to communicate with him, given the current circumstances in Gaza. On the Israeli side, even though they're sending a delegation to Doha for these talks, there are persistent reports that Netanyahu, the Prime Minister has imposed new conditions. This is what CNN has been reporting and other outlets for quite some time, even though the Prime Minister's office put out a statement this evening denying it. And then there's the problem of domestic politics in Israel. It's important to keep in mind that there are two members of Netanyahu's cabinet. Itamar Ben-Gvir; the National Security Minister and the Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. These are hard-liners who have made it clear all along that they are fundamentally opposed, not only to ceasefire, they are opposed to sending humanitarian aid to Gaza. And they have threatened time and time again that if Netanyahu signs a ceasefire agreement of any kind, that doesn't involve the release of all the hostages, that they will resign from his government. So, on the one hand, there are logistical problems for Hamas in just participating effectively in these talks. And on the other hand, fundamental political obstacles in front of Benjamin Netanyahu to actually agree to some sort of truce and release of hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian detainees and prisoners. So, the Americans are certainly spinning their diplomatic wheels very vigorously, but it's highly questionable, and many people are doubting throughout the region that actual progress is going to be made unfortunately.",

Concrete streets, buildings that just hold on to that solar energy like a big thermal battery often into the overnight hours stressing people relentlessly. And what we're seeing as you look at the data, this is the 50 biggest cities -- they looked at comparison, the temperatures this Summer to the last decade or so, averages also going back, comparing them to 50 years ago or so. And right now, Las Vegas is staggering on how much they're jumping above what is already a scorching hot place to live, 83 days above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, that's 35 degrees Celsius so far this year. That's 17.5 days more than is average over the last decade or so. San Antonio is also seeing a big jump down in Texas. Nashville, Atlanta, which is used to maybe one or two days at 95 degrees, has had 12 extra, 14 total this year. But  if we compare these, Lynda, to just going back a longer timescale, going back to the mid 70s or so, the hotter places are getting hotter. Phoenix, Mesa-Arizona, Tucson already pretty scorching. As we look at the next chart -- oh, that's the -- that's the one nationally that just shows the trend going up nationwide. But I think we have the number of days, 95 degrees or hotter in 1975, compared to now. And you can see that cities in Arizona, while they're getting hotter, they started that way. But San Antonio has gone up 12,000 percent. They were used to maybe a few days a week at the most. Back in the 1970s, 96 days above 95 degrees last year. So overall, Lynda, the trend here on this data is that the most vulnerable folks in these big cities, the young, the old, outdoor workers, the un- housed, those are seeing life or death situations as these heat waves become more protracted.

Shespent over 20 years of her life at this business and her co-workers were saying how she was talking about going back to her home country, back to her daughters at the end of this year. And sadly, they say she just didn't make it. And today, we find a rose left here by someone that says, we'll remember her dearly. GIOKOS (voice-over):  More than 700 firefighters, almost 200 vehicles and 35 water bombing aircraft have now managed to control the blaze. But 100,000 acres of land were lost. The extent of the damage so great it can be seen from space. A scenario of destruction just a few miles from Athens. Experts say the last few years of fires are drastically changing the city's climate. The loss of trees making winds and temperatures rise along with the risk of fire. A tough challenge ahead, local officials are well aware of.",

After less than a year in the topjob, Laxman Narasimhan is headed for the exit. He's set to be replaced by the head of another fast service chain, Chipotle's at Brian Niccol. Starbucks investors are happy with that news, which set the stock price soaring. Chipotle, meanwhile, is sinking on that news. Our business reporter, Nathaniel Meyersohn has more.",

And Starbucks has really struggled the last several years. Last quarter, its sales were down 3 percent. Customers are really frustrated with higher prices. People are paying $5, $6, $7 for iced coffee, even more for lattes. At Starbucks, the business model has completely changed over the past several years. You think back at Starbucks during the '90s and 2000, people used to go inside, stay for a while, sit down. Now, everybody's ordering on their phone. Sometimes the service is often slow. But investors are very confident in him. The stock is up about 20 percent at Starbucks today. It shows, you know, excitement for Niccol. He's known as a turnaround expert, having turned around Chipotle after its E. coli and food safety issues, also has a track record of turning around Taco Bell. So, Wall Street really thinks that Starbucks has picked the right man for the job, Lynda.",

Scientists estimate that the total amount ofwater could actually fill oceans on the planet's surface. The water is most likely trapped in tiny cracks and pores of rocks. And this new data came from NASA's InSight Lander, which was used to study Mars from 2018 to 2022. Well, joining us now to explain it more as CNN's Kristin Fisher explains. Good to see you, Kristin. So, what are you learning about this Martian water and what it could mean for potential life on Mars?",

      "sentences": "Well, that is the real exciting development here, right? Because if you think of where, youknow, life has flourished, especially early on when life flourished on this planet, it was in watery places. And a lot of scientists think it happened, you know, beneath the Earth's surface. And that is exactly where these scientists believe that they have found water on Mars. And we are talking about a huge amount of water, potentially. Water enough to fill the entire planet about a mile deep. The catch though is, you know, in order to access that water, you'd have to drill down between seven to 12 miles into the surface of Mars, and to get a drill that big on the red planet, that'd be a pretty tough thing to do. But if scientists were able to get a drill that size on Mars, you could potentially drill down and that is where scientists hope that maybe there are signs of life there. Now, as you mentioned, this discovery was made using data from NASA's InSight Lander, which stopped being operational back in 2022. So, scientists have been crunching this data for two years since. And this lander was essentially one big seismometer used to measure what's called Marsquakes. You know, Mars' version of earthquakes. And by, you know, looking at where those waves went within the Mars' core, so to speak, that's how they were able to determine their belief that there is this water there. So, Lynda, some exciting developments that these scientists are really hopeful for.",
