It's all because of the ground up here is still saturated. It's saturated from the week and week and week of rain we had over the past year. And so, it just hasn't had a chance to dry out. Like down here that has just dried out. The country cut in half where the southern part way in excess of normal and in the northern part very, very pleasant. How about 79 in Omaha, 83 in Denver. Can't argue with anything like that.
