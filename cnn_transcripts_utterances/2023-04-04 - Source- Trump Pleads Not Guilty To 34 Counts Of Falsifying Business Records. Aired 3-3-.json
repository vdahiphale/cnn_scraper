      "sentences": "The fact that he's already - if the reporting is correct - the fact that he's already pled not guilty to all 34 charges leads me to believe that he - that probably did happen here that they read the reading - they waived the reading of the 34 charges and instead just arraigned him on the indictment.This is a long proceeding, I will say, for an arraignment, because especially if he's already pled not guilty. That's the main thing that would happen here is the reading of the indictment and how do you - the plead - the entry of plea of guilty or not guilty and he entered not guilty. So the question to me is what has been happening since he entered those pleas of not guilty here. And if potentially they could be looking at future dates or scheduling or whether or not he wants to appear or has to appear, I should say at future dates. But more likely is there some legal arguments that are being sought after by either the DA or the defense attorneys who are asking the judge to rule on certain legal questions that they may or may not have or perhaps the judge is setting the parameters of what is appropriate to be talked about or not. But this is going on a lot longer than a typical arraignment where there's no question of bail, because this is not a bail eligible offense in New York. So even if he was a flight risk or in some ways they were concerned with that, this is not a crime for which you can even ask for bail. So custody is not an issue and if you waive the rights there, then that's also not an issue. And so I don't know what's going on there but looking at that picture on the screen, the lead prosecutor in this case, is - that's Chris Conroy who's been at the DA's. He's a long-term Assistant District Attorney and he's been there for a long time. The woman behind him is Susan Hoffinger. She is the attorney who prosecuted, successfully prosecuted The Trump Organization and got a 17-count conviction where her - the opposing counsel was Susan Necheles, the woman seated to Mr. Trump's right and then you have, obviously, the same judge, Judge Merchan there.",

And all of us should - in the - in journalism and in the public should be skeptical and open minded when it comes to any accusations made by the government against any individual. And we'll see exactly what the District Attorney Alvin Bragg is proceeding with against Donald Trump when he brings this indictment forward, which we're told has been unsealed, although we - the public is still waiting to see it.Adam Kaufmann, let me just ask you, when we're told Trump pleads not guilty to 34 counts, which is what a New York government official has told CNN, 34 counts, what does that mean? Is that 34 different felonies? Is it 34 misdemeanors? Is it one felony in 34 counts of that one felony? Translate that into public speaking for us? ADAM KAUFMANN, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: KAUFMANN: Right, so we don't know, we don't know what the counts are. We know because this is a felony indictment being arraigned in Supreme Court that at least one count is a felony. If it's the falsifying business records, under New York State procedural law, every time there was a false business record, it would have to be charged as a separate count and so it is entirely possible that it's all multiple counts, because every fake check or every fake entry in a ledger would be its own discrete count, that's another possibility. To go back to the way the arraignment probably worked, you would expect the court to simply - generally the court will simply inform the - advice the defendant that a New York County grand jury has filed an indictment charging you with and then they'll list the counts and then ask the defendant, how do you plead guilty or not guilty and that's the point when Mr. Trump would have entered his plea of not guilty. But at this point, we just don't know what all of those different counts are and what the indictment contains.",

One of the goals that the judge will have had in this first arraignment would be to set up at least a provisional schedule of when those motions would be due. So you can imagine we've already heard reporting from the Trump legal team that they intend to fight.

      "sentences": "Yes. So this is a common bread and butter charge for the District Attorney's Office. It's used in New York State, not just the Manhattan DA's Office, but in multiple counties around the state. It's a very common white collar fraud charge. It's called falsifying a business record in the first degree. It's a Class E felony, which is the lowest felony there is in New York State, but it's very, very common.And the question is going to be what is the charge that brings the falsifying a business record from the misdemeanor to a felony. The misdemeanor and falsifying a business record is just when you - with the intent to deceive, you enter a false or erroneous record. You make an - a record entry that is false or erroneous in some way with the intent to deceive someone. What makes it a felony is when you make that erroneous entry and your intent to deceive includes the commission or concealment of another crime. And there's been a lot of speculation about what - what's appropriate and what could that other crime be. And that's going to be the thing that I think most legal analysts are waiting to see if we get any indication of that from the unsealing of the indictment, because then we might not know which crime they relied upon or crimes, because it could be multiple, they could have multiple theories of what the crimes are that they're thinking about. It also doesn't say in the statute whose crime you are intending to conceal or commit. It could be, for example, that the falsification was made in furtherance of the charges by Michael Cohen, who was already prosecuted and pled guilty in 2018 federally for this exact charge. So we just don't know what the crime will be that the District Attorney used to elevate it to a felony. And again, there's been a lot of question about is it okay to use a federal election law violation as the crime that makes this a felony, and that's going to be one of the legal arguments, I think, that the lawyers are going to make in this case, because that is something that although it's been done many times or several times, I should say before, it's not ever been tested or litigated in court.",

One of the people in recent years - well, before he became president that he used as his chief henchmen, this is what he calls himself was Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was the man who kept him out of the very situation that we're looking at that he is in right now.

It will be briefed by lawyers at another date. Right now, the only thing that's happening in court, it was just supposed to be an arraignment, it would not be anything about custody or bail since this crime is not bail eligible. So what could they possibly be talking about? I think it's the fact that Donald Trump has crossed a massive line here in New York when he had a picture of himself with a baseball bat to Alvin Braggs head and then, right after that calling - in his way, calling for death and destruction in the streets, that crossed a line in New York. He could have easily be charged with another crime there, obstruction of governmental administration because he was trying to intimidate - using intimidation and threats to interfere with the court process. Doing the same thing to the judge, these veiled threats to his daughter, that's another - he's - they are committing more crimes. And so whether he gets arrested for them is a decision that will have to be made by law enforcement. But I can assure you, this judge, Judge Merchan is not going to put up with it and this judge knows The Trump Organization and Trump and his ways and his allies, he sat and was the judge who presided over The Trump Organization trial. So he is not a stranger to the ways of Donald Trump and Donald Trump's orbit.
