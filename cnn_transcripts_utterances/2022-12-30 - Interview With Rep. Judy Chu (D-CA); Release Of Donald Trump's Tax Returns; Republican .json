What do you think -- make of that, and should there be a change there?REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): Yes -- well, I think that there are numerous red flags in Trump's taxes, and this is indeed one of them. And I find his bank accounts in China to be very ironic because it was at the same time that he was accusing President Biden of having close ties with China. In reality, it was Trump that was continuing these financial relationships. So, the reason that he wanted to declare his foreign tax payments is because he could get a deduction, and I think there is some wrong with the system where he would be able to pay more in foreign taxes than he could to our U.S. government where he was only having to pay $750 in 2016 and 2017, and $0 in 2020.",

I do want to ask you about what Republicans are saying about this. Because, of course, they have dissented. They have been very annoyed that this was coming out even though the Supreme Court agreed that they could be released. What do you say to Republicans who say, look, the tax returns didn't need to go public. That is not going to fix the audit for example, program that did not do its job apparently.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, every president since Nixon has released their tax returns. Trump was the only one that did not do that. But that actually was not the sole reason for us to release his tax returns. The real reason had to do with this mandatory presidential audit and the fact that it wasn't done, and that there were so many holes. And so, we knew that in order for the public to understand what happened, they needed to see the returns themselves.You know there's a lot of skepticism in our American public right now, and I think that they don't take our word for things anymore. Just, they don't take it for granted. We need for them to be able to see for themselves what's going on.",

Now as the situation became more dire, he ended up breaking into a nearby school and then it's what he did next that is incredible. He helped 20 other people who were stranded get inside to safety. Police were able to find the local hero from the apology note he left for the break-in along with security video.CNN's Miguel Marquez joins you now from Buffalo. He has seen how bad this storm -- he and his crew has seen how bad this storm has been. Miguel, what more can you tell us about this gentleman?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kevin McCarthy just wrapped a conference call between some of his critics and some of his supporters, but sources tell me and my colleague Lauren Fox there were no major breakthroughs on that call in his quest for the speakership votes.What McCarthy has been trying to do behind the scenes is go to his critics and try to figure out what do they want in terms of a rules package. And he's been trying to win them over with some concessions and he has made some significant concessions to them already. On the call today for example he agreed to establish a broad investigative panel that would really centralize all the different probes into the Biden administration. That is something that has been a chief priority for conservatives like Chip Roy, someone who has been on the fence about supporting McCarthy. And then he also signaled on the call signal that he would be willing to support a lower threshold for something called the motion to vacate the Speaker's chair. That is a tool that can be used to force a for vote on ousting the sitting Speaker. Previously McCarthy didn't want to budge on it, but now he is offering -- it come significantly down. So, you talked about on that call, he had reported first as CNN that he was open to that idea. However, on the call, moderates expressed a lot of concern about the idea of lowering that threshold. They're worried that it could be used over McCarthy's head by his critics while he is Speaker and that he be giving away a significant amount of his authority. And then the critics on the call who want this lower threshold, wouldn't even agree to supporting McCarthy even if he does come down on that threshold. So, still a lot of work to do. Lawmaker said they are continuing to work through the weekend to try to resolve some of these issues. But time is running out as the vote is on January 3rd -- Sara.",

This is the first New Year's Eve since 2020 that will be back to pre-pandemic status. No restrictions -- that's what that means. So, there will be a full capacity crowd. If you're headed to Times Square, no umbrellas are allowed but you better bring your raincoat, unfortunately. CNN's Allison Chinchar joins us now. Really!",

But yes, unfortunately, this system right here that's impacting the Midwest and the Southeast right now is going to shift east in the next 24 hours. Bringing with it all of those rain showers.But we also have a secondary system. This one is starting to make its way into the West Coast here bringing pretty heavy rain across areas of California which will also be a concern. But we begin with where the strong storms are at this moment. You've got several active, severe and even flood warnings at the moment for this area down here right along the Gulf Coast. Very heavy rainfall, lots of lightning and, yes, the potential for flooding exists there. Also flooding potential for Northern California. This low pressure system moving ever is slowly, so it's got a lot of time to dump a tremendous amount of rain. But the big question, what is New York going to look like. Now we've got a lot of heavy rain in the hours leading up to the ball dropping. But it should start to lighten up hopefully, Sara, literally minutes before the ball actually drops.",
