Now, talks are ongoing in Cairo, but an Israeli delegation is not there. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz is expected to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris later today. This after she specifically called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.Let's get right to Jeremy Diamond, who is in Tel Aviv, on the status of these talks were Israel is not participating just now, Jeremy, why?",

He's also the co-author of the book \"ConflictIt's good to see you. Thank you so much for - for being here, General. Let's first start with the negotiations as Jeremy Diamond was laying out kind of the latest of where it stands. What is your level of confidence at this point in these negotiations, considering I've heard you say and taken note when you - when you say that Hamas is the equivalent of the Islamic State? GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, its a very close call as to whether this will come through or not. There are a lot of reasons that the various parties would like to see this happen, a temporary ceasefire to be sure, maybe four to six weeks, something like that, for the period of Ramadan. But it will not be extended. Israel does need to destroy Hamas. Again, that means render them incapable of accomplishing their mission without reconstitution. But clearly there also has to be enormous additional attention and resources devoted to taking care of the people, especially in the areas that have already been cleared. And we saw with that episode with the convoy in which 100 or so people were killed in a stampede apparently threatening, these soldiers saw that as such, clearly there's got to be more attention also just to issues that might be described as law and order. Gangs are running around now rampant. Aid convoys find it very difficult to get in. That was actually organized by the Israelis, but clearly not secure and sufficiently. So, more attention has to be given to the -- what happens in neighborhoods after they have been cleared, and also, how do you hold them, if you will? How do you secure the people and keep them from having Hamas reinfiltrate, which would be the reconstitution that we saw with the Islamic State, in fact. In Iraq, we destroyed it during the surge in Iraq, kept it down for three-and-a-half years. We withdrew. The Iraqis took their eyes off it. And then, a few years later, you have a califate. So, much more attention to this side of this particular - this war on Hamas.",

And there has to be much more attention to the whole phase, both to take care of the people -- again, there should also be an explicit objective that is announced that we want to make life better for the Palestinians in Gaza, and then demonstrate that by what is done on the ground.Again, I fully agree with the need to destroy Hamas, dismantle the political wing, get their hostages back, but there have to be additional objectives announced that have to do with the people and who's going to administer and oversee the distribution of humanitarian assistance, who's going to restore basic services, begin reconstruction. All of that can be done simultaneously, even as they are continuing the operations in central and southern Gaza. And it should be done. That should be the approach taken. Yes, there will be those that say Hamas is an army, not an insurgency. Fair enough. But you still have to deal with it. And then you have to hold that area or they will reconstitute. That's the other big fear. There are signs of reconstitution in some of the areas of northern Gaza.",

This first tranche of bills, these were probably the easier bills to try and negotiate. So, they are expected to pass by the Friday midnight deadline. The House is going to move forward on Wednesday. And while there are some conservatives who are arguing that there aren't enough conservative policy wins, that these spending numbers are too high, the reality is many people acknowledge that Speaker Johnson was on a trajectory set by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy that was going to be very difficult to get off of.So, last week I heard a lot of grumbling about where this was headed, but very few members threatening that this was going to end Speaker Johnson's time in the speakership. Now, there is a question, what happens to the next six bills, because those bills traditionally have been harder to negotiate. Things like negotiating spending and policies at the Labor Department, at HHS, at DHS. Though agencies can be a little bit trickier for lawmakers on the Republican and Democratic side to come to an agreement on. They have until March 22nd to get an agreement on that second tranche of bills. But here's why everyone is so motivated. At the end of April, if you don't have agreement on these full-year spending packages, what you get is automatic cuts across the board. That was part of the debt ceiling deal that was passed in the end of last May. The reason for that was to really get everyone to the negotiating table, to avoid a situation where you were just doing these constant short term CRs to get them through the fiscal year. So, John, after they're all done with this, they have to put their eyes toward getting agreement on funding for the next fiscal year. So, that's right around the corner.",
