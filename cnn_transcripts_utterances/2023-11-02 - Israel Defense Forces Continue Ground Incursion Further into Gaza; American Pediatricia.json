This is the latest video from the IDF of Israeli soldiers, tanks, and bulldozers pushing deeper into Gaza. This morning the Israeli military says Hamas's defensive lines are collapsing and militants are retreating into central Gaza.And this is the devastation from the second airstrike in two days on Gaza's largest refugee camp. The IDF says it was targeting a Hamas command center but the United Nations Human Rights Office is now warning the high number of civilian casualties from those strikes on the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp could amount to war crimes.

And these are Israeli IDF special forces here. They are training for the real thing in the event that they have to defend the northern border from greater involvement from Iranian backed forces inside Syria and in Lebanon, of course, Hezbollah chief among them.To date, we have seen a lot of clashes along this border, exchange of artillery fire. Just in the last 24 hours Hezbollah forces say they shot down an Israeli drone. The worry is that it becomes bigger, and that is that you have Hezbollah fighters attempting to come across the border in numbers or firing missiles in greater numbers. And exercises like this one are designed to keep them on edge, keep Israeli forces on edge in case they have to come to the country's defense in the north, much like they have had to do in the south. And this is a daily event here, right, because you have some 70,000 IDF forces now based in the north to defend against the possibility of such an attack.",

And so my staying wasn't really helping anything.The night before last, I just woke up in the middle of the night. I was checking my messages, and I had an email. I can't check the email, but my husband had sent me an email saying for Americans to be ready the next few days. We will be notified when we are on the list for that day. I never got any other notification. I started contacting my State Department contact at that point and asking is this -- will all my group -- we were a group of eight then with four Americans. Will all the Americans in my group be able to move at the same time? Because that was our plan. Would the internationals we were with who were also sharing the same transportation be able to move at the same time? And asking all those questions, and she didn't know. In the meantime, simultaneously, other people in my group, especially the internationals, were getting calls from their embassy saying be at the border at 7:00.

I think if Trump is convicted of a felony in any of these cases, there will be a cohort of voters, some Republicans who just don't want to associate their franchise with a convicted felon or don't think someone who's been convicted should be in the White House, and that could be enough to scramble his reelection plans. Of course, on the Democratic side, the scrambling, I think, could be if the third-party candidates have ballot access in enough states.
