You also had JD Vance tweeting out, encouraging people to vote and also saying, today is the day we send a message to Joe Biden. And really that has been a central theme of his message and campaign. He's trying to make this election a referendum on Joe Biden and the Democratic agenda. That was also a theme we heard last night at the JD Vance rally, which featured former President Donald Trump. And another strategy of Vance's has been really trying to tap into the Trump base and trying to enthusiastically gin up that base. He sought out Trump's endorsement in the primary and he's hugged him tightly ever since. And then, meanwhile, you have Tim Ryan, who has really tried to portray himself as this independent, no nonsense fighter who's going to stand up for his own party. He's also had a very consistent economic message since the beginning of his campaign. He's trying to make an appeal to these working white collar voters. And he's also been trying to portray JD Vance as a sycophant of Donald Trump. Obviously, that's not something JD Vance has shied away from. But in talking to Tim Ryan, it is very clear that he views himself as an underdog and that he thinks this race has been largely overlooked, including by his own party. And to be clear, this race is a lot closer than people expected it to be, especially considering it's a red state and a - a Trump-won state from 2020. But it is still a very tough political environment for Democrats. So, we'll have to wait and see.",

This is someone who said they are heading to the polls and it's going to be a game-time decision, but that the economy is top of mind.

And as it turns out, Election Day has not been through our entire history. You have to go all the way back to 1845, I believe, is the first day in which Election Day was, in fact, a universal day. And it actually correlated with the invention of the telegram because the idea was they didn't want some states being able to communicate with other ones to know what their voting patterns were. Now, I think there's almost this question, though, OK, why is it an early Tuesday in November, right? This seems to be quite strange. Well, it's a Tuesday because a lot of people went to churches on Sunday and on Wednesday it was sort of the day you would go into town to sort of sell your goods. And it's in early November because it is after the fall harvest and it is before the harsh winter. The last -- I know, it is amazing. The -- and then there's one little last nugget which in all honesty my mind is - is sort of forgetting, if we could put up the graphic I'll remember it here. The last - the last sort of nugget is -- graphic people, please, I'm begging you. There we go. The reason why that I wonder if it truly is an Election Day still at this particular point is because so many people are voting early and are voting before Election Day even begins.",
