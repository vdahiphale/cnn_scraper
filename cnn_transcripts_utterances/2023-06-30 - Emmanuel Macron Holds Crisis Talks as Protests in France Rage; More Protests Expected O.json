Sweden allowed Wednesday's incident calling it free speech. But more than a few critics describe it as incitement. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is tracking this story for us.

This was allowed to go ahead on one of the most significant days in the Islamic calendar. The first day of Eid-al-Adha. So you can imagine how offended, insulted, angry, and outraged Muslims around the world are. And we are seeing this right now playing out in Baghdad. You've got these crowds that are beginning to gather near the Swedish embassy. This is a protest that was called for by the Shia cleric, the powerful and influential cleric Muqtada al-Sadr who can really mobilize the masses of his supporters. He wants them to put pressure on the government essentially to expel the Swedish ambassador. Now we're not expecting this at this point to turn violent. It is expected to be a peaceful protest. We saw what happened yesterday when dozens of his supporters did end up pouring into the compound of the Swedish consulate. But there was no violence and the Swedish Foreign Ministry said that their staff were safe. We'll have to wait and see but the expectation is today that we're going to be seeing really huge crowds in Baghdad and also demonstrations in other parts of the country as well.

Well, General Surovikin, whose whereabouts we have to say are still not clear, there were reports he may have been arrested, but that's not been confirmed by the authorities.

However, there is a huge amount of interest generated by the assets that are frozen. In terms of the foreign reserves, which is more than $300 billion that's been frozen by Western allies, around two-thirds of that is held within the E.U. which is kind of why the E.U. is leading this discussion. And a huge chunk of that is currently sitting in a clearinghouse in Belgium essentially because transactions were made but money was never able to hit the Russian accounts. So it's just been sitting there and making a huge amount of interest. I think it was just over $800 million in the first quarter of this year. So the discussion now is could you use the interest generated from these frozen Russian assets to put into an account to go towards rebuilding and reconstructing Ukraine. That's what's under discussion. It would mean underlying assets, which are Russia's, would still be there at the end. It could be returned to Russia at some stage.",

The second concern, also a really interesting one, would this put off central banks from around the world from putting foreign reserves in euro denominated assets because this could potentially happen?

The Women's World Cup kicking up next month in Australia and New Zealand, and it will feature something not seen at last year's men's tournament in Qatar. Captains of all 32 teams will get to wear special armbands. Amanda Davies is here to tell us more about the significance of this and significance not least because this breaks out from the, you know, huge controversy that you and I reported on in Qatar in November of course, when there was so much said and so much controversy about these armbands. Just explain why it is that these teams want to wear them and what the message here is. AMANDA DAVIES, CNN'S WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Yes, well, Becky, in fact these images we're seeing, they are what became the infamous \"One Love\" armband, aren't they? And they were not officially sanctioned by FIFA. So the captains of the Men's World Cup were not allowed to wear what many of them hoped to wear as a real sign for equality and a fight against discrimination. In an attempt to avoid the controversy, looking ahead to this Women's World Cup, FIFA have now decided to identify eight social causes and for those social causes they have revealed these images of these armbands. They are not compulsory. Captains can choose to wear one of them, one each match or indeed a neutral one that doesn't support any of these causes. It's more a football is a source of good. The interesting thing is whether these go far enough. And that is the reaction that's starting to filter through. Does it avoid the controversy? Is it what the players want to be wearing the causes they want to be supporting? And that's what we're going to be looking at in a couple of minutes in \"WORLD SPORT.\"",
