I want you to look at the animation here from flight radar 24.It shows that Delta Airlines flight taking runway 4 left at JFK on Friday evening, when an American Airlines 777 pulled out onto the runway in front of it. That Delta flight was still accelerating for takeoff. I want you to listen now to the air traffic control recording come from live ATC where you can hear the urgency in the air traffic controller's voice. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "A rejected takeoff, something that pilots often only do in the flight simulator. This time it was real life. The FAA says these planes came only within about 1,000 feet of each other in the end which is not all that big in aviation terms. Remember, these planes are hundreds of feet long. This is known as a runway incursion in technical terms and these happen hundreds of times a year according to the FAA, although rarely ever this close.Now the FAA and the NTSB are investigating. They will, of course, want to hear the cockpit voice recorder, especially from the cockpit of that American Airlines 777. They will also be paying very close attention to the radio calls here. Was that American Airlines 777 actually cleared to cross that runway? You need to get an explicit clearance from air traffic control to do so, or was it told to go someplace else? A lot of confusion here it seems, Victor, and the insult to injury here is that it could have been so much worse.",

Although there was some radio chatter at the end there where the American pilots were, like, wait, were we cleared to cross that runway? And the air traffic controller said, we'll pull the tapes and go back to the recording and listen.So, there's going to be a lot of investigation here, and of course they'll want to talk to the pilots involved, also listen to the air traffic controller recordings and then of course, the cockpit voice recorder. Were the pilots distracted? Did they think they were going someplace where they really weren't? There are typically a lot of warning signs on the ground, but the question here is did they just simply ignore them?",

This was a big moment, but Devin Willock, 20 years old, he was -- we now know ejected from the vehicle during Sunday's fatal single car crash.According to Athens Clarke County Police, he was pronounced dead at the scene. The UGA staff member, Chandler LeCroy, 24 years old was driving with Willock and two other passengers near UGA's campus in Athens, Georgia here at approximately 2:45 in the morning on Sunday. The vehicle went off the road, hit a couple of power poles, several trees, according to police. LeCroy died after being taken to the hospital. The two other passengers in the crash were identified as 21- year-old Georgia offensive lineman Warren McClendon who received minor injuries and 26-year-old Victoria Bowles who had more serious injuries, according to police. McClendon started at right tackle for UGA this season. Declared for the NFL draft earlier that day on Saturday. Willock played in all 15 games for UGA this season. LeCroy was a recruiting analyst for the program. But Willock in his final hours, just hours before the crash, Victor, he re-tweeted a tweet of a man who was with his grandson at the parade, and he had a picture of Willock standing next to his grandson. A young boy who luckily let him wear his championship ring, and he said a big thanks to him. He didn't have to do that. He said you went out of your way to make him feel special, and you made his day. So that was the final hours before Willock lost his life, along with LeCroy.",

Seeing that big smile again, holding up the heart hands and flexing, showing that he's coming back.But they did go through that emotional lull this past playoff game, and you mentioned now, in next week's divisional round, Victor, they will play those Cincinnati Bengals again, and we heard Tre'Davious White for the Buffalo Bills talking about how he still has images of that terrifying scene when he had to see his teammate's heart being resuscitated -- revived rather, on the field by paramedics, giving him CPR. And when they look across that field and they see that opposing helmet again, when they meet in Buffalo this weekend, is definitely going to be an emotional roller coaster of a journey before even kickoff begins.",
