We do know that she probably will not vote for Donald Trump. And she may even come out in and endorse Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democrats before the November election, which I think would be the Republicans and Donald Trump's biggest nightmare. And it's probably why he's injecting this question mark into this election for whatever reason he might think helps him.But again, this just goes into the weirdness of what this campaign is, and it gives us the opportunity to talk about the weirdness of Donald Trump. And again, that does nothing to take away from his base, but we know that his base will probably never leave him no matter what.

In fact, according to the polling, if anything, they think it has been not harsh enough on him. Just 27 percent of Americans think that the legal system has been unfair. So the fact is, most Americans have no problem with Hunter Biden being on trial. His favorability ratings are quite low. And it's something, when you look at the polling, why the White House I think is genuinely worried, because he's definitely, in their minds, potentially a liability for them, at least outside of Joe Biden.",

So a lot of the key players needed to get not only the Israelis on board and the Biden administration is clearly confident that they have the Israelis agreeing to the ceasefire proposal. But now to try to push Hamas to agree to the ceasefire proposal that is on the table. There have been some positive noises coming from Hamas, both in reaction to the UN Security Council resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire and to the proposal on the table. The question of course, is in the details and that remains to be seen because the process has fallen apart repeatedly on the details in the past. Still, Blinken knows who he has to convince here and that is the head of Hamas' military in Gaza, the most powerful person in the organization right now, Yahya Sinwar.

On the big picture perspective on how many Palestinians have been killed here, it is clear from these alleged messages that Sinwar views this as something almost necessary to push forward the Palestinian national cause. Here is another quote from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" \"In one message to Hamas leaders in Doha, Sinwar cited civilian losses in national liberation conflicts in places such as Algeria, where hundreds of thousands of people died fighting for independence from France, saying these are necessary sacrifices.\" It is that mindset that Blinken is trying to work towards agreeing to a ceasefire here.
