But it's not her calling conservatives the enemy within, right? Plus, in a stunning proposal, Republican leader in a battleground state reportedly wants to do away with the election process altogether and just anoint Trump that state's electoral votes.

So today on the campaign trial, both candidates are heading west to the Lone Star State, which you may correctly note is not a battleground state in the presidential race. It is solid red, although they do have Senate race there. But the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, will rally in Houston tonight, on a mission to persuade people to get out the vote while showcasing her issue of abortion rights in the state with one of the strictest abortion bans. Texas natives, Beyonce and Willie Nelson, will be there hoping to round up support for her. Further west in Austin, Texas, Donald Trump just spoke on one of his main issues, immigration and the border. But a few hours ago, two top Republicans came to Trump's defense in a rare joint statement House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called on Vice President Harris today to end what they call dangerous rhetoric against Donald Trump, saying in part, quote, the vice presidents words more closely resemble those of President Trump's second would-be assassin than her own earlier appeal to civility. Labeling a political opponent as a fascist risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before election day. Okay. So the two are Republican leaders expressing concern about Kamala Harris calling Donald Trump a fascist lets show an example of Harris doing exactly but McConnell and Johnson are taking issue with.

One of his top issues and as we've seen over the last several weeks now, Donald Trump has continued to really lean into inflammatory rhetoric and really demeaning language about immigrants. He repeated a line that he actually first stated yesterday in Arizona, where he likened undocumented immigrants to trash. He said that America was dumping ground for the world, calling it a garbage can and then went on to say that perhaps Kamala Harris should be disqualified from running because of her handling of the border.

Remember, we've heard him argue that undocumented migrants are poisoning the blood of the country, language that people have said, likens back to language used by Adolf Hitler.He's talked about, you know, arguing that day are criminals and rapists and other, you know, other horrible things about migrants. We've heard this before, but I think to put this into context, why is he doing this? Why is he leaning in heavily to this? It's because he thinks it's working. He tells his advisers he thinks this helps him get elected in 2016, that type of rhetoric, and he thinks it will help him again. And to argue that point, they say, look at the polling, he is doing better, he is closing the gap. He's doing even better than he has in recent weeks. And that's why he's continuing to use this language. So the question of is he going to stop doing this before Election Day, it's going to be the opposite.

Fascism is actually wanting to get rid of the filibuster. So what we're looking at issues of what are fascists activities as opposed to what are fascist rhetoric. The rhetoric gets hot. We all understand that there has been a president who's had two assassination attempts. I certainly see the concern of a Speaker McConnell and President McConnell and Speaker Johnson.

And there's some leaked intercepts obtained by Ukraine revealing the Russian soldiers were condemning the new recruits, asking what the F to do with them?What's your take on this? What does this tell you about Russia and Putin at this stage in the war against Ukraine? ESPER: Yeah, its very interesting development. I think at the tactical level, what it means or what it tells me is Putin is reluctant to mobilize another major tranche of Russian young men to fight in Ukraine. And so he's asked his -- now he's treaty partner, Kim Jong-un in North Korea to supply of troops and it's kind of interesting that he is deploying North Korean troops and its going to do so apparently in the Kursk region. So he needs to use North Korean foreign troops to push Ukraine out of Russia. I just think it's great. That's really rich. But the bigger strategic issue is this, Jake, this is evidence of a growing convergence between the autocracies of the world against the democracies of the world. And so, we saw over the past two-and-a-half years, North Korea providing munitions material to the Russians. Now they're providing troops. And what really concerns me is what is North Korea getting back in return or they getting new? Their weapons technology missiles technology, or God forbid the means to pair the two up and have the means to strike the United States with a miniaturized nuclear weapon, a top of an ICBM. That's my bigger concern here at the end of the day setting aside the tactical concerns and what Ukraine may face on the battlefield there.",

You might recall this story of beloved Stanford university soccer star Katie Meyer, who tragically died by suicide in 2022. Later that year, her parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Stanford, alleging that the university mishandled potential disciplinary action against Katie Meyer, which led to her suicide.Stanford says it strongly disagrees with that claim, but Katie's parents didn't stop there. They pushed for legislative action to try to fix this potential problem. And now, a California's public colleges and universities, a new law called Katie Meyer's Law offers students support in navigating what can be challenging and isolating situations on campus. I recently traveled to Los Angeles where I spoke with Katie's parents about this new law that they believe will save lives.

But this can happen to anyone. This is not a Democrat wrote this true. This is not a Republican issue. This is an American issue. We have an obligation patient to tackle it as such. And when you think about Katie story, I mean, she was a highly flourishing, remarkable all-in individual. When her parents told me she's won a national championship, captain of her team was an R.A., was a Mayfield fellow -- I mean, was about to give a Ted talk.

She said I tell them check on your strong friends, too. And so I think bringing awareness to the mental health issues in front of us as a nation, knowing that when you look at Katie's story, her parents will share with you that she had no health history of mental illness more mental health challenges.

And so, what Fetterman and I have done is come together, our surgeon general came out in June of this year and said social media needs warning labels and we think -- we fully agree. [16:55:04] You look at what morning labels have done in the industry like tobacco, warning people of the challenges and the health challenges that can occur from using, that's exactly what we want in the social media space. So, essentially, a warning label would pop up. It wouldn't prevent anyone from using it. It would just make them aware of the mental health challenges that can occur by usage. And as you click through to that, obviously, that would be determined by the surgeon general, what is said, but the one thing that Fetterman and I have said we want to make sure that there is a link to help included on that morning. And we envision that and being something like 988, telling people if you are struggling, we want you to click here. We want you to call this number. We want you to take this Texas number so that we can get you the help that you need. We're both parents and as Fetterman and I look at these issues, we look at it very similar to John and Steve as parents, who want to do what we what we can put up the proper guardrails that will allow our children to flourish and ultimately achieve their American dream.",
