I'm only doing it because I think I have a unique voice and perspective. And I'm very concerned that the country is off in the wrong track and that somebody has to step up and try to do something about it. It's what I have been talking about and focused on for years. And this gives me a platform to go down there and maybe actually try to bring people together and fix things, just like we did in Maryland, where I had a 70 percent Democratic legislature. And yet we got them to come together to cut taxes eight years in a row by $4.7 billion and accomplished a heck of a lot of other things by finding that middle ground where we can all actually get things done.
