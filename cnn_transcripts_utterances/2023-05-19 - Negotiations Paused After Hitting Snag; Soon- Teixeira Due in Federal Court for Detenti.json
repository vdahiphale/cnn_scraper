And it is not uncommon for this sort of thing to happen for them to all kind of take a step back and for it appear to be a real setback. So this isn't uncommon. What needs to happen next, though, is that they need to come back together and push ahead. Speaker McCarthy had said he wanted a deal in hand by the end of the week, if they could get it - so they could get it through the House and then get it through the Senate by that June 1st deadline.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, the reaction hasn't been all that dramatic. It's been negative, but I don't think that investors or economists are freaking out yet. If you look at the stock market, U.S. stocks actually opened the day mildly higher and then this debt ceiling impasse news hit and we saw the market go into the red.You can see the Dow is down about 115 points as we speak. I think there is some disappointment here because investors had been starting to get hopeful that maybe there could be a framework for a deal announced in the coming days perhaps as soon as Sunday when the President is supposed to have a press conference. That obviously does not look likely at this point. I did just talk to Moody's Analytics Chief Economist, Mark Zandi. And he told me, look, I always thought this was going to go down to the wire. He added, if the rhetoric is dark next week, markets will start to react. We'll see a lot more red on the screen. And by the end of the week, it'll be dark red. And he added that if this stretches through Memorial Day weekend, that's where you could see a 2011 style market freak out. Now, we're not there yet and hopefully we won't, not just because of the market reaction. It's because of the economic one, right? I mean there's a lot at stake in terms of higher borrowing costs and job loss. I mean, the White House has estimated that even a near default would wipe out about 200,000 jobs. So Brianna, I think the point here is, the longer that stretches out, the closer you get to that June 1st deadline, the greater the impact on the economy.",

Jason, it seems like when you look at this judge in the case has a lot of new evidence to weigh, particularly the fact that to Teixeira was warned repeatedly.

And then just last week in Iceland, there was a meeting of European leaders and the British Prime Minister, along with his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, both said that they would begin to form a group that would help get Ukraine F-16s and help train the fighter pilots. Now, President Biden has removed the - has made it possible for these NATO allies and partners like the Netherlands, like the Danish, like the Norwegians who have F-16 aircraft, that if they want to give them to Ukraine, the United States is not going to object. So the momentum has been building slowly diplomatically. But now it's reached this critical mass at the G7 and this is going to give Zelenskyy what he wants to improve their chances and the important fight against Russia. Now, the aircraft won't be in Ukraine's hands and the pilots not trained up ready for the counteroffensive expected soon. But Zelenskyy wants to be in the room with the G7 leaders. His advisors say it's extremely important that he wants to put clear proposals and give the other leaders their clear arguments for the steps that Ukraine is taking.
