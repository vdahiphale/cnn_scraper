He grabbed the steering wheel with one hand lunch at Engle with the other. And she has testified that Ornato told her about this later in the day on January 6, that's key. When did you hear this? And Engel was there; he did not disagree or correct any part of the story? Now, as you noted, both Ornato at an Engle they have met with a committee prior to Hutchinson's testimony. But this interview, this is the first time they've met with them since and now they have the opportunity to look at her testimony and corroborate it, correct it. And this is all happening as the committee is wrapping up its work.

It's good to have you on!You know, you look at the structure of this because it's Ticketmaster. But they merged with Live Nation, which is a concert promoter and actually owns a lot of the venues. I mean, if not a monopoly that strikes me as a competition problem here that they own so many parts of the business. LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR IN CHIEF, TECHRADAR: Yes, it's certainly a closed loop. And I have to say that the structure of it has always made it easy for ticket buying bots to win when they only have to go through one point of contact and set it up and they have time to prepare. They're going to beat the humans every time. Now, I should say that this is a question of scale. Because Taylor Swift is incredibly popular first time touring in five years.

This is that critical technology that was so critical during the shuttle era. I mean, just think about the Columbia accident. It was a damaged heat shield that caused that space shuttle to disintegrate when it reentered the Earth's atmosphere. So that heat shield there, this one can actually inflate in space. Right now the size of the heat shield is limited by the size of the rocket that it rides on. So this one inflates in space it could allow NASA to land people and protect them from those high temperatures on reentry on the surface of Mars and more cargo. Right now, Jim, the heat shields can only land about one ton on Mars, this would allow them to land between 20 to 40 tons on Mars. And you know I just have to say the actual name of this. It's called LOFTED a fancy NASA acronym; I had to write it down. The low Earth orbit flight test of an inflatable decelerator so this thing would slow it down it would protect them from the heat.
