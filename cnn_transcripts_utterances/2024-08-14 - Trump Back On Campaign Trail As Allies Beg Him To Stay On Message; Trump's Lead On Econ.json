      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, dollars and cents. Donald Trump heads to North Carolina today for a speech. His advisers say, we'll focus on the economic failures of the Biden, Harris administration, at least that's what his campaign hopes he'll focus on.Plus, why are African American men drifting away from the Democratic Party? Our friend Zolan Kanno-Youngs is here to share his reporting on a growing gender divide and what he calls the elephant in the room. Black men who hesitate about voting for a black woman. And are Republicans already laying the groundwork to claim the election is stolen. We're going to look at some of the language Trump is using about how Harris became the nominee. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. A shot of good economic news this morning, and anything that's good for your pocketbook is good for the Harris campaign. The inflation rate fell to 2.9 percent, the lowest in more than three years. That makes it more likely the Fed will lower interest rates next month, which means lower rates for mortgages, car loans and credit cards. But while prices may be rising more slowly, they are still rising. And they're almost 20 percent higher than when Joe Biden took office. Voters remain sour on the economy, which Republicans see as the key to their victory. Later today, Donald Trump will be in North Carolina, where he says -- where his advisers rather say that he will zero in on what they call the Biden, Harris administration's economic failures. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in Asheville, North Carolina. And Kristen, you've got some great new reporting on what to expect, at least according to the campaign from Donald Trump today.",

The Boston Globe's Jackie Kucinich, Zolan Kanno-Youngs of The New York Times, and Catherine Lucey of The Wall Street Journal.I just want to say, we obviously got the purple menu -- memo, I should say. I have butterfly envy, and there's a debate. And yeah, you can tell us at home whether Catherine's jacket is purple or blue, but I'm going to go with purplish blue. Back to the important issue at hand that Kristen just set up so well for us, which is what the Trump campaign is hoping that he accomplishes today in North Carolina. By the way, North Carolina being a state that -- I don't know four weeks ago, they thought they pretty much had locked up, and now the Democrats are hoping that it's in play for Kamala Harris. So, what are you hearing, Jackie, from your sources about the goals inside the Trump campaign on this critically important issue, the economy? JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: When you talk about Republicans, and I think Kristen got to this. They say this should be a very easy pitch to make to voters. They say, you know that based on inflation, based on her role in the White House, and based on some of the things that she said when she was running in 2019. This is someone. And you've seen it. You see it in some of the ads that are running from Trump and his allies. This should be someone. That should be very easy to put in, kind of the liberal box, right? And someone who is backing policies that might not be working. However, they're candidate is former President Trump. And he is -- he can stick on a teleprompter, and maybe he will today. But the problem is, the minute that those words get taken away, he fills it in with his own words, and those aren't necessarily helpful to the larger goal of winning the election.",

Inflation has hurt the Hispanic population so badly, but it's hurt everybody. But the people that you, largely your listeners, have been horribly hurt with inflation. Inflation has been caused to a large extent in terms of the region by the United States's policy on energy, and we're going to drill baby drill. She's never going to do anything about inflation.

And every minute, I think his advisers feel, every minute he is spending, talking about the economy, hitting Harris on inflation and tying her to Biden's policies, which are, you know, have been unpopular voters. That's effective. Less effective, obviously, is a lot of what he does spend his time talking about. So, the question is, can he focus on this?ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: That's the problem, right? He hasn't spent every minute trying to attach or even a majority, I mean, often in terms of staying on message and trying to attack the political vulnerabilities of what was the Biden, Harris agenda. The economy, and I would put immigration there as well. When you look at the polls, he has not been able to continue to just stay on message. Discipline isn't something we associate with the former president often when it comes to politics. I think we all knew that. So instead, you see him sort of attacking crowd sizes, and you know, he's saying -- making false accusations about the crowd sizes of Kamala Harris or looking to insult her name, the pronunciation of her name.",

And for the most part, again, this is in the context of Donald Trump and his world. He did it. So he is able to do it. It just -- I guess, depends on his head space.I just want to switch to a very different topic, which is the attacks that Tim Walz has been getting on his military record, served for 24 years in the National Guard and the Republicans, specifically J. D. Vance, who also is a veteran has been saying that he lied about his record, something that the Harris campaign has said that he misspoke when he said that he used a weapon in war, he wasn't in war.

He said something similar to what he posted after that comment on social media, which is, I support your service. I thank you for your service. It's not about that.

Election boards can demand more information and conduct inquiries before certifying results.And in addition to that, if you listen carefully to that very long rally that the former president did in Georgia last week, it might have gotten missed because the focus was on him trashing the Republican governor. But he was praising three Republican board members who were appointed to their jobs this year, saying that they're on fire, that they're pit bulls for transparency, honesty and victory. And it made some people go, OK, so you working the refs here a little bit. KUCINICH: Well, the Democrat on that panel warned of how this could be misused in an election. And so, the difference between 2020 and now, or in 2024 is that it was kind of ad hoc, right in 2020?
