At least 350 Israeli deaths are confirmed and more than 1500 Israelis have been wounded over the past 24 hours as intense fighting rages between Israel and Hamas. Retaliatory Israeli strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza reportedly have killed at least 313 people, that's according to Palestinian authorities. The IDF says up to 1,000 Hamas militants poured across the border early Saturday and invaded nearby Israeli towns. Disturbing video shows civilians being rounded up in one of them, presumably, to be taken to Gaza as hostages. A short time ago, Hamas claimed its fighters were still in southern Israel. Here's the Israeli Prime Minister on Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): What happened today has never been seen in Israel. And I will make sure that it does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas' capabilities. And we will take mighty vengeance for this black day that they have forced on the state of Israel and its citizens. All of the places which Hamas has deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn it into an island of ruins. I am telling Gaza's people to leave those places now, because we will take action everywhere. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Important to note that analysts suggest that Hezbollah -- Iran-backed Hezbollah, who has come out with a statement of support for Hamas and the Palestinians, say at this time, have something like 100,000 to 150,000 missiles at their disposal. And they've struck three sites and Israelis have struck back. But the idea of an escalation at that northern border is a real concern at present. And there are those who watch this sort of theatre very, very closely who say this seeming spectacular failure of intelligence on the part of Israeli intelligence forces may have been because they were so focused on a potential escalation to the north that they had to a certain extent their eye off the ball on that Gaza and Israeli border, once again, you know heavily fortified by the Israelis which has now been significantly breached to the tune of sort of 26 breaches at this present.

So being here in Israel, we know that about a thousand terrorists have infiltrated the Israeli border while rockets were launched from Gaza on Israel as a decoy. They infiltrated and brutally murdered. We're talking about hundreds of civilians and soldiers. We're talking about thousands being injured. And we did not speak yet about the numbers of people who were kidnapped from their beds, dragged by their hair. We're talking about elderly people with dementia. We're speaking about disabled people, about women and children. We're talking about humanitarian, a huge problem that would affect us for many, many years.

And we need to understand that there is a very interesting axis here in the Middle East. And we're talking obviously about the Iranian axis. Now, among other aims, the aim, maybe the main aim of this horrible attack was to sabotage the possible normalization with Saudi Arabia. Now Iran, who has been investing hundreds of millions of --",

But, as you mentioned there, there has also been some expression of solidarity with the Palestinian people from regional plays, including Saudi Arabia. And, of course, Saudi Arabia is in the process of exploring the possible normalization of ties with Israel. But we have heard from the Saudi Foreign Ministry while condemning the violence, also saying that the kingdom is repeating its previous repetitive warnings of the dangers of the situation blowing up as a result of the continuing occupation and depriving the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights. And this is a sentiment and message which has been echoed by others including the Arab League, Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen. We have seen protests and rallies and solidarity of the Palestinian people erupting in both Kuwait and Yemen. Of course, as you mentioned there, we have had expressions of support from Iran as well.

We paid a very heavy price. We are still counting the number of casualties.  Unfortunately it's hundreds. We also know about dozens of Israelis who barbarically were kidnapped in to Gaza. And we are talking about families, children of two years, three years old, elderly, crippled people. It is a barbaric situation. It reminds us, seems that we saw of ISIS a few years ago, but now it's here inside Israel. As we speak, we are still fighting few militants in the southern border. I believe that in the next few hours, we will be able to clear the entire area and then we will start to get ready for our attack. We will not sit idly by. We will attack Hamas.

And this attack is exactly what they had intended to do.We're not sure what it means for Iran, but Israel could not sit still after an attack like this. No country would sit still. The thing to remember as well, every time there are conversations about peace in the region, Palestinian militants are sabotaging this. This is exactly what happened around the Oslo Accord and why the Oslo Accord failed, because the Palestinians unleashed terrorist attacks all over Israel. So, it's not surprising that this is happening again while we're discussing peace with Saudi. I have to be clear here. There are no whataboutism about what happened today. There is no defending it in any way, shape or form. Democratic Socialist of America is hosting a rally tomorrow in New York City in order to support whatever just happened today. When you put women and children on trucks and elderly and babies and you take them into Gaza and parade them, there is no defending this.
