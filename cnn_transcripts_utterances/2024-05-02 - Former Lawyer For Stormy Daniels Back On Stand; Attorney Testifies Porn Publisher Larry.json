Right now, the defense is cross-examining the former attorney for Stormy Daniels.Trump, however, appears concerned about reports that he's falling asleep. Just before court resumed moments ago, he posted on Truth Social the following quote: \"I don't fall asleep during the crooked D.A.'s witch hunt, especially not today. I simply close my beautiful blue eyes, sometimes listen intensely, take it all in!!!\" Three exclamation points. Joining -- joining us now is reporter, Alayna Treene, who has been following the Trump campaign here this entire campaign. And CNN political commentator, Republican strategist and former Trump campaign adviser, David Urban. All right, so, David, I have to say I was in the courtroom the other day and I saw him lean back sometimes closing -- I saw that. I actually just am going to take this very seriously for one second and say, it did not appear to me that he was ever sleeping. He was paying attention just in various positions. However, the way he chooses to do this and focus on his beautiful blue eyes and the optics, he cares about the optics, David.",

It's probably killing him, right? it's probably killing him. He is -- he's usually, I'm sure, very caffeinated during the day.

It's a little confusing exactly what he was offering, but it appeared that he was offering her a million dollars and her -- her legal costs as well.I think it just underscores the seedy world that we're talking about, that they're operating in. Now here, defense attorneys are confronting Davidson with another recording in which he told Michael Cohen that Daniels wanted, quote, \"the money.\" And this is interesting because I think they're pressuring him here ahead of the election. And he's about, say, if he loses this election, and he's going to lose, we all lose all of our F'ing leverage. So here they're homing in on this question of leverage. Did you think that you had, quote, \"leverage\" over Trump ahead of the election? That's significant because, if you think you have leverage over someone, that speaks more to extortion as opposed to a mutually beneficial agreement where someone suppresses a story. Now Davidson confirms he said, if he loses, Trump, this election, and he's going to lose, we all lose all F-ing leverage. And this is what prosecutors are really hammering Davidson on, is this question of whether he was trying to extort Trump ahead of the election.",

They played a recording where, in fact, he uses the word \"leverage.\" Now this is another recording that they're playing where, in fact, Davidson uses the word \"leverage.\" So to Paula's point, trying to lay out the kind of extortion versus what an NDA actually is or means, the dynamic that they've been talking about throughout the course of this cross-examination.

You just -- you kind of learn people's rhythms.And he clearly knew Cohen's rhythm as being very erotic and emotional. So if he seems scripted, Davidson was right to be concerned. But remember, Davidson is the one who receives the money directly from Michael Cohen. At the heart of this case, there's an allegation that Trump then paid Cohen back and covered it up -- covered up that this was hush money and said this was for legal services or a retainer. But if you watch Davidson right now on the stand, you can see where some jurors might eventually wonder, well, was Cohen just doing what he needed to due to advocate for his client and protect him from extortion? I mean, so far, this has been a powerful cross for the defense and just raising some questions about what exactly happened in the days leading up to the election and what Trump was eventually reimbursement.",

And so whether or not jurors draw that direct connection, obviously, it's very much up to them. But it is certainly a central theme that we've gotten throughout the course of this cross.",
