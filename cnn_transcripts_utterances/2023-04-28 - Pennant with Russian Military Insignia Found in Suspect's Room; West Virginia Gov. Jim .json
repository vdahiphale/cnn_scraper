And now it is a desperate search for survivors amid the rubble. So far, we know that at least 17 people are dead after a Russian missile hit a residential building in the central city of Uman. And we are being told, the death toll is likely to continue to rise as we speak. This all happened just before 5:00 a.m. local time. So many of these people, asleep in bed. According to the Zelenskyy government, there were 46 apartments in that building, and 27 of them now destroyed. The CNN team on the ground is seeing bodies being removed from this decimated residential building. We saw it playing out live unfortunately as Nic Robertson was speaking to John Berman just earlier this hour. Sara?",

This pennant bearing the insignia of the Russian military's general's staff was found hanging inside the bedroom of Jack Teixeira. He's the Air National Guardsman accused of posting classified documents online. Teixeira was in court for a detention hearing yesterday. The judge has not yet ruled on whether or not he must stay in jail while he awaits trial. All of this has prompted the Pentagon to review how it vets individuals before giving them security clearances. CNN national security reporter, Natasha Bertrand, is joining us now. What more are you learning about what might change when it comes to getting security clearances?",

It is our chance right now. You know, if you look at the math and you look at everything, and you look at what happens if this doesn't happen in 2024.

He runs as I'm Joe Manchin, you know me.He has 100 percent name recognition. He's very good on the stump. And obviously he's gotten a lot of national attention over the last couple of years. So he is -- he's right there. He should not be -- if he gets in this race, that's the big question, he's not to be taken lightly. This is not a slam dunk. And if he does run, you've got to figure that even if -- even if the Washington Democrats are not thrilled with Joe Manchin, he's their only hope.

He's 75 years old. He's had a lifetime in politics. He could run for reelection, and it would be a blood bath in West Virginia, it would be a very tough election. He could not run again, but I think his attention span's very short, I think he would miss being in politics. Or, or, he can be a third party candidate for president. It is not lost on Manchin that 70 percent of the expected voters would like somebody other than Trump and Biden.
