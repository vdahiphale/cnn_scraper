      "sentences": "Policy, but it sounds like they're saying what you're saying, which is that you have to listen to what people are saying. And you feel like maybe you came in a little hot when you were running in the Republican primary.VIVEK RAMASWAMY (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, I take a look at the presidential campaign. I often judge - as a business leader I've been by results. The reality is, I came in with no name ID. Most people didn't know my name, let alone how to pronounce it. I wasn't even expected to make the debate stage. I beat a vice president, multiple former U.S. senators and current senators and governors. So, I'm proud of what we achieved. But at the same time I didn't achieve my goal of receiving the nomination and being the next president. And one of my learnings from that campaign was that there's a lot of distractions along the way. There's a lot of things that will pull you off of your original purpose. Don't seed to that temptation. So, as it relates to the race right now, what you bring up in the Democratic Convention, I think one of the things that's missing in this race right now is a rigorous debate on policy. You do get a lot of Democratic criticism of Republicans and of Trump in particular, including even that clip of Bill Clinton that you played, that it's built around a cult of personality. I see a little bit of projection right now. And right now we see a campaign that's built mostly around style rather than substance. And I do think Americans are going to be best served if this is an election built around competing policy visions for the future of the country. And I do think right now that's missing, if we're being very honest, from the Kamala Harris campaign and the Democratic - and the Democratic campaigns more generally.",

I - like it or not, Trump has offered deep policy specifics, from everything from a vision for a crypto currency and digital assets framework, all the way to his specific proposals of what tariffs he would or wouldn't impose, a clear position on how to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a clear position on mass deportations in this country and exactly what he would do to seal that southern border. You may or may not agree with the policies, but he has offered policy specifics at a level that we have not heard from Kamala Harris.And I do say this - I think it's accurate to say this. I think right now, so far, in her campaign, it's early, but I think the media has been covering for her absence of policy specifics in the same way they were covering for Biden's cognitive deficits for the course of three years. And I do think Americans are left off worse as voters when we don't get those hard answers. So, my advice to voters across the country would be, assume that her positions are what they were when she ran for U.S. president in 2020. That wasn't a long time ago. And if so, we ought to be having a debate about abolishing private health insurance, about taxes on unrealized capital gains, about the green new deal. That's the debate we need to be having, but we're not. And I think Americans are less well served as a consequence.",

These are issues we should be hitting hard on.Take that tax on unrealized capital gains. That means most farmers and most small business owners will have to pay taxes with cash they literally do not have. That is a formula for a great depression.

They've been spreading widely and sowing confusion on social media.So, researchers from the News Literacy Project, a non-partisan group, they analyzed more than 500 unique examples of election misinformation. They're launching a searchable database today, hoping to raise awareness and combat the lies. We got an early look at their data and found that about one in ten of these examples were actually the fake endorsements, like you just showed. Look at this, you showed it. I'll show it again. Just this past weekend, Donald Trump put this problem front and center when he shared these AI generated images of Swifties for Trump. Many of these images, especially that one on the top left, there's simply not real. They were made by a computer, designed to deceive. But it's not just Trump. The misinformation is coming from all angles. Here's another viral post from earlier this year claiming that Taylor Swift endorsed Joe Biden. She did not support him in 2020. She did support him in 2020, but has not yet weighed in in 2024. And here's one more, Kate. Look at this photoshopped image of actor Ryan Reynolds, supposedly wearing a shirt supporting Kamala Harris. Some of these lies are easy to spot, like this one is photoshopped. But others are far more sophisticated with AI, and they regularly rack up millions of views online. The News Literacy Project is hoping to fight back against this problem and stem the tide by releasing this dashboard so people can check it out for themselves. And it's just a good reminder for everyone out there that it's really on us, Kate, if people see something that's just too good to believe, an eye-popping celebrity endorsement, you might want to take a closer look before you hit that share button.",
