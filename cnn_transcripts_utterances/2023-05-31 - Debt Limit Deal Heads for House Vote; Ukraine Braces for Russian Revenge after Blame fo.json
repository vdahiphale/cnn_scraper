And what we've seen from the White House over the past few days is really this drum beat of communication. Making these one-on-one calls to Democratic lawmakers. The White House saying that they've called about over 100 members of Congress as this agreement came together over the weekend. But heading into tonight's vote, White House officials are aware they're not going to get every single Democrat onboard with this agreement. They just need enough Democrats onboard. Now the White House has not said how many Democrats they do believe will ultimately vote for this bill. But the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has said that he is taking Republicans at their word of being able to put up 150 Republican votes. If you do the math, that would then roughly add to about 70 Democrats that they would need to get this bill across the finish line. Now, you've heard this frustration from progressives and other Democrats in the party, not just with work requirements for Food Stamps but also the permitting reform for energy projects. The president himself has said that he's not sure if he can get all progressives onboard with this proposal. But one thing that officials in their pitch to lawmakers had been trying to stress is that this bill prevented many of the Republican priorities that they passed in that legislation previously, they prevented that from making it into the bill. So lawmakers need to look at this. Need to look at the need to avert a default for the first time in U.S. history. And they are hoping that they will be able to get enough Democrats onboard. Of course, throughout this process, they have stressed that this will need to be a bipartisan deal. And so they're hoping to get that across the finish line tonight in the House.",

They have been under a lot of pressure, Poppy, for the past couple of days.But a lot of those Russian strikes not only happening overnight but happening during the daytime hours, as well. And there certainly was the fear here on the ground and also among the authorities that there could be massive retaliation immediately after those alleged drone attacks that happened in Moscow, the Russian capitol, which as you pointed out, the Ukrainians are continuing to say they have nothing to do with. But the Russians are squarely saying they know that it was the Ukrainians that did this. So that was one of the reasons why there was that concern that there could be big strikes coming up. And you know, as you said, there are Ukrainian officials who are publicly speculating as to what exactly might be the case. The Ukrainians, for instance, saying the Russians might be reloading their arsenal, might be bringing more of those Shahed drones into place, as well. They also say, for quite some time, Popp, that they haven't seen any sea-launched cruise missiles from the Russians. So they fear that something like that could be in the works, as well. There's one official, an adviser to the interior ministry, who is speculating whether or not maybe that's -- drone attack in Moscow did have an effect on the Russian government, even though the Ukrainians are saying it was not them. That maybe it was something that could cause them to maybe slow down a little bit as far as the strikes in Kyiv are concerned. Again, very difficult to say.

Obviously, also, the Russians having to strengthen their border in the Belgorod region, as well. Of course, we had that cross-border raid by that anti-Putin Russian group just last week. And now, overnight, there were these considerable strikes, as the governor of the Belgorod region put it, that injured several people on the ground there in a small village called Shebekino (ph). Now, I was actually in that village in the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as we were stationed down here. It's a very small place. But certainly someone -- a place that's very close to an important military center for the Russians. So that's certainly something where we see that the Russians are under pressure on their own turf.

Well, we'll get to that in a second. Really, what the prosecution tried to do yesterday is not only establish that Robert Bowers was the one who killed 11 worshippers in Pittsburgh on -- in that synagogue on that day in October of 2018, but also that he did it specifically because those worshippers were Jewish, and he did so in a truly horrific fashion. And yesterday we really learned new details about just how violent and just how intentional that shooting was. Prosecutors said that Robert Bowers went through the synagogue room by room, methodically hunting Jewish worshippers. That's the prosecution's word. Now in the end of that shooting, the SWAT team, actually, from Pittsburgh got into a shootout with Robert Bowers. He eventually surrendered. And a SWAT officer asked Bowers, \"Why did you do this?\" And Bowers responded, according to prosecution, \"Because all Jews need to die. Jews are killing our kids.\" Now it's interesting, as we also heard from the defense yesterday in their opening statements, and they're not disputing any of the facts. They say, the defense attorney, Judy Clarke, said that Bowers' actions were incomprehensible and inexcusable. And that there will be no question as to that this was a planned act. However, the defense is asking the jury to consider if, in their words, his \"irrational motives\" and misguided intent, if those things fit with the 63 felony charges that he is facing. But Poppy, I want to walk through the 911 calls that you just mentioned at the top. You heard from Bernice Simon. You read that particular phone call. It was so harrowing. Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was the rabbi of the Tree of Life congregation. He survived the shooting. And they played one of his 911 calls in the trial yesterday. And it was harrowing. You heard him desperately trying to guide first-responders to the synagogue and to his room. And then prosecutors realized that there was a silence in the 911 call. So prosecutors asked Rabbi Myers, Why was there this science [SIC] -- this silence, rather? And Rabbi Myers said, \"I was praying, because I expected to die. I was initially trying to decide in that moment,\" Rabbi Myers said, \"whether I hang up the phone and call my wife or make a video for her. But he said, I thought if this was the end, I wasn't going to leave her, my wife, a message like this.\" So, again, just an incredible, intense day in the courtroom yesterday. And we're expecting to see more of that in the days to come -- Poppy.",

And I remember, I was actually in that courtroom when the judge announced that day, from a very beginning, that all these private claims, because everybody was suing the Sacklers, right? That they were going to be folded into the bankruptcy claim, because in the channels of bankruptcy. And so that is where the case proceeded. And all this negotiation for all these years has really been how much money of personal funds are they going to pay for victim compensation, for programs to abate.
