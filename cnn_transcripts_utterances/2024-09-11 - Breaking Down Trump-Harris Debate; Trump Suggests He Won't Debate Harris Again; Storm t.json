Those are the markets and these are the main events: Kamala Harris' big night, getting the best of Donald Trump in the debate and scoring an endorsement from Taylor Swift. Antony Blinken is in Kyiv to meet with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. The US is facing growing pressure to lift restrictions on long-range weapons. And Hurricane Francine is barreling towards Louisiana. Our weather team has the latest with landfall just hours away now. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, September 11th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. So she started with a handshake and ended with what most people are calling a win for the hour and 45 minutes in between, vice president and Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris repeatedly and literally gleefully baited Donald Trump, answering nearly every question with a comment seemingly designed to enrage the Republican former president. She criticized his policies, mocked everything from his rally crowd sizes, to his wild conspiracy theory about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets in Ohio. Those tactics seemed to work in her favor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: His former national security adviser has said he is dangerous and unfit.

Appreciate it. Now the economy was indeed a big debate topic. Harris promised middle-class tax breaks and a \"opportunity economy,\" and Trump pledged to reinstate tariffs against China and Mexico to bring more cash into the US while bashing Harris for the rise in inflation since he left office. Now, a new report out this morning finds inflation hit its lowest level since 2021, with the Consumer Price Index dropping to 2.5 percent over the year ending in August. Joining me now to talk about all of this is Julia Chatterley. She is anchor of CNN's \"First Move.\" I know how closely you've been looking at all of this, Julia. So tell us, VP Harris called this an opportunity economy, right, during the debate, did she -- was she able to flesh it out enough for voters to really take the measure of what she is talking about? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": I am not sure how much flesh they were really looking for. The headlines continue to be splashy, the details remain utterly lacking. If we can talk about those sort of four main pillars of what she has talked about, remember, tackling inflation, price gouging. I think we can write that off, support for housing. People across the united states who are in an affordability crisis, we need it, by just giving first-time buyers $25,000.00 as she has talked about in the past, set to add to prices. Some of the other things, the support for working families, child tax credits, support for drug prices, those things I think would be welcome if she can get them through Congress. The other thing of course has been that big increase proposal in the tax deduction for startup businesses, assuming they're making money at any point in the first year, which is the key. Look, the total cost of this, $1.7 trillion. I said the word splashy and I meant it. She could offset that to the tune of around $1 trillion by raising corporation taxes, and perhaps, that's part of the nervousness that we saw in stock markets today. If she is more likely to win the election as a result of what we saw yesterday. But for comparison, Paula and we need it, Penn Wharton have looked at what Trump's spending and tax proposals are and they say that that could cost up to $4 trillion over the next 10 years. So yes, if he is Harry Potter, she is Hermione Granger. We will see what they can actually get through Congress and that's the key.",

They're paid by US companies and they're passed over to US consumers, so they are inflationary. At the most extreme case of what he has proposed, you're talking a cost of around for the average US household an extra cost of around $3,900.00 -- let me get my facts straight -- annual cost. But we are not also talking about the risk potentially of a trade war being created as other countries around the world start raising their own tariffs in response. This is also something that he doesn't need Congress for. He could enact these with executive orders. Moody's has said that if you combine the tariffs that he is talking about with the immigration, tighter restrictions on immigration, it could add a percentage point more to inflation next year and that's going to slow the Fed down and that's something that borrowers in this country are desperately hoping for, of course, is lower interest rates. So that for me remains the real kicker and he is talking about tariffs to tackle almost everything it seems when he is talking about potential future policy. So this is the danger point and I don't think markets will like this either, but they don't like uncertainty and I think we are as confused as ever after that debate on them who could potentially win this.",

All that they've gotten so far is the Secretary of State saying that he spoke about it with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he will speak about it with President Biden. That President Biden will then speak about it with the British prime minister. Obviously, the Ukrainians also would like to use some of the British longer distance weapons to strike inside Russian territory. So it seems as though there might be movement as far as that is concerned. But as of now, right now, there really isn't anything substantive to indicate that in the near future, the Ukrainians would be allowed to strike deeper into Russian territory, which for them they say is extremely important especially if they want to at least try to, to a certain extent shut down some of the airfields that the Russians are using to launch those fighter jets that then drop those devastating glide bombs that are really tough for Ukrainian frontline troops -- Paula.",

We tried to build as democratic free Afghanistan with equal rights for men and women. We realized after some years that that was too ambitious. That was something that required too much. So I think one of the lessons learned from Afghanistan is the dangerous mission creep. We started in 2001. That was right, to go in and to fight al-Qaeda, to take Osama bin Laden, so what started as a focused counterterrorism operation, moved into a big ambitious, nation-building mission and that mission creep was too much because reality was that we didn't have the resources.

I know you're saying with meat, but no, she is not showing up for the voters. That is what they are saying in polling.",

She is going to do a lot more one-on-one interviews. She is going to go and do talk to local media. She's going to talk to Hispanic media. She's going to talk to black media. She's going to talk to specialty media. And I think that's exactly what she needs to be doing. And look, I believe that, you know, Evan is right. I think Republicans really set the bar really low and it's really puzzling to me that they would think that somebody as accomplished as her, who was a prosecutor and a D.A. for San Francisco, an A.G. for California, a senator for California and vice president for three and a half years is going to sit there and do word salad. I mean, that to me is a huge underestimation of who Donald Trump is against. And that is exactly what was shown last night. I mean, if they thought that she was going to ramble, what did they think their candidate did? I mean, he could not put together two coherent words last night. It was the contrast between somebody who was thoughtful and presidential and showed leadership and was forward looking and was generational change, and somebody who was just old and decrepit and crazy.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be because when you look at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her. So I think ABC took a big hit last night. I mean, to be honest, their news organization, they have to be licensed to do it. They ought to take away their license for the way they did that.

You might summarize it as darkness versus light or some of your previous guests did, you know, youth versus age, wisdom versus a younger generation. There are a lot of contrasts here and the questions from the ABC moderators helped us see those contrasts. There were also a lot of points to follow up on. Harris did answer some new policy questions, but there are lots of follow-ups. So both viewers and journalists came away perhaps wanting to know more and having follow-up questions to ask. So overall, I think these are reasons to rate this debate a big success because viewers did come away better informed, not just about Harris, because she is the new person here, the new nominee, but also more informed about how Trump is handling the stress of this race now that Harris is his opponent.",

He is claiming that his campaign will think about it.He says he might do it with NBC or FOX, but he is not committing. The Harris campaign right away, said, yes, let's debate again in October. They clearly felt confident at the end of last night's debate. Trump, however, has several chances -- has had several chances today to commit and he has not committed. I do think he will eventually debate her again. I do think he will. I'm not willing to put money on it, but I do think he'll do it. As for the ratings, we don't have the official numbers yet, but what it looks like so far, at least 60 million viewers tuned in via television in the U.S. That's even than the higher than the CNN debate in June between Biden and Trump. That CNN debate was about 51 million plus. You know, it's impossible to know for sure because we're talking about a global event that's also livestreamed and then clipped all around the Web. So, you know, we were talking about these ratings, these are the base levels.

Now, Hurricane Francine is heading towards Louisiana and is expected to make landfall in the next few hours. Right now the eye of the storm is just off the coast. You see it there, but strong winds and heavy rain are already hitting the southern parts of the state. That is where we find CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. He is in Morgan City, Louisiana.

In fact, the National Weather Service, the national agency here in the United States, that forecast for these storms alongside the National Hurricane Center warning that it is this period, this next hour when the northern and northeastern eyewall of this hurricane that is the most intense part of the storm moves on shore and clearly, with what I'm experiencing and what your viewers see at home we are experiencing just that. Now, it's not hurricane force just yet because it would be more difficult to stand up. But here in St. Mary Parish, there are voluntary evacuations for some of the low-lying areas. There is a mandatory curfew, of course, that is citywide near Morgan City where I'm located. There's also a flood wall that protects the city that's nearest to me, but we're actually outside of those protected areas to talk about the vulnerabilities of the coastline of Louisiana. Louisiana, if you look at a map, there's also a lot of marsh low-level, low-lying areas. And where we're standing now is only about six feet roughly two meters above sea level. So when you're talking about a storm surge forecast that's between six to 10 feet, you understand the threats there as the low sea-level just extend so far inland. And it extends out into the Gulf of Mexico as well. Every time one of these more intense rain band comes through, you feel almost as if you're getting the backwash of a jet engine just spiking your face, spiking any exposed parts of your body with a sting. And that's actually just raindrops that are pelting at this moment in time. It is now, according to the National Weather Center, over the next couple of hours as Francine makes landfall, most critical for people of Terrebonne Parish to my east and St. Mary's Parish, where I'm located, to be in their shelter and to ride out this hurricane in their safe place as the most intense part of the storm is approaching now as you can see. We're currently under a flash flood warning, a hurricane warning and a tornado watch. So we have kind of this triple effect of threats that are coming together as the strongest part of the hurricane approaches. It doesn't take much to spin up a tornado. We're monitoring the radar. We're monitoring the conditions closely and of course with wind gusts that have been measured on the eastern eyewall, and some buoys in the Gulf of Mexico, Paula, over 150 kilometers per hour. If those make their way on shore it will be virtually impossible to stand in those conditions here coming up -- Paula.",

As you can see in the FOX poll from last year, more than half of registered voters view her favorably, and that breaks down to 68 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans.
