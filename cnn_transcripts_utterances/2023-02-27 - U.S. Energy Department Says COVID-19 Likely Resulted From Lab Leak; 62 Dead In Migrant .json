Our Christine Romans is here to make sense of these varying outlooks. Also, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis releasing another book this week. Is this a step in his bid for the White House? And snow in Southern California and tornadoes in the middle of winter. We're tracking this powerful storm as it tears through Oklahoma. Take a look at this -- this new video -- wow -- just in from Norman. Two homes with roofs ripped off and neighbors will now have to pick up the pieces. We are live from Norman, Oklahoma just ahead.",

      "sentences": "Also this morning, new intelligence has prompted a notable change in the Department of Energy's report on what most likely caused the coronavirus pandemic. The Energy Department now says that a lab leak is the most likely origin, according to this updated report.But there is some really important context here. Sources tell CNN that the agency says it has, quote, \"low confidence\" in the assessment. A low-confidence assessment usually means that information is not reliable enough or really kind of just too fragmented to make a more definitive judgment. The FBI has come to the same conclusion as the Department of Energy with moderate confidence. But several other American agencies believe that the pandemic started with natural transmission, though they also have low confidence in those assessments. The CIA -- it's still undecided. So, of course, a major question is will we ever know the origin for sure -- something that is obviously vitally important. CNN's national security reporter Natasha Bertrand and our CNN correspondent David Culver who actually reported from the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan at the beginning of the pandemic are both joining us this morning. No two better to talk to this -- people to talk to this about. Natasha, when we get this update from the Department of Energy the major question that I had and that a lot of people have is what changed? Why are they now making this assessment even if it is with low confidence?",

Now it appears that they have shifted their assessment to a low-confidence assessment that this virus did originate in a lab.However, as you mentioned at the top there, it is a low-confidence assessment and that indicates that the intelligence really was not strong enough for them to make any kind of more definitive judgment about where this virus actually came from. But it is notable because it just adds, right, to the split that we're seeing in the intelligence community about where this virus originated. And right now it seems like we just don't have any good answers as to where this came from primarily because the U.S. has had a lot of difficulty in getting China to cooperate with this investigation, right, without that kind of on-the-ground presence by the U.S. intelligence community and by scientists in Wuhan where this virus is believed to have started. It's really difficult for the intelligence community to have any kind of real kind of smoking gun as to where this virus originated short of, say, intercepted communications, for example, which the IC does not seem to have at this moment.",

It said, \"The IC and the global scientific community lacks clinical samples or a complete understanding of data from the earliest COVID-19 cases. China's cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19.\" So again, without this kind of on-the-ground analysis by the U.S., by Western governments, by really anyone who wants a definitive explanation here of what happened, it's going to be really difficult to come to that final judgment guys.",

But it's become so politicized within China -- one of the most sensitive issues -- that it's very unlikely that you'll ever get to that level of cooperation that Natasha was talking about.I mean, the Chinese look at this as something that has become so severely politicized and become a geopolitical issue from the U.S. perspective that they've launched their own propaganda campaign against it that has been relentless. I mean, they point to a lab outside of Washington, D.C. at Fort Detrick, that they say yes, there is a lab leak we're talking about but it's one in the U.S. And then the U.S. Army -- one spokesperson for the Minister of Foreign Affairs in China had said -- brought it over to Wuhan in 2019. No evidence of that. And, of course, that's just something that they've been putting out into the narrative to muddy the waters, to sow doubt, and deflect blame here. That cooperation that you talk about in trying to get international scientists together -- they did have a field study. It happened in January of 2021. The WHO went there and yes, as the Chinese pointed out this morning, they said it's highly unlikely this started from a lab in Wuhan. But the WHO also asked to go back for a phase two. The Chinese said that is not going to happen. They denied that request. And even early on, as the WHO field team was there on the ground in Wuhan, guys, they were denied a lot of the data firsthand. So imagine trying to investigate a crime scene -- and this was pointed out to me by one of the investigators -- and you're sent there a year later after it was heavily sanitized and essentially wiped clean.",

You wrote, \"It's an instructive window into DeSantis' governing beliefs which, at times, seem to collide with his current leadership style but may soon inform his platform as he seeks higher office.\" What does it tell us? CONTORNO:  Yes, and that book was called \"Dreams From Our Founding Fathers,\" which obviously sounds a lot like President Obama's memoir \"Dreams From My Father.\" And it was a full-throated defense of the Tea Party, of limited government, of separation of powers. It was really critical of President Obama for -- you know, he said overreaching and using the bully pulpits to force his political views on people and using executive powers in ways that we have not seen before in the country -- and that was his case. You know, flash forward more than a decade later and Gov. DeSantis has often led in that style. He is using the power of the executive branch to force his will on a lot of state institutions and businesses here. He was critical of Obama -- the sort of messianic language around Obama. And the last ad of his presidential -- or excuse me, his campaign for governor last year was a suggestion that God made him on the eighth day.

How he's tested there.A main audience for this book Steve also seems to be donors, which is going to be something that all these Republicans who are running for president will be going after. He talks about how his view on corporations -- how they should respond to what he refers to as this woke culture. Obviously, we saw what he did with Disney and the way he's basically framing Florida. What did you read into that over how he handled that and how that translates to what he would look like on the national stage?",

We've seen some of the biggest donors in the Republican Party from the last midterm cycle already pouring money into his campaign. He has received $4.5 million from three different donors in the last month alone. He has $71 million left over from his previous campaign.

In fact, this past weekend in Palm Beach, like I said, a lot of these people were huddled up with him right in Trump's backyard. These are people who gave to Trump in previous cycles now aligning themselves with DeSantis as he ramps up his activity.",
