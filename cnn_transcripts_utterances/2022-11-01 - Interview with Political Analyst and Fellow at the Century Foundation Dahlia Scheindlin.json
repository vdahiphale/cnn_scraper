In Kyiv, a city with a pre-war population of some 3 million people, the mayor says 80 percent of residents were left without water on Monday. And while power is gradually being restored, one Ukrainian energy company warns it's running out of equipment to make repairs. Ukraine's military says it was able to shoot down 45 of the 55 cruise missiles fired by Russia on Monday. Russian President Vladimir Putin says those strikes are not all his military can do. But Mr. Zelenskyy says Ukrainians will not be intimidated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Russian terrorists do not have such missiles that can hit the Ukrainian desire to live, live in a civilized manner, and take care of each other. And if someone over there in the Kremlin listen to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine would help put pressure on Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised that their losses when they see how Ukrainians conduct negotiations in the dark.

Russia made that move after blaming Ukraine for an attack in Crimea. CHURCH (voice-over): Russia claims movement on the Black Sea grain corridor is now suspended and warns using it would be risky. Still, about a dozen ships could be seen using it on Monday. The E.U. is calling on Russia to reverse its decision over fears it will affect the global food crisis. CHURCH (on camera): And for more on this story, I'm joined now by Clare Sebastian, joining us live from London. Good morning to you Clare. So, the E.U. condemns Russia's decision to suspend its participation in the Black Sea grain initiative, but Ukraine is sending grain ships to sea anyway. So, what is the latest on this? And of course, what are the risks involved for those ships? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Yes, Rosemary. The latest is that Russia says that it has suspended its participation. It has not fully exited the deal, clearly leaving the door open in order to provide itself with leverage against Ukraine. It is still allowing these diplomatic overtures to try and change its mind to go ahead. There was a call late Monday between foreign minister -- Russian Prime Minister Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart. The Turkish side clearly wants to salvage this deal. It has been a key broker in this really only diplomatic achievement of this war, so far. So, that call went ahead. But meanwhile, both Sergey Lavrov and President Putin are claiming that the reason why they have had to sort of temporarily, in their words, pull out of this deal is because they say that Ukraine has violated the safe maritime corridor that was created for ships under this deal through this alleged drone attack on Crimea over the weekend. This is something that President Putin is sticking with. Have a listen to what he said on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): Those drones, both undersea and air drones happen to be partly in corridor, through which the grain from the Ukraine has exported. They created risks for both our ships, we should provide security for the grain export as several ships who are taking care of it. But we've made commitment to provide security. But if pardon me for the expression, Ukraine here, so ships will be the ones to blame. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if this was the only problem, it would be bad enough. But this thing happening at a time that the world is in turmoil is terrible. Let me just say one other thing that, you know, with all its issues and problems right now, what we are dealing with is an affordability crisis. What that means is that food is there, but it maybe it's not at the right place, maybe it's not at the right cause or right price, but it is there. But the problem is that if we don't sort out the fertilizer issue, which also comes or should come from this corridor, and from Russia and from other countries, today's affordability crisis will turn into tomorrow's availability crisis, meaning there would not be enough food. Imagine what that would do to the prices, and in this particular environment. So this is, this is not only about today, it is also about tomorrow. And you know, growing food takes time.

Anything could happen after the elections. But he still has the best possibility to reach what Israelis now consider the magic number of a bare majority of 61 parliamentary seats out of 120. The average of all of his parties in the polls over the last campaign cycle has been around 59, creeping up over the 60 seat mark out of 120 seats. If that trend continues, it's not impossible that he would get 61 or even more. That would be a surprise, it would go beyond what we're seeing in the polls. But he does have that block. The problem is that the parties who are running against him, who want to form a coalition that he does not lead, they're not sufficiently united. So, at present, the blocs appear to be even. Those other parties representing -- many of them representing the outgoing government have about 60 seats themselves, but they are not sufficiently united. That's one of the reasons the government fell apart. So, it is certainly a possible scenario, he would be going in with the Religious Zionist Party that you mentioned in your report, which is very extremist, nationalist, supremacist, Ukcratic Party (PH), and to ultra-orthodox parties who often sit in Israel's coalition.

As your report pointed out, people are fatigued, but from everything we can see in the surveys, overall, voter turnout looks set to be typically high. Israel generally has high voter turnout. Last time, it was over 67 percent.As far as we can see, it will probably be in that range. But the big concern is that the Arab citizens of Israel have been indicating that they will vote at a much lower rate than the Jews, which is a typical pattern also in recent years. It could be anywhere as low as the mid to upper 30 percent range or as high as 50 percent, but very few predicted it will go above 50 percent, and that will be a critical distinction. You know, in terms of the issues of the campaign, it's complicated because, of course, Israelis are worried about cost of living, dealing with the price hikes like everybody else in the world, but they don't really distinguish between the parties based on economic themes. It's much more about -- in Israeli it's much more -- in terms of issues, it's about the Israeli Palestinian conflict and security. And we have seen serious escalations over the last number of months. That's very top of mind, including attacks and ongoing raids of Israelis in Palestinian cities and attacks of Israelis. So, all of that certainly -- generally helps the right-wing, pushes people to vote for more right-wing parties. But I really think that, ultimately, at this point, fifth election in less than four years, most people are choosing based on which block, The Netanyahu supporting block or those who are opposed to Netanyahu. They see the same issues but just believe whichever side they support will resolve them better. CHURCH:  All right. We will see what happens.

This dramatic video showing the moment that the bridge fell apart and plunged into the water. The bridge had only recently reopened from scheduled maintenance. Police have arrested nine people in connection with the accident. Funerals and cremations began Monday for some of those who died in the accident. The Indian government has agreed to compensate families of the victims.And CNN's Vedika Sud joins me now from New Delhi.

Now, like you pointed out, this bridge was under maintenance and repairs for more than six months and had just reopened last week. One would imagine that this bridge obviously would be foolproof in terms of any kind of weakness in terms of the way they had repaired it. But in this case, it just collapsed.You had at least 200 people on the bridge when the incident took place. It was holiday season. India has just completed its celebration Diwali, one of the biggest Hindu festivals which is on the 24th. And then, there was the Ugadi new year, celebrated in that state, particularly where people are in holiday spirit, more than -- they take their children to different places within Gujarat to celebrate the occasion. And that's the reason why you see more than 30 children dead in this mishap. Most of them were with their families. Some lost their friends, some lost as many as 12 family members. And they are all asking, Rosemary, who should be hold accountable? It's all very well to arrest nine people on day two of the incident. What we know is that these are junior officers from that company that was given the contract. But what about the owners? What about the administration who gave the go ahead for this bridge to be reopened? Was it given a (INAUDIBLE) certificate and what is the government doing to investigate? All of these questions. It took just 20 cents for these people to get onto that bridge, but it has cost them their lives, or the lives of their dear ones, Rosemary.",

I guess the concern is, what sort of sentences will be handed out to these protesters? More than 1,000 according to the chief justice of the judiciary will be publicly tried this week. He said that these trials will be for people who \"have carried out acts of sabotage in recent events, including assaulting or marching (ph) security guards, setting fire to public property.Now, these protests, as we know, were sparked by the death of 22-year- old Mahsa Amini back in mid-September after she was arrested by the Morality Police for wearing an improper hijab. As a result, you know, people week after week, you know, very much a student-led, very much female-led have taken to the streets. And we saw those violent clashes over the weekend when there were protests staged at university campuses right around the country. Police firing tear gas. There were reports of live bullets as well, Rosemary. We know that according to human rights groups and activist, more than 200 people have been killed over the past seven weeks, thousands have been arrested, and that is a very conservative number. Now, we have also heard from a mother of a 22-year-old protester who says that her son has been sentenced to death. She is pleading that he be saved, Rosemary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MASOUHMEH AHMADI, MOTHER OF MAN GIVEN DEATH SENTENCE (through translator):  They are treating my child unfairly. They have interrogated him without an attorney present. And in that very first session of the court, they have sentenced him to death. Is this Islamic justice? In what court do they issue an execution sentence in the first session? And they want to execute the sentence equally quickly. Please, please, help and support us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
