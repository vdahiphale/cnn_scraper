It's been three days since the end of Title 42, the pandemic-era policy that slowed the number of migrants allowed into the U.S. With Thursday's expiration, many border communities were bracing for a surge of migrants. But at least for now, that has not happened yet. Homeland Security officials say there were about 4200 encounters yesterday as they call them. That's a big drop from the day before. And yesterday's numbers are less than half of the 10,000 seen at the U.S.-Mexico border in the days before Title 42 ended. Just minutes ago, we heard from President Biden as he completed a bike ride. And here's what he had to say about the situation down at the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But they're there with the hopes that they may be able to have an opportunity to enter legally, safely, orderly, and to be able to offer their children a space where they can be safe.That's all they're looking for. And so I think that's what we're seeing, you know? Families, children. And, yes, of course a lot of young men that are entering. I think all of this has to do with the fact that Title 42 just attracted them to come because it's going to be lifted and they're going to have a chance to enter. So now they're seeing the reality that it's not quite that so, you know. You enter, and if you don't do it correctly, you could very easily be deported back to your country. ACOSTA: And some border officials are cautioning that a surge could come later with perhaps up to 14,000 migrants arriving every day. Is that the kind of estimate that you are getting prepared for?

And I think that thanks to our collaboration, we're able to successfully make that happen.And we are ready to make sure that we can provide them with a safe space. And so, yes, if that should happen later on, numbers increase, we're prepared for that, and we hope that we can help every single person that arrives and has been given to us to make sure that nobody's hurt and that everybody is safe.

So back to your question, and, listen, taking a snapshot in time is a snapshot in time. This issue has been going on -- as a matter of fact, I was digging around in my office. I don't know if you can see this or not. This is a Homeland Security Committee briefing book I just happened to see on my disheveled office in here.It's dated 2014, and we're dealing with the field hearing crisis on the Texas border surge of unaccompanied minors. You remember that. That was nine years ago. So this has been going on for a really long time. We've had now three administrations that dealt with it. I'm very biased in my observation as I think we had this issue in hand four years ago with the programs that we had in place. The message was clear. It's not just a casual walk across the border to get into the United States. And so I think you have to go back to some really strict enforcement of the border. You have to have a system in place where you can allow for legal immigration, and you have to have these countries south of the border working with you. And I think we may have failed there more often than we were successful in getting these countries in Central America and Mexico. So there's a lot of work to be done, and we've got a real problem on our hands, and we don't know who these people are. And that's the real challenge. So -- but we need to -- we need to come together. This deal ended in a circle and pointing to the left and saying it's their felt. We know how to do this, so let's, you know -- saying this is easier than it is to get it done. I recognize that.

I was a total and absolute against legalization of drugs, and I still am from the standpoint of recreational use and what have you.But these compounds, when they're used with the right dosage, well, obviously the right diagnosis first, the right dosage, the right guiding through these experiences and the follow-up, those four things together, and we're seeing some extraordinary benefits from. Let me just give you one example up in New York in the V.A. There's a Dr. Rachel Yahouda who's overseeing a program there. I think they had two phase three trials behind them now using MDMA, the old rave drug ecstasy. And the benefits of that, the results of those trials are stunningly good. For instance, and I'll try to brief here, three doses two weeks apart to these veterans who had post-traumatic stress symptoms, either depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, suicidal thoughts, or all four in a lot of cases, after six months, after three doses, 70 plus percent of those individuals had zero symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Jim, I don't know. To me, that is stunning results. It's one that we as a country need to get behind. It's my understanding that the FDA is going to approve for taking off of Schedule 1 MDMA in the fall. I think that is very wise. I think the V.A. is supporting that, and all Americans should. If you care about these kids' lives, young men and women who put their lives on the line for us, we were at war for 20 years, which is a whole another story. But for 20 years they've been in combat, and to be able to give them their lives back after they literally put their lives on the line, and sadly some are between 16 and 20, are still committing suicide every day.",

There was a 20-year-old who was also then taken to the hospital. He later died as well. And there was a 16-year-old who was taken to the hospital in Yuma and had to be flown to Phoenix because of his injuries. And so among the other victims who were wounded, you have a 15-year- old, two 16-year-olds, an 18-year-old. And so these are all teenagers or young adults who were essentially at this party, and something happens. And that's exactly what authorities are trying to figure out. So far they say they don't have the shooter. They don't have the motive. They don't know how this all happened. And unfortunately this is not the first incident that we're reporting when it comes to teenagers or young adults who are being shot. Just this month, one shooting in Texas left a 16-year-old dead and a 19- year-old in Mississippi also a victim of one of these shootings. And last month, a number of shootings involving teenagers, including that 16-year-old birthday party that left four people dead in Alabama. So unfortunately this is not something that we have not seen. We're seeing this all over the country, whether it's in Yuma, Arizona, or in Alabama.

Joining me now is one of the Georgia lawmakers pushing for change in that state, Democratic State Representative Teri Anulewicz. State Representative Anulewicz, thank you so much for being with us. I guess your thoughts on all of this? The governor has already ruled out a special session. He's accusing Democrats of playing politics with this. But where does it go from here? TERI ANULEWICZ (D), GEORGE STATE HOUSE: So I think where it goes from here -- and thank you for having me on to talk about this and to talk about what I'm hearing and seeing on the ground here in Georgia. I think what happens next is we need to, as citizens, as the normal workaday Georgians who want to see these commonsense gun measures that the Democratic Party is asking for, to continue to keep urging not just the governor but also their state representatives, their state senators, the speaker of the House, and the lieutenant governor, who can also call this special session if three-fifths agree.",

We live in the area that the gunman fled to, so my kids' high school was on a lockdown. The middle school was on a lockdown. All the soccer practices were canceled that evening.So when you're talking about these mass shooting events, they're impacting far more than even the people who were directly involved.

So, you know, there's obviously lots of different kinds of apps and sites that have an impact on music whether you're talking about YouTube or SoundCloud or TikTok, redefining music consumption. But it's really those streaming platforms, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and others that are game changers.And they're game changers because you're less likely to own or download music in the 2010s. You're not going to hold a physical piece of music in your hand. You're probably going to subscribe to one of those companies and you're going to stream music from one of their servers. And that has a lot of pluses and minuses. For fans, that's huge because suddenly they have access to way more music than they ever imagined they could. Also they have way more power at their fingertips to be able to help define what becomes a hit and which artists rise to the mainstream. But on the other hand, it really makes a lot of changes for a number of artists who struggle to earn revenue or traditional revenue in the music industry because of the economics of streaming sites, and the way that they impact the middle class of music.",
