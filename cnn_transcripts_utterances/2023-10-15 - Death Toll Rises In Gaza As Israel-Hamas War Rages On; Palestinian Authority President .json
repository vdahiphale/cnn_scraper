For the first time since that barbaric terror attack in Israel, the president of the Palestinian Authority is condemning the killing saying, quote, \"The actions of Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people.\" In the meantime, the death toll has now risen to over 1400, including 30 Americans. Sources now tell CNN that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has invited President Biden to visit even as Israeli forces prepare for a massive ground offensive. At this hour, troops continue their suffocating blockade the Gaza Strip. Israeli Defense Forces say they had killed one Hamas commander today amid a barrage of some 250 strikes across Gaza. You can see much of the rubble there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL JONATHAN CONRICUS, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We are hunting Hamas commanders. Everybody from the butcher of Khan Younis, Yahya Sinwar, the political leader, and everybody down from him, are dead men walking. We've been able to kill quite a few Hamas commanders, some of them senior, some of them tactical commanders. And that is a priority in our targeting campaign as we speak. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's sort of I would say like a blue reflective that you might see in sunglasses that some people have. It looks like that from the outside. But it gives them excellent night vision. So they have incredible advantage when it comes to night fighting. So there have been many who have expected that such an assault would begin in the evening. Obviously, it is still quiet here tonight, and in fact, in these past few hours, quieter than it has been. We've become very accustomed to the thud of explosions in Gaza, here in Tel Aviv, not hearing so many, but I will say we have heard more rocket, incoming rocket fire into Tel Aviv in these past 10 hours or so, maybe six hours. And some of those without accompanying sirens, which interestingly enough, our Clarissa Ward also said she'd experienced to the south of here in Ashkelon. And I want to turn now to Nic Robertson.

It came in the form of a report on WAFA, the Palestinian news agency about a phone call he had with Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela. In that phone call, he said that the actions of Hamas do not represent the Palestinian people.He went on to call for the end of attacks on civilians, but he also said, the so-called Israeli aggression on Gaza has to end. So, yes, this comes in a rather backhanded form of condemnation of the Hamas attack, and rather late in the day, considering how much has happened since the 7th of October. Sorry, it's starting to rain very heavily here in southern Lebanon. But we should keep in mind that Mahmoud Abbas, he's 87 years old, very unpopular among Palestinians because it's felt he's completely out of touch. He's at the head of the Palestinian Authority that's considered to be very corrupt, very inefficient, and hasn't really achieved much for the Palestinian people. So he's walking a fine line between pressure from Europe and the United States to come out and strongly condemn the Hamas attack. And at the same time, his people are increasingly angry over the fact that so many civilians are being killed in Gaza itself -- Jim.",

But there's no guarantee U.S. troops won't be deployed in the future, with more than a dozen Americans unaccounted for following the Hamas attack in Israel. The Biden administration is not ruling out the use of military forces to rescue those Americans.I'm joined now by retired Army General Wesley Clark. He's a CNN military analyst and the former NATO Supreme Allied commander. Also with me is Kim Dozier, a CNN global affairs analyst.

You know, it is -- we've been saying this over and over again, this is to send a message to Iran and its proxies and so on. I just can't imagine, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, I cannot imagine a scenario where the Iranians would actually get involved in some way because of what it would trigger, what that would ultimately mean. Is that realistic? What do you think? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think the odds of their involvement are somewhat low, but I think they're situation dependent. So, for example, if the whole world turns against Israel, if Israel has got 300,000 troops beleaguered and besieged inside Gaza City, if it looks like this is Iran's big chance to unleash Hezbollah with decisive effect, they might go ahead and do it. So you can't rule it out. But they know if they deploy Hezbollah, it's -- the world knows it's their trigger, not Hezbollah's decision. And the world also knows and that the Iranians know that Hezbollah will be destroyed. Whatever damage it does to Israel, it won't recover from this because the Israelis and the Americans will turn on Hezbollah, and that will be the end of it. It might be brutal, it might take casualties, maybe six weeks of fighting, but Hezbollah will have been expended and with that will go Iran's major effort for hegemony on the Mediterranean coast and in Lebanon. There's plenty of enemies of Hezbollah that will take advantage of a U.S.-Israeli destruction of Hezbollah.",

Abbas does, as he did a couple of days ago, condemns violence on both sides and states, according to this readout, that the PLO, that his organization, the Palestinian Authority, is the sole representative of the Palestinian people. But it doesn't mention anyone else.So I can see why, depending on how you read it, you might read it as a condemnation of Hamas, but nowhere in the version that I was able to find does he outright attack Hamas which would be a dangerous thing to do because Hamas right now is riding high in terms of popularity in many parts of the Palestinian world and many parts of the Arab world.",

I would say, you know, the kind of fundamental fact, if I could take a moment to put the historical context is, the United States was the kind of power broker in the Middle East. And the United States ever since the Iraq war has been stepping back, right? That was part of the whole idea of pivoting to Asia, getting somewhat less involved in the Middle East.Well, guess what, when the United States steps back, what happens is you create a power vacuum. And all kinds of people fall into that power vacuum. And the biggest shift became a contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Who would fill in that power vacuum. And the way the Saudis tried to do it in cooperation with the Israelis, who also were trying to move in, as well as, by the way, the Turks and the Russians a little bit, but the Saudis tried to ensure that their concerns and interests are taken care of, by forging this new alliance between the moderate Gulf Arabs and Israel. That scared the, you know, the Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, all these actors that are being marginalized now. And most importantly, the Palestinians, particularly Hamas felt they would be marginalized because what Bibi Netanyahu was trying to do was essentially ignore the Palestinian issue, make peace with the Arabs. And as a result of that, Hamas and perhaps some of Hamas' sponsors, but certainly Hamas, decided, we're going to burn the house down. And this is their way of trying to burn the house down. And so part of what's going on here is that you have had a kind of power vacuum, which all kinds of people have been jockeying for influence and Hamas is watching all this. And they're playing the card they have, which is the most brutal, sadistic card, but that's -- it's their effort to get their attention.",

But as a result of that, one of the things I would urge Israelis to do is learn from the mistakes that the United States made after 9/11. We occasionally reacted and acted through emotion, through fear, through anger, and many times these were not the -- we did not end up with the right policies. We overreacted. We tried to go into Afghanistan and build a whole new democratic nation. We tried to go into -- we went into Iraq. It is not clear that those were the right answers at the time. So one of the things, Richard Haass was on my program and he said, you know, one of the lessons surely should be -- you know, be careful, be judicious, be discriminating. Don't -- you know, don't get -- don't let the emotions guide you. You know, Bismarck once said, the Great 19th century German statesman, a fool learns from his own mistakes, wise people learn from others -- other people's mistakes.

These people have no -- I mean, we don't know whether they support Hamas, but what we do know is that the easiest way to radicalize them would be through a massive indiscriminate campaign of bombing and things like that. This is something we saw happen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and so I would hope that we could recognize, that the Israelis recognize that justified as they are, it was a brutal, awful terror attack that is inhuman. You don't want to further radicalize the Palestinian population. For people who say, well, they are already radicalized. I think that's not entirely true. Very important and interesting issue you pointed to, Mahmoud Abbas, that the head of the Palestinian Authority finally, you know, summoned up the courage to essentially denounce the terror attack and point out that this is not what most Palestinians believe in, it's not what most Palestinians do on a daily basis. But the point is not, you know -- I think the Israel is justified in its anger, in its shock, in its horror. The question is, to be strategic about this.

Is that even a realistic possibility at this point given what's about to take place? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, Jim, it always has to be a realistic possibility, because the United States does not leave people behind. We will always, always endeavor to bring people home, whether that's through direct action raid, hostage rescue missions, like our Special Operations Forces do, whether it's through diplomacy, or intelligence, and working through our partners as well. In a situation like this, the best avenue is either diplomacy, or working through the Israelis. You know, we never want to take anything off the table, we never say that our Special Operations Forces will not go do something. But in a dense urban terrain like this, that's highly saturated with enemy forces, you have Israeli Forces working, you have airstrikes, you have missiles, you have rockets going off. It's very, very hard to safely insert a Special Operations team to conduct a hostage rescue mission. So by diplomacy and working through our Israeli partners are probably the best two avenues at this point.",
