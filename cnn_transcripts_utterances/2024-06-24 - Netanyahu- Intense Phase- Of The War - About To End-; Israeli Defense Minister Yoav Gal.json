I am Eleni Giokos, live in Abu Dhabi.At least 20 people are dead after gunmen attacked religious sites in Dagestan, Russia, a region with a history of violence for questions remain as to who is responsible? Israel's prime minister, signals intense bombardment of Gaza may be nearing an end, as his focus turns to Lebanon. Still, Benjamin Netanyahu said it wouldn't need the war with Hamas is over. And tragedy in the United States with 13 mass shootings on a single weekend, it's part of a worrying trend in a year, when already there have been well over 200 such incidents. Welcome to the show, and we start the second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD with a looming shift in Israel's military focus from Gaza to the northern border with Lebanon. That possible scenario laid out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his first one on one interview with the Israeli media since the Hamas terror attacks last October. The prime minister is saying, \"The intense phase of the war with Hamas is about to end. His interview comes while Israel's defense minister is in Washington, meeting with his American counterparts, and other top officials. We'll have more from Lebanon in just a few minutes. But first, we've got Paula Hancocks back with us this hour from Jerusalem. We've got Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon to cover all these angles for us. Paula, I want to start off with you. And really significant messaging from Benjamin Netanyahu about the intensity of the war with Hamas, the possibility of another front with Lebanon, this is rhetoric at this point in time. But you know, we've just seen so many questions about the possibility of a spillover into the wider region. Give me a sense of the thinking behind what Benjamin Netanyahu has made the sort of the rhetoric. But importantly, how they builds on what we've heard in the past week?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Yoav Gallant, he is scheduled to come here to the Pentagon tomorrow. And what weexpect the discussions to really focus on are, of course, the next phase of the war. But, you know, it is very telling that Gallant was invited here to Washington, and that the White House, just yesterday, put out a statement saying that they look forward to constructive discussions with Yoav Gallant, really directly contrasting that with the comments that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been making over the last week about how the U.S. has been withholding weapons and other military supplies to the Israelis. Again, reiterating the White House did that they have no idea really what he is referring to. And so, they view Gallant here as kind of the grown up that they can have these conversations with, and hopefully, get to a point where they try to dissuade the Israelis from doing anything. Rash when it comes to Lebanon, doing anything very dramatic in terms of a possible incursion into southern Lebanon to push Hezbollah back. Something we reported last week, is something that the IDF is looking at and is making plans for. And so, what we expect is, look, the U.S. is going to reiterate to the Israelis to Gallant that they support Israel, and they will support Israel if they do decide to engage in this new phase of the war in the north. But they are still trying to come to this kind of diplomatic solution here, which is why go onto already has met with the U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has been in charge of trying to find a diplomatic solution between the Israelis and Hezbollah. So that another front in this war one that would be much larger than the one we saw between Israel and Hamas potentially, actually breaks out here. And so, we expect him to, you know, have these discussions about a possible transition phase as well, inside Gaza is something that Gallant has been pushing for, and one that does not involve the Israeli military. But that is something that Netanyahu, again, has not yet agreed to. And so, it's going to be interesting to see how the discussions with Gallant kind of stand in contrast to the administration's relationship, right now with Netanyahu in terms of being, it seems, a kind of more positive relationship overall, something they see they can actually, you know, influence potentially the Israelis behavior moving forward.",

But at the same time, you have this really frenetic diplomatic effort going on behind the scenes to try to find a diplomatic solution to this. Because the U.S. has warned Israel, look, you know, we don't -- we think that you can probably go -- you know, you have what you need to fight Hezbollah. But it is not wise, because this is going to create a new war, a new conflict that is going to be much broader, you are not going to going to be able to keep it limited and quick in the way that you might want to. And so, we see this advice behind the scenes, but publicly, of course, they're saying they're going to stand behind their ally, while at the same time, really working hard to try to prevent yet another war with devastating consequences potentially, from breaking out there, Eleni.",

WEDEMAN (voice-over): Last week, Israeli generals approved a plan to attack Lebanon, while Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah recently warned, if it comes to war, the group will fight Israel on land, sea and air, and also inside Israel itself. The Iranian-backed group's sophisticated attacks have surprised Israeli officials, including precision strikes on surveillance posts on the border, shooting down high-flying Israeli drones and knocking out anti-missile and anti- drone defenses, and posting online more than nine minutes of what it claimed was drone footage of sensitive military and civilian infrastructure in and around the city of Haifa. The bell summons the faithful to mass in the predominantly Christian town of Marjayoun. More than 90,000 people have already left the south for safer ground.

Last October here in Lebanon when there were fears back then of a full-scale war, we have seen Sweden, Kuwait, and North Macedonia, urging all their citizens in Lebanon to leave immediately, and others who are planning to come not to come now. Now, we haven't, for instance, seeing the cancellation of flights. Back in October, the national carrier Middle East Airlines moved many of its planes outside of the country for fear. They could be struck in the event of an Israeli bombing of the airport here but gradually we're seeing the tensions going back to the levels they were back in November and October, and November.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's the key question that's coming out of this. Certainly, for the Russian people in any is howdid this happen again, just to -- just three months rather, after the deadliest terror attack that Russia had seen in two decades at the Crocus City concert hall in Moscow. Now, look, we don't, as you say, have a claim of responsibility as of yet, unlike what happened with that attack in Moscow where ISI-K came out pretty quickly after it had happened and claimed responsibility. Now, all we have, as you say, is this sort of note of praise from the Russian language telegram channel used by ISIS-K, where they say our brothers from the Caucasus showed that they are still strong. This is some way off an actual claim of responsibility. So, there are still a lot of questions surrounding who could have been behind what the authorities say a coordinated attack. So, they are still piecing together what happened, but here is what we know so far, about how it unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice over): Shattering the calm of a summer evening. Russian authorities say these were coordinated attacks simultaneously targeting both Dagestan's capital Makhachkala, and Derbent, an ancient city more than 100 kilometers away. Their attack is fired on this synagogue just 40 minutes before evening prayers, says the Russian Jewish Congress, setting it on fire. As police confronted attackers, 19 people locked themselves in this church in Makhachkala, according to state media. They were later brought to safety. Around 6:00 or 10:00 past 6:00, they were already shooting heavily, says this eyewitness speaking to Russian state T.V. They killed, Armisha (PH), our security guard. YUSUP UMAVOV, MAYOR OF MAKHACHKALA, RUSSIA (through translator): The relevant services and law enforcement agencies worked quickly, but unfortunately, there were losses. We offer our sincere condolences to the families and friends whose sons and brothers died today. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Most of the casualties, police officers, but gruesome details emerged about the murder of an orthodox priest in Derbent, attackers cutting his throat, according to one local official. The head of the predominantly Muslim Republic said this was an attempt to destabilize the region, hinting at foreign influence. SERGI MELIKOV, GOVERNOR OF DAGESTAN (through translator): Further operative search and investigative measures will be carried out until all participants of the sleeper cells are identified, which undoubtedly include some that were organized from abroad. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The attack, which Russia is investigating as terrorism, comes just three months after the deadliest terror attack in Russia in two decades, more than 140 people killed at a Moscow concert hall. Russia's President then laid the blame on the West and Ukraine, despite a claim of responsibility from ISIS-K, the Islamic state's regional branch in Afghanistan. Ethnic tensions also a key focus in Dagestan, a region with an ancient Jewish population. In late October, an anti-Jewish mob stormed the main airport in Dagestan's capital as a flight landed from Tel Aviv. This latest attack raising more serious security questions. Russia, already at war in Ukraine, facing growing threats at home. (END VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (on camera): Well, again, Eleni, there is no official claim from any specific group of responsibility for this attack. But we do know that Dagestan is a region with a long history of Islamic insurgency, one that Putin had promised to crack down on when he first came to power. In 2000, there was even a connection to the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow. In March, a few weeks later, the FSB claimed to have disrupted a terrorist cell in Dagestan, which they say, had armed and funded the perpetrators of the Crocus City Hall attack. There's also of course in 2013, the connection to the Boston Marathon bombers in the United States. So, look, this is obviously a shock to the Russian people coming so soon after another major terror attack that it is in a region that is no stranger to violence.",

Now according to a GoFundMe that was set up by family and friends, Callie leaves behind a 10-month-old daughter. According to her family, she loved her child very much and that everyone saw her being a \"phenomenal mom.\" The second person that was killed on Friday was 62-year-old Shirley Kay Taylor. Her daughter Angela said that she was the hardest working woman she knew and that she was a great person. A 50-year-old Roy Sturgis. You see his photo there as well. He also died in the shooting. We're told that he leaves behind a daughter and two sisters. And then 81-year-old Ellen Shrum was the oldest victim on Friday. According to her family, Ellen actually worked as a cashier for a few months at the very store where this shooting happened.

Authorities said that they recover -- get this, over 350 spent shell casings. The incident we're told began as a party that grew out of control and spilled out onto some streets there. In Ohio, there was another mass shooting that left 10 people injured in Columbus, that is southwest of Cleveland. Now authorities there said that all of the victims were men and that two were teenagers. A suspect in connection with that shooting later turned himself into authorities.

It is a historic event the first time is sitting U.S. presidents and a former president face off.

Is it the pugilistic, interrupting, yelling Trump or is it a more restrained more presidential Donald Trump who shows up on the debate stage? And that, according to Biden advisors is something that they're trying to prepare for in these extensive debate preparations that he is holding at Camp David that is trying to be ready for whatever version of the candidate shows up. Now, Biden is now on day four of his debate prep camp out at Camp David in Western Maryland. And I think it's no secret why the President is spending the better part of a week in preparation sessions. They realize, his campaign realizes that they really cannot afford an underwhelming performance on that debate stage. And they know that any sort of slip up, a mental slip up or a verbal slip up will only be amplified underneath those debate stage lights. We did get a glimpse I think of the campaign's strategy heading into this week where they put out a pretty lengthy memo yesterday. And it does lay out three specific areas that I think President Biden is going to want to focus on. One of them is on abortion. And that's not necessarily a surprise. This is one of the most galvanizing issues for Democrats this election year. And President Biden really wants to lay the repeal of Roe versus Wade right at Donald Trump's feet. The other is the idea of democracy and the necessity of protecting democracy. And certainly, this has been an underpinning of President Biden's entire campaign. And then the third is the economy. Obviously, this is the top issue for many voters. In some ways. It's the one that President Biden is most vulnerable on because so many Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the economy, despite what is otherwise a robust economic recovery, but it is certainly something that he will want to talk about at this debate. And so, what he's doing at camp, David, I think is crystallizing his answers, sharpening his responses on these three items, all in preparation for Thursday.",

And that community can be supported by having amazing collaborators give us the opportunity to stand on their shoulders. And that was my opportunity at the United Nations Conference on climate change. ANDERSON (voice-over): Listening to these young leaders gives you hope for the future.
