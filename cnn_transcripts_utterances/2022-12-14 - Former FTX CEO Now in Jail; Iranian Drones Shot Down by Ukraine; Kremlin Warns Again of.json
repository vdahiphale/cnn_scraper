It's unsurprising that a case has been bought first against Sam Bankman-Fried. This is a situation in which he is the headline grabber. He's obviously the head of the entire organization.We heard testimony today at the financial services hearing from Mr. John Ray III who is the current CEO that pointed to Sam Bankman-Fried as the person who is running this entire enterprise. And so, we certainly have a very strong culpability for Sam Bankman- Fried. But obviously, what Mr. Ray also pointed to was this cautery of other very close confidants that were in concentrated control, in Mr. Ray's words, of FTX. Now what the indictment today pointed to was a series of conspiracy charges, conspiracy for wire fraud, for example. And in that context when you do have a conspiracy you are assuming that there will be other conspirators that will be involved in this context. So, certainly, if you are connected to the very close circle of advisors that were running FTX at the time, there is every reason to worry that you are next in line to face legal jeopardy in this context. Now looking much more further field for folks like the big stars involved in this case, as you mentioned, Rosemary, Tom Brady and the other big stars that were very closely involved in hyping up FTX. That is a harder case to establish. In fact, the other day one of the cases against them was thrown out. The hype potential is going to be harder to face because there's no real crutch there to say that these folks were deceiving particular customers or they even knew about the problems that were happening at FTX at the time.

Not everyone is lucky to play at the stage of the tournament. The best team here, Brazil, has already been knocked out. We are a very ambitious team. We are hungry, but I don't know if it will be enough. It can be. We are confident and determined to rewrite the history books. We want Africa to be on top of the world.

It's a success story which has seemingly unified the Arab fan base and their supporters can't get enough of them.
