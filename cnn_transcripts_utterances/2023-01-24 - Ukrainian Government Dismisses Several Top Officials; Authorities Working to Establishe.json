And for any one of those countries, even if they own those tanks for any one of those countries to send those tanks to Ukraine. They need legally to get the OK from Berlin. Now, this really escalated when Poland's Foreign Minister said a few days ago, look, if we don't have that approval from Germany, and we can collect a coalition of partners, we might go ahead without that approval and send those tanks to Ukraine. Now Poland saying they have submitted that official request to Germany. Germany saying they're reviewing it as a matter of urgency. You heard there from Germany's newly appointed Foreign Minister saying to his partners, go ahead and train Ukrainian troops if that's what you need to do. But we are still working on the sort of bureaucracy, if you will, of giving the OK for these Leopard tanks. And there's also been this back and forth about whether or not it's the right type of tank to send debates on whether or not U.S. may tank the Abrams should be sent instead. But what you hear repeatedly, from analyst and from Ukrainian officials is that these are the tanks needed right now. Probably yesterday, if you ask President Zelenskyy he sees all of this red tape as wasting of time and causing more bloodshed on the ground. And if you take a step back, you absolutely can look at the back battleground now and see how Ukraine is under pressure in places like Bakhmut. Ukrainian officials saying Russia is preparing for a spring offensive in the use of these Leopard tanks right on the frontlines. And what is very much an infantry war, meaning it is all about those foot soldiers all about the artillery. Those tanks can spearhead and provide the movements that Ukraine needs going forward in this anticipated counter offensive this spring.",

Now all this pretty much started off last week when the Deputy Minister got taken into custody for alleged embezzlement. And since then, we've sort of seen this wave of people tendering the resignations, and possibly not completely voluntarily and other people's being sacked out right now. It's unclear what exactly is behind this large wave of all this. But it certainly seems to be as though the President of this country Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is somewhat cleaning up the ranks and certainly trying to remove some people that he might feel are not fully on board with the effort of defending against Russia. And certainly might also be doing some other things as well. It was interesting, because a top Presidential Adviser earlier today and came out and said, look, this operation that we're seeing right now, the sackings that we're seeing right now. They show that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President feels the pulse of the people and the people who are in office, the people who are in government need to understand that in these tough times, they have a job to do and they certainly shouldn't deviate from that.

They say that obviously, it isa group that operates in a very brutal way, but also in complete disregard of their own losses. And we did obtain a document from the Ukrainian military outlining this, how the Wagner group is fighting and why they are one of the few units that are affiliated with the Russian military that are able to get gains here in Ukraine? You should be learned. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): As Russia's invasion of Ukraine falters, there's one group that is having some success on the battlefield. The brutally effective Wagner private military company led by Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin. Wagner, why are we effective? And where does this effectiveness come from? He asks, first, we have been fighting for many years probably we are the most experienced army in the world today. And Ukraine's leadership is alarmed by Wagner success. CNN has exclusively obtained a military document outlining Kyiv's assessment of the group. There are also purely military reasons for Wagner's effectiveness. The document says as the command structure and tactics currently employed are the only ones that are effective for the poorly trained mobilized troops that make up the majority of Russian ground forces. Ukraine's military filmed this video showing Wagner assault tactics using waves of fighters trying to overwhelm and encircle a Ukrainian position. The tasks are set to be as primitive as possible to achieve the goal, many assault groups are deployed, and attacks can be carried out for a long period of time without regard to losses, the document says. The first waves are often convicts essentially used as cannon fodder. The deaths of thousands of Wagner soldiers do not matter to Russian society, the military document asserts. And unauthorized withdrawal of a team or without being wounded is punishable by execution on the spot. Prigozhin makes no secret of the fact that losses don't matter to him. He recently visited a building where the bodies of the fallen were kept. Their contracts have ended. They are going home he said. But Prigozhin also claims to respect the Ukrainians defending against his mercenaries saying they're fighting with valor. You need to be more careful to send them off in a dignified manner. He said while recently overseeing an exchange of bodies between Wagner and the Ukrainian army. Internally though it's a brutal regime. A pro Wagner social media channel recently posted a video of mercenaries using a sledgehammer to kill a Former Comrade who allegedly defected and criticized the group. The word is out on the battlefield too. Ukrainian intelligence intercepted this call, which CNN cannot independently verify of a Russian soldier talking to a friend about --. [09:10:00] PLEITGEN (voice over): Still, Wagner's morale seems high, the Ukrainian say, and the fighters are often better equipped and Russia's regular forces thanks to what the Ukrainians claim is U.S. made technology. In contrast to the Russian Armed Forces, Wagner's main means of communication are American made radio relay stations and Motorola walkie-talkies, the Ukrainian document says. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We've been hearing so much about infighting going on between Wagner and Prigozhin specifically.

And so that has an outsized benefit for a big economy like Germany. And lastly, China's reopening now that happened very recently, very suddenly.

And also we can add to that I know you've been talking about this on the show. In recent weeks, the strikes we've been seeing which according to the U.K., Office of National Statistics have been so bad that the U.K. economy lost more working days between June and November of last year than any six- month period over the last 30 years. And strikes really are a byproduct of all of those issues, frankly, wages just not keeping up with the cost of living. There's also a little bit more to it. And I am always loath to mention this because I feel like it's all I've talked about last years when the Chief Economist of S&amp;P Global who put together the PMI report also highlighted longer term structural issues related to Brexit.

Well, it's early days, and we've only had about 65 S&amp;P 500 companies report so far. We're having a historic number of beats have both on the earnings line and the revenue line. But what's more important is thus far, in terms of guidance, it really hasn't drawn down the consensus estimate for 2023 yet and that's the important thing when you try to stack up valuations and what makes sense for level. So this will be an important week as well next, and we'll have a much larger sample set of companies reporting in this. This is one of the busier weeks with next week being the busiest, but I think what we'll really be paying close attention to and watching is, does the aggregate guidance, drive down what we think the S&amp;P 500 can throw off in terms of earnings for 23?

And as matter of fact, when earnings miss estimates, the reaction function tends to be much sharper than it is if you, you know if you beat modestly. But I also think what's really important here is to your point; it's just a position between the narratives around how much things have slowed down in the economy versus how corporate America is doing? And I think that the recent announcements of layoffs, it's a pretty good sign that technology companies in general, are trying to get back to a manageable size to manage their expenses, et cetera. So if you look at all the layoffs that have been announced, which seems like on a daily basis, really only getting the total level of employment at tech companies back to where they were in the in 2021. There was a massive amount of hiring that went on and technology companies between 2022, they're getting back to where they were in 21.

And then last year, they hit some barriers along the way. And basically, the deal dissolved, so now people who have been playing many popular video games are without luck. I mean, these games have basically been suspended. I mean, of course, the big one is World of Warcraft, which is very popular. You know you play with people from really all over the world. It's one of those multiplayer games. It's been suspended. And the reaction has been pretty, pretty robust on social media.
