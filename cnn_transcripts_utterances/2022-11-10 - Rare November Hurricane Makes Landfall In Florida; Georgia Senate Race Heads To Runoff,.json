What you're going to see up in the distance is the International Speedway Bridge, which has been shut off. And so there is no access to that barrier island here in Daytona Beach. That's an area that by the way, still being evacuated where the county has told us there are dozens of building -- buildings that have been deemed unsafe. And they're correlating that to coastal erosion.So let's walk down here and show you sort of another angle. So you can see the problem when it comes to the flooding down here. Not only closing down roads, washing out roads, and closing bridges but take a look down on this side, you can see just by that car there how high the water is. I spoke to one gentleman who said he left here this morning. He just checked on his business which is on this street and he has two feet of water inside. So a lot of flooding that we're seeing here. And one other pretty big update that just came in as well announced that the death toll now associated with tropical storm, Nicole, they have reported two deaths as a result. Kate?",

Let's turn now to the economy though, U.S. stocks way up at this hour after inflation report was better than expected. It shows inflation easing from that four decade high we've been tracking for so long now. Well, the Federal Reserve is still working on trying to tame stubborn inflation. Matt Egan is back with us with more on this. Matt, how big of a deal is this report?",

      "sentences": "Kate, this is a big deal. I mean, inflation isn't gone, but it is cooling off. It's cooling off more so than people expected. One of the interesting things out of this report is that core inflation which strips out food and energy that actually unexpectedly got cut in half month over month in October. That was significant year over year, 7.7 percent increase in prices. That is not good, but everything is relative.This is a nine month low and it is big improvement from June when we saw consumer prices go up by more than 9 percent. We saw outright price declines month over month in October for apparel, airfare, used cars, fresh fruit, and Moody's economist Mark Zandi told me that he thinks that today's reports suggest that even though inflation is still painfully high, it is quote, definitively moderating. And Zandi says as long as oil prices don't go crazy, or China doesn't resort to really extreme lockdowns, then he thinks that inflation should be quote, much lower a year from now, which would obviously be great news. Now Wall Street is loving this. The second that this report came out, we saw stock futures skyrocket. Dow up by about 800 points around 3 percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 4 percent. The NASDAQ is spiking 6 percent. You don't see that every day, this would be the best day for Wall Street in over two years. The hope is that all of this gives the Fed a reason to stop slamming the brakes on the economy. These massive interest rate hikes are raising the risk of a recession. They're also raising borrowing costs. Yesterday we learn that credit card rates hit record highs, mortgage rates today, we learned are back above 7 percent at a 20 year high. So hopefully this inflation report gives the Fed a reason to stop with the rate hikes.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's a problem. There was a lot of hope among Republicans, that Governor Kemp would finish by such a huge margin over 50 percent that he could drag Herschel Walker over that finish line. There are a number of Georgia voters, Republicans, who voted for Governor Brian Kemp, who did not vote for Herschel Walker. But the governor has a huge ground game. He built up his own ground game outside of the Republican Party apparatus, turned on that switch, got all of his voters out to the polls, which he said would help all of the other Republicans on the ballot that helped everyone except Herschel Walker win without a runoff.Now when Walker is out there by himself on Election Day in that runoff, he's going to need that kind of ground game that Governor Brian Kemp was able to flip on, but it won't be Kemp's operation anymore. So that was a big boost for every other Republican on the ticket. It wasn't enough to get Walker over the finish line, though. And so he's going to need to go back to the drawing board. But it will hurt him absolutely that Governor Kemp isn't on the ticket with him to help him get over the line.",

So there is a point at which all the money you throw at this race isn't going to make sure that you have won. We have more than $500 million coming into the state for those runoffs in 2021. Eventually, all those ads just canceled each other out, people stop paying attention. But if the money goes into a ground game, if the money goes into delivering those voters to the polls, which you really have to win a runoff because people just aren't paying attention the same way then that's money well spent, but in terms of all of the money flooding in for an air war that tends to start to just get completely tuned out. They need that money on the ground Herschel Walker especially needs that money on the ground because that was an operation that Kemp had stood up before.",

So it has in effect, a limitless range around the world. It's huge, as you can see there. It's designed to go off the coast of an adversary country of an adversary city, lie and wait there and if ordered launch, potentially a nuclear attack, so that so this is a fearsome offensive weapon. The U.S. was watching these naval exercises just north of Russia, in the Arctic sea very closely to see if it's come along so far, that they're able to give it a real life test in effect.There were clearly preparations for doing that. They had a submarine in these exercises, designed to carry this very weapon. But in the end, those ships left the Arctic sea last week without carrying out the test. And the U.S. believes it's possible they ran into technical difficulties doing so also because of the nature of where that is in the world that ISIS over this time of year, so the window was limited. But bigger picture is well, Kate, you and I've talked about this and others that concern that Russia that Vladimir Putin wanted to make as a step, a threat to the world, in effect to show the power of his weapons. And this was one of those potential test, one of those potential demonstrations here. And that's why the U.S. is watching this so closely.",

He's now charged for making threats against Jewish people and threatening to attack a synagogue. And as you mentioned, really, this all materialized last week, when the FBI really sent out an alarming tweet. They said in that tweet that they had received credible information about a broad threat to synagogues in New Jersey.Our team at the time noted there was no specific target or timing mentioned. But that this tweet was prompted, in fact by an online posting with an anti-Semitic comments in a forum that was frequented by extremists. And at the time last week, authorities were especially alarmed because the posting was written as if the attack on a synagogue had already occurred, which it had not. But now there is one suspect under arrest for allegedly posting what authorities are now calling a manifesto where he allegedly spewed hatred, and he threatened to attack a synagogue. Now this 18-year-old that was arrested his name is Omar Alkattoul. He was arrested and interviewed by authorities. And now we're told he's been voluntarily transferred to a hospital for examination. But Kate, at the hospital the complaint actually says that he told an employee that he had been communicating with someone on social media, he believed to be affiliated with al Qaeda. And he told them about these alleged plans to essentially blow up a synagogue but this suspect now in custody, and facing that one count of transmitting a threat. Kate?",

As you know, the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States has the responsibility to review transactions that could result in American business being controlled by a foreign person, and then it goes on.
