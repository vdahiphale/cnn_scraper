But on Sunday, he failed to to secure 50 percent of the vote in the general election against the opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Throughout Erdogan's presidency, he's faced criticism for consolidating power and silencing his political rivals, often putting them behind bars. He's also fostered close ties with the Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran.CNN's International Becky Anderson is here with us live with her exclusive interview with President Erdogan. I mean, this is so fascinating to hear him talk, especially as he is now fighting for his political survival. What did he tell you?",

He criticized his policy towards the Kurds. And he said at the time, he would support the Turkish opposition in trying to unseat him now to an increasingly nationalistic Turkish population. Anti-Americanism plays well with a crowd here. And the Turkish President knows that. At a rally on Saturday, calling out Joe Biden accusing him of trying to topple him in a wide-ranging interview that I had with the Turkish President. We discussed and asked him to explain.
