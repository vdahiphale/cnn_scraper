A Pentagon spokesperson says the U.S. has not conducted strikes or operations inside Iran while the Tehran government displayed what it says are pieces of the drones. But the Israel Defense Forces have declined to comment. More now from CNN's Salma Abdelaziz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Questions and concerns after an attack over the weekend on a military facility in Iran, according to Iranian state media on Saturday night, a military factory in the central Iranian city of Isfahan was attacked with three drones in according to Iranian state media, one of those drones was shut down, the two others caught in the country's air defense systems and exploded. Now, Iran has not accused any certain group or country of carrying out this attack but a top official, the Iranian foreign minister calling it a cowardly act and saying it was part of efforts to incite insecurity in Iran. Now separately, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times have spoken to U.S. officials, unnamed U.S. officials that say Israel was behind the attack. Now in the past, Israel has been accused by Iran and others of carrying out these covert attacks against Iranian military sites in an effort to deter that country's nuclear program to make clear. Israel has made no comment on this recent attack. Now, separately, there was also a response from Ukraine, a top official again, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, in a tweet saying it was \"An explosive night in Iran\", going on then, to use the Ukrainian flag and saying did warn you. Now, it's important to note here that Ukraine has accused Iran and Ukraine's allies agreed that Iran is providing drones to Russia, which are being used in Ukraine -- in Russia's invasion of that country and have caused according to Ukrainian officials, again, civilian loss of life. Now, all of this quite murky, unclear who is behind this specific attack, but very much part of a shadow war and a continuation of the increasing isolation of Iran over the course of the last few months. That country has been cracking down on a protest movement. The result of that has been that nuclear talks, attempts to restart nuclear talks have all but faded away, no hope there, more sanctions from the west. Iran increasingly turning to Moscow, helping to provide and replenish its arsenal for the war in Ukraine and concerns and fears that the Middle East already in a very fragile place that this could escalate tensions there.
