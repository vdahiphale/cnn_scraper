We know how difficult it is to not only know that their loved ones are in these prisons, but not knowing when they're going to come home. And then, in the case of Evan Gershkovich, for example, get smacked with the news that he's been sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison on these - on these - on these espionage charges that everyone believes, whether it's U.S. officials or his employer, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" rights groups are completely trumped up simply for doing his job.Gershkovich was doing a fantastic job as a young American reporter in Russia. And as these prisoners have come out in the past, whether it's Trevor Reed or Brittney Griner, they have told CNN and other outlets about the incredibly arduous journey of being in the Russian penal system, of the uncertainty of the treatment, and not knowing what was going to eventually happen. But I can tell you guys that in speaking with U.S. officials, there are furious negotiations that happened behind the scenes. In this case, a lot of it was - in this case of what's happening today, we believe that a lot of it was carried out between the intelligence communities, so that would be the CIA director, Bill Burns, who used to be based in Russia as a diplomat, engaging with the FSB on the Russian side. But it's also been taking place at a political level. I reported several months ago that Alexei Navalny, the most famous Russian opposition leader, was expected to be part of a trade that could have included Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, as well as Vadim Krasikov, the FSB killer. And that fell apart after Navalny was killed. So, this is an extremely delicate, extremely complicated months, if not years long process to get all these puzzle pieces into place. Multiple prisoners, multiple countries at the intelligence level. And then finally getting the sign-off at the political level. So, we're talking about Chancellor Scholz in Germany, President Biden, and President Putin, as well as the leaders of the other countries that may be involved.",

Again, as we understand at this point, the latest that we have is that the parties have agreed to a prisoner transfer and that prisoners are expected to soon be in U.S. custody. That's according to a senior administration official. I want to bring in CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood, who joins us now. So, Kylie, look, we don't have the complete list of who may or may not be involved here, but there are certainly a number of Americans that - that had been at the center of major efforts to try and get them either released or released through a type of prisoner swap like what we may be seeing here soon. What are you hearing on your end? Is there any movement at the State Department?",

They are being released by Russia. They are going to be on their way home. If not already, then in short order.This is such wonderful news. These are the biggest names of those who are expected to be part of this exchange. It has been such a battle to try to get these two men released from Russian custody. Paul Whelan arrested first in 2018 and held for the past six years, convicted on espionage charges back in 2020. Evan Gershkovich simply doing his job as an American reporter in Russia, arrested last March, very quickly accused of espionage and then finally convicted last month, in July, of - on those charges and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. Now, that sentence last month came really as - not as a shock, but certainly a realization that it could be a long journey before getting him home. But at the same time, we knew that the Russians would have to convict him before they could start talking about releasing him in exchange for other Russians. So, this is tremendous news from the Biden administration, confirming that Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich will be part of this exchange. We are awaiting more details, others who may be released, not just from the Russian side and the U.S., but also from Germany and other countries as well. Kate.",

His family fighting to get him released since he was first arrested in 2018.

      "sentences": "Well, the Russians are being tight lipped. But to your point, yes, I mean, I've been in Russia, you know, for the past several years, watching in horror as people like Paul Whelan were detained, accused of espionage, sentenced to 16 years in prison. The same then happened, of course, to Evan Gershkovich, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter and, you know, countless other sort of Russians or people associated with the west who have been detained for just doing their jobs or for criticizing the Russian authorities.It seems like a deal has been reached that will see a large proportion of, if not all, and it's not all, of those people who have suffered in this crackdown and been detained in this crackdown, are going to be set free. Evan Gershkovich, of course, and Paul Whelan, the most high- profile among them, but others as well. We're looking at a deal which, I mean these numbers aren't - aren't confirmed yet, but possibly 16 people sort of leaving Russian custody, eight going back in to Russia, being released by the United States and - and other countries. Now, I think one of the issues, which is the sort of elephant in the room, is the moral issue. The issue of the fact that, you know, the people who are being released by Russia are people like Evan, journalists who are just doing their job, you know, Paul Whelan, wrongly accused of espionage, something that's been denied by him and, of course, the U.S. authorities, in exchange for those people. We're seeing individuals released from U.S. jails and others who are serious, you know, committed serious acts. You know, criminal acts. Vadim Krasikov is this FSB colonel who was convicted in Germany of murdering someone in broad daylight, a Chechen dissident in a Berlin park. He's going to be going back. There are others who have been accused or even convicted of espionage in various places in the west as well. There'll be sent back. And other individuals, Russian citizens who are serving sentences for cybercrimes. One individual, you know, believed to be part of this mix, although that name has not been confirmed yet, who is linked with, you know, a multi-million dollar, you know, kind of financial fraud involving, you know, kind of, you know, kind of bitcoin and stuff like that. And so we're not talking about a trade of like-for-like. We're not talking about, you know, pro-democracy activists. Well, we are talking about pro-democracy activists, basically, and journalists, in exchange for, you know, kind of serious criminals.",

Germany involved. We believe Germany, Russia, the United States, and possibly more countries involved.I saw Kayla Tausche at the White House standing by for us on your screen there. Let's get over to Kayla. Kayla, this is a huge moment for the country and for the White House and this administration. What are you hearing from there?",

And you're made to stand there in front of the accused, in this case Evan Gershkovich, and not interact with them in any way. And, of course, they're standing in a sort of goldfish bowl type glass cage.And it's very difficult, you know? And so when I went in, I sort of said hello and I asked him if he was OK. And that, you know, meant I got kicked out. But I just thought it was the right thing to do. And I think, you know, me and many of my colleagues are very glad to see that Evan Gershkovich - or to hear that Evan Gershkovich is part of this - of this prisoner deal. But - but, you know, look, I mean, as I said earlier, this has been a - an ethical dilemma. It is not a like for like swap. People like Evan Gershkovich are being - and Paul Whelan are being swapped for, you know, in some ways very hardened sort of criminal figures that have been held in the United States, and others as well, but obviously that's a trade-off that the White House, after many months of negotiations, felt was the right one morally to make. And I think we'll probably - there's not - there's not many people hear, any of us here, who - who would - who would think otherwise.",

We all know these things can, unfortunately, you know, go bad. So, we want to be really careful about what we know and what we don't know.But if the overall indication from Putin is that he is ready for a big swap and that we're hoping one is underway. Then the question is, is he ready to go move on to what would be the next big swap, which would be a way out on Ukraine. They're very different dynamics and very different problems. And of course, President Biden's view has been that only the Ukrainians can make the decision about whether they're willing to give up some Ukrainian territory for peace. But this certainly is the first time since the war broke out in February 2022 where there's been any sign of a constructive conversation with the Russians. Hasn't happened on arms control. Certainly hasn't happened on Ukraine. Hasn't happened in a range of other areas. And while prisoner swaps happened during the Cold War at various moments without many broader effects. The hope here is that this could be the beginning of a thaw.",

And if, in fact, he is part of this, and if this comes off as one would hope it would, it may be that the Russians felt they had to get through the legal process.But from all the sounds of it, this is a much bigger swap than that. And so this is a calculus on Putin's part about when he was ready. The U.S. was pretty much ready as well. Also a question of how big the deal is. Putin's been interested in Russians held in countries other than the United States, including in Germany. We don't know anything right now about whether or not this could embrace those as well. But Putin may - may have decided that he's been pushing his luck here. Hard to imagine, just given the fact that he's making some incremental gains on the battlefield, and he's got this new relationship with China, really hard to crawl inside Vladimir Putin's mind.",
