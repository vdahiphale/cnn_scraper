More and more Republicans plead with Congressman George Santos to quit as we get a glimpse of his resume chock full of outright lies, and American families exhale as new data shows inflation is easing. Is it a return to normal? Or is a recession still on the table?Up first for us though the Attorney General makes a public statement next hour as questions mount about how he will handle a blossoming controversy involving his boss. Joe Biden also had classified files in his Delaware garage this morning. The President and his attorneys confirming the existence of a second batch of classified materials dating back to Mr. Biden's time as vice president. The search teams were told completed this review yesterday, searching Biden residences in Wilmington, and in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The new documents were unclassified markets - markings, the statement from Biden's counsel says were found in his Wilmington garage and a neighboring room. The documents we are told were mixed in with other papers. Let's get straight to our CNN Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez. Evan, we will hear from the Attorney General, next hour. Do we know it is about this? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: We anticipate John that it is about this. The Justice Department is in a very tight spot here. They're in a very difficult position because obviously the President and his team did not tell the full story when they issued a statement on Monday about finding a batch of documents, classified documents, they said at the time, fewer than a dozen. What they didn't tell us was that in subsequent search, that there were additional documents that were found. And the question is, when did they have that information? And why didn't they tell the world immediately because now there's a perception that has been created, that they're hiding something and that is put the Attorney General now in a position where, you know, he might have to appoint a special counsel or at least open a fuller investigation of this matter. Just to catch people up, what the President at what the White House says happened is that they found a second set of documents, classified documents in a in a garage and in an adjacent room at the president's home in Wilmington, Delaware. They also did a search of his beach home in Rehoboth, Delaware. They didn't find anything there. They say that all those searches were concluded last night. And that's the reason why they are now confirming the finding of this second set of documents. What they're not saying, however, is when exactly they found this second set. Did they know this on Monday, and they just didn't tell the world? That's the - that's one of the questions that we still have outstanding with the White House, John. And so we expect the Attorney General will - will have to explain what exactly course he's going to take now.",

Paula, to you first. And the Attorney General here, what is the process? Look, there's a lot of politics here. There's a separate investigation of Donald Trump for similar not exactly the same but classified documents removed from government property. The President has sort of rolled his eyes at Donald Trump.

This is something that they have not managed effectively, and not really managed well. The way around that is to sort of minimize some of the political considerations and probably to appoint a special counsel. Look, I as I told you months ago, I think the Justice Department's perfectly capable of investigating something in an apolitical way, but it's how the public sees it. And I think in what the risk of appearing to be political, so they probably don't have much of a choice here.",

But there's questions about how did documents - how did they handle documents when they left the VP's office during the transition period as he was setting up those various offices, who like would have been responsible for packing up some of these documents? Could some of these documents have been holdovers that he had taken to his home in Wilmington on a weekend, for instance? So there's so many issues that are at hand right now? Is this a political headache that's turning kind of into a lingering migraine for them, but it really, you know, they it gives Republicans such an opening, to be able to criticize Biden on this at a time when the Biden Administration is trying to make these distinctions about the way that the former President Donald Trump handled it, and the way he has handled it.

He also will get committee assignments.
