You see him here leaving a federal courthouse in Miami after his initial court appearance.De Oliveira was indicted last week on four charges, including conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to the FBI. He did not enter a formal plea during this brief hearing and was released on a $100,000 bond. He will be formally arraigned next week. The special counsel says that Trump close aide Walt Nauta and De Oliveira together tried to delete security footage after it was subpoenaed by investigators and that the three men tried to -- quote -- \"alter, mutilate and conceal evidence.\" According to the indictment, De Oliveira allegedly told Mar-a-Lago's I.T. director that \"the boss,\" as he put it, wanted the server deleted. A number of people close to the former president, as well as people who know De Oliveira, personally described him as someone not in Trump's inner circle. As Trump's classified documents case expands, an indictment could be coming at any time in the special counsel's January 6 probe. The former president said over the weekend he thinks he -- quote -- \"probably\" will be indicted in that case and in the election interference case in Georgia. And he may be right. Fulton county DA Fani Willis over the weekend saying that she will announce charging decisions within weeks here, saying -- quote -- \"We are ready to go.\" Let's begin now with CNN's Randi Kaye, who is in Miami with the very latest here.

The judge asked him to come to the lectern in the courtroom. And he did read the charges that are being filed against him. And he asked De Oliveira if he understood them. He told him that he had the right to obtain a lawyer and also to remain silent. So he said that he understood the charges, and then he did tell him that he would be released on that $100,000 bond, as you mentioned. A couple of other notes to make. He was asked if he has a passport. He did say he holds a U.S. passport, but that it was expired. The judge told him that he would have to turn that passport over within 48 hours. The judge also told him that he could not leave the area of South Florida without permission, so some restricted travel put in place. And the judge also told De Oliveira that he would not be able to speak with any witnesses who have been I.D.ed on the government's list. As you mentioned, he did not enter a plea. He will do that on August 10. He did not have a Florida-based attorney, Brianna, which he needs in order to enter a plea here in the state of Florida. He is working on getting one, his D.C.-based attorney said, and he does expect to enter a plea come August 10 -- back to you.",

Dorsainvil disappeared the same day that the United States ordered all American visitors leave Haiti because of an increase in the number of kidnappings and rising instability there. The president of her alma mater told NBC News that she was not surprised the nurse from New Hampshire chose a life of service. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Boris, this is not surprising, because given who might have taken them, which was likely a gang, trying to isolate exactly which gang it was, and if they're asking for a ransom or something else, all of those delicate negotiations. And those involved will want pretty much of blackout on anything going on right now. And, certainly, the charity itself that her husband is a director at, El Roi, has said that they, for the interest of safety of both Alix and her child, want to make sure that people don't speculate on any of those details too much. Having said that, though, as you just pointed out, Boris, the violence in Haiti has persisted. It has terrorized average citizens there, who are unable to do things like get medical help, get food, to send their kids to school. It is a daily occurrence, especially on the streets of Port-au-Prince, the capital. And yet Alix Dorsainvil, as you just explained, was devoted to trying to help those Haitians. I want you to listen to her in her own words now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
