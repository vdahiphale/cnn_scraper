I'm Christiane Amanpour coming to you from the heart of Athens where democracy was born. And where I sat down with President Barack Obama, whose post presidency is devoted to strengthening the foundations of democracy now and in the future at home and abroad. Obama previously came to Athens back in November 2016. It was barely a week after Donald Trump won the election that would succeed him. And he came to reassure the world that the system would prevail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, THEN-U.S. PRESIDENT:  As long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don't waver from those central principles that ensure a lively open debate, then our future will be OK. Because it remains the most effective form of government ever devised by man. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think there is a less tolerance for ideas that don't suit us.

I dealt with Modi to get the Paris Accords done, because I think climate change is something that transcends, you know, any particular momentary issues. It's a problem that humanity has got to deal with over the next couple of decades in a serious way. I do think that it is appropriate for the president of the United States, where he or she can, to uphold those principles and to challenge, whether behind closed doors or in public, trends that are troubling. And so, I'm less concerned about labels than I am concerned about, you know, specific practices. You know, I think it is important for the president of the United States to say that if you have Uyghurs in China who are being placed in mass camps and \"re-educated,\" that is a problem. That's a challenge to all of us and we have to pay attention to it. I think it is true that if the president meets with Prime Minister Modi, then the protection of the Muslim minority in a majority Hindu India, that's something worth mentioning because -- and by the way, if I had a conversation with Prime Minister Modi, who I know well, part of my argument would be that, if you do not protect the rights of ethnic minorities in India, then there's a strong possibility India at some point starts pulling apart, and we've seen what happens when you start getting those kinds of large internal conflicts. So, that would be contrary to the interests, not just of Muslim India but also Hindu India. So, I think it's important to be able to talk about these things honestly.

I do not think that there'sgoing to be any kind of serious primary challenge to Joe Biden. I think that the Democratic Party is unified. You know, there was a lot of talk, you'll remember when he was first elected, because Bernie Sanders had run, that somehow there was this huge split between progressive Democrats and more centrist Democrats. And the truth is, is that partly because of how Joe has governed, those divisions have been bridge. I think what's true in American politics generally is until you get to campaigns people aren't paying much attention. People have gone through a difficult time because of COVID and the pandemic and lockdowns, because of inflation, primarily the result of both the war in Ukraine and rising energy prices as well as supply chain issues. And so, people have memories about them. OK. Eggs got more expensive and gas was more expensive. And they haven't been paying as much attention to the fact that, for example, the African American unemployment rate is lower than it's been in decades. The campaign will allow President Biden to make those arguments. And I think that, you know, in a media environment that's so cluttered it's very hard to breakthrough until you get to election time. We all recall when I ran for reelection in 2012, my poll numbers weren't that great, and we ended up winning comfortably. Part of that was just we started campaigning, and we were able to get a message out and people said, yes, you know, that policy or this policy or this thing left undone, that irritated me a little bit.

And then, now we've seen the first war on European soil in recent memory, and I think it was a wakeup call to Europe and I think it was a wakeup call to the West, and to democracies around the world, that the old ways of thinking, might makes right, big countries can do what they want to small countries, that, you know, people cannot independently determine their futures, that those forces have to be confronted, watching the Ukrainians themselves with such courage and bravery fight back, I think that reminded Europe of who they were. And I have been impressed by the degree to which in not easy circumstances, Europe has stood up, it has provided the aid that was necessary. I think the Biden administration has very deftly managed maintaining that alliance to support Ukraine.

And part of what happened was both myself, and also Merkel, who I give enormous credit for, had to pull in a lot of other Europeans kicking and screaming to impose the sanctions that we did and to prevent Putin from continuing through the Donbas into the rest of Ukraine. So, I actually think that, given both where Ukraine was at the time and where the European mindset was at the time, we held the line. And part of what happened was over time, a sense of Ukrainian identity separate from Russia and a determination to push back against Russia and an ability to prepare, both militarily and in civically, to resist Russian pressure that -- they've built up those muscles and that's part of the reason why they were able to respond the way they did when you actually saw what was, in my view at least, an incredibly misguided, not to mention, illegal and incredibly cruel incursion by Russian forces.",

Like we have always been told that you cannot vote, who's going to take your vote. You cannot participate in anything. You are not as equal as men are. So, having all of those challenges that are being faced by women it kind of reshaped half of the women in Sudan into not knowing what kind of leaders they can actually be. So, the power that they actually have in them. And it take -- it took us like ages to realize that women are actually strong and they can empower and they are the right to vote, they have the right to have a voice, and they have the right to be respected as well. Stepping into respect, it has always been a challenge for Sudanese women to be respected, especially when it comes to being respected by men, because for them it's always like, we are the leaders, like we rule the family. It's only us, nobody else. And for me, especially, I have always been challenged by it. But luckily, I grew up in a family that always taught me that you have the right to do whatever you want as long as you know what you are doing and we trust you enough.

SUMMER KELIIPIO, OBAMA FOUNDATION LEADER AND OWNER, MO'O STRATEGIES:  Such a great question. You know, for me and for all of the other Pacific Islands that are, you know, quickly losing land mass because of climate change, it's so important, now more than ever, to be able to tell our stories and to reach out to the people around the globe, to our new colleagues in the network and to be able to find opportunities for connecting and helping them to understand what we're going through on a daily basis. The storms are bigger, the surges are bigger, our reefs are disappearing, the fish are not there, people cannot survive anymore. And so, you know, the leadership and the network provide us an opportunity to get help.

The latest number was 20 million, but I would say there are millions of people missing in the tech industry. Which often also refers to the need for confidence. And it's because of the rapid developments that we've seen within technology. The rapid development of things that we don't understand makes us afraid. So, the literacy of technology is crucial.
