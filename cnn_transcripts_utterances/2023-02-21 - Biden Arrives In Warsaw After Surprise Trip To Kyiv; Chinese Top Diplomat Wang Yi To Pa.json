This was the first time an American president has been in a war zone with no significant U.S. military presence. In other words, the safety and security for the leader of the free world was left to the Ukrainian police and Ukrainian soldiers. Air raid sirens could be heard ringing out in Kyiv, as Mr. Biden walked alongside the Ukrainian president around St. Michael's cathedral. During the visit, Joe Biden said Vladimir Putin's war of conquest is failing. And once again, he reaffirmed and reaffirmed his support for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Freedom is priceless. It's worth fighting for, for as long as it takes. And that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAUSE: Along with words or gestures or support, there's also deeds. President Biden announcing a new aid package for Ukraine whilst he was in Kyiv with $500 million in military equipment. U.S. officials are hopeful this will be enough to help put Ukraine in a position to negotiate terms for an end to the war. New package includes ammunition, anti-tank weapons, and radar to help detect possible Russian bombardment, but not the fighter jets Ukraine has been asking for is more now from one senior U.S. official.

The President has spoken to this we're going to stay in touch with the Ukrainians and with allies and partners about their needs.

John, we got a hint of you know what's on the agenda last week when you heard from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and they call this visit by China's top diplomat Wang Yi, who's on route to Moscow, of course is an opportunity for both China and Russia to exchange views about the relationship and also an opportunity to talk about international hotspot issues, which is China code for the war in Ukraine.Now on Monday, we did hear from Wang Yi he was speaking in Budapest. And while there he made this appeal, he said that China is willing to work with other countries for a lasting peace in Ukraine. We also heard from the Kremlin spokesman there saying that is not ruling out the possibility of a meeting between Wang Yi and the Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, this visit comes, of course, during a time of deepening diplomatic tension between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon incident and over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Just last weekend, the U.S. Secretary of State gave that warning to Wang Yi saying that there will be consequences if trying to provide material support to Russia. And China responded forcefully at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing on Monday. This is just a statement of what we heard from the spokesman on Monday, let's bring it up for you saying quote the U.S. is in no position to tell China what to do. We would never stand for finger pointing or even coercion and pressure rising from the U.S. on our relations with Russia. And that was a point that was made multiple times by the spokesman during that briefing. Look, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine we've seen both Russia and China edge closer together on a political level on an economic level as well. China continues to buy Russian energy which of course softens the impact of sanctions. And we will see just how far this no limits relationship is when Wang Yi touches down in Russia did it touch down Tuesday afternoon, local time, and whether or not he gets that meeting with Vladimir Putin.

And Aleppo slightly warmer by maybe a degree or two. The quake recovery here.

We can expect that the original earthquake 7.8 as we mentioned, backup a week ago that originally took place on February 6 rather a couple of weeks ago. And that is what we focused on around there with the epicenter and then of course the aftershocks to follow which was that 6.3. Noticing your forecast scattered showers here expected.

Really dangerous and concrete structure, something you see in even U.S. do. And but anything bill after the problem is there's no license system for engineers and contractors. And there's no requirement for engineers to be on site to make sure that the things get done right. So those things are lacking. And I'm sure that the government would change that immediately. And reconstruction can be started. And Turkish construction industry is extremely robust, as you may know.

That's where that the really issue what I saw there about place like Gaziantep was sits on at the fairly farm rock cite that that was really limited only less than 2 percent of buildings collapsed versus Hatay of 50 percent collapsed. So, it's a huge difference between what you at, makes a huge difference. And even Hatay, if you go into mountainside there's a rocky side and you live up there. So there's no damage there you see there. I will say that the probably a, you know, one of the 10 buildings we saw out there, which is a newer construction, now maybe more than that, maybe 20 percent.

So it's definitely the sole goal huge construction boom will happen in both countries because of a reconstruction. But it's happening almost same time.So yes, it's definitely the hotspots for construction. So it's definitely a material shortage will be happening. And also the donors, the, you know, EU, to U.S., to many other countries is definitely the, you know, there's so much finite amount of money is here. So it's a -- it makes it extremely difficult. The key is though not only public money, but private sector investments actually really critical. If you look up the audit disaster in the past, around a 10 to 50 percent of the reconstruction done by public money rest has come from the privately actually.

From the early days when many sought shelter from bomb blasts and the safest place they could find, the underground. Men, women, children all heading into the subway system in hopes of staying safe and staying alive. The March 16th bombing of Mariupol of the drama theater, one the most brazen of Russia's attacks. Officials say hundreds of people have taken refuge in the building with the word \"children\" painted outside on the sidewalk. Just days later a memorial was set up in the city of Lviv to honor the children killed in that war. 109 baby carriages placed in the central square, one for each dead child. Some of the most iconic and graphic images from the war came from the bombing of a maternity hospital, also in Mariupol. An Associated Press photo of emergency workers tag (ph) a pregnant woman on a stretcher outside the hospital was seen around the world. There is no happy ending, the woman and her baby did not survive. Those photographs are just some of the many images that stand out from a year of war in Ukraine.

That moment, was that, did you think a turning point? ANASTASIA TAYLOR-LIND, PHOTOJOURNALIST: It was absolutely a turning point. It was the moment when ordinary civilians deposed a president who had very close ties to Russia and demonstrated that they wanted to move forward with closer ties to Europe.
