The DNC, by the way, last night used Trump Tower to troll the former president and his running mate ahead of tonight's VP showdown. One of the messages they projected on the building, \"Go, Coach Walz.\" Trump, for his part, had this to say about the debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER US PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're so rigged and so stacked. You'll see it tomorrow with J.D., it'll be stacked. He's going up against a moron, a total moron. How she picked him is unbelievable. And I think it's a big factor. There's something wrong with that guy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Quite frankly, Governor Walz still goes into this debate as the underdog, in spite of J.D. Vance having, what, a 35 percent approval rating, 46 percent, not approval -- unapproval rating, essentially, in spite of him being an evangelist for Trump's Project 2025, in spite of his war on women, in spite of the fact that he simply has been an extremist, election denying, insurrection support. In spite of all that, Governor Walz still goes into this as the underdog.So I think it's important for the coach to take off the headset and put on the jersey. He must block and tackle tonight. Part of the blocking is making the American people understand that the past three plus years have been a down payment on the progress we have to make. And so, we have to protect that. That's what this election is all about. But he has to tackle. He has to tackle the extremism that comes along with J.D. Vance and Donald Trump, but also tackle the issues that Kamala Harris has laid out so eloquently that she and he will tackle together, whether it's housing, whether it's healthcare, whether it's child affordability, whether it's the climate crisis, all those things.

You see President Biden at the beach and, yes, he's been on the phone. But there are real questions about who's running the country. Biden does not seem mentally or physically capable of handling himself in standard situations. So what happens during a disaster?

When there has been a disaster, we've seen Democrats, particularly President Biden and Vice President Harris, step up and rescue the American people.When she was a United States senator, she continuously voted to give the American people relief when needed. Quite frankly, President Biden has been on the scene. That's why his FEMA director is planted in North Carolina until further notice. That's why he immediately called governor of South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, all impacted by the storm before the storm even hit, signed the emergency declaration so there would be no delay. And you compare that to when Donald Trump was in office. We had storms in Puerto Rico, disasters in Puerto Rico, disasters in North Carolina, both delayed response in North Carolina. In the 2017 hurricane, they received less than 1 percent of the necessary aid needed to heal those people. People remember that. People remember the lies. They remember the contrast. And quite frankly, Donald Trump is a person searching for relevancy in Georgia because he puts a strain on the ground with all the things that come along with a former president having to go to an area.

So it is really not clear, John, what level of influence President Biden, the White House, Secretary Blinken have now on the Israeli prime minister because at each stage, he has done what he and his advisers have judged to be in Israel's national security interests and has not paid a price for that for any time that he has gotten on the opposite side of issues or positions with the United States.
