President Biden kicked off his reelection effort with his first real rally on Saturday in Philadelphia, where he unveiled endorsements from labor unions critical to his coalition and offered a message that centered on the American economy. What you didn't hear, any mention from Biden of the Trump indictment currently dividing the Republican Party. We're just two months from the first Republican presidential debate, and the legal crisis facing front-runner Donald Trump is consuming the race in many ways, making it difficult for any of his competitors to get oxygen they need to gain support. And now, late this week, the Republican National Committee said it would refuse to give candidates a carve-out in the debate loyalty pledge the RNC is demanding. So, in order to debate, candidates must pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if that nominee becomes a convicted felon. It's a new wrinkle for a GOP field that has been largely hesitant to directly take on the man they're trying to beat, with some exceptions, of course. And joining us now is one of those exceptions, Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, the former two-term governor of New Jersey. Governor, first, Happy Father's Day. Thanks for joining us today.",

We now have that opportunity to let states to make that decision state by state. Let's see what the states do here and see if they form a national consensus, because there's no way you're going to get 60 votes in the Senate for anything unless you have formed a national consensus. So I want the states to go about doing their work. Many have been arguing for 50 years that they should have that chance. I have been one of those people arguing that for 50 years.

Do I really think they should be paying higher taxes here? I don't. Look, I think, if we give people plenty of time to plan -- and I'm talking about raising retirement age for people currently in their 30s and 40s. People who are in their 50s and 60s, they have already passed the time when they could do planning for their retirement. And Social Security has to remain where it is for them. But in people in their 30s and 40s, we could save a significant amount of money for the program. And let me remind everybody that, if we don't make any changes at all, by 2034, what we're going to be dealing with in 10 years is a 24 percent cut in everyone's benefit. So we need to come up with a bipartisan solution. But taxes would not be a part that bipartisan solution for me, Jake, because I think these Democrats in Washington have placed enough taxes on the people of this country, and they don't need more.

One we have yet to hear from is Trump's former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who also served as secretary of the Army. And joining us now is former Secretary Mark Esper. Secretary Esper, happy Father's Day. MARK ESPER, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  Thanks, Jake. You too. TAPPER:  So let's start with the indictment of your former boss. You have plenty of experience handling classified documents as secretary of defense and secretary of the Army. What was your reaction when you learned from the indictment that Trump had all these documents pertaining to very sensitive topics, classified topics, the country's nuclear programs, defense capabilities, vulnerabilities, just lying around Mar-a-Lago, in some instances showing them to people without classified clearance, allegedly? Do you think his actions put America's national security at risk?",

But, at some point, it'll continue to pick up momentum and we will see the type of offensive that we have been expecting. And, look, it's very important for a number of reasons, not least of which is the battlefield, what happens on the ground, Ukraine's ability to push the Russians back out of their country. But, at the political level, it will affect continued Western support for the Ukrainians. We want to see -- most nations want to see a return on this investment and want to see the Ukrainians do well with the means they needed. One piece of this fight that's troubling, though, is, you get reports from the battlefield that Russian air support superiority has really taken a toll on the Ukrainians so far. And this is going to be something we look back and say, boy, if only we had provided the Ukrainians air support, the F-16s, other aircraft sooner, it could have made a difference here in the initial phases of this operation.",
