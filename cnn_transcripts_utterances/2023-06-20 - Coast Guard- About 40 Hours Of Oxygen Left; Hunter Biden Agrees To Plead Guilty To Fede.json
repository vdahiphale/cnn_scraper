      "sentences": "Right now, both American and Canadian Coast Guard officials are combing the seas for any evidence of that missing tourist dive vessel. Four people and a pilot were on board as it's submerged off the coast of Newfoundland to visit the shipwreck site of the Titanic. It was about an hour and 45 minutes into their voyage that it lost contact with its support ship.Now that was on Sunday and now officials estimate there are only about 38 to 39 hours left until they run out of oxygen. The vessel is about the size of a minivan and it's a property of an expedition company called OceanGate. The U.S. Coast Guard says their surge area is about the size of the state of Connecticut. But one of the biggest challenges is the depth of the vessel may have already reached. At some 3,200 feet, you can no longer see light. And while much of this search equipment is equipped with sonar, keep in mind that Titanic wreckage sits at more than 12,000 feet below the surface. We want to take you now live to Ottawa and CNN's Paula Newton has been tracking all these details for us. So Paula, what can you tell us about the latest of this ongoing mission?  PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris. We just had a very sobering update from the U.S. Coast Guard which as you say is leading certainly the search and rescue. But that's in a unified command with both Canadian and American officials. And I have to say, Boris, with all the resources they can muster literally from anywhere in the world. What has happened now though and just to try and start with the good news here is that a vessel called Deep Energy has arrived at the site and is already doing what they knew need to - had to be done immediately and that was actually try and go to the depths of the seabed there. They had already searched about well over 7,000 square miles in the air. And I had been saying having been in those waters that if the submergible had come to the surface, that it would take some time to find it even in the water given as you just said the size no bigger than really a family van. Having said that, though, now that they've actually told us how much they've searched in the air and on the surface, it is important for them to get to do what they call a sub surface search and not require some deep diving I want you to listen now to Captain Jamie Frederick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: Today the vessel, Deep Energy, 194- meter pipe-laying vessel arrived on scene with underwater ROV capability. They have rendezvoused with the vessel, Polar Prince, they could then commenced an ROV dive at the last known of the position of the Titan in the approximate position of the Titanic wreck. That operation is currently ongoing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I know there's a P-8 already on scene from the Canadians that has enormous capability to search underwater. It's designed to search for subs.

So let me pick up right where Paula left off in the key question here.Once you're able to find this submersible, how do you lift it. And we have at least a potential answer to that from the Navy which says they're sending not only subject matter experts to assist in the search, but also what's known as the flyaway deep ocean salvage system. That's essentially a fancy name for something that can lift heavy things such as fallen aircraft or vessels off the bottom of the ocean floor and bring it up, crucially fly away. So you're able to transport it, you're able to bring it and connect it to a ship. And then you're able to use it, it would certainly be able to lift something of this size, which is to say not all that large, the submersible as long as you can find it. That, of course, remains the key question at this point and back to where we started this, what are the search assets that are being used. First, there are C-130s. Those likely use to search to the surface of the water, long range patrol aircraft that have the ability to stay up for a long time and keep searching an area the size of Connecticut. Here is the Pentagon Press Secretary from a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And prosecutors say that Hunter Biden didn't pay taxes on more than one and a half million dollars in income for each of those years.Now according to a source, the U.S. Attorney - the Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney David Weiss here has agreed to recommend to the judge that Hunter Biden get probation on those charges. Now under the statutory statute, the maximum possible punishment for those charges is up to a year in prison each. Now there's also that gun possession charge that you mentioned, and that is a felony. But in this instance, Hunter Biden won't plead guilty to that charge, instead it's going to be diverted which means that if he lives up to certain elements of conditions that are set by this agreement, then that charge will go away. And that's a common charge that's used in instances where someone has been under the influence and addict. It's a one way to resolve that kind of case. So clearly, a negotiated deal that has been in the works for some time, this investigation has spanned more than five years. And at one point it was looking into potential foreign lobbying violations, some money laundering violations with this resolution being announced today. Now, Hunter Biden's attorney said that this - to their knowledge means that this investigation is closed. That attorney Chris Clark also said, I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward now. How much of that will take place given that there's going to be a lot of attention from Republicans who are focusing on this investigation, not only saying that they're going to continue to look into the Biden family finances, but also exploring or hoping to, you know, get some more information about the Department of Justice investigation that ultimately led to the guilty plea filing that we saw today. Now, the next thing here will be - a judge will be assigned to this case and then Hunter Biden will come into court behind me and allocate to these charges say that he he's pleading guilty to them and saying to the judge exactly what crimes he's committed, Brianna?",

But one thing that a senior Biden adviser told me was that they do not direct or advice that legal team on what they should do. But they certainly have kept apprised of this.And the President himself, he remarkably has made little to no effort to distance himself publicly from his son throughout this investigation. Instead, he has really embraced him. We have seen Hunter Biden at the President side at public events on a foreign trip to Ireland just a couple of months ago where he was a constant presence there. And so it's no surprise that the first reaction we're getting from the White House is a statement of support from the President and the First Lady saying, \"The President and the First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life. We will have no further comment.\" That's a statement from the White House spokesman, Ian Sams. And the President, as recently as several weeks ago, said that he is proud of his son that he doesn't believe that he has done anything wrong. Of course, in this case, Hunter Biden has now admitted to wrongdoing with these expected guilty pleas. But White House officials and the President's personal attorney, as I said, they have kept tabs on this situation. And so this did not come as a surprise to the President in the way that we have seen when charges are announced against the former president, for example, the President hasn't been aware of that. But that's because of the communication with Hunter Biden's legal team, not because of any involvement with the Justice Department.
