As little as 20 minutes of moderate activity a day, five days a week, can significantly lower the risk of depressive symptoms for people over 50. And this is especially true for people with conditions often linked to depression, such as diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pain. Moderate physical activities, typically defined as an activity that, quote, \"takes your breath\" so that it is hard to speak while doing it, like brisk walking, bicycling, dancing, playing tennis, or running up and down stairs. Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency Safety Committee is looking into the risk of suicidal thoughts in patients who use popular medicines for weight, like Ozempic. The review comes after three case reports raised by the Icelandic Medicines Agency. Two were cases of suicidal thoughts; one following the use of Ozempic and another use of another -- after another drug called Saxenda.",

I mean, it can be hard if not impossible to predict, of course, who is going to win any match on any given day.But tell us what stands out to you about Eubanks' game -- how he plays. Why this is his moment. How he was able to sort of turn things around for himself. MATS WILANDER, FORMER PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER, 7-TIME GRAND SLAM WINNER, EUROSPORT TENNIS COMMENTATOR:  Yes, so he's got a very big game. Obviously, he's six-foot-seven so he's got a huge serve. He's got a one-handed beautiful backhand. He's talked about basing his game on Roger Federer's game and watching a lot of YouTube videos. So he plays sort of an old-fashioned traditional tennis. He hits the ball really hard from both sides. He's got an amazing attitude. And I actually talked to him a couple of times and interviewed him here at Wimbledon and he said that he gives a lot of credit to the time he spent as a tennis commentator because he started to look at the game differently and he realized the players were going in and out, sometimes, of matches mentally. And that has given the confidence and knowledge that he didn't have before. So, I mean, I don't know where this is going to end but it's an amazing story. It's definetely the Cinderella story of this tournament. And Daniil Medvedev is tough but Chris Eubanks -- he's got a huge game, and I think that's the big difference from other players that sometimes get through to a quarterfinals. We don't know how good he can play. He's playing great. He might have to play better.",

You were thinking Frances Tiafoe. That was who you were thinking of going into this tournament. Eubanks admitted struggling with the playing surface of grass. I think he had this great comment in his press conference a month ago. He was texting back and forth with Kim Clijsters saying basically that this is the stupidest surface to play on. I'm paraphrasing to some degree. Talk about that -- the ability to kind of get over that and the surface itself.",

But you don't come to the net as much, but he is coming to the net. He is very difficult to pass. Very difficult to lob over, of course. But it's also not enough in today's game to just sort of hit a slice backhand and come to the net, or serve and volley and go to the net all the time. Guys are too good at returning and hitting passing shots. So you really have to construct points before you get to the net. And he's doing that. He's more aggressive than anybody in this -- in this draw for sure. So for everybody that's up against him, it's not a style that you see every day and you might play a player like that a couple of times a year. So, it's a big surprise to a lot of guys. But I think that most important is his mindset. That he's relaxed. He puts no pressure on himself.",

SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  Apparently not, and the reason why I say that is because if it was you would have Department of Defense officials negotiating with Sen. Tuberville. But in this particular case, they're not responding to him. They're not visiting with him. We can take each one of those nominations one at a time. The commandant for the Marine Corps could be voted on today and passed out, but they're one at a time. What Sen. Tuberville has done has said we're not going to do by unanimous consent a whole bunch of them all at one time. But if the Department of Defense says this is a very serious issue and it's one that we need to resolve tomorrow, all they've got to do is make the phone call to the senator and say this is our problem.

You found it -- you find it in the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan back in 2020. It was being utilized at that point.

China is very advanced in this and they are continuing to develop their databases. They're looking at databases in the West right now. It's one of the reasons why you find TikTok being something that they promote. But it's not just China but the other countries in the world that are our usual adversaries are also using it.

And Northwestern University president Michael Schill, who is part of that investigation, said that 11 current or former players acknowledge hazing had been ongoing. But not just hazing -- specifically, hazing that included forced participation, nudity, and sexualized acts in a degrading manner.Some student-athletes, according to the investigation, believed it was all fun and games. Others believed it was incredibly harmful. And while that hazing was well known by many in the program, according to the investigation, the investigator found no credible evidence that head coach Pat Fitzgerald knew of what was happening. That said, according to the investigation, it also reads that \"The hazing we investigated was widespread and clearly not a secret within the program, providing Coach Fitzgerald with the opportunity to learn what was happening. Either way, the culture in Northwestern football, while incredible in some ways, was broken in others.\" That statement went on. \"...as much as Coach Fitzgerald has meant to our institution and our student-athletes, we have an obligation -- in fact, a responsibility -- to live by our values, even when it means making difficult and painful decisions such as this one. We must move forward.\" Now, I've reached out to Coach Fitz, as he's known, along with his agent, and we haven't heard back anything on that front. But Coach Fitzgerald has denied knowing any of this was going on up to this point. And just for context for anyone who may not know, he has been involved either as a player or a coach with Northwestern for nearly 30 years and is, by far, the most successful football coach in Northwestern history. But clearly, these allegations and the investigation got to a point where the university felt they had no choice.",
