I want to bring our legal analyst, Laura Coates, back in with us. Laura, this update from Chief John Drake, really, quite remarkable. He said that Audrey Hale had some seven firearms that had been bought at five different stores legally. Now we did know yesterday - I'm going to go back to this press conference. Laura, stay with me. All right, never mind that appears to be over. But, Laura, there is no law in Tennessee that would have, according to the police chief, had these guns taken away from Audrey Hale, despite the fact that Hale was under a doctor's care. So this will, I imagine, prompt another conversation about Red Flag laws.",

Laura, stay with me.I do want to bring in Amara Walker, who was at that press conference in Nashville, Tennessee. Amara, it's clear that the police in Nashville are still grappling with the question of a motive. The police chief saying there that the school was targeted but that individuals were not. AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: That's correct. And I do want to mention, you know, just seeing Chief John Drake, you could see just in his eyes how emotionally depleted he is. And this is obviously something that has impacted him greatly along with his officers, who he has said in interviews this morning that even his officers are questioning if they can continue to work in this line of work. So some of the headlines from this news conference. I mean, the fact that this shooter had bought seven firearms, all legally. Three of those firearms were used in this school shooting here at Covenant School. But they were all purchased legally and locally at several different stores here in the Nashville area. And you heard there from Chief John Drake that they interviewed the parents. They did reveal that Audrey Hale had some emotional disorder. He wasn't sure if it was Autism. That's apparently what one reporter asked about. But had some kind of emotional disorder. And I don't want to obviously equate Autism to emotional disorders. But that's what was asked about and he said he wasn't sure about that. But, Chief John Drake also mentioned that, even if Audrey Hale or reported in terms of her mental fitness or emotional disorder, were there any laws in Tennessee that would have prevented her - and that's how the chief referred to Audrey Hale as a her, because, again, you know, there have been questions about, you know, how the shooter identified. Chief John Drake said that there are no laws he currently knows of that would have prevented her from purchasing all of these guns. But also really stuck out was the fact that the mother saw Audrey Hale leaving the house on Monday morning with the bag. Clearly, there were weapons and ammunition inside. The mother didn't stop to open the bag. The mother did ask Audrey Hale, what's in that bag? And she basically kind of, you know, said there's nothing in here, dismissed it. Told police that she didn't know her daughter had weapons inside and let her go off to wherever she was headed. And obviously, that was here to the Covenant School, where six lives were just horrifically taken - Alex? MARQUARDT: Yes. The chief there saying that the parents thought that Audrey had sold the guns because, I believe one weapon had been sold, but Audrey had bought seven of them legally at five different stores. Three were used in yesterday's attack. And, Amara, the police chief there talking about what was in Audrey's writings, saying that the school was targeted. But Audrey did talk about other locations. But it wasn't clear, it seems, to the police that those were other targets as well.",

I want to bring back in Laura Coates on this question of the motive. Laura, you heard there Amara talking about how the police chief making clear that they're still looking into this motive. And they have learned a lot and they have shared a lot in the past 24 hours. They have spoken to Audrey's parents. They have read Audrey's writings. How much more can they do to try to get at this question of motive?",

But through documents it might be found on her computer, documents or correspondence to different people.There might be a social circle or network that she is involved in trying to figure out if she gave warning to somebody else, if she was egged on by someone else, did she act alone in the planning of any of this, was there somebody who conspired or could have prevented? We're talking a lot about the Red Flag laws or the absence thereof and what her parents may have been able to see. While the police investigation now we'll look at whether this was truly foreseeable. What can they look to figure out? And I just want to take a step back here. Every time we talk about motive, we do not use that term synonymously with justification. There is no justification for what has happened. But the motive is what the police officers and investigators will look at as a kind of forward thinking deterrence. What can we learn from what's happened here to either create laws or create new law enforcement protocol or to create some nuance in the law to be able to prosecute or to prevent these actions from happening in the future? So I want to be clear. Whenever people hear that term, there is a very big cringe factor, as we look for a motive, because people think it somehow would mean you feel better about what's happened. We will not. But what it can do is be used proactively by law enforcement and the greater legal and legislative community to try to prevent it from happening again.",

Tens of thousands - you can see right there - all across the country protesting and going on strike. Netanyahu announced that he would delay voting on that judicial overhaul, ostensibly to allow time for more debate. Some of the proposed changes would allow Israel's parliament to overturn decisions by the state, the country's Supreme Court. I want to bring in Ehud Barak. He is, of course, the former prime minister of Israel. He was also the country's deputy prime minister under Benjamin Netanyahu, though, I should note he is in the opposing party.

That's the end of the procession route, if you like, for this union-organized protests against Macron's plans to change the pensionable age from 62 to 64. Now the government here has deployed a huge number of extra police.You can see a hand -, relatively speaking, a handful. There are very large numbers of police out on the streets of Paris. An extra five and a half thousand on the streets of Paris, 13,000 around the rest of the country. There were deep concerns that there was going to be violence following the demonstration. There has been a lot of tear gas, a lot of throwing of rocks and stones at the police and the gendarmerie, but they seem to be containing it by the standards of Paris. Now the whole city has got fairly used to these demonstrations. This is the 10th in a row. But the numbers are down. According to the government, 740,000 people demonstrating around the country, 93,000 here in Paris, down from 120,000 last Thursday. But that doesn't take away from the boiling anger that is here over these pension reforms that are opposed by about two-thirds of the country. The problem for the opposition is that the legislation is all but done. There's almost nothing they can do to reverse it other than have street protests. And that means the possibility of escalating violence and, of course, strikes. The problem with strikes is that the country has been on and off strike since the middle of January, and people are really suffering from strikes. They're not getting paid, Alex. That means that even, for example, here in Paris, the garbage collections are going to restart tomorrow simply because the garbage collectors have run out of wages. So this steam may go out of some of these protests over the next few weeks. The problem is, for Macron, the anger against him and his legislative program is definitely not going away - Alex?",
