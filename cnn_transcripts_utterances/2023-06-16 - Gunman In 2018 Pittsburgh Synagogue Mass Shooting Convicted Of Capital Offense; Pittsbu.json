A jury just found that shooter guilty on multiple counts, nearing 40 counts so far. They're still reading in that courtroom and includes capital offenses and hate crimes.I want to go outside the courtroom. That is where we have CNN's Danny Freeman live in Pittsburgh.

So far, all have been found guilty. And that is including Dana, as you said, the 22 capital offenses.Remember, Robert Bowers, he faces 63 federal charges already convicted of 41 now, I should say, 22 of capital offenses, and I just want to read the capital offenses he's facing. It's obstruction of free exercise of religious belief resulting in death, and then also the use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. And also, Dana, convicted so far on all of the hate crimes that he was accused of earlier. And I just want to reset for a moment. This is a long time coming. This shooting happened on October 27, 2018. This community in Pittsburgh, this Jewish community in Pittsburgh has been waiting for some kind of justice, some kind of answer to have their day in court. And they're getting this as we speak. And just, if it's all right, I'll read the names specifically where these capital offenses come in. Robert Bowers convicted of killing and obstructing their ability to exercise their religious beliefs. Joyce Feinberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mallinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Dan Stein, Mel Wax and Irv Younger. So, Dana, that's the latest from this point. We're now after these -- this full list of charges and convictions. If they continue this way are done and finished, then we will move on to the death penalty phase. And that's where we're expecting the defense to actually spend a lot more time trying to spare Robert Bowers life essentially, because they never disputed that he was the one who came into that synagogue and killed those 11 worshippers. They were just trying to poke holes in the motive. We heard that in the closing arguments yesterday. But I think we're going to see a lot more activity from the defense in this definitely face also note, the prosecution called 60 witnesses to get to this guilt phase. The defense did not call a single witness and they only cross examined a handful. So again, we're listening. We're looking at these verdicts coming through, 46 now convictions for Robert Bowers in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial. Dana?",

We don't have cameras in, we don't have audio in, but we do have a producer in there who is getting us the information. 63 charges in total, as you said Danny 22 capital charges. He's guilty on those and we're waiting for the rest of the 10 and change or so. We're going to get back to you when you get more information. As we get all of the counts, Danny.I wanted to bring in Elie Honig, CNN legal analyst. And Elie, so much to explore here with you. I just want to say first and foremost, I know obviously, you're an attorney. And I want you to give me the legal point of view and import of this. But just in reading what has happened during the course of this trial. The prosecutors laying out in very stark, harrowing detail about this shooter, going into the synagogue where three -- actually three separate congregations were worshipping at the same time on that day in October of 2018. He was hunting down Jews who were worshipping, some were wrapped in their prayer shawls. Some were clutching their prayer books. And now we have a jury in the midst of finding him guilty of capital offenses. ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSIST. U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Yes, Dana. This is a moment of deep solemnity and grief, and one would hope some measure of justice for the victims and for their families and for the entire community. This is the worst single antisemitic attack most deadly antisemitic attack in United States history. [12:05:00] And what's really important to me about this verdict than I imagined to the victims and the families is that prosecutors had to prove and now the jury has found as a necessity under law that the reason this person committed this heinous attack was because of antisemitism because he was motivated by hatred for Jewish people. You cannot find this individual guilty unless you find that that's the reason for the attack under the hate crimes laws. The jury has now made that finding. And you know, Dana, our system, our justice system can never undo what's done, it can never undo the hurt, but it hopefully can deliver at least some measure of justice and solace. And that's what we've seen here today from this jury.",

Importantly, a murder is a state level crime. And there are state charges that have been put on hold, pending this investigation in this case.But I think it was a powerful statement by the United States Department of Justice made actually under the prior administration, when this horrible event happened, that we're going to prosecute this as a hate crime. That we are going to argue and prove to a jury that the reason that this man went into a synagogue was intentional, because he hated Jewish people. He had posted things online that he wanted to kill all Jews, but there was a strange sort of defense argument here that actually he wanted to -- he was angry at immigrants, not Jewish people, but immigrants. And the jury has soundly rejected that. So, now we know that a jury has found, and I think this is -- I imagine this is quite significant for the families and the victims. But the reason for this murder was antisemitism.",

Caroline, your thoughts?CAROLINE POLISI, FEDERAL AND WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yes. As Danny indicated, we call those victim impact statements. They are often incredibly moving incredibly powerful testimony. As you noted this is a bifurcated trial. We know now that those 22 capital eligible charges have been, you know, the jury has found him guilty of those will move immediately into the sentencing phase now, where the sort of level of evidence allowed is different. As you noted, the defense will put on more evidence, what's known as, you know, aggravating factors versus mitigating factors. They will try to argue that although he has been found guilty of these charges, he should not be given the death penalty. The prosecution, obviously, will argue that the death penalty should be imposed. And we'll see, you know, more evidence in that regard.

When this happened, this in particular, this was the single biggest, worst antisemitic attack in the history of the United States.And it seems as though, the defense even though they're going to have to push back against their client getting the death penalty in the next phase of this trial in the phase that just wrapped up.

The defense approach here was that he was not motivated exactly by antisemitism, but by a hatred for immigrants. He had actually gone online and been radicalized, essentially reading things about how Jews were helping immigrants come into the country, and how that was a danger that motivated him.The prosecution, of course, pushed back hard against this. He went into a synagogue, he targeted Jews, he killed Jews. He said in many of his online postings that his goal was to kill Jews. And one of the interesting -- important aspects of this case is that he was motivated this individual by hatred for a group called HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which has a long history dating back to World War II of helping millions of people, originally Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. And now Jews and non-Jews alike, including refugees from Ukraine, and that hatred for that heroic group is part of what spurred this individual to commit this heinous act. The jury has now spoken. The jury has declared that the reason he did this was because of hatred for Jewish people because of antisemitism.",

And I also want to mention some -- I mentioned some of the reporting and the data that you have coming out of the ADL.Just to remind our viewers in 2022, last year, you tabulated nearly 4000 antisemitic incidents throughout the U.S., a 36 percent increase from 2021. I don't want this question to come off as naive. But when you see a result, like we see in Pittsburgh, do you see any hope that there is a deterrent there?",

So, since that massacre in 2018, in 2019, the numbers hit an all-time high, that was eclipsed by another all-time high in 2021. And then again in 2022, the total number of antisemitic incidents, Dana, is more than 500 percent greater today than just a decade ago.So, to your point, we have seen a tsunami of anti-Jewish hate. This act wasn't the first in that line. And since then, we've seen shootings in Poway, hostage taking in Pittsburgh, sorry, in Colleyville, Texas, assault on Jews in broad daylight in New York City. I mean, it goes on and on. So, will this be a bit of a deterrent? I think it's too soon to tell. But when the systems work, when justice is served, that's a sign to would be antisemites, whether they are right wing extremists like this person or hardened antisemites from the left or whomever they may be, that there is no place for this kind of rhetoric in this kind of region or public square data. That alone is a very important message, not just to that would be culprits, but to the Jewish community to know that the systems can work for us, and that indeed, we can be protected as well.",

I was there, I went visited that synagogue and talk to a couple of the people who survived, it was a hostage standoff. But the person who held them hostage was ultimately killed by law enforcement. And in so many of these instances that is what happens.So, we don't see a trial, like we saw in Pittsburgh. So, this is different in that case.

And here in France, they have dealt with stabbings and beheadings and other attacks on Jewish people. And very rarely do those culprits come to trial, sometimes they are killed by law enforcement. Sometimes the crimes are actually dismissed as not being antisemitic in nature, like pushing an elderly Holocaust survivor out a window. I could go on, they're really quite grotesque.And the truth is, Dana, that the American justice system can indeed work, and this is an example. And again, as torturous as the testimony was as grueling as it was to the families and loved ones of the survivors and everyone in that community. I believe it was important to illustrate again, that our systems can work and people regardless of how they pray, that alone where they're from, or who they love should be protected in America from this kind of, hey, there's something else here. Just to point out, you know, you were talking earlier in the segment, a fact that this man was motivated by these ugly conspiracy theories about Jews, trying to commit the, \"great replace,\" trying to replace as it were white Americans with immigrants, Muslims, Mexicans, whatever madness he was spewing. And this is really crucial. The antisemitism itself is a conspiracy theory, Dana, about how the world works. I believe the Jews are at the center of plots and machinations and whatnot. There's no truth to it. But it also shows us how dangerous it is when these ideas are laundered in politics, or in media or in the public conversation. So, the great replacement theory, whether again, it's defaming Jewish people, or the Jewish state, it's just wrong and it's got to stop.",

I just spoke to one of the presidents of one of the congregations that was impacted just a moment ago and there was relief that this verdict has come down. But I just want to also emphasize that this next phase is going to be very difficult for this community. [12The death penalty, I should say prosecutors have been seeking the death penalty for a number of years. And throughout that time, different family members, different congregations have expressed different opinions about whether or not they feel that Bowers should ultimately be put to death. And it's interesting that while there is relief about today's verdict, even during jury selection, then there was a lot of conversation about not guilt, but the next phase. The guilt was almost taken for granted by folks in that he wouldn't be found guilty. The defense was not arguing that he didn't do this. This day and this moment, still, of course, as was mentioned by previous guests, still monumental. But I just want to illustrate that the next step in the healing and the perception of justice after this is going to be very hard from this community. We got a statement yesterday from one of the congregations that just talked about forgiveness and the difficulty of forgiveness because this shooter still has not asked for forgiveness. And the statement from the new light congregation said, the dead cannot forgive. So, I think that today is a monumental moment.

I just got off the phone with a pastor in Iowa. And he was telling me that there are real concerns about the indictment that he's hearing, some of the folks that were supporting Trump are moving on to DeSantis.
