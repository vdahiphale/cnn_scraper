I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Israel now threatening serious consequences after Spain, Norway and Ireland, all announced its plans to recognize a Palestinian state. Passengers describe the terrifying moment their Singapore Airlines flight experienced severe turbulence. 20 people remain in the ICU, as investigators try to begin piecing together what happened. And more wild weather, this time tornadoes, sweeping through small towns in the Midwest, leaving a trail of destruction with fears of more to come. We have a live report coming up. This is CNN Newsroom. Well, we want to begin this hour with that historic decision by three European countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Spain, Norway and Ireland have all announced plans to formally recognize Palestinian statehood beginning next week. Now, that triggered an angry response from Israel, which is recalling its ambassadors to all three nations. Spain's Prime Minister says that the decision is not a statement against Israel or in favor of Hamas, but a move toward a peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PEDRO SANCHEZ, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER (Interpreted): After having reached a consensus between the two parties that make up the progressive coalition government and echoing the majority feeling of the Spanish people, next Tuesday, on the 28th of May, Spain will approve, its Council of Ministers, the recognition of the State of Palestine. JONAS GAHR STORE, NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER (Interpreted): Recognition of Palestine is in support of moderate forces that are on a retreating front in a protracted and cruel conflict. This is an investment in the only solution that can bring lasting peace in the Middle East. It is a strong call to other countries to do the same as we are doing today.",

So, I think each of these three countries come at it from a slightly different perspective and place because of what their countries stand for, their national identities.But, it is, in essence, about a frustration that they're watching a lot of suffering of Palestinian people, the deaths, the lack of food, all of these issues, and they feel that the only way to change the situation, the political situation there at the moment is to take this move right now. Now, that's a move rejected by the United States. It's a move rejected by the French, for example, who both say, look, we recognize and accept that there should be a two-state solution, that there should be a Palestinian state and an Israeli state. But, the French say, now is not the time to move. We should all do this together. But, these countries, Ireland, Spain and Norway, have decided that, by waiting, you don't get any closer to the objective.

That's what he said.

But, this is an anti-Hamas measure, because what we are strengthening are the forces in the region and in Palestine, who believes in peace with Israel, and who detests the work of Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis in the region.

So, all of these are discussions that continue to be underway. The President has said before that he believes that this could still be reached with the Israeli Prime Minister despite some of the objections that they may have.But, of course, this is also happening while the conflict in Gaza is ongoing, and that conflict needs to recede for this to get underway in earnest. In fact, I've been talking with U.S. officials. They often say that, should there be a temporary ceasefire, that would allow an opening to give these talks more momentum, but in the interim, it is obviously difficult for them as this conflict continues between Israel and Hamas.",

They have been plastering the cities with posters depicting the President, the Foreign Minister and the others who were killed in that crash, and they have encouraged people to come here to participate in this mourning.As far as the people themselves are concerned, many of them of course say that they are very sad. They're shocked by what's happened. But, many of them also say, we need to know what happens next. It's interesting, because the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, even while the helicopter was still missing, he came out and he said there would not be any disruption to the government. Iran's government has already called for new elections that are going to take place on June 28th, as they try to portray stability, but also trying to of course find a new government to lead the country forward.

And he was just trying to do his best to be flat -- to deflect it. But, look, he is distracted, and that's really kind of leads to what happens if he ends up having the job of President again.

But, more so than the polls, I think these primaries are more -- a more accurate representation of where the Republican base is at. I mean, if 18 percent to 20 percent in every one of these states are showing up voting for somebody who got out 10 weeks ago, that tells you a really big directional sign as to where the Republican Party is headed as far as the total numbers.If Donald Trump wins this, he is going to need absolutely every single vote that he got in 2016 to show back up. And of course, we saw where a majority of those moderates and suburban voters, especially women, were at in 2020. And Donald Trump continues to have that math problem play out. But, he is not doing a good enough job reaching out. For folks like me that are lifelong Republicans, very conservative nature, but just not angry and full of vile and visceral comments, to try to move our agenda, we actually want to work with the other side. And to me, that's where this election is going to come down to increase the math problem for Republicans. But, I think looking through the lens of the Democratic side, Joe Biden has got to continue to figure out a way to message better about the economy and other issues, of course, Israel is one of those, but different strokes for different folks with this economy, from coming into the economy for the first time trying to buy a house, I'm really disappointed at where the economy is. If I'm in the economy where I'm trying to sell a house or looking at my 401(k) to retire, I'm probably pretty happy. So, there is a mixed bag of goods. SOLOMON: OK. Let's get back to this base problem that you just mentioned with Biden. Obviously, we have the first debate coming up in a few weeks. Obviously, Biden has a long political career. He has done his fair share of debates. That said, you are a communications expert. If you were on his team, if you were prepping Biden for this debate, what's the play?

We prepped him for the debate. A big piece of what wound up resonating coming out of those debates with Donald Trump in 2020 was Joe Biden's humanity, his fundamental decency. People sensed that he was not perfect, but was going to fight for them and cared about them. And when you see Joe Biden on stage next to Donald Trump, you really -- you have a really clear opportunity to see that contrast.And so, for Biden, I think, as they prepare, they need to think about the fact that Trump is unpredictable. He obviously has shown that he will happily roll around in the gutter. That's where he seems to feel at home. And so, for Biden, he has to -- as he is preparing, he has to not be distracted by that. He has to not be pulled down into the gutter with Trump, but he has to use it as an opportunity to show people that he is a man of character, that he is somebody who is rock solid and steadfast, and that he cares about the people he is asking to vote for him. And I think he showed in 2020 that he is quite capable of doing that on the debate stage next to Donald Trump, and I think that's what they should be preparing for and trying to get out of this debate next month.",

The most important time during the trial was jury selection, when you had your one and only opportunity to make your first appearance in front of this jury and find out things about them as you selected them. But, it is certainly amongst the top three. These are the instructions on the law that the jury takes back with them to the jury room. And when they have a question amongst themselves, did the prosecution meet their burden of proof, they looked at these instructions to determine whether or not according to the law given to them by the judge, the prosecution has met their burden.And if there is a flaw in these instructions, if the defense is asked for something that's not included or they've asked for something that the court has overruled and has not included it, and it's an error that will result in a reversal, it becomes a critical portion of the case. Now, we heard from the judge yesterday during the charge conference that he is going to follow the standard for the most part, the standard jury instructions. And by doing that, he maintains a position that, look, I'm following what's been accepted for decades in terms of what we instruct the jury about. So, that helps to prevent some sort of reversible error. But, they are an important and critical part of this trial.",

These documents were false when they were filed. And why were they filed? They were filed to influence the election. They were filed in some ways in violation of campaign finance laws and rules regarding the election. But, for all 12 of them to agree on that, they have to somehow embrace at least a portion of Michael Cohen's testimony, and that's what's going to be critical here.Look, he is a witness with a lot of baggage. But, in many prosecutions, when you're dealing with a cooperating co-defendant, this is a type of witness you have all of the time. And you have to embrace and accept them, and the prosecution has done that. And the defense has done a good job poking holes in the prosecution's case and sort of focusing the jurors on Cohen's testimony. But, you know what? If those 12 people go back and they say, yes, he is lied, but he has lied not only under oath before, but he has lied to protect the person who is the defendant, and we heard a lot of that testimony in the last couple of days, then they may accept what he said as supporting the rest of the evidence. And while there are a couple of instances where he is the only witnesses to a conversation, or as to what's said, and what imparts knowledge and intent to the defendant in this case, there are other witnesses who can give that same type of evidence as well and record. So, the jury can go back and they can find that, in fact, the prosecution did support their case. It'll be interesting to see how the rebuttal argument of the prosecution goes after the defense has laid out for the jury why they believe the prosecution didn't meet their case, and that's another important factor here.
