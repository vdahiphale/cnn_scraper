And you look around, it is the only building in the round, the only museum in the round in the world such as this, and what he wanted to do was create the storing space, with no visible support in the middle, no columns, no pillars, but open air so that when you walk in, you literally are taken immediately to the heavens.",

Actually, now they believe, down to a mere 6.5 percent. The Germans, of course, having a conviction in previous times with that sort of level. France is down to five percent, and the thought might be that the ECB, might at least pause their rate hikes coming forward.

The Eurozone as a whole is looking at more internally driven inflation rather than some of the external factors, supply chains, commodities, et cetera that we've seen.

So I'm not real worried, not only in the visual arts, but frankly, in the creative arts, which gets to the Hollywood strikes.

About twenty, twenty-five or so Celsius. There's a lot of cooling centers set up across the entire country right now. It's not just New York in the East Coast, it is all the way to the other coast as well. Phoenix, Arizona, which is used to heat is having some of the worst ever. That city has broken records over 15 days so far this year of over 115 degrees heat. What is that? Forty-six degrees.

Now, the beauty of art is the question of the various movements, the different artists, the times upon which they painted, and the way they pushed agendas forward. So for instance, you have the Dutch Golden Age of Baroque in the 16th Century. It was epitomized by Johannes Vermeer. Who wouldn't like to have a Vermeer on their wall at the moment? But the Vermeer moves on to the impressionism developed in France in the mid-19th Century. Best of course, exemplified by Monet, Claude Monet. You move forward into cubism, in early 20th Century pioneered by Pablo Picasso. Indeed here at the Guggenheim, they have the early works of Picasso from his Paris years here. Experts believe we might be in the beginning of a major art shake up, which is all predicated by AI.

We're going to look around at some of the art, some of the more modern stuff. Why would not shouldn't be intimidating and I'm intimidated to start with. And September's Emmy Award ceremony has been postponed. The Writers are taking part. The Actors of course are taking part and we now wonder what's going to happen. Chloe will be with me to talk to me about it. We will only get to those stories and they all work after I've updated you with the headlines because this is CNN and on this network the news always comes first. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a Russian missile strike hits a residential town, a security service building in the city of Dnipro. He says all necessary services are on the site. Member of Parliament is in the city says he does not know of any casualties at this point. A 45-year-old woman has been hanged in Singapore for attempted heroin trafficking. She's the first female prisoner executed that in almost 20 years. Human rights group are calling it a grim milestone for a country with no tourists, the harsh anti-drug laws. Taylor Swift's contest -- concerts last weekend in Seattle, Washington were literally earthshaking (INAUDIBLE) just says the blasting music and screaming fans caused the equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. A similar phenomenon was recorded in 2011, during a Seattle Seahawks football game. If you don't know what you're doing, when you go to an art museum, it can be downright intimidating. And perhaps one of the beauties of the Guggenheim is it's fun-like building. The round and round and round. But then some of the art inside can be a little bit strange and intimidating in its own right. So that's why Naomi Beckwith, the chief curator left me a no doubt everyone's welcome.
