I think it's important to actually fact check the president there because when he came to office at the -- at the end of January 2021, it was 1.4 percent. And it hit 9 percent around June of 2022. So there in that interview with Erin Burnett, he's trying to make the case that he has saved the economy, basically, that he's turned it around. But there still is this major disconnect between what he says, what the administration says, what his campaign it says, and how people seem to be feeling because his ratings on the economy are down in the mid 30s. When we ask people how they feel about the job he's doing on the economy.",

I think that's absolutely right.As you said, just because Biden is defending his economy, doesn't mean that its going to translate to voters and that's the number one thing that I hear from Trump voters on the campaign trail when I asked them about why they're supporting Trump. I think one thing though that we saw Biden do this time in the CNN interview is he mentioned specifically that he has put a cap on late fees for credit cards and he's also put a cap on the amount that banks can charge when checks bounce. I mean, late fees is something that everyone has received and they're very annoying so I think doing those specific things, he's counting on, pointing out some specific actions he's made.

Erin pressed Biden about this and asked him about -- about what Trump had to say. Watch what Biden had to say about whether the election would be legitimate or not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They link immigration in the economy together when they see images from the border. They view it as something that is inextricably tied together, in their minds. And both of those issues seem to be playing two Republicans' hands.And we do have those numbers from our economy poll, 34 percent approve of what Joe Biden is doing on the economy, 66 percent disapprove.

He's on trial right now, and so he's been in New York City at telling New York City voters that Biden has letting immigrants come in and they're taking peoples jobs.

It's a hugely significant moment, not just because America is the biggest military backer in Israel, it's also its biggest diplomatic backer.So this is making Israel look more isolated, which is very damaging for Israel.

It's not a wide scale invasion.So while some people are suggesting can argue that Israelis have gone into Rafah, it hasn't crossed that red line for most people. Of course, the test is when they do that, how does Biden respond to that and there's a lot of pressure, isn't there, on Netanyahu to go into Rafah from the right wing but also just to finish this off to clean out Hamas.
