So, by and large, all that's going to be determined today is a) what occurs with the preventative detention. You'll remember that Andrew Tate was arrested -- put in jail in December of last year. He was released into house arrest after a court ruling in March of this year, so the court will find out if that continues -- how long it continues.And the second part that's supposed to occur today is to set a date for the trial. Now, the actual trial itself is expected to take many years. They were indicted yesterday, Romania's courts announced -- indicted, the two brothers, of human trafficking and rape, along with two other Romanian associates. The indictment dates back to events taking place in 2021 against seven women -- seven victims. The brothers have long maintained their innocence. And what is so concerning to authorities and to parents afraid of the influence of Andrew Tate is that every time he's in the headlines it seems that more attention is drawn to his social media accounts. His Twitter account was reinstated late last year. Since that time his number of followers has skyrocketed. Just since the announcement of the indictment yesterday, he's tweeted dozens of times from that account, including a video maintaining his innocence that has received four million views. I also have to note here that in addition to the indictment that he is facing now he is also under investigation for money laundering and trafficking of minors -- of minors. But despite the very serious criminal allegations he's facing he continues to just captivate and horrify.",

Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished lower. The Hang Seng down nearly two percent after signs that China's stimulus was less than some had hoped for. European markets are mixed as the U.K. inflation held steady in May. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now are barely mixed. Stocks were down for the second day in a row yesterday. The Dow down more than 200 points amid signs of weakening global demand. But U.S. home construction surged by the fastest pace in more than a year, climbing 21.7 percent from April.
