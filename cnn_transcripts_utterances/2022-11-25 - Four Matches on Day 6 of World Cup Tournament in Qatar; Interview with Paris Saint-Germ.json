Well, I'm Becky Anderson, hello, and welcome back to a special CONNECT THE WORLD, live all this week from Doha. We are on day six of the World Cup here in Qatar. Two matches down already today and two to go. We have two huge hours of incredible interviews, fan reactions and game coverage coming your way. Boding well for the weekend, the day's first match ended with high drama. Well, Iran netting two goals late in stoppage time to defeat Wales 2-0 to keep their hopes of advancing alive. A real turnaround after Iran got thrashed by England, 6-2 in their World Cup opener. Well, Qatar and Senegal faced off in the day's second match with a loss by either team, sending them to the brink of elimination. And that match is just over with Senegal winning 3-1, despite a spirited effort in the first goal of the tournament by Qatar that sent the crowd and fans around here -- fleeting to the highly anticipated face off later today between England and the U.S. England riding high after that first game against Iran. And the United States, coming from a disappointing 1-0 draw with Wales. England can clinch a spot in the final 16 with a win tonight and make some history in the process. Here's what both sides are saying about that game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said they are here to play football and win a tournament. They've definitely not win a tournament, compete in a tournament, and they have definitely regrouped. It was a much more together collective performance, if the emotion was still running very, very high amongst the crowd. They stuck in there. It was Wales who lost their head because it means so much to them as well, this first World Cup since 1958. And it was really, really incredible to see the emotions amongst the players, the staff on the touchline.

What the U.S. can learn from Qatar and we'll bring you that interview in the next hour. In case today's excitement made you forget what happened yesterday, I'm going to remind you. Brazil showed the world why they are ranked number one by defeating Serbia 2-0. Both goals were from Tottenham Hotspur striker Richarlison. Amidst the joy, there were also tears from football star Neymar. He suffered an ankle injury and it's not clear if the PSG player will be able to play in the next game. One person who has a unique view on Brazil's success is the former Brazilian left back, Maxwell. He played for them in the 2014 World Cup and is the current assistant sporting director for Paris Saint-Germain where Neymar plays.

By area, this is a big city. But normally, once they go off there normally are airstrikes. There was a loud detonation this morning. There was an attack on what turned out to be a gas station on the outskirts of town yesterday and there have been repeatedly attacks close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. That's been going on now for months, Becky, because also that location is also, as you know, a fire based used by the Russians. But one of the things that's interesting about this whole relentless campaign by Russia now to try to break the power generating capabilities and distribution systems of Ukraine is that it's another example of the Kremlin going after Ukraine civilian population. Having been not back in its attempt to catch a Kyiv, catch a Kharkiv, it switched to bombarding those cities particularly Kharkiv. You saw of course the mass destruction of Mariupol, and now we're seeing this latest effort to try to break the will of the Ukrainian people. It shouldn't come as any surprise. Jens Stoltenberg talked about the Russians weaponizing winter in this campaign. Well, if you're waging a war to try to win it, that is exactly what you would do. What the Ukrainians' response to that is yes, of course he's doing that. Give us the capability to defend ourselves against these swarms of cruise missiles that the Russians are sending to attack our generating capability and then we'd be able to not only get through winter but continue to have military success on the ground.

The Israelis have been giving moral and other humanitarian support to Ukraine but are refusing to supply their highly sophisticated anti-missile systems, the Iron Dome, and the other bigger system that we've seen so frequently in action there. So that is something that they are continuing to work on, but they haven't got -- the Ukrainians haven't got access yet to the Patriot missile. Germany and Poland are kind of discussing whether or not they ought to supply them, but they need to negotiate that also with the United States. That will be a very effective anti-missile missile system. There's a lot of equipment out there. What I think the pattern has been so far, and this goes back to 2014 when Ukraine was first invaded by Russia and her proxies, is that the NATO and her allies have been somewhat behind the loop. They've always been anxious about an excessive reaction coming from Moscow, and particularly with the use of sophisticated missile systems, and then they eventually catch up. You know, so back in 2014, Ukraine got no lethal aid. Now it's getting tank-killing equipment, it's getting tanks, it's getting armored personnel carriers. It's getting stinger missiles. It's getting other missiles that can bring down incoming aircraft from Russia. But it's not the top end stuff here -- Becky.",

But speaking with experts, Becky, what they say is they're hoping for an immediate effect that this would be some sort of a deterrent. Because they say what we've been seeing over the past couple of months is the result of decades of impunity and that no one has been held accountable for any of the human rights violations that have been taking place for decades. And you've had so many Iranians and human rights organizations that have been pushing the international community to do something like this. To establish an independent, investigative body. Some sort of an accountability mechanism. So they're really hoping that this could be a first step and a very significant one towards that accountability they're hoping to get to and impunity.

The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents and metal barriers. We frequently see these. This is normally used as part of COVID measures. The videos also show smoke and flames coming from the high floor of the building but the water failing to actually reach the fire because the firefighters are not close enough. We know that 10 people were killed and nine were injured in that fire at the apartment building in a room. And what adds to the tragedy, Becky, is that those victims likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building if not entirely. This whole situation has really struck a chord with the public here because we've seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food, daily necessities and emergency care in lockdown -- Becky.",

So they had announced a whole list of rules that are really just incremental baby steps that are tweaking the COVID rules. Not getting rid of zero COVID whatsoever. In fact, on the contrary, as we see these cases surging, coming into the wintertime, these local governments are doubling down on zero COVID. Going back to the playbook of draconian lockdowns. Mass testing, quarantines, but of course we know that with the new variance which are more contagious but less deadly, you cannot completely stamp out COVID. And a lot of these local governments are coming under a lot of pressure because it's expensive to be running these mass PCR tests. It's expensive to upkeep these mass quarantine facilities to house all the COVID cases and close contacts. Now the position from authorities is that zero COVID is the best way forward. They are worried that opening up would lead to a mass number of death. That it would overrun China's uneven health care system. But at this point, we are seeing so much public discontent and more people asking the question, that is it really COVID that is the danger? Or is it the COVID restrictions that are the danger? Because it is the measures right now that are leading to these scenes of suffering and tragedy -- Becky.",
