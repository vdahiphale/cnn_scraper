We are learning this morning that Donald Trump will be traveling later this week to Paris on the personal invitation from French President Emmanuel Macron for the grand opening, reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. This will be Donald Trump's first trip overseas since winning the election, and it will happen as a handful of his top cabinet nominations are facing more questions and more scrutiny on Capitol Hill with their confirmations hanging in the balance. Some of them, including Pam Bondi, who is up for A.G., Pete Hegseth, who is up for defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard, who is up for DNI, they're headed to the Hill today to meet with more lawmakers to make the case, shake the hands, and maybe answer some questions.Let's start this hour with CNN's senior political analyst Mark Preston for much more on this. Mark, can we start with Donald Trump headed to Paris, though. I want to get to nominations in a second. But in this moment, I'm going to present to you a multiple choice question, if you will, on the intent of Macron's invite, because you can just jump right on into his mind and guess. One, A, this is A, this is just old friends getting back together, B, Macron's play to position himself as Trump's favorite European, favorite ally, C Donald Trump's love of the cathedral's gothic architecture, or D, all or none of the above?",

He's somebody who's had trouble back in his own country with his favorability rating. Inviting Donald Trump to come over for this grand reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral is something that plays very well to Donald Trump's ego.And let's not forget, Donald Trump is somebody who has built his whole career, on what? On building things. So the fact that Donald Trump is going over there, not too surprising given that Macron is trying to position France as one of the, if not the, rather, leader coming out of Europe, especially as Donald Trump is talking about the dissolution of NATO. And we have new leaders of course, in Germany and in Great Britain, you know, from the time when Donald Trump was president before, Kate.",

There is, we know that still the Trump transition is ignoring the standard of putting these cabinet nominations up for -- to face FBI background checks, which is breaking from the standard. We are seeing now more openness from more Republican senators, especially to go along with that, just be OK with that.I had two staffers from Senate Judiciary, former staffers on yesterday, and Mark, a Democrat and Republican, and these are two guys that ran vetting for that key committee for years. And they called breaking from this tradition appalling and dangerous.

And if Donald Trump can keep less than three senators, and I mean senators, I mean Republican senators from opposing what he's doing, then Donald Trump's going to be able to do whatever he wants. There will be no FBI background checks on some of these folks.What that does do is it puts an incredible amount of pressure and stress now on the minority committee, which are the Democrats, to try to do these background checks as best they can for these confirmation hearings. And also, Donald Trump has talked about trying to push through as many folks as possible. Will he now put pressure on the Republicans leading these committees who are supposed to be doing the investigating in the vetting of all of this, will he put pressure on them to try to get these hearings done incredibly quick?

This time, she's going to be accompanied by six US Marshals to make sure nothing goes wrong, because so much had gone wrong to get to this point.Let me set the scene for you: A Delta flight going from JFK to Paris last week. The woman somehow slipped past multiple layers of airport and airline security to jump a flight she had no ticket for to Paris. She was discovered mid-flight as she had been bathroom hopping, which I didn't even know was a thing, throughout the journey. After landing at Charles de Gaulle, she was arrested and then made to return to the US on a flight on Saturday, but-but-but she caused such a disturbance on that flight that she was removed before it took off. One passenger told CNN she kept saying, \"I don't want to go back to the US, only a judge can send me back to the US.\" Joining me right now is CNN transportation analyst and former inspector general for the Department of Transportation, Mary Schiavo. Mary, I mean, there is so much going on here. I had to like list, that's why I wanted to kind of play out the timeline here for people on how we got to this point.

And this very elaborate, far-fetched movie that was released in 2020, and as you said, debuted close to here in Mar-a- Lago. Trump was there. He was in attendance and praised the movie. They tried to say that people who they called mules were showing up at drop boxes with all these fraudulent ballots, stuffing the drop boxes with votes and that's how they were committing voter fraud. There was no evidence at all whatsoever for this. So many different authorities investigated this even Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr, said there was nothing in the movie that showed widespread fraud. One individual who was shown in the movie on surveillance footage is a man in Georgia, and they alleged -- the movie suggested that he was one of these so-called mules. Georgia authorities investigated. He is not a mule. He was bringing his own vote and ballots belonging to his family to this drop site. So, he sued. He said that his life has been turned upside down because of this, and that is in part why Dinesh D'Souza, the creator of this film is apologizing.
