Jim Acosta is off tonight.Now, former President Donald Trump is stirring the political pot with new claims that he expects to be arrested on Tuesday. His campaign is already fundraising off that allegation. And new tonight, Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina blames the media and the district attorney for Trump's comments. In a statement to CNN, Tacopina says, \"No one tells us anything which is very frustrating. President Trump is basing his response on press reports and the fact that this is a political prosecution and the D.A. leaks things to the press instead of communicating to the lawyers as they should.\" Now the former president has not stated why he expects to be arrested as the investigation continues into hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels. But sources tell me and my colleague Kristen Holmes that Trump's legal team has gotten no word from the Manhattan DA's office about the timing of any possible indictment. We also know that at least one witness is still expected to testify before the grand jury on Monday. But if Trump is indicted, his defense team would be notified and then they would likely negotiate any possible surrender and initial court appearance with the district attorney. But in his Truth Social post, Trump also calls for protests over his anticipated arrest. And urges supporters to quote, \"take back our nation\". Now CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz has more on the long-simmering investigation out of Manhattan, Katelyn.",

However, we do know that this ongoing investigation into possible financial crimes may be falsification of business records of the Trump Organization all connecting back to that $130,000 payment that Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen made to Stormy Daniels to cover up things that she wanted to allege in his 2016 campaign. All of that investigation is nearing the end because Trump was invited to testify which he had the right to do. He declined to do that. That is the sort of thing that happens at the very end of a grand jury investigation like this. But we do know that there's another witness coming into the grand jury on Monday, at least scheduled to be testifying. And so at this point in time, we don't know exactly when or exactly what charges may be approved or may be asked to be approved by the grand jury sitting in Manhattan in this unprecedented investigation that could lead to a criminal charge against the former president of the United States, Paula.",

Polo, even though we don't have any confirmation of an arrest or that an indictment is certain, law enforcement is still preparing because of course, this would be an unprecedented event.

But it's the potential or at least the possibility that they could see a flare-up of violence, also a potential clashing with anti-protesters as well. And so that's why you have the local, the state, the federal agencies basically coming together to make sure that they have a plan in place to at least keep some of those state court facilities here in lower Manhattan that are part of this investigation safe as well as the people inside. And then there's the other sort of threat in all this which is the coordination that would have to happen if charges are filed. Coordinating that would include the Secret Service, for example. They would have to be working with the Manhattan district attorney to make sure that the former president is able to get in and out incident- free. So again, there's so much in flux -- many, many, many ifs, but one thing for sure here in New York is that law enforcement do want to be ready for whatever may come their way in the coming days, Paula.",

And again, we need to be very clear. This is certainly quite normal for New York state's judicial system as they present charges, arrest, book, take mugshots of defendants.

And CNN's senior political analyst Ron Brownstein joins us now. Ron, thank you for joining us. We know that the former president is often trying to position himself as sort of a victim of the deep state, of systems, of the court.

I think last year, a year ago most Republicans would have said it probably would have helped him and kind of rally around the flag. As you say the deep state is persecuting him and they're going after me because they're really trying to silence you, all of those arguments. I think in the immediate aftermath of the 2022 election I think the view changed significantly among Republicans and the feeling was more that an indictment would reinforce the doubts among the parts of the party that were in part because of the '22 results, worried that he could not win again in '24. I guess I think now six month out from the election it probably would do some of both. You know, the CNN poll this week, Paula, asked Republican voters do you put more priority on someone who agrees with you on the issues or more priority on someone who can beat Joe Biden. The CNN polling, you know, just before I came on ran the numbers for me, among those who said it was most important to agree with you on the issues, Trump leads DeSantis. Among those who say that it is most important to have a nominee who can beat Joe Biden, DeSantis leads Trump. And I could see both sides of that divide being reinforced by this indictment and certainly further ones that may be coming down the road.",

If you bend over backwards and do double, triple back flips you can find yourself, you know, some people could find themselves sympathetic to his argument that he had no idea that what he said on January 6th was going to cause violence.He is putting out this language after January 6th. He saw what his language on January 6th did. And he is again echoing that kind of language. So any idea that he does not know kind of the match that he is dropping in gasoline here, you know, I think it can't be sustained and you see the dilemma of the Republican Party. Kevin McCarthy rallies around Trump. Mike Pence who said, you know, history will judge Donald Trump but has done his best to ensure that Trump is not by not judged in the hear and now by not testifying about his behavior, his January 6th behavior or defense (ph). But he says on the radio today that he is being unfairly treated. So you know, it is a moment where the Republican Party again has the opportunity to say look, we stand for the rule of law, wherever the chips fall, that's where they fall.

And you're right, they're not defending the call for protests but they are echoing his attempt to delegitimize the investigation in the first place, you know.And there is an alternative path. The alternative path is simply to say look, these investigations have to play out and, you know, the judicial system will render its decisions about whether there's something to indict and if there is something to indict, you know, whether there is something to convict. But that is not what's happening. I mean it's kind of moving very quickly to joining Trump in basically portraying the entire thing as illegitimate and that is just I think another indication of how difficult it is for the party to move away from him despite, you know, the many party leaders, fundraisers, strategists who believe that especially after 2022 it has to.",

Two of them stand out.One, the National Transportation Safety Board wants cockpit voice recorders to record a full 25 hours rather than two hours. And that was important because they said in all these seven recent near collisions they haven't had the cockpit voice recorder to really study what went on so they can make recommendations. And also there is equipment and the E.U. is -- European Union is working on making this mandatory but there is equipment and it's readily available where it can give some of those alerts in the cockpit that Pete mentioned in his piece where it would actually alert the pilot instantly if they're headed to collision, if they're on the wrong taxiway, if they're lined up for, you know, different possibilities of collision with others. And that equipment is available. That technology is there. But it's not required in most places, and that would be life saving. Right now the alerts, you depend upon the air traffic controllers. And finally, if we are having a problem with these runway incursions, the FAA is the only one that can do this, we have to require the air traffic controller eyes be on all aspects of the operation because some of these happen when the controller turns away to do something else. So if we have to have more controllers at the big airports, they average 3,000 operations a day at core 30 airports. That's a lot of operations. We just need more eyes.",

Number one, what's important to point out here, is that when Republican voters were asked whether or not they thought that the money to Stormy Daniels was an important issue, they said, no, it was not an important issue. More than that, you know, if this race were, let's say, on electability, the non-Trump Republicans are already viewed as more than non-Republicans. The majority of Republicans believe that. An issue, Trump's electability, as far as Republican voters are concerned, that is their more import - they view the fact that Trump is closer to them on the issues is more important than the fact he might be able to win in the fall.
