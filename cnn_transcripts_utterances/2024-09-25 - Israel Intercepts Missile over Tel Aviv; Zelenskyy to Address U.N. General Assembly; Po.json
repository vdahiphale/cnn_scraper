It can cause nausea, respiratory issues and certainly there could be some long-term issues like organ damage. So, no joke. Officials taking this, obviously, very seriously.Once that was reported yesterday, there was about a half a mile radius around that area of homes, of schools, as you mentioned, that were evacuated. I just looked at the schools in that area. There's three schools that are not going to be open today, but they did say at about 1:00 today they're going to decide if they can do after school activities. So, you can see that that whole area sort of in a waiting pattern, trying to get an update about the air quality and about what officials think the, you know, the solution is at this moment. But they did warn this could take quite a bit of people not being able to return to their homes in that area. So, we'll wait and see, Sara.",

Hezbollah said it was targeting the headquarters of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service.Also put out today, the IDF released this video. What they say this shows is a strike destroying the Hezbollah missile launcher that was used in that attack. Plus, that was sirens over Israel today. And then there is this. New footage showing the moment an Israeli airstrike hit Lebanon. You can see the explosion in the distance. CNN's Nic Robertson tracking all of this in Tel Aviv.

      "sentences": "Yes, that incoming missile this morning towards Tel Aviv, Hezbollah said it was a ballistic missile fired at the Mossad, the intelligence headquarters just north of Tel Aviv. It was intercepted quite easily, it appears, by a new or rather not the usual interceptor system. And there are several reasons for that.This missile, this ballistic missile, represents an escalation by Hezbollah. Not a massive escalation as they could have used if they'd fired a lot of these ballistic missiles. Why is it an escalation? The ballistic missiles carry a much bigger payload, hundreds of kilograms, pounds of explosives. They can fly much further, much faster than any of the missiles that Hezbollah has used so far. It's used short range just across the border in the north, it has used medium range, which fly about 30 miles. This missile had the capability to fly hundreds of miles. It flies high in an ark. And it was intercepted by David's Sling, which is Israel's more sophisticated - packs a harder punch, flies at a higher altitude, an interceptor system this morning. Those sirens that you heard, by the way, there as that ballistic missile was intercepted woke about a million people up in Israel today because the threat was so widespread, the area was so widespread that the alarms went off in more than 370 different communities in Israel. So, this represents an escalation. Israel intercepted it. There were no immediate casualties. However, it does represent, if you will, from the way the IDF views the situation right now, that Hezbollah is at a - is at a junction here. It can either ratchet up further with more of these ballistic missiles or back down. And there's no indication at the moment that they're backing down. And Israel had a strong round wave, if you will, of strikes into Lebanon today, hitting ammunition stores and other places where they say Hezbollah has got - has got weapons. So, that's - that really is the sort of limit of the escalation, if you will, today. Having said that, we've heard from the head of the northern command of the IDF on the northern border here, telling troops they need to be ready for maneuver and action. It's not saying they are going across the border, but it's telling them that they need to be ready for it. And that's the strongest signal that they could be about to cross the border that we've seen so far.",

And in at least two instances this morning suggesting that the onus remains on Hamas to accept that deal. Both John Kirby, on your program earlier this morning, saying that the - that responsibility lays solely with Sinwar, the leader of Hamas. And Secretary of State Tony Blinken also saying that the two parties, Israel and Hamas, have agreed to 15 out of 18 paragraphs of the ceasefire deal. And that it's the fine print that remains to be agreed to. And that it's Hamas who won't agree to that.

If we're looking across an average of polls, Harris' net favorability is plus one point in positive territory. Donald Trump is still in negative territory when it comes to his net favorability at minus nine points.You'd look at this and you'd say to yourself, oh, Kamala Harris should be well ahead in this race. But that CNN poll out yesterday had Harris up by just a point. The Quinnipiac University poll that was out yesterday showed something very similar.

CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta answers your burning questions in this week's \"Dr. Sanjay Gupta On-Call.\" Sanjay is with us right now.And, Sanjay, Lisa writes, \"I turned 60 recently\" - happy birthday, Lisa, \"and I have noticed that when I drink I lose my balance and get tired more quickly even though I haven't drunk that much. What's going on?\" What do you think? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, we - we got a lot of question - surprisingly, a lot of questions just like this one. And as someone who's getting closer to Lisa's age than not, I can - I can sort of relate to this. Yes is the short answer to the question. Your bodies do change as you get older in terms of how you process alcohol. Three main reasons. One is, you have less muscle mass. So, that's going to decrease your overall metabolism. Also, your liver function, which actually processes alcohol, that's also a bit diminished as you get older. So, alcohol is going to stick around, be stronger and it's going to last longer. And finally, you know, people, they take medications more as they get older. Sometimes those medications can have an interaction. So, you know, you're not a kid anymore. And again, I say this as someone who's getting closer to your age, Lisa, you can't drink like you're a kid anymore. Really important. One thing I'll say, on a serious note is that 65 percent of falls that result in death are somehow alcohol related. So, as you get older, you're more at risk of falls, and alcohol can exacerbate that. So, you've got to pay more attention to how much you're drinking.",

I mean, if you're trying to be completely alcohol-free, no alcohol at all, you want zero alcohol instead of non-alcohol. An important point. One thing I'll say is that it's very interesting, the process. Sometimes they make the drink exactly the way they used to, and then they just remove the alcohol. They inject steam into it and they sort of let the alcohol distill off.
