I'm Paula Newton in New York.And we have breaking news, the US Department of Justice has just released the special counsel's report on President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents. Now, you'll remember these were the documents found at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, and also at the president's home in Delaware. Earlier today, the White House declined to assert executive privilege over any of this report. And that's why we have it in our hands now. We want to go straight to our Katelyn Polantz who has been reading through it, and Katelyn, I mean, from the few lines that have I've seen, this is quite a bombshell for the Biden administration.",

Now, there's a big but here. The but is there are no criminal charges being filed here. Special Counsel Rob Hur found that there should not be criminal charges, that even if department policy at the Department of Justice said you can't indict a sitting president, which Joe Biden is currently and that is the department policy, they still wouldn't be bringing charges. The reason for that are many different mitigating factors, specifically pointing out that Joe Biden had a failing memory about some of these things and even if he was willfully retaining and disclosing classified information, especially about Afghanistan, the Afghanistan military, foreign policy, as well as handwritten notebooks he kept from his vice presidency, even though he shared them at some point with a ghostwriter he was working with on a memoir, it was not enough to convince a jury that there was guilt on his mind or that he willfully wanted to keep these things in violation of the law.",

I mean, how do you think that played into what we see today in terms of the results of this investigation? Paula, the Special Counsel Rob Hur in this report, it's more than 300 pages long. He points that out as one of the mitigating factors here. One of the reasons that factored into what a jury may believe here, or see here, if they were to see the evidence, and also what he was looking at, that Joe Biden was cooperative with this investigation sitting for interviews. He also turned the documents back over to the Justice Department once they were found, and Special Counsel Rob Hur's especially goes through exactly how this is different from the case against Donald Trump, the case that has been charged in criminal court and is headed toward a trial. The difference here where Donald Trump is accused of keeping records at his estate, Mar-a-Lago in Florida after his presidency, is that in that case, they have found evidence of the obstruction of justice, a refusal of Donald Trump to return documents and his wish that witnesses in that case would lie to federal authorities.",

In this world, we have context, and we have perspective. And when you can sit and give your perspective in terms of mishaps that you made, it makes a big difference. It is what we, lawyers, call mitigation, mitigating circumstances. And so when you cooperate fully and completely, when you indicate that you had no ill-intent, when you don't instruct other witnesses to cover or otherwise lie for you, it makes a difference in terms of what prosecutors are going to do and what they did do in this case. The issue then becomes, Paula, how it's going to be received politically. Obviously, the former president is going to say, a-ha, you see, it's a gross distinction. I'm treated differently. They prosecute me. They don't prosecute Joe Biden, but we'll get ready for it, in addition to that, his allies will do it. As Norm said, and I do agree, it's apples and oranges in so many regards, but people who don't follow the niceties and the fine distinctions are not going to see it that way and this is going to be political fodder for those who are the enemies of Biden in a campaign to say that the Justice Department is bought and paid for, and there's people who are -- who engage in similar acts, but it is not, but are being treated, you know, dissimilarly, and that's what's going to come for sure and soon.",

I think it depends uponwho's seeing it and who is -- you know, the function of where you sit depends upon where you stand. And obviously, the opponents of Mr. Biden, President Biden will argue that this is the Justice Department covering for him, so what? That he got a report where he is rebuked for negligently handling documents, he should be prosecuted, like President Trump is being prosecuted, et cetera, everyone's out to get President Trump and that's what will be the political narrative. However, to those of you who parse it and look at it closely, I think they will see vast distinctions between the two with regard to intent, number one, in terms of whether or not you actually had classified documents, knew you had classified documents, were sharing them for reasons that are untoward, inappropriate, illegal, et cetera, I think the cooperation component gets a lot of points. I think the fact that you're not directing or orchestrating a cover up gets a lot of points. I think the fact that you take ownership of the mishandling and your misconduct, I'll call it, not criminal misconduct gets a lot of points and there are other distinctions, and anyone who reads the indictment of President Trump will know that. And so I just think that the Democrats will have a lot of messaging to do with respect to pointing out the distinctions, pointing out that there are apples, pointing out that there are oranges, and explaining why there was no prosecution here. Final point, Paula, and that is that prosecutors move forward in cases that they believe they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. If you don't think of that standard, you do not go forward, and I think that's the basis for which they decided that as prosecutors, that they will not be pursuing a criminal prosecution here.",

I think the American people understand that everyone, even presidents can make a mistake. I think my advice to President Biden would be to say, it wasn't intentional, but everybody has to be careful with classified documents. To err is human, I err, to forgive divine. I'm asking you, you know, to forgive me for this. I'd make that kind of a statement.

Now, when they had subsequent conversations about that, it wasn't coming up in their interactions and it wasn't part of the memoir itself, disclosing this information, but that seems to be a core piece of what the special counsel found here, as he is outlining how these classified materials were kept within the possession of Joe Biden, how he was willfully keeping them, and then how he disclosed them to someone else.

He needs to say, but there was no evidence of intentionality, whereas my opponent is being charged with intentional violation of the law and there is no evidence of cover up, I cooperated. He is being charged with covering things up. So don't compare us. Beyond that, every president we need to have a new system, every piece of paper that walks out of the White House has to be checked not once, but twice. Nobody should be allowed to take papers, thumb drives, or any other materials without double checking, that needs to be a new protocol because whether it's intentional, as is alleged, with Trump or accidental, not willful as is alleged with Biden, the documents are getting out in the chaos of those last days.

The finding that Joe Biden willfully retained and disclosedclassified information specifically whenever he was sharing his recollections from his vice presidency, his handwritten notes with a ghostwriter in 2017, who was working on his memoir. That said, he is not being charged with any crime. The special counsel explicitly said that there was not enough there to bring a charge. It would be very unlikely that they would be able to convince jurors that Joe Biden was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. One of the reasons they say in this report is that Joe Biden may appear to jurors to be so sympathetic and well-meaning. An elderly man with a poor memory.

A personal attorney to Joe Biden came out saying that this was investigative excess. Another attorney working for Joe Biden within the White House called some of these comments in the special counsel's report inappropriate, and yet all of the people representing Joe Biden, those attorneys, they are relieved and they're applauding the special counsel for not bringing charges here, for making that decision as an independent investigator, criminal investigator here, who had the authority to charge Joe Biden if he wanted to. Because the other thing out there, Paula, is that a very similar investigation had taken place against Donald Trump that ultimately resulted in a subpoena, a search warrant of his estate, Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and then criminal charges against the former President Donald Trump. That is a different thing than this. The special counsel outlined today in his report the reason is because Donald Trump was obstructing the investigation, doing more, having more intent of keeping the document knowing he had them and willfully keeping them from the federal government. whereas Joe Biden cooperated with this investigation and turned those documents back over once they were found.",

A landmark case that could decide Donald Trump's fate on the ballot. Now justices heard oral arguments on whether the former president's actions on January 6th make him ineligible for office. Colorado removed him from the state's ballot using the 14th Amendment. Now that part of the Constitution goes way back to the Civil War, and it says those who have engaged in insurrection are disqualified from holding future public office.

That's a pretty daunting consequence. JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT: I'm not getting a whole lot of help from you about how this would not be an unmanageable situation.

And you heard it there from the liberal-leaning Justice Elena Kagan,where she chimed in with these other conservative justices really saying why should one state have the power to decide who appears on the ballot? Justice Alito saying wouldn't this really lead to chaos throughout the country if states individually decided who can appear on the ballot. And that really was what emerged toward the end of these two-and-a-half hours of arguments. The justices all sort of had this consensus surrounding this idea that the 14th Amendment probably doesn't give states the unilateral power to decide who are these ineligible insurrectionists. And that might be the point that Donald Trump wins on. You know, either way it does look like a majority of the justices are poised to rule in favor of Trump. That would be overturning the fact that the Colorado Supreme Court took Trump off the ballot. So when it comes to a ruling, you know, the justices really expedited the arguments in this case to try to decide this case very quickly. So we could see a ruling from them in just a matter of weeks. They want to get something on the books before too much of the election already happens. You know, that Colorado ruling was actually frozen. It was paused while the Supreme Court decision and the arguments play out. So basically, Donald Trump's name will be on the ballot in Colorado when they go for the primary vote. But the question, the larger question is, you know, will those votes count? And what will happen for the general election if Donald Trump is the nominee. That's why the Supreme Court really has to try to settle this very quickly. We also -- you know, we heard a number of issues here that the Supreme Court could really seize on. There were questions about, you know, whether this is even the court's role to decide if it's not really up to Congress to step in and decide when certain office holders might be ineligible, if this even applies to running for office. You know, there are specific civic language in the Constitution that says holding an office and that was a point of contention as well. One thing we didn't hear a lot of argument on that was somewhat surprising, especially because the voters who brought this case against Trump, it's what they focused on. They focused on the fact that January 6th in their view was an insurrection, that Trump engaged in insurrection and as such should be removed from the ballot. We didn't hear a lot of argument on that. There was a bit of back-and-forth between Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the newest justice, as well as Donald Trump's lawyer. Donald Trump's lawyer saying, look, this was criminal, this was chaos, but this wasn't insurrection. That was really the only point we heard what about that. It's likely here, Paula, that the justices won't wade into this factual question as to whether or not this was an insurrection, whether or not Donald Trump engaged in insurrection. It is very likely that they will look for maybe a narrow off-ramp here to decide this whole case. So they might say, you know, court shouldn't even step in. This is only for Congress. They might say that the president is not an officer of the United States therefore this section of the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to him. There are many routes here for Donald Trump to win. And what we saw from the arguments today is it looks like he probably has enough justices on his side to decide this case one way or the other on any of these issues but probably in Donald Trump's favor -- Paula.",

We've seen it in the special counsel report from Robert Mueller aboutDonald Trump, especially as it pertained to obstruction. Maybe not characterizing him as a person, but trying to get inside of his thinking and his mindset because there is a very important question that a prosecutor has to answer here. The intention. It's not just the willful retention of documents. It's is there an intention to break the law as well. And so the prosecutor in interviewing Joe Biden in this does seem to be trying to characterize his mindset here. Now, that is to say the special counsel to the president. So a lawyer that works in the White House for Joe Biden named Richard Sauber put out a statement calling some of the comments in this port inappropriate. He didn't specify which ones, but one that was so searing in this report from Special Counsel Rob Hur says that Joe Biden may come across to jurors if he were to testify to them as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory -- Paula.",

You know, I was just asking Katelyn about how much detail was put in the special counsel's report just characterizing, you know, how the president presented himself and what the opinion was.

Thelanguage that's used with respect to classifying the president's memory, with respect to saying that he didn't have much of a memory, he's an elderly man. Obviously, when you're running for president of the United States, that becomes problematic. At the same time from -- and in addition to that issue with respect to the willful retention of documents, et cetera, that's not good. And I would look certainly for his opponent to capitalize on that, perhaps make commercials out of that. But when you look at the legal issue of intention, I think that plays huge, and to the core of your question, whenever you have a criminal case, prosecutors focus in on intent. What kind of criminal intent, if any, did you have if you are person who's being looked at as the defendant in a case which Mr. Biden was? Were you doing this for nefarious reasons? What was your motivation? What was your state of mind? And I think Paula with regard to the interview that prosecutors conducted of the president over the course of a couple of days, they concluded that it was at the end of the day best classification and honest mistake. A careless one, one that should not happen, one that by all means should have been prevented, but not criminal nonetheless in terms of him not concealing documents, giving them back right away, you know, expressing why he had them in the first instance, et cetera. And so while not good for him politically, certainly legally not to be charged is a major victor.",

That was a healthy day. It's good for our democracy whenever we apply the Constitution and ask how it should be applied. What really jumped out to me was nobody seriously question, among those nine justices, the conclusion of the Colorado courts of every fact finder, the January 6th Committee, the main secretary of state, to have reached the following question. Did Donald Trump engage in insurrection? Everybody to reach that question has found that he did engage in insurrection and the Supreme Court didn't challenge that. So that large finding was looming over this hearing. I think it's likely that the Supreme Court is going to split the baby here. They're going to do one for Donald Trump and refuse to disqualify him. But then the immunity case, absolute immunity, can Donald Trump, as his lawyers put it in the D.C. Circuit, the appeals court, assassinate political opponents, that came up a little bit, too. Justice Alito raised it. And I suspect reading the court today, they're going to rule against Trump on that. So I thought on the whole, it was a landmark day. Another historic argument at the Supreme Court. This one will probably go for Trump.",

He's the country's biggest military -- it's thecountry's, pardon me, biggest military shakeups since the start of Russia's invasion. Tensions between the two surfaced last year after the general described the situation on the ground as a stalemate. Now Ukraine's new military chief steps into what all of us know is a very tough job. He faces a renewed Russian onslaught, ammunition shortages, and wavering support from the United States. Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv. He's been following all of this, and not just today, Fred. I mean, look, you've been covering this for months and weeks and especially in terms of inside ball as to all of this happen. But at the crux of it, what is going to be different? What is the president of Ukraine hoping will be different now on the ground, given, you know, the difficulty that the military has been having?",

I think that in the end it doesn't come downto a personality of Valerii Zaluzhnyi who has just been a dismissed by the Ukrainian president and the new person is going to be in charge, Oleksandr Syrskyi, who until now has been the head of the land forces of the Ukrainian military. Of course, someone who's really well-known here in Ukraine, instrumental in the battle of Kyiv, instrumental also in Ukraine's offensive in the Kharkiv area late in 2022 when they made some gains there. But also his forces bogged down in the east of the country recently as well. I think one of the things that we've seen from Volodymyr Zelenskyy today is he came out and he said that there needs to be big changes within the Ukrainian military if they want to try and turn the tides in light of everything that you've just been saying, the ammo shortages, the fact that there's help that's waning from the United States, European allies obviously not able to make up for that. Zelenskyy believes that the Ukrainian military needs to rely more on drones and other unmanned systems and needs to become more agile. And that therefore change was something that was necessary. I want to listen to some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I am grateful to General Zaluzhnyi for two years of defense. I'm grateful for every victory that we achieved together and thanks to all Ukrainian soldiers who are heroically enduring this war.

I think a lot of people here have no illusions about the fact that it's looking very difficult for that aid to come through.
