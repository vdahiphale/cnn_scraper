It is expected to go through. Timing tight, though, bill has to be signed by Friday with the current funding expires and folks hopefully leave for their Christmas vacation.Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut joins me now. Senator, thanks for taking the time this morning. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Yes, thanks for having me.",

This is mostly a bill about obligations, social security, Medicare, Medicaid. There are some big emergency numbers in this bill but much of that is going overseas, $40-plus billion for Ukraine. I don't think there is anything in this bill that isn't absolutely necessary for the health of the country and I don't anticipate that it will have any extraordinary inflationary effect.",

The former president, who attempted to overturn an election in exactly this way, getting his vice president, and, in fact, to reject the electoral count, he's now running again. For folks watching at home, should they feel confident that this reform at least closes down that path to attempting to overturn an election?",

President Trump tried to probe it in several different ways in 2020 and was almost successful. Listen, this bill makes it harder for a corrupt president or a corrupt governor to send the wrong set of electors to Washington for the electoral count but it doesn't completely rule out that possibility. So, I don't want to overstate the importance of the Electoral Count Reform Act. It makes it harder for the wrong president to be chosen by the Electoral College but it is still not impossible that Donald Trump in league with some corrupt governor could send the slate of electors for the losing candidate to the Electoral College.",

Remember, Republicans and Democrats both cheered our efforts to get our Afghan partners, interpreters, military advisers out of Afghanistan. But now, for some reason, Republicans are not supporting a pathway to allow those individuals to become permanent U.S. residents. We need 60 votes in the Senate to pass anything and we do not have right now Republican -- enough Republican support to get this done.So, we're going to continue to push for this into next year. You have got so many of these Afghans living in limbo. They're in the United States but only temporarily. And at any presidential whim, they could be sent back into a hostile environment, their lives at risk. This is still open business. We need a few more Republicans to support us here.",

I know that passing immigration reform in this country on Capitol Hill is just tough. There is a lot of opposition from Republicans, not a lot of political will from many Democrats here. But Democrats, again, they've had majority in both chambers for two years. And I know you need ten votes in the Senate, but do Democrats bear responsibility, some responsibility for failing to enact reforms that would have helped address the situation at the southern border? I'm not saying solve all of the problems but help address them.",

Senator Sinema, a Democrat, or an Independent now, and Senator Tillis, a Republican, unveiled a last- minute bipartisan proposal, and it was rejected by Republicans. So, right now, one of the rules of the Senate, we need a handful of Republicans to support immigration reform, they won't.Now, the budget includes some money to manage these increased numbers at the border. But it is much less than what the administration needs. Why is that? Because not only do Republicans oppose immigration reform, they also are opposing the money necessary to deal with the emergency. So, you're going to see scenes of chaos at the border in January and February, and that is going to be in large part because Republicans aren't allowing us enough funding to deal with these increased numbers.",

And as you know, the law allows for anybody presenting themselves at the southern border to apply for asylum and to stay in the United States while they make that case and that claim. Many of us would argue that President Trump went above his statutory authority in denying many people the ability to make that claim. So, if Congress wants to turn people back around or stop allowing people to make asylum claims, then they have to make that change in the law. So long as the law is what it is today, the president has to accept those people's asylum claims.",

Justice Department now has a call to make based on the evidence, but also there are real politics because a potential target is a candidate for office again, not only a former president but a candidate for office. In your view, are there dangers in indicting a former president who is running again against the current president who, by his office, has authority oversight over the Justice Department?",

If there is a clear and convincing case, then I don't think you could ignore the law. But we have been and we should be very careful in this country about prosecuting former presidents.We chide and we scold other nations for doing that. Here, if the law is the law, then nobody should stand in the way of the Justice Department, but they should be careful. They should make sure that they have a pretty open and shut case.",

Some parents also having trouble finding the antibiotics doctors have prescribed for their children. That is no fun when you want to get a kid healthy.CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins us now. I wonder, gosh. I mean, feel I like we're covering kind of medical shortages every few months now. But how far and wide is this around the country? ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it is not clear how wide spread this is, Jim. The manufactures say it is not widespread. We certainly heard horrible stories. We spoke to one woman who couldn't find Advil when her child had an (INAUDIBLE) then got a prescription for amoxicillin, for an antibiotic, and they had to go to several different places to find that. And when you have got a sick child, this is last the thing you need to be doing. But to be clear, this is not like the infant formula shortages that we saw earlier this year. Those were about manufacturing issues. This is about demand because so many children have flu or have RSV. So, let's take a look at what the numbers tell us. So, according to the folks who manufacture these products, the demand for these products for children's pain and fever meds, well, it is up 65 percent compared to the same time last year. So, basically, in some areas, it seems like they're having trouble keeping up with that demand. When we reached out to the FDA, here is what they had to say. They said manufacturing are working very closely with us in increasing supply so that we can get the demand where the priority need to be. So, in other words, they're trying to figure out where the areas that are hardest hit and getting them product. So, as you mentioned big retailers are limiting how much parents can buy and even in places that aren't limiting, I will say, parents, do not hoard this medication. Get what you need. If you hoard it, that bad mom and dad karma will come back to haunt you. Only take what you need. Do not hoard. Jim and Erica?",
