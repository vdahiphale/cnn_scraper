It is Tuesday, April the 9th, 9 a.m. here in London. 11 a.m. in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set for a ground operation into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite strong international opposition to such an offensive.More than a million displaced Palestinians are seeking shelter there. And the U.S. State Department says Israel hasn't presented a credible plan for evaluating those civilians or providing a date for an invasion of Rafah. A source says CIA director Bill Burns has presented a new proposal to try to bridge the gaps in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Hamas during weekend talks in Cairo. Hamas says its leaders will review the latest proposal from Israel, even though it doesn't meet their demands. Here's Mr. Netanyahu's reaction to that news. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today, I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo. We are constantly working to achieve our goals, primarily the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas. This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen. There is a date. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Khan Younis' highway of hell shattered witness to four deadly months of Israeli occupation. Nothing untouched. The Jaffa Mosque reduced to rubble. The Affah (ph) gas station destroyed. Spreading out from the thoroughfare, a city-sized stamp of destruction. Almost every building in the southern Gazan hub once home to 420,000 Palestinians wrecked by Israeli troops searching for Hamas. The scale testimony of the ferocity of the fight. The graffiti left behind. Venom Gaza for the Jews, it reads. The IDF's sudden departure over the weekend, opening the way for residents to return to what's left of their homes. Our house was bombed and bulldozed, Alia says. I got these clothes and this toy, pointing to a brother. The toy means a lot to us. It's a memory from home. What are we to do? Mohammed Ahmed says. I'm pulling out a few clothes, looking through the rubble. Maybe I'll find something. That was my washing machine. And that was my fridge. Return is not victory here. It's resilience. Salim going back to his destroyed home. I will put a tent on it. Even if they destroy all of Khan Younis, we will stay here and we are steadfast. At first, just a trickle of people coming back.

They want a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, but of course we know that Israel's plans for the day after involve Israel having full security control over the Gaza Strip. And they also want full freedom of movement for Gazans who have been displaced to the southern part of the territory back to the north. That is something that the United States is also pushing for, but so far the Israelis have insisted on security checks for anyone moving and limitations on the numbers who are moving north. And look, it seems, Max, that the United States and Israel are starting to see eye-to-eye now more on the aid issue. The Israelis have really ramped it up. Yesterday, case in point, more than 400 trucks were able to enter the territory. That is nearing the levels that we saw pre-war. But they are nowhere near seeing eye-to-eye when it comes to the military invasion of Rafah that the prime minister of Israel says is pending. And this is despite even more renewed pressure from the international community, including an op-ed written in the Washington Post from the leaders of Jordan, Egypt, and France, who wrote this about the potential invasion of Rafah. They said it would only bring more death and suffering, heighten the risks and consequences of mass displacement of the people of Gaza, and threaten regional escalation. They also wrote that when it comes to aid, quote: Consistent with international law, Israel is under an obligation to ensure the flow of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian population, a responsibility it has not fulfilled. Of course, all of this, Max, could become somewhat of a moot point if there was some kind of a ceasefire deal agreed to, but as you pointed out, it doesn't seem like there's one imminent at the moment.",

And so the foreign minister last night said that there was no excuse, in his words, for Israel to do that, and they would be taking actions against Israel.And we've just gotten word this morning from the trade ministry that they are now cutting off exports to Israel, of exports of more than 50 categories. Most of them are sort of construction or industrial- related, things like steel, aluminum, electrical components, cement, ceramics, the list goes on and on, and this is something that the Turks have sort of long pushed to the side. Of course, President Erdogan has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel since the outset of the war, but I recall in December, I asked his chief advisor why Turkey was continuing to trade with Israel, and at the time, he said, look, this is not a state-to- state issue, this is a private business issue. But now it seems, perhaps, because of the message that was sent to President Erdogan in the last round of local elections just over a week ago, that many people want to see Turkey take a harder line when it comes to Israel, that Ankara is now listening and now, obviously, it's putting its money where its mouth is -- Max.",

Well, in the coming hours, Britain's top diplomat will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in an effort to push for more funding for Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron was scheduled to meet with former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. CNN hasn't confirmed if that meeting actually happened, but both men have recently criticized Israel's war in Gaza. Cameron has also urged U.S. lawmakers to pass additional aid to Ukraine. His visit comes as a Ukraine aid bill has stalled in the U.S. Congress, as House Speaker Mike Johnson has so far refused to hold a vote on passing the package. U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith is asking the Supreme Court to reject Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity. Smith is leading the prosecution of Trump for inciting the January 6th Capitol riot and for mishandling classified documents. The Supreme Court is set to decide whether Trump's claim of presidential immunity is legitimate. Smith's prosecution is based on the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which reads in part: No person shall hold any office who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion. A New York appeals court judge has rejected Trump's petition to delay his hush money trial. The former president wanted a change of venue, claiming he can't get a fair trial in Manhattan, and we're getting our first look at the juror questionnaire as well. CNN's Paula Reid has the details.

      "sentences": "The Trump lawyers argue that pre-trial publicity is making it impossible to get a fair trial, but prosecutors said, look, it's too late to do something like that. And the way we will weed out biased jurors is through jury selection, and that's where the jury questionnaire comes in.And you look through this, the questions, some of them are similar to the questions we saw during jury selection in the E. Jean Carroll case. They ask where jurors get their news. They ask if they or anyone close to them has ever worked for Trump or attended a Trump rally. They also ask about membership in extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Now, again, these are questions that we have seen before. Then they get more specific about, in this case, about feelings about Trump himself. This is the process prosecutors insist will help them weed out anyone who has a bias. Now, a question I'm getting a lot is, how long is this going to take? Well, remember, in this case, it's only four days in a trial week because court is off on Wednesdays. We also have a couple religious holidays over the next few weeks. So this process of selecting a jury for this, the first criminal prosecution of former President Trump, could take a few weeks.
