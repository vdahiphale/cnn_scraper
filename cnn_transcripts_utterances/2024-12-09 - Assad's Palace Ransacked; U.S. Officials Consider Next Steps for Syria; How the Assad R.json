Our officers have been working around the clock, many of them are -- did not go home. To pursue this individual, it was crucial that we were able to remove him off the streets of America, and we were going to seek him out no matter where he was at the time. And so, this is a strong person of interest. The police commissioner and chief of detectives will go over where we are right now in the investigation. He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident. How did we do it? Good old-fashioned police work. The chief of detectives and the police commissioner made the decision to release as much of a photo that we've -- that we had at the time. We sent it across the country, and someone at McDonald's employee did something we ask every American to do, if you see something, say something, but most importantly, do something, and they did. And because of that, we believe we have a strong person of interest to deal with this case. I want to now turn it over to the police commissioner of the city of New York, Commissioner Tisch.",

He has been identified as Luigi Nicholas Mangione. He is a male, 26 years old, he was born and raised in Maryland. We know he has ties to San Francisco, California, and his last known address was Honolulu, Hawaii. He has no prior arrest history in New York. Members of the NYPD Detective Bureau are currently traveling to Pennsylvania with members of the Manhattan District Attorney's office to interview this subject. This case was brought to a successful conclusion based on the coordinated effort between numerous NYPD units, including the Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureau. Our federal partners at the FBI, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, and of course, members of the Altoona Police Department in Pennsylvania. On Thursday, one day after this crime was committed, the NYPD released a photo of the shooter. In this case, this picture was obtained by the NYPD during one of their extensive video canvasses. We took that photograph and we asked for the public's help in identifying the subject and the public responded. Hundreds of tips began to pour into our hotline. Each tip was investigated thoroughly and we began to release additional photographs as they came into our possession. The NYPD provided these photos to numerous media outlets, local, national and international outlets released a photo via television, print, social media and online content. Luckily, a citizen in Pennsylvania recognized our subject and called local law enforcement. Members of the Altoona Police Department responded to the call, and based on their investigation, they notified the NYPD. This investigation is still active and ongoing. Thank you very much.

And it does appear the real break in this case was the NYPD releasing those images, showing the full face of this suspect, now, we can identify as Luigi Mangione, a 26-year-old male, because most of the other images that we had seen of him prior and subsequently is wearing a mask. But the full face images, that's clearly what the employee at McDonald's was provoked by and to the point of calling the authorities. TOM VERNI, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; SECURITY CONSULTANT:  Yes, and that's great, and I'm very happy that someone felt that they were urged to -- you know, look -- the police urging the public to -- you know, to -- if they saw something to do something or say something. And that's exactly what this person did, and that's what happens every single day across the United States, across any -- really any country that -- you know, when the police have a crime that they're trying to investigate, the first set of people they want to appeal to is the public. Because the public many times is -- are going to be the ones that provide the critical information that they need, whether they saw something, they heard something, they observed something or something didn't sit right with them. Yet, over and over and over again, it's been proven that the public is integral in providing information which helps the police in their investigations and brings these criminals to justice.",

And I was leaning against, you know, the professional hit-man theory only in the way that the -- the way that this was carried out and the amount of evidence that was left behind led me to believe that this was likely not someone who was a, quote, unquote, \"professional\" -- because a professional sort of assassin would have, you know, ghosted in and ghosted out of that scene, and you would have saw very little of them, and they would have made sure that their face was not seen anywhere. So, that led me, you know, more to believe that this was someone who clearly was -- you know, had problems, deranged and certainly was very angry and then had access to weapons. And you know, that we see every day here in America, where deranged people with weapons do a lot of damage. You know, that the fact that they found the manifesto just sort of reinforces the -- you know, the method behind the madness as to why they would just go out and single out this person, you know, from this -- from this company. And you know, I never thought that the general public was at risk or anyone going to the Hilton Hotel was at risk. I -- you know, it seemed very clear from the beginning that this was a targeted assassination, targeted murder. And so, then we have to figure out, OK, well, who is this person? Where are they? And why did they do that? So, now this is all starting to make a lot of sense. And I was also trying to urge people to -- you know, to give the police a little bit of time because these investigations are very difficult. It's not like on TV where they're solved in 43 minutes without commercials, you know, these investigations take days, sometimes weeks, sometimes months, sometimes longer. So, the fact that this was actually wrapped up within a few days, to me is actually kind of surprising, given the wide area that had to be covered to try to track down this person.",

Human rights groups said the Assad regime tortured and executed thousands of people at the facility.

While some are celebrating the regime's fall, others are focused on getting what their families need during this uncertain period. CNN's Clarissa Ward was on the streets of Damascus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  You could see there are a lot of people out on the streets today. It's not scenes of celebration. It's not scenes of looting like we were seeing today, now people are trying to make sure that they have stocked up on all the supplies that they might need. Take a look at this line here. We're outside a bakery, these people say they've been waiting more than half an hour, some of them, they're waiting for bread.

Yesterday, there was extensive looting there, a lot of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. Then more rebels arrived in the capital, the looting appears to have stopped, it does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many people who are elated that Bashar al-Assad is finally gone.

The Israeli Prime Minister called this a new chapter for the Middle East, and said that Israel has extended a hand of peace to Syria. He even said that Israel has taken measures to make sure that Israel is safe vis-a-vis Syria, although he wouldn't say more about that. But it was the suggestion of some kind of indirect diplomacy to see whether or not this kind of 50- year detente effectively between Israel and Syria along that border in the Golan Heights, whether or not that can indeed be preserved. And that is certainly the question at this moment in Israel, as the government and officials and analysts here are, you know, watching very closely to see who will actually lead the new government in Syria and what their approach will be to Israel. Because, of course, beyond just the -- that strip of land between the Israeli occupied Golan Heights in Syrian territory, there are also of course, concerns about how Syria has been used for decades now. And that is to allow Iranian weapons to flow through Syria into Lebanon into Hezbollah's hands. I was along the border today between Israeli and Syrian-held territory. And, you know, you could see that troops had moved into that buffer zone. We actually saw troops that were inside that buffer zone, and we're also told that they've actually moved beyond the buffer zone into Syrian territory beyond that buffer zone. And of course, we also know that Israel has been striking at Syria's chemical weapons, air defense systems and missile capabilities as well. And clearly, would appear to be targets of opportunity that the Israeli government is trying to take advantage of in this moment of uncertainty inside of Syria. So, a lot of uncertainty, certainly, but also clearly Israel seeing opportunities for the future as well. The question really now is who exactly will Israel's neighbors be in Syria, Bianna?",

But as rebels swiftly advanced on the capital, the Assads were finally dislodged, fleeing to Moscow where they received asylum. Overjoyed Syrians celebrated in the streets and ransacked the regime's residences and offices, taking chairs, plates, clothes, whatever they could carry. \"Is this stealing?\" One person jokes, \"no, it's not\", another laughs. Syrians have long accused the generational autocracy of pocketing hundreds of millions from the state, festering corruption was one of the key grievances of the 2011 uprising.

In fact, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, his name is Ahmed Hussein al-Shar'a, is really behaving like the new leader of Syria. He met today with the prime minister. If you ask me -- a minute ago, you were talking to your U.S. correspondent about who is in charge. I can tell you for sure that Abu Mohammad al-Jolani is in charge. The fact that he goes and meets with the prime minister in order to really basically transition to a new government, the fact that he is on a victory tour. He goes to one of the most -- I mean, one of the greatest mosque in Damascus and address the people. So, yes, ISIS is a major challenge, but there are much bigger challenges.

My concern is that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is the most, the best equipped, the best arm, the best fed, well led. And at the end of the day, from a cynical point of view, I teach international relations, why would Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the most powerful, and who has more than 10,000 fighters, basically, I mean, share power with other, I mean, opposition factions? It's about power. It's about ambition. And again, what we have learned about Abu Mohammad al-Jolani in the past 20 years, he has shown himself to be very cunning, very calculating, very nimble. In fact, he outlasted and outmaneuvered his own mentors, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi, and even Bashar al-Assad. He sent Bashar al-Assad packing into exiles in Russia.",

Ithink, you know, if you look at Afghanistan, August 2021, as a template and the U.S. withdrawal there, that's something that Trump talks openly that the Biden administration shouldn't have withdrawn troops, even though the policy of withdrawing was really a continuation of the Doha agreement started under Trump. That said, I think you can see the damage of even removing a small number of troops from Afghanistan, I think 2,500 at the time, 900 troops now in Syria. I think for the time being, and for the foreseeable future, those troops need to remain. And as Dan Byman wrote in The New York Times this morning, may even have to expand so the United States can keep track of what's going on, human intelligence, counterterrorism issues. And to go back just briefly to what Fawaz was talking about before, I answered the question of what's the biggest U.S. concern? It was the Islamic State. He then spoke about ISIS not being a concern for Syria. I think the two are connected. If Syria is not able to get its government together, that's going to give room to Islamic State to grow. So, these are all interconnected issues here. It's a very complex situation.",

Last year on a New York City subway, Daniel Penny grabbed Neely from behind, putting him in a chokehold, and held him there for several minutes after Neely began acting erratically.

Just moments ago, Neely's father, who was present in the courtroom, spoke on the pain he feels in reaction to today's verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDRE ZACHARY, JORDAN NEELY'S FATHER:  It hurts.
