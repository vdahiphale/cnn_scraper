Not a book about any controversial topic or political theory, just a book written by a black person. But that's exactly what teachers in South Florida say they felt forced to get this week because of a new state law. Today was the school making a political statement, or do Black History Month programs now need special approval?Plus the testimony of Fani Willis grilled by lawyers trying to force her off the Donald Trump case here in Georgia. Some black professional women say they saw a double standard, we'll get into that. And Beyonce goes country. Listen, we knew there would be some haters. But much of the criticism of her making music in the genre is just ignorant of history. So we're going to educate some people. I'm Victor Blackwell, let's start the show. If you have kids, you probably cannot count the number of permission slips you've signed, for a trip to the zoo or museum when I was in school, we needed them before we could attend sex education. Okay. But the permission slip that parents at a school in Miami Dade Florida were asked to sign this week. It is, unfortunately, a sign of the time students needed permission to and this is a quote, \"participate and listen to a book written by an African American.\" That's it. It doesn't mention the contents of the book. No radical theories. Just a book written by a black person. A parent shared it online. And this, as you'd expect went viral. And we called up the parent to ask what he thought about this. And here's a bit of his reaction. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHUCK WALTER, PARENT OF MIAMI-DADE STUDENT THAT GOT PERMISSION SLIP: What concerns me more is just parents who may not be realizing what they're signing off on or not signing on. And then potentially their kids being taken out of the class for that. That just seems to be very strange. And this is the first instance of it, and who knows where it could go from here.

I thank you for giving us the context and perspective. Fulton County prosecutor Fani Willism, did you see that testimony? She was in the witness chair this week. Giving some fiery answers to questions about her personal life or finances in relation to the election interference case is against Donald Trump and several of his allies. Now the defendants want her removed from the case. They say that she had an improper romantic and financial relationship with Nathan Wade. Now, Wade is one of the lawyers she hired to be a special prosecutor on the case. Willis let's make clear that she was not happy to be in this position. She was not the only one. When the defendants made the allegations of misconduct. A lot of black women thought, here we go again. Another black woman in authority being targeted while she's trying to do her job. Now Others say that she should have known better considering her position and the double standard she faces. Joining me now to talk about this is Terrica Redfield Ganzy.

And I know there was concerns in the beginning about song lyrics and social media being admitted criminal evidence, for all the reasons I think that people talked about before is hip hop going to be on trial. What I've been seeing over the past couple of weeks is that when you also admit that as evidence, it bogs down the proceedings by a lot, so instead of talking about like specific incidents and specific crimes, the trial has focused so much on these overt acts that are supposed to speak to the, quote unquote, criminal mindset of Young Thug.And so over the past couple of weeks alone, I've seen more discussion over whether to admit a Tiny Desk concert, that Young Thug performed in 2021, than any one specific crime.",

And this was before Trump was indicted.And so like, I think the both cases so that she came out, you know, like, with like, a set intention to make her known in case with the YSL trial to target a criminal street gang activity here in the city.

Charis Kubrin who has studied this for decades told us, the most common finding across all these different kinds of studies is that immigration to an area is either not associated with crime in that area or is negatively associated with crime in that area, meaning more immigration equals less crime. She goes on to say this, if the story is not why are these migrants committing these crimes against police officers? It's how is it that thousands and thousands and thousands of migrants with these conditions are coming and not engaging in crime.What we can say for certain is that the rhetoric is dangerous. Immigrant communities are afraid that people will retaliate, motivated by Trump's claims. Immigration and crime, they are both major issues in the 2024 campaign. They both need solutions, but politicians should rethink making those issues appear to be one in the same.

Now there are just four, Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, Pine Forge Academy in Pennsylvania, Redemption Christian Academy in New York and Piney Woods in Mississippi. The documentary was a Piney Woods -- the documentary is not out yet. I got the perk of being able to see it early, but the documentary is coming.

Victor, like you said, I was really shocked to learn that there were only four black boarding schools left when they were over 100 prior to 1954. And my father went to a black boarding school called Blacks Academy, which was one of those schools that closed down and he had such fun, strong memories about this school. What attracted me to Piney Woods in particular was their mission and their approach. Piney Woods believes in developing a child head, hearts and hands, right? So when they're looking to develop a kid, they're not just thinking about the classroom, they're thinking about developing empathy, accountability, serious critical thinking skills, right? And then there's also this wonderful other facet that they have, which is a strong agricultural program. In 1920, about 14 percent of farmers were black. And today only 1 percent are, right? So the idea of continuing this ritual, this legacy, and teaching children about self-sustainability and communal sustainability in such a major way, that's what really attracted me to Piney Woods.",

I poured everything out onto the palette that came in the little paint set that I had purchased at the time.And eventually it just evolved into what you see now. You'll see a lot of the different shades of blues and teals and purples and stuff like that in my work. So represents peace, but it also at the same time can represent like pain. Something that I believe is strong within black people. A lot of the subjects that I use for references for the painting are neighbors, friends, family, neighbors, people here in Oklahoma. When you look at my work, you'll see durags. For me what durags represent, they represent crowns. I remember being young, I had here, I don't anymore. But you would put the wave cap on and what would happen is when you put it on and your waves of glow around your head, it created what was called a crown.
