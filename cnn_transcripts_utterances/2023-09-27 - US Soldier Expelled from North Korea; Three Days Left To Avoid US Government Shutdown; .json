Now, it has come all the way back up again. But we are in the last hour of trade, and anything can happen between now and 4:00 PM Eastern. The markets and the events that we are watching closely: The American soldier who entered North Korea is back in US custody. The White House is warning a US government shutdown would cause significant airport delays amongst other economic damage. And the Hollywood writers go back to work. Some are doubting their new deal does much to protect them on the issue of artificial intelligence. Live in London tonight on Wednesday, September the 27th. I'm Richard Quest and in London, I mean business. A very good day to you. We begin with the American soldier, Travis King, who is now on his way back to the United States more than two months after he caused a sensation when he crossed into North Korea. The decision by North Korea to suddenly release King perhaps came as a surprise. There was speculation in Washington that Pyongyang could try to use King as a political bargaining chip. CNN's Paula Hancocks reports from Seoul. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After 10 weeks in North Korean custody, Travis King is back in US hands. His mother thanks the US military for a job well done. US officials speak of intense diplomacy with multiple countries, but no concessions made to Pyongyang. A transfer to China with the help of Sweden, the protecting power for the US in Pyongyang. The US and North Korea have no diplomatic ties. North Korea said earlier, Wednesday, they would expel him, added King had confessed to illegally intruding into the country due to \"inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination in the United States Army.\" Pyongyang's words through state media, King has not been heard from or seen since mid-July. Photographed here on a civilian tour of the Joint Security Area in the DMZ just before he ran across the military demarcation line into North Korea. US officials say he tried to access the main building which was locked, ran around the back, and was bundled into a van by North Korean guards. There is a fairly safe assumption he would have been extensively questioned by North Korean officials.",

He was supposed to be deported back to the US, but instead of boarding a flight, he headed to the DMZ. HANCOCKS (on camera): US officials say the focus now is on King's health and reuniting him with his family and that any administrative actions could be considered later.

And one of the concerns, of course, is what's going to happen to the travel sector? The US Travel Association, the trade group for the travel industry, they estimate that a shutdown would cost the US travel economy $140 million each day and that's because in part, there could be these delays, and some people may decide not to travel. In the longest shutdown ever, that was the last shutdown, the one that began in late 2018, there was a situation where some TSA workers and some - - even some air traffic controllers, they called out sick, and that was causing delays at the airport. And so the worry is that there could be chaos, and that that's going to really impact the travel economy, the problem is that TSA workers and also air traffic controllers, they're going to be deemed essential workers, so they'll have to report to work, but Uncle Sam won't be paying them because the government is shut down, and that's where you have a situation where some workers may not show up as they wait for the government to reopen and they actually get paid -- Richard.",

And so this was his company on trial and the judge is saying, you have been a fraud for years inflating the value of your assets, inflating your own personal worth, and essentially lying to the public, and your counterparts in business about how much money you have. So that's stinging to the former president, you know, from a reputational standpoint, and even though this is still in a sense, a small family run business, it is a significant presence in New York of having Trump Tower, having some of these operations and it's still unclear how this is going to shake out. Now, the former president, obviously handed the reins of this company to his sons when he went into the White House, but it is still the family business. It is still something that he has pointed to as saying that he is a billionaire, that he's a successful businessman and that's part of his political campaign.

It reached a deal with the big studios. Amongst the deal, increases to pay and benefits. Compensation for guarantees for shows that are aired or streaming and new rules around the role of artificial intelligence. The potential for AI was a major issue. According to a summary of the deal, studios have agreed that AI can't write or rewrite literary material. Any AI generated material given to a writer has to be disclosed. For those who are not happy, veteran medical executive Barry Diller said on CNBC, the paragraph protects nothing from no one. Bill Wolkoff is a television writer and producer and joins me from Los Angeles. First question, how difficult was it becoming on strike for that long? The economic times are starting to get tough.",
