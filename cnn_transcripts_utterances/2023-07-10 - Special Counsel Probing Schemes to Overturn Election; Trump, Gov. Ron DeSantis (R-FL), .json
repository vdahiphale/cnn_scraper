And, separately, tomorrow in Georgia, selection begins for a grand jury that will also decide whether to indict him. In a moment, I will speak live with a key witness in the special counsel's investigation, former Trump official Ken Cuccinelli. But, first, here is your evening's cliffs notes, or shall I say the Coates notes, for a second, on the various alleged schemes that Jack Smith is likely to be considering. Now, in one scheme, Trump considers a plan to use the military to seize voting machines. In another, military-related plot, allies floated the idea of even using martial law, using troops to redo an election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he has come out to suggest that Trump somehow colluded with social media to squash his story and beyond.

You can go back to the Bush v. Gore election in 2000 and seeing election after election where Republicans won, that Democrats were making the kind of objections that have now been taken to a higher level by the Democrats themselves.I would like us to see all Americans get to the point where each of our states has such clean, clear, transparent elections that we can all have confidence, even when we're on the losing side, that the outcome most righteous and appropriate. They will never be perfect but that should be a shared goal. It's one I work toward and parallel right now in my life today, and I think that we're gradually having some success in that area, but that happens at the state level, Laura, much more so than at the federal level. And Governor DeSantis has been a leader in that as well in Florida, and all of the challenges that have come along have been well-handled, and they count their votes quickly and cleanly and there are not major complaints from either side.

You have to have the responsibility to clear the field. Their donor base has to have the responsibility to tell their candidates to clear the field, get this down to two or three. If it's a one-on-one race, Trump and someone else, Trump loses and win as Republicans in November. And all that matters is winning in November of '24. And if you can't clear that hurdle, if the math isn't there and it's not for Trump, you have got to find somebody else. And I think the Republican Party will kind of embrace that and really take advantage of that both through Iowa, New Hampshire, and as we go into Super Tuesday.",

If you're talking about this reputation or the idea of more than 50 years worth of staffing.

THOMPSONBiden, because he's been in the public life 50 years, he knows the difference between a public persona and a private persona. And he's a very, you know, he didn't become president by accident, right? I mean, that requires a level of public persona skill that sometimes is different than your private persona. In this case, why it's so interesting is that his public persona leans so much on him being civil, on his civility. And that clip you just showed about, you know, the standard he was setting for his White House, I can tell you some former Biden administration aides don't think that he's lived up even to his own standard. Now, the other thing I would point out as well is that a lot of, you know, Biden does have a side of him that is incredibly generous, that is incredibly compassionate. It's why, despite being a really tough boss, he has had this very similar, same inner core of advisors for sometimes going back several decades. You know, they go, they realize what they've gone into, and they can sort of go with the highs and lows. And I think that's part of the reason why he's actually had a relatively stable staff.

There's something off here because, as I said, I don't think anybody who's listening would agree that somebody who's done something terrible, they're a predator, just because they have money, after they get arrested, they should be able to go home, particularly have money. And somebody else has got to sit in jail for a year and a half, lose their job, lose their place in school, lose their kids to the system, just because they don't have enough money to give somebody before they get to trial.So, that's what this judge is concerned about. That said, if it turns out that there is a smarter, better way to do it, using other factors, maybe for some kinds of crime, maybe you might want to apply bail, I'm open to something that's reasonable. But what this judge found is that in our county we have 13,000 people in jail, half of whom have not been convicted of anything. You got 6000 people sitting in jail right now, haven't been convicted of anything, and they can't get out because they're poor. That doesn't work for Los Angeles.",

They don't talk to the victims. They just release them. That's dangerous.And, you know, to the L.A. case, unfortunately, my understanding is neither the district attorney nor any member of law enforcement appeared in that court case and offered a contrary opinion.

It deals with something interferes with someone's right to property, the use of their property, or destroys it, or commits a crime by doing that.
