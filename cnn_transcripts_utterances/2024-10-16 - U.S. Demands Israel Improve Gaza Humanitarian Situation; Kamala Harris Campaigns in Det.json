It was a place that they operated back in December. They'd left, they cleared it out, but Hamas has begun to reconstitute itself. Israel is back in there again trying to clear out that area and aid has had a difficulty getting in during this period of time. There are still apparently several hundred thousand Palestinians who are left in that area. But I think what's really going on here, though, is that the Biden administration wants this war over. They want the war over in Gaza. They want to war over in Lebanon. They would prefer not to have Israel attack Iran in retaliation for -- you spoke about earlier -- the missile assault from just a couple of weeks ago. This is just part of that growing frustration as America nears its general election in just a couple of weeks. They want this war behind them.",

So for Israelis, this is a war that was needed also because you have 60,000 people who can't go back to their homes until Hezbollah is pushed away from that border. But you are right, though, that for the Americans, the concern here, specifically with the attacks by Israel in Beirut, is that this will weaken the government of Lebanon. It will weaken the Lebanese armed forces and these are the entities that the Americans, the French, and other countries in the West want to see grab the reins from Hezbollah now that it has been significantly weakened.",

The idea of the man as the protector, childless cat ladies, parents should get more votes if they have kids.And that appeals to a segment of female voters, but not to the largest segment. If you believe as I do that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the three former blue wall states, are still the most likely places to decide the election, what Trump is really aiming at in events like this is the very large population in those states of white women without a college degree. It's pretty clear, I think the odds are pretty high that Kamala Harris is going to run even better than Biden did in 2020 among white women with a college degree.

And there is a portion that responds to what I just mentioned. This kind of tradition gender roles signaling that Trump, for example, by having Hulk Hogan, the professional wrestler, you know, the idea that he's a tough guy at the convention. Harris I think, you know, has focused a lot on trying to convince black and Latino voters that she will fight for people like them, economically, and she's made up some ground on that.

A cloud of debris blown into the sky. North Korea demolished this roadway and another one on the other side of the country, two of the last remaining road and railways linking the two countries.This video is certainly compelling, but what is it all mean? Well, it's certainly a physical reminder that a policy of peaceful unification may be a thing of the past. In January, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said, peaceful reunification should no longer be pursued and monuments like this one, the Arch of Reunification in North Korea's capital, have presumably been blown up. Kim Jong-un said he was going to do it and it no longer appears in satellite imagery. So this is also a movie we've seen before. In 2010, North Korea was upset about leaflets sent by balloon from South Korea. Balloons like these, and the leaflets described what life is like in the free world. A version of that balloon drama is still happening today. So back in 2020 to retaliate, North Korea blew up this building near the border, which was supposed to be a cooperation office between North and South Korea. So bottom line, tensions have been much worse before. South Korea has actually had islands shelled by North Korea and a battleship also sunk by North Korea. That happened back in 2010. Tensions now are nowhere near at that point. The two roadways that were demolished in this most recent episode, well, they haven't been used for years.
