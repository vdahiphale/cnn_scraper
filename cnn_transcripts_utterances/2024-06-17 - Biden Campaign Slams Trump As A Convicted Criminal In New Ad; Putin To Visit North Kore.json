Over the weekend, the Biden campaign raised more than $30 million as part of a star studded fundraiser in Hollywood, where Biden appeared on stage with President Obama, and it was co-hosted by George Clooney. And attendees say that President Biden gave an impassioned plea about the future of the Supreme Court being on the line, among other things.But even despite that fundraising Wolf, the Biden campaign suggesting it needs more. A text message blasted grass roots donor this afternoon from Vice President Kamala Harris, suggesting that Trump has raised $141 million just since the conviction and asking donors to help them match that.

We know that his campaign and groups, like Turning Point, are trying to convince Republicans to buy into mail-in voting, to do early voting, even though Donald Trump continuously criticizes those processes on the campaign trail.

I mean, the polls have been remarkably stable. Given everything that's happened in the race, 34 felony convictions, I mean, we couldn't have even imagined that once upon a time, the polls have barely changed, but they really believe, the Biden campaign, talking to their advisers, believe that what they need to do is bring some Democrats home and bring some Biden voters home, so by sort of shining a light on this stark difference, they think that's necessary.

So, cutting off the microphones, that is the key difference here, really. Yes, there are a couple commercials, which is probably good for the candidates to rest a bit. But cutting off the mics when they're not speaking, it's interesting because it sort of raises -- if it works, it raises the burden, I think, on both sides to make their coherent point, and you can't necessarily win by having someone else outshout you. And the no audience, the no studio audience is also very important. The White House insisted on that. President Biden did not want an audience and that Donald Trump wanted to debate Joe Biden.

I just talked to a fire official who told me they have been able to hold the lines. But you see here behind me, this has already destroyed more than 15,000 acres and you have firefighters working around the clock. This crew here on to my left, they're taking a quick 15-minute break, but they are working very, very hard. And you have the crews also up in the air dropping the water, trying to do everything they can to continue to keep those fire lines. The efforts by these guys here is what is keeping those fire lines.There's also this concern about what climate change is doing to this fire and many others in the season. It is very early to see this type of fire. So, I want you to take a listen to what one fire official with the Forest Service told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Actually, there's Texas right there, could even see quite a bit of rain in Texas with this, some of the models putting somewhere between 10 and 20 inches of rainfall in spots here as the storm circulates around.

The problem is about more crossings being open, Wolf, areas in the north, close Rafah, the lifeline for humanitarian aid in the south closed the port, not functioning at the moment. These are the things that are critical. And then once aid gets in, Israel is the occupying power, ensuring it lives up to that legal responsibility to ensure we can deliver that aid safely across the Gaza Strip.

Their husband was killed, their homes bombed.I was also seeing children who are angry, who is silent or who would throw things because they know what's happened to them. I'm seeing children also, Wolf, on the ground. Hospitals are so overcrowded. I'm seeing children with head wounds oh, terrible burns, not being able to get the medical attention because we've seen the systematic devastation. So physically, it is a place where they are so woefully under threat, but psychologically, it's 250 days of this, Wolf, and they trust me as someone who's barely slept for a few days because the bombing and the drones are so utterly relentless. And then during the day, if they're not being bombed in a town into a tent, Wolf, tangible because, of course, they don't want to lose their home. So there's no windows and there's no ceiling fans. One of these tents is 50 degrees Celsius. That's -- I don't know, 120 plus Fahrenheit with a lethal lack of water. That's life for child in Gaza. It's no place for children, but it's home.

And that has been a wonderful thing. And I think it's a thing also when I speak to so many Gazans that it lifts their spirits to know that people are seeking to raise their voice. But at the same time, whilst we see this almost unprecedented in modern times, range of protests against attacks on children. We see almost impunity on the other side. So, yes, of course, certainly. I find it very disconcerting that people still somehow excused away attacks on children and don't just look solely for a ceasefire, a ceasefire. Both these parties seem woefully disconnected from the suffering of children as ceasefire, it gets hostages home that, ends that torment. And it allows, Wolf, as a mother said to me, it would allow her to promise her daughter that she would wake up in the morning. A parent cannot do that. Children look in parents eyes now, he will open children know their parents have lost the ability to protect them. That is an -- that is awful realization for child and a terrible, terrible moment for parents who also knows that they can no longer protect their child albeit from the sky or malnutrition and lack of water on the ground.",

But apparently aborted the landing when they could not see the runway in front of them, something called a missed approach, known to be an especially busy time in the cockpit of a large airline are typically the procedure is to decline, but the data shows the plane continuing to descend at a rate of 4,000 feet a minute until the dissent was arrested at 400 feet above ground level, very low. The question here will be the cause and the memo reported by other outlets says the first officer was flying the plane at the time and may have inadvertently pushed forward on the control column. Now, Southwest has released a statement men saying, nothing is more important to Southwest than safety through our robust safety management system, the event was addressed appropriately as we always strive for continuous improvement. This is similar you may remember to an incident on a United Airlines flight back in December of 2022, also, a landing in the island of Hawaii in bad weather, the NTSB found significant miscommunication in the cockpit. The NTSB says it will not investigate this latest incident -- Wolf.",
