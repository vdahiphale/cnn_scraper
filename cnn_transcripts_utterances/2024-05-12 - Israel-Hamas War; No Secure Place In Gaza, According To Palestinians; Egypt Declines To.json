Thousands of people gathering in central Tel Aviv and other cities across Israel to keep up the pressure on the government, to try to do a deal with Hamas that would see the 128 or so hostages, about a quarter of whom are believed to be dead, brought back into Israel.Now, this has been happening on a weekly basis. Now, the protesters are not only demanding that the government do a deal, and I should note that talks have, I suppose, let's put it politely, paused. They haven't completely broken down, but they paused for now. Given that situation, the pressure is growing on the government from these protesters. They're also calling for new elections and also calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. And this weekend's protests took on added poignancy because it comes on the eve of Yom HaZikaron, the day -- Memorial Day for Israelis when Israel remembers its fallen soldiers and people that have been killed in the various conflicts that Israel has been involved with since the establishment of the modern-day state in 1948. So, added poignancy also calling not only for the living hostages to be returned to Israel, but also for the bodies of those who have been killed by Hamas to be returned to Israel so that they can receive a dignified burial. Now, most of those protests were peaceful, but there were clashes with police by a number of people that remained after the authorized protest. They blocked roads, set fires, and there were a number of arrests, including, we understand, a couple of relatives of hostages being held in captivity in Gaza. Those protests are no sign of abating. They are happening weekly and they will continue to happen until a ceasefire deal is done -- a ceasefire deal, Kim, I should say, that seems further away than ever.",

Of course, this stemming from a February national security memorandum that required the determination on this matter, and also whether Israel withheld humanitarian aid into Gaza in violation of U.S. law. Of course, all of this is being serving as another data point that the Biden administration is using in their ongoing discussions with Israel. But it also comes against the backdrop of the interview that President Biden had with CNN, where he said for the first time that he is willing to withhold weapons from Israel if they launch that major ground operation in Rafah, an area with more than a million displaced Palestinians. Now, those conversations are ongoing, and the President said that he would continue defensive weapons, but there could be a change on offensive weapons.

Their research suggests sperm whales speak with a certain structure, varying the rhythm and pace of their clicks, sometimes even adding an extra click at the end, like a suffix. The next step though is to decipher what that structure means, a challenge that will require a closer look at social dynamics.",

And even if we do, one day, understand what sperm whales are saying, should we try to talk back? Andreas is optimistic that the answers are within reach. ANDREAS: This is an incredibly vulnerable population with a socially transmitted communication system that we really don't want to disturb. And so -- right, we're just at the very beginning of this process, and I think there's a lot more research that we have to do, before we know whether it's a good idea to try to communicate with them, or really even to have a sense of whether that will be possible.
