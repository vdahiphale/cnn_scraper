His own party, though, remains divided after another uneven performance. A mass exodus continues from Gaza City amid intense Israeli military action around the area that has left dozens of Palestinians dead. And an enormous data breach at AT&amp;T has affected millions of people. U.S. President Joe Biden is back on the campaign trail today after that closely watched news conference to end the NATO summit in Washington. He'll be heading to the battleground state of Michigan as more congressional Democrats call on him to exit the presidential race, while others continue to voice strong support. Now at the news conference Thursday, Mr. Biden answered questions for nearly an hour, fending off concerns about his cognitive health and ability to serve four more years in office. He did make one notable flub at the start, mixing up the names of the vice president and his Republican opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the question is, is fine good enough to go on with his campaign? And that is very much an uncertainty at this hour in Washington. Now the president traveling to Michigan later today, a key battleground state here in the U.S. He is going forward. He said last night at the press conference he is committed to staying in this race. But the question is with what type of strength and backing? There have been, as you said, three Democratic members of Congress come out since that news conference on Thursday night saying they would like him to step aside. We do expect more to do so as the day wears on. It's unclear if any of these have a direct effect on his actual plans, though. One thing we are watching very carefully former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, of course a longtime ally and friend of President Biden, has been in quiet conversations we are told this week with former president Barack Obama. Neither have said specifically what they want President Biden to do, but they have in their conversations, we are told, expressed a worry and concern about his ability to win in November. So they've been something of a sounding board. The question is, will they take their views to President Biden. It's tricky. He's dug in, in the words of his advisers. He's committed to staying in, but he did say one thing at the news conference that was different. He said if he's presented information from data in polls that show he would lose, that could get him to reconsider. But then in the next breath, he went on to say, but they're not. He's winning. But that flub you showed certainly is something that will make the rounds on social media. It already has and it could become a soundtrack of his campaign.",

So comparedto the last election where Biden is obviously right, he says I'm the only guy who's beaten Trump and he did beat Trump. He was 10 points ahead in July of 2020. OK. He's not 10 points ahead now. He's behind and he's narrowly behind nationally. But more importantly, he's narrowly behind in nearly all of the critical swing states. And I watched that press conference carefully and commented on it. I think it was -- I think he did fine. He showed particularly substantive mastery of his role as leader of the free world. It was very impressive to me. Style had some problems. He was hesitant, soft-spoken, and then he did call the vice president Trump. But all of it is a tactical answer to an existential problem, right? The existential problem is people think he's too old. Democrats think he's too old. And just to put it in -- because it's a global audience, John Major, the former British prime minister, who's been out of power for 29 years, he's still younger than Joe Biden. You know, we Democrats turned to him because we believed he could beat Trump. We were right. He beat Trump. He turned out to be a great president, most consequential first-term president since LBJ. But more and more Democrats I'm hearing from are saying, it is time for new leadership because they're very worried that this time he won't be able to beat Trump the way he did last time.",

So it could be as soon as two or three weeks that the Democrats settle on Biden as their nominee. He's already won 14 million votes. He's already won every single primary and caucus. He was challenged within his party. A guy named Dean Phillips, very accomplished congressman from Minnesota, who got precisely zero, I think. I think he just really got wiped out by President Biden.

I spoke to somebody close to President Obama yesterday and did not confirm. I did not know that he had talked to Speaker Emerita Pelosi, but basically said President Obama has always been a personal close friend of Joe Biden's. There has been political tension sometimes in the past, but he's always been a sounding voice for President Biden, and President Obama really is, the source close to him told me, he really wants to maintain that.

And unfortunately, a lot of non-AT&amp;T customers are going to be impacted here because they said what was also stolen was the customers of wireless providers that used its network and also people who interacted with an AT&amp;T customers. Now it's important to note that the company says that at this point they don't believe that this data is publicly available. Of course, that's just at this point and that could change. As far as what is included and what's not, critically AT&amp;T says that the content of text messages and phone calls that was not stolen here, nor is the names of the people who were the customers or their Social Security number. So that of course is a relief. But AT&amp;T acknowledges that there are publicly available tools out there where you can connect a phone number to a person and the company says that for a small subset of customers, it was also some cell phone -- cell I.D. tower information was taken. And that's the kind of data that could be very valuable because it could actually identify where some of these customers are located, where they live, where they work. Now the company put out a statement. They say they're going to alert former and current customers, they're going to provide them resources. AT&amp;T says, \"We sincerely regret the situation occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care.\" One other point here that's really interesting is the timing because, as I mentioned, AT&amp;T learned about this back in April, but we're only learning about it now. The company says that the Justice Department decided that it was worth it to delay things here. The FBI actually put out a statement and they say that they decided to delay the public release of this because of potential risk to, quote, \"national security and/or public safety.\" AT&amp;T says that they have been cooperating with law enforcement and that they understand that at least one person believed to be involved here has been apprehended. We don't know the identity of that person, where they were apprehended or what group or groups they were associated with.

The meeting occurred yesterday evening. And in that conversation I directly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives, and conclusions about the path forward that the caucus has shared in our recent time together.\" There are some 16 House Democrats who have now come out publicly and said that President Biden should step aside in the race. And the White House and the campaign, as well as the party believed that there would be more defections to take place and that even though they were pleased with the president's performance in the press conference, that that would not be enough to stem the mounting pressure that had been brewing within the Democratic Party.

However, sources tell CNN there are still tough issues to resolve. U.S. President Joe Biden says he hopes the proposal now being discussed will allow for a two-state solution in the Middle East. He called these Israeli war cabinet the most conservative war cabinets in the country's history and said he was working with Arab nations on how they could keep the peace in Gaza without Israeli forces staying in the enclave.

Earlier this week, the Israeli military ordered the evacuation of Gaza City bit bybit to ultimately include nearly the entire city, and this morning it appears that the Israeli military has withdrawn from most parts of that very same city. And what they have left in their wake, of course, is an enormous amount of destruction. There has been intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza City throughout much of this week. And we've seen some of that fighting stretch back as much as two weeks in the past. The Israeli military says that the focus of at least some of its operations was near the UNRWA headquarters in Gaza City. Now, it's important to note that this headquarter has not been used by that U.N. agency for months now, but in its stead, the Israeli military says that Hamas began to use that headquarters in Gaza City as a compound for its own operations, including operating a war room out of that building and also storing large stashes of weapons. That's not information that CNN can independently verify at this stage, but it does give you a sense of what the Israeli military, what they say they have been battling in that area. But there's no question that the destruction here is enormous. Not only that UNRWA headquarters that's partially damaged, but other buildings in that area suffering just an enormous, enormous scale of destruction. We've started to see images of Palestinians displaced from Gaza City, several hundred thousand of them who were displaced. Some of those beginning to return to that area and finding this absolute wasteland instead of it. We know that all of this is happening of course as those ceasefire negotiations continue between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the Egyptian and the Qatari governments. We've gotten some indications that there's been some progress made, but also just a lot of uncertainty over exactly what that progress actually is and also what the stumbling blocks that need to be resolved are that remain. But certainly all of Gaza looking towards those ceasefire talks to see if there could be a reprieve in the fighting.",

Combat in the area during the initial hours was characterized by a lack of command and control, a lack of coordination, and a lack of order among the different forces and units. This led to several incidents where security forces grouped at the entrance of the kibbutz without immediately engaging in combat.\" And what that last line means is that for about the first seven hours of Hamas' attack on this kibbutz, the civilians were effectively left to defend themselves. That included members of the Civilian Rapid Response Unit for the kibbutz who valiantly battled Hamas militants according to the Israeli military. But it was only in the afternoon of that day that is Israeli military forces actually began to enter that kibbutz and beat back the Hamas fighters who were there. So very sweeping conclusions from the Israeli military. And what's especially notable is the fact that this is only the first such inquiry into the events of October 7th into the failings of the Israeli security establishment on and riding up until that day. But the Israeli military has indicated that there will be more reports like this one into those failings on October 7th -- Eleni.",

Venezuela is preparing for national elections that some hope could change the country's future for many of the millions whofled under the leadership of Nicolas Maduro. A change in power could bring about some long-sought homecomings. Stefano Pozzebon has more.

These migrants in Bogota are doing just that, working with a foundation that provides free classes and counseling to vulnerable Venezuelans and Colombians alike. Maria Alvarez (PH) arrived in Colombia seven years ago. She helped create the organization. Making a living as a manicurist is tough. But Bogota has been welcoming. Home, however, is still somewhere else. (Through text translation): What are your hopes for July? What do you think? What do you dream? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through text translation): I want Venezuela to be free. That everything goes back to how it used to be. POZZEBON (voice-over): She dreams that one day her son will finally meet his grandparents in Venezuela. He has only seen them in photos. This month, millions of Venezuelan migrants are sharing such dreams, as their home country heads to the polls. Authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro pledging to allow free and fair elections as he campaigns for reelection, and the democratic opposition uniting behind a single candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, a former diplomat who floated the idea of amnesty for former government officials who have been accused of crimes against humanity. It's the most credible democratic challenge in a decade. But because more than seven million Venezuelans like Alvarez have fled the country under Maduro, the upcoming month can make an impact all across the Americas. Colombia has welcomed more than two million Venezuelan migrants in recent years. Many here have found a new home. But for others these streets are just the beginning of a journey to the north. (Voice-over): Venezuelans were the second largest group of migrants reaching the U.S. southern border last year. Many arrived from Colombia, crossing the treacherous jungle to Panama, in the Darien Gap, and then upward through Central America.

Four daysafter Hurricane Beryl swept through the region, more than a million people are still without electricity. 879,000 of those are CenterPoint Energy customers. The utility company says half a million Houston homes and businesses may not have their power restored until sometime next week. Now the outages have been debilitating for hospitals, assisted living facilities and water treatment plants in the area. Texas Governor Greg Abbott is ordering an investigation into the state's utility companies to see what issues arose in the response to the hurricane. And outside the United States, we are seeing dangerous heatwaves in countries around the world. One major hotspot right now is in Iran, where people were warned of rising temperatures heading into the weekend. There are major concerns about the power supply holding. One official calling this an unprecedented situation. Iran's hottest temperatures in 50 years, provinces around the country have taken precautionary measures and announced office closures. Now, India has also been in a brutal struggle with heat for many weeks. It is a problem that is just not going away and in a recent article for the \"Hindu Sun Times,\" my next guest had this to say. \"To emerge as a leader in the rapidly heating world, businesses and countries and the global south need to become climate ready and tap into opportunities that arise from the energy transition.\" Arunabha Ghosh is the founder and CEO of the public policy think tank based in India called the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water, and joins us now live.

And this summer in May, for instance, we have more than 37 cities in north and central India that were experiencing daytime highs above 113 Fahrenheit. So this is particularly concerning because on average you get five to eight days of heatwaves. This summer it was, say in Delhi, upwards of 20 days. So there's more than a doubling of the kind of heat stress and that then of course has a public health impact. It has an impact on economic productivity for workers working outdoors.

So in fact, for the first time in history, the share of coal-based capacity of power generation in India has fallen under 50 percent. So what more needs to be done? What more needs to be done is we've got to tender out a lot more renewable energy capacity. Last year we tended our 45,000 megawatts. This kind of level of tendering has to go on for the next five years. So 45,000 to 50,000 megawatts every year of clean electric capacity being installed. We've also got to make sure that we look at the past systems of the future. The past systems of the future will be much more distributed.
