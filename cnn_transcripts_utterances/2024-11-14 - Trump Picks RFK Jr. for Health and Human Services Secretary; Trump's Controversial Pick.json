      "sentences": "It is 8And wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" A warm welcome to \"First Move.\" Here is today's need to know. Donald Trump names RFK Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of war crimes in Gaza, saying it's implemented a systematic campaign of forced mass displacement. The satirical news site, The Onion, buys Alex Jones' InfoWars at a bankruptcy auction. And taxi takeoff. Archer Aviation signs a deal to bring electric flying cabs to Japan. We'll have that conversation and plenty more coming right up. But first President-Elect Donald Trump picks Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services. The anti-vaccine activist had dropped his own presidential bid and endorsed Trump. It comes as Trump's pick for attorney general continues to rattle Washington. Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress shortly after Trump named him to be in charge of the Justice Department. The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet Friday to discuss the fate of its report about Gaetz, involving accusations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, and misusing campaign funds. It's unclear, as of now, if the information will ever be made public now that he has resigned. Well, some senators are calling for it to be released anyway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)' SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  The timing of his resignation and flight with President-Elect Donald Trump suggests he believes that this report is not friendly and favorable. So, I want to read the report and find out what the investigation behind it brought up. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated. SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  Look, I barely know Gaetz. All I know is he likes picking fights on social media. But at the end of the day, you got to have the votes and you better have the resume. That's how the process works. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I would say that most people in public health are trying to pick them up off the floor or are already in the emergency room with a heart attack. His views are in the extreme. They're in orbit. They're opposed by just about everybody in public health. RFK Jr. even wants to take the fluoride out of the water. This was a controversy in the 1950s and 1960s. It was resolved then. So, it's just another bombshell, and it's part of Donald Trump's theory and approach to government, which is if you nominate enough controversial people, maybe one or two won't get through but they'll have to confirm the rest, because it's a Republican Senate.",

We know for certain disease, like take measles, thankfully, we don't see a lot of measles anymore because children have been vaccinated. You have to keep the population vaccine rates above 95 percent to keep measles out of a community. Even if it drops down to 90 or 85, we start seeing outbreaks, that is what we are seeing in certain communities spread largely by people like RFK Jr. who like to undermine confidence in vaccines.

Now, in the previous Trump administration, there seemed to be very little interest in looking at those things, but I don't think -- I think that is fine. I think the much broader issue here is how are we going to make those decisions? And when you look at additives and foods, how are we going to decide whether something is safe or not? We're going to have to rigorously test it using scientific methods. That's how we make decisions. And he is not someone who has shown any evidence of being committed to that process.

Security was also beefed off at the stadium outside Paris where the game was held. The show of force intended to avoid a repeat of the anti-Semitic violence that broke out in Amsterdam last week after a football match. There were some altercations in the stands during the game in France. At least one person held up a Palestinian flag even though flags were banned inside the stadium. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the stadium to protest the match, which ended in a nil-nil draw. Well, a new report by Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of carrying out a deliberate systematic campaign of forced mass displacement. The report says Israel has blatantly violated obligations to ensure Palestinians can return home by destroying virtually any everything in large areas, but the Israeli military says it's committed to international law and issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat. Our Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv with the details. But we need to warn you parts of his report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For more than a year this scene has played out in Gaza, day after day on an endless loop. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians forced to flee their homes in an elusive quest for safety, spurred by Israeli bombs and missiles, as well as military evacuation orders. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  For your immediate safety, we urge all residents of Northern Gaza and Gaza City to temporarily relocate south. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Israeli officials say these leaflets and the other warnings are evidence of its efforts to minimize civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based watchdog, says Israel's evacuation system has not only failed to keep Palestinians safe, but amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a 154-page report analyzing 184 evacuation orders, Human Rights Watch concluded that Israel's actions have intentionally caused the mass and force displacement of the majority of the civilian population of Gaza. The report calls Israel's evacuation orders inconsistent, inaccurate, and frequently not communicated to civilians with enough time to allow evacuations, and says designated evacuation routes and safe zones were repeatedly attacked by the Israeli military.",

But Gaetz abruptly resigned from the House yesterday after getting this pick. And after he resigned, essentially that investigation ended. It didn't have any -- it couldn't move forward, but lawmakers could still vote in that committee to release that information, and that's what a lot of Democrats are demanding right now. They want that information out before there's any vote next year to confirm him. Republicans, for the most part, are not joining those calls. Some want to see that information come out. But that's a big question here, Lynda, whether or not that information will come out, when it would and what it says and how -- whether or not that could be enough to tank this nomination altogether.

In fact, that's what Donald Trump said in just the last few days, as the Senate was -- Republicans werechoosing their new leader of the Senate majority. He said, the next Senate majority leader must agree to allow him to make what's known as recess appointments. That means the constitutional authority given to the president when the Senate is on an extended recess period, they're not in session, but the president can go in and install someone to the post and bypass the Senate altogether. Well, that has not really been done in about 17 years because of the maneuvering by Senate majorities to prevent the Senate from going into extended recesses. But Trump is saying, you know what, the new majority leader needs to agree with me. And the Senate Republican leader, who was just elected yesterday, Senate Republican leader, John Thune, has indicated an openness to that but has not said that he would do that in order for Donald Trump to install people like RFK Jr. And there is a lot of controversy, Lynda. A lot of Republicans are concerned about his views. We've not gotten a full airing yet of Republicans who left town this afternoon for their weekend before this news broke. We'll get a better sense next week. Whether or not the votes are actually there, but I can assure you many will have concerns and many will want to hear what he has to say in those high-profile confirmation hearings that will take place early next year.

Amazon is uniquely positioned to help in natural disasters in a way. We have logistics all around the world. We have global inventory and we have technology, and that goes a long way to help in these situations. But you mentioned we have disaster relief hubs. We actually have 14 of those around the world. We have them in Australia, Japan, India, all very disaster-prone continents and countries. We have one in Europe and we have multiple ones in the U.S. here. In Europe, we actually mobilized our hub right after this horrible sudden disaster happened and we used the pre-positioned items that we have there, hygiene kits and blankets, and shipped them into direction Valencia. We also tapped into our inventory across Spain. We're able to provide all items that our relief partners actually requested from us, and we were able to build a temporary disaster relief up right in Valencia together with Fundacion Altius who serves the communities in needs even outside of disasters and who we partner with when there isn't a disaster and this brought us an opportunity to work together, stem up a temporary disaster relief up in just under 48 hours, send in help to engineer the logistics of this, and we delivered. Actually, you mentioned 160,000 items, it is today a quarter million items that were able to be deployed to the people in need in the population in the vicinity.",

So, think airport to city center, that's a trip that I think we're all very familiar with. Those are trips that can be very tiresome and really just soul sucking as you sit there in traffic. Those are routes that we can fly in very short periods of time. And so, we're now working with the regulators, as we close the final stages here, in order to bring these aircraft to markets.
