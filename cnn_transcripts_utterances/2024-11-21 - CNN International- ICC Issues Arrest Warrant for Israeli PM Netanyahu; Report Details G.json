Ukraine is accusing Russia of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile in the country's east, as the war escalates. We're live in Kyiv shortly.But first we begin with this breaking news out of the Middle East. The International Criminal Court has just issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant accusing them of war crimes in Gaza. And also, for a top Hamas commander, also known as Mohammed Deif who is believed to be dead. The court says it found reasonable grounds to believe the prime minister bears criminal responsibility for war crimes, including starvation as a method of warfare, and it rejected Israel's challenge of the court's jurisdiction over the matter. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Jerusalem. Nic, what more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a very, very significant escalation. It was first announced by Karim Khan, the ICC Chief Prosecutor, back in May, that he was going to seek to request arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, who was the defense minister at the time, as well as three other senior Hamas officials, including Mohammed Deif Ismael Hanya Yahya Sinwar the other.Those three are all dead. Deif believed to have been killed in July. So unclear why they issued an arrest warrant now for him. But by overturning Israel's rejection of the jurisdiction and the allegations by the court, this clears the way for something very, very significant, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel have never, ever faced before. These are very, very serious charges and allegations, as you read them out there. The court believes he has -- they have grounds to believe that he bears criminal responsibility for war crimes, as you said, including starvation as a method of warfare and of crimes against humanity, of murder, persecution and of other crimes. These are very, very serious allegations. These are not the sorts of allegations that the prime minister has faced before, when they -- when the ICC first made these statements back in May, the prime minister's office, said that they were absurd, that they were false, and that they were a distortion of reality. It is something that back then, the prime minister took very, very seriously. Has been in meetings today with the U.S. Mediator, Amos Hochstein, talking about the possibility of a ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon to the North, but this is absolutely now going to come front and center of the prime minister's attention here.",

But he -- we have seen in the case of Vladimir Putin that there are countries that he has avoided visiting, like South Africa for a BRICS Summit, where potentially, because South Africa is a signatory to the Rome Statute, he could have technically been arrested and taken to the Hague so will the same fate or limitations on travel face Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? It appears absolutely so. If, technically, if he would have set foot today in the Netherlands or in the UK or in France, also all signatures of the Rome Statute he would be or those countries at least would be obligated to arrest him and turn him over to the ICC.",

But yeah, a certainly a concern. I think that we're seeing a slow escalation here. Moscow said it was likely it would respond to the use of U.S.-made missiles by Ukraine, and maybe what we saw this morning hitting, it seems, a target in Dnipro, a major Ukrainian city with suggestions, an industrial complex there was hit.

The report details allegations that Hegseth sexually assaulted a woman in 2017. The woman told police Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room and then forced himself on her despite her numerous protests.Hegseth says the encounter was consensual, but he later paid the woman to keep the incident confidential. Separately, House Republicans blocked the release of an ethics committee report on Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick to run the Department of Justice. The report looked into allegations of drug use and sexual misconduct by Gaetz. The Committee will meet again in early December to decide what to do next. Democrats have filed a motion calling for the entire House to vote on making the report public. Let's bring in CNN Political Reporter Sara Murray with a closer look at all of this.

I want to run through the woman's account. She's referred to Jane Doe in this police report.She says Hegseth was getting off a creeper vibe at the conference. She says she ends up in his hotel room. He takes her phone. He blocks the door with his body. And then she remembered saying no, a lot. Now there's a lot that she couldn't recall. She said maybe something was slipped into her drink. And there are conflicting accounts, though, because there are witnesses who saw her and said she didn't seem to be overly intoxicated. There are also witnesses who saw Hegseth and Jane Doe interacting at the hotel bar before they end up in this hotel room. One said that she was appearing to intercept Hegseth when he was hitting on another woman. Another person said it appeared that this woman, Jane Doe, and another woman, were flirting with Hegseth. At any rate, she seeks medical care a couple of days later, and says she believes she was sexually assaulted. And this is all very different than Pete Hegseth's account to authorities. He describes this as consensual sexual conduct. He says she ended up in his hotel room, but there was always conversation, always consensual contact. He said they discussed that the woman, Jane Doe, was married. She said she would tell her husband she'd fallen asleep on the couch in someone else's room, and he said she showed early signs of regret. And I want to get to the lawyer statement for Pete Hegseth, Tim Parlatore, he said the police report confirms what I've said all along. The incident was fully investigated, and police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed and there were no charges filed in this case. The police report doesn't say it found the incidents to be false, but there is other evidence, like surveillance video, a memo from the DA which could shed light on why he wasn't charged, that has not been made public. Now this woman, Jane Doe, is not commenting to the media on this.",

He'll bring in the conservative media attack machine against any Senator who stands up.Having said that if at some point Trump gets the impression that he can get something else, he can wield power in another way by letting one of these nominees go. I wouldn't be surprised to see him do that, for example, if he sacrificed Gaetz and therefore got undertakings from Republican Senators that all of his other nominees would get through, he might decide that that is a good exercise of power. On the other hand, there are some Republican Senators that may prove not to be reachable by Trump, for example, those who are running for re-election in six years, when he will no longer be in the White House because he's term limited. Look at a Senator like Thom Tillis in North Carolina. He has to worry if he opposes one of Trump's nominees about getting a primary challenge, but he's in a state that just is pretty much 50-50, on the evidence of the last election, if he votes for Gaetz, that's going to become a huge issue in a race against a Democrat in the general election in two years' time, in the congressional midterms.

I don't think there is an appetite among most Senators for that to happen, simply because that would basically make them completely superfluous in Trump's second term.There is, even though the GOP has been genuflecting to Trump for years, there is at least some small residue of Senators who want to wield their individual power. Take the case of Gaetz. A lot of Republican Senators are saying they want the process to play out. They want confirmation hearings. I think what they're hoping is that the process plays out until Trump is inaugurated, there are confirmation hearings, and the new White House gets to a point where they believe that Gaetz can't be confirmed, and then the vote that is so hard for Republicans to take doesn't actually happen. So, there's this idea that over a period of time, it just becomes politically unsustainable, and Trump decides it's got far more things to worry about when he's president. He doesn't really care that much about Gaetz anymore. He can find someone else to do what Gaetz would have done. So -- you know when Senators say one thing, they usually meaning that they hope, in the end, to get to some kind of fudge that gets them off the hook. I think that's what might be happening here.",

In fact, the spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he was on a regular call with journalists earlier today, and he was specifically asked by CNN, by the way, whether or not he would comment on all of this, and he said only the military would comment on this. He was then asked whether or not the threats of the Russians using more force against Ukraine after the U.S. allowed the Ukrainians to use longer range U.S. weapons to strike deep into Russian territory would mean that the Russians would hit the Ukrainians harder than they have in the past. He also deferred that to the military. There was a bit of a moment earlier today during the regular press briefing of the spokeswoman of Russia's Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, where she appeared to get a call in the middle of her press briefing telling her not to comment on this matter, on the alleged launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile by the Russians. She later clarified and said that she had asked for some sort of clarification in general about topics she was supposed to speak about, and that answer came during her press briefing in general, though, from Russian officials, so far, we don't have anything official confirming or denying that they use this type of missile.

But it's really what's going to be really fascinating to watch about her is that, if she is confirmed, she will become the most markedly or most publicly anti surveillance official to ever hold the post at the top of the part of the U.S. government that is responsible for collecting intelligence on America's foreign adversaries.Back when she was still a Democrat in Congress, she, Gabbard, introduced a series of bills that would have been really antithetical to the intelligence community's world view. Two of them were designed to get the U.S. government or to persuade the U.S. government to drop their prosecution of Julian Assange, the Founder of WikiLeaks, as well as of Edward Snowden, the Former National Security Agency contractor who revealed bulk collection of America's data by the National Security Agency back in 2013. Both of these men are viewed really, as almost enemies of the state within the intelligence community, even as they have attracted a certain amount of support from not just Gabbard, but also from some civil libertarian sorry, from some sort of libertarian minded folks on the right, as well as some progressives concerned about press freedoms on the left. But the other piece of legislation that she introduced that was really shocking to intelligence officials would have wholesale repealed one of the most powerful pieces of surveillance authority that the U.S. government has, something called Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is what allows the U.S. government to spy on foreigners overseas. Now, there's been some push by some on the left and on the right to try to reform it, to improve civil liberties protections for Americans whose data is sort of inadvertently sucked up as part of this collection authority. But the idea of wholesale repealing it, this is something that former intelligence officials tell me really would deliberately blind the commander in chief, the president himself, on any given day, as much as half of the intelligence in his daily brief is drawn from FISA section 702. So, this is a pretty extraordinary position to take, and it really speaks to this kind of profound mistrust that Gabbard has of the intelligence community and of its broader surveillance authorities, Fredricka.",

They didn't really know a lot about her beyond the headlines. But what's certainly true, and I think very interesting about Gabbard is that she kind of predates this sort of very Trump perspective that the FBI has been illegally surveilling Americans and it's not to be trusted that the intelligence community is a deep state. Even going back to her time as a Democrat in Congress, she was part of this sort of coalition of lawmakers, again, on sort of the libertarian side of the Republican Party, as well as the sort of progressive side the far left of the Democratic Party that was really skeptical that American surveillance authorities may have sort of overstepped their boundaries in ways that were infringing on the rights of Americans, as opposed to just sort of doing the work that they were supposed to do, collecting intelligence on foreign adversaries. So, what's fascinating about Gabbard is that she does seem to kind of represent the sort of ascendance of this kind of techno libertarian, anti-surveillance wing of the Republican Party.",

There's concern the protests could lead to these scenes again, which played on the streets of Nairobi over the summer.That's when demonstrators held rallies for weeks, forcing the president to drop his unpopular tax hikes, and despite that, many Kenyans remain disillusioned with him. Social media posts are encouraging people to block roads to the parliament. CNN's Larry Madowo is outside the Kenyan parliament in Nairobi. Larry, what is happening at the moment? LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Fred, the president just finished his State of the Nation address, where he said the State of the Nation is resilient. He covered some of what he considers achievements of his administration, and he's just about to leave here. This is part of his entourage getting ready for the presidents to wrap up kind of meeting with the lawmakers in there and leave after doing that joint address of the nation. One of the big highlights out of this speech was that the president ordered two Kenyan ministries of transport and petroleum to cancel two recently signed deals. One, with the Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's company to supply to build and operate power plants here for 30 years. And another was about to go forward that of the handover of the country's main national airport to the Adani group for another 30 years. He says that's based on new information, but the protesters who've been on the streets for most of June and July were unhappy about corruption in his government. And one of the issues they were most concerned about was that potential handover of the country's main national airport to the Adani group, which is, as you know, was indicted for fraud in New York. So that's a win for some of the protesters already claiming credit for it. But it's a little traumatic being back here. The reason why I say it's traumatic being back here is because we were here on, we just want to walk with you. We were here on June 25th, that's five months ago, which was the deadliest day of protests in Kenya. And on that day, we saw protesters shot dead on this very street, walking down the same path. Fred, I can tell you exactly which bodies were where I've spoken to the members of their families. I know their names. 25-year-old Ericson Kyalo was lying there in his white overalls, and police ignored him until the protesters took his body to the morgue just further down there. David Chege, a Sandy school teacher. His body was there, his brain splattered on the ground, and again, it's these scenes that people have been so upset about with the government of President William Ruto. The police brutality they saw in the way that it dealt with the protesters. And over here, this wall five months ago was completely down as protesters breached it and made their way into parliament. And on that grill, the body of Eric Kayoni was there. He was there. He was the University of Nairobi student. His family, as many of these families, were just devastated that. What started out as young people agitating for a better Kenya ended with dozens of people killed as they did that, and that's something President Ruto addressed in his address. But for many protesters, it was not enough for them.",

Prosecutors say Indian conglomerate Adani and seven other executives including his nephew agree to pay over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts.According to U.S. officials, Adani personally met with an Indian government official to quote, advance the bribery scheme, which took place between 2020 and 2024. In a statement out on Wednesday, attorney Bryan Pease said this quote, the defendants orchestrated an elaborate scheme to bribe Indian government officials to secure contracts worth billions of dollars, and lied about the bribery scheme as they sought to raise capital from U.S. and international investors. In a statement, the Adani group says the allegations are, quote, baseless and denied, adding this quote, all possible legal recourse will be sought, and we assure our stakeholders, partners and employees, that we are a law-abiding organization, fully compliant with all laws. Now, the 62-year-old Adani started his career in Diamond trading. Now worth more than $85 billion he is one of India's richest men with an empire that extends from ports and power to media and clean energy. In February of 2023, the billionaire exuded confidence in this handout video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
