      "sentences": "But making it clear that there was no one waiting in the wings, at least in his mind, to be speaker, and that he thought that Johnson was going to be successful today.Now, I did ask him about our reporting that he had been calling these holdouts, and he confirmed that he had, including speaking to representative Chip Roy. On that, specifically, he said he believed that Chip Roy would do the right thing for the country. Obviously, Jake, we are going to have to wait and see how that aligns with Chip Roy believes is right for the country and what Donald Trump believes is right for the country. But he also insisted -- he wasn't telling the holdouts anything. He was just saying, telling them that this would be a good add to the win that they had in the presidential election. A big, beautiful exclamation point is how he put it. So, obviously very Trump rhetoric right there, but he said he's going to be watching all of this unfold. He's very interested in how the votes go down, and that he's going to be spending the day looking at this to see how exactly this plays out. JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. We just saw Chip Roy on the floor there -- and there that's Jamie Raskin. There's Chip Roy. Congressman from Texas on the phone, leaving the floor of the House of representatives to take this phone call. Who knows, perhaps, from somebody whose last name is Trump. And Chip Roy, Dana Bash, very sincere, very earnest believer in the fact that the United States spends too much money compared to how much money it takes in from taxes, and that this deficit and debt problem is one that needs drastic measures as soon as possible. He's very sincere about that, Dana?",

So, I want to bring in my esteemed colleagues here, David Chalian and Kasie Hunt. Nice to see you. We're so excited. This is always an exciting day.I want to pick up on what Kristen was reporting about from her conversation with Donald Trump. And that is the approach that I am told by a senior House Republican source, Mike Johnson is taking. And that is -- that quote today will either go smoothly or set up a showdown with the House Freedom Caucus versus MAGA. Johnson is Trump's pick for Trump's agenda. It's one in the same. So that, you know, the House Freedom Caucus is another way of talking about what Jake was just talking about, of course, which is the people who are fundamental on spending, on debt, on deficit. Now there are other agenda items that they have but that is the core of their mission. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF &amp; POLITICAL DIRECTOR: And many of them put in a letter so that Speaker Johnson could see plainly what their areas of concern are about his leadership to date, and a lot of it has to do with spending. You saw just pictures there as Speaker Johnson working the floor as he is still trying to make sure all the votes are in place for him. And you don't usually get to see all of this, right? This is Chip Roy getting up and taking a phone call in the back of the chamber. We only get to see that because Congress hasn't formally convened yet and been sworn in, and the normal rules of what we get to see on the House floor apply. But you are right. This is a -- this is a moment for this Republican Party, for this speaker to navigate this historic narrow majority, at a time when Donald Trump believes he's sweeping in with a decisive victory in the presidential election, and it could be a bit of a speed bump right out of the gate here as he's preparing to take over full Republican control of Washington and act an agenda. He's not looking for speed bumps, and that's why he's working the phones.",

And the House of Representatives was like, predictable, right? It wasn't like an interesting -- everybody wanted to cover the Senate. You knew the outcome was going to be pre-ordained in the House.And usually when you go to the floor, you have the votes. It is worth, I think, stepping back and understanding how remarkable it is that Mike Johnson doesn't know if he's going to have the votes to be speaker on this first ballot.",

Hakeem Jeffries, of course, the current House Democratic leader. I'm not sure if we see it there, but we certainly saw some shots before the reminder that there - -this is a family affair. This is a time when -- because the House is elected every two years, it's not just the members who have worked their behinds off. It's their families who have been a part of, in most cases, the effort to get them elected. And I was talking to one member who this -- for whom this will be the third swearing in, who was so frustrated, or, I would say, frustrated slash, hopeful that, because the first time was COVID, so their family couldn't come. Last time, the family ended up just going home because it took so many days to get a speaker, they weren't even sworn in. So, the hope is that these family members who are there will not have to wait and wait and wait in order to see their loved ones sworn in --",

I mean, Dana, I think one of the things too, that's worth pointing out, and Patrick McHenry, who's, you know, exiting the stage, leaving the Congress close with Kevin McCarthy, was obviously the person who served in the interim there for a little while.He noted something that, you know, I think has been one of the driving forces behind the change that I've certainly seen in this institution, which is the incentives are totally different than what they used to be. It used to be that playing the inside game was the best way to make a difference. Was the best way to become well known. It was building relationships inside the House, inside the Congress, working the hallways and the phones. And now it's much more an outside game, right? It's a game for attention. It's a game to kind of grab the headlines, at least. That's how a lot of these newer members see it. And each cycle, we have seen more of the kind of serious institutionalists leave the stage. And that's part of why, no matter what happens today, if Johnson gets this gavel, it's just the first of -- I don't know how many times we may be sitting here, wondering if he can get it done.",

We don't see images like this. That's right, you don't. Normally, the C-SPAN cameras are kept under very strict lock and key and controlled by the speaker as to what images they can get. Usually, you just see images like that one right there, and a couple other close ups of people who are speaking. You don't see the candid shots of people in the audience, but we don't have a speaker right now.So, there you go. There is Congresswoman, former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, back from her recovery after breaking her hip overseas, being greeted by colleagues who are excited to see her, and that's normally the kind of thing we don't get to see. You can see it if you're like in the visitor gallery in the House, but you don't get to see it on your C-SPAN cameras. It's one of the reasons why I do like this day as the elected speaker because more transparency the better as far as I'm concerned. We have with us as Dana Bash mentioned, a former speaker of sorts for 23 days -- for 23 days during the last Congress, Congressman Patrick McHenry of the great state of North Carolina, filled in as speaker. He was not elected per se, so he does get a portrait, but I'm told it was a very small portrait on the halls of Congress and he's here today. Thank you so much for being here. Good to see you. I'm going to call you Mr. Speaker, if that's OK with you? Is it? REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): that's fine. I was a committee chair, and I actually sought that. I didn't really seek the speakership.",

What is our goal setting? How are we going to -- what do we do first? What do we do second? What's in the first reconciliation bill? What's in the second reconciliation bill? Those types of things are goal setting that should be done between the election day and the first speaker vote. What we saw two years ago with Speaker McCarthy's vote is some people want to do it live and wanted to have maximum leverage there, with the only Republican intent, with the Democratic Senate, Democrat president, Speaker McCarthy had -- truly had to do that vote on his own.

That's what parliamentary democracies do. That was smart negotiating, and she was adept negotiator on that. We did not have that point of leverage.

He put on a lengthy post on that. Just moments ago, saying that as the speaker, he would commit to create a working group, he said, of independent experts looking potential waste in government spending. He also talked about trying to task that working which will create audits of federal agencies. He talked about using the House committees, the existing House committees to indicate take what he calls, quote, aggressive reviews, to expose what he calls irresponsible or illegal practices of federal agencies. Whether this goes long far enough, remains to be seen. This vote, of course, is going to happen on the House floor in just a matter of minutes, but some of those members who have held out for their support, including Congressman Chip Roy. You guys have been talking about others as well, have demanded that Johnson agree to changes over what they call structural reforms to the institution to go do oversight of the federal government, of federal agencies. Will that be enough to win them over? That's going to be a big question.
