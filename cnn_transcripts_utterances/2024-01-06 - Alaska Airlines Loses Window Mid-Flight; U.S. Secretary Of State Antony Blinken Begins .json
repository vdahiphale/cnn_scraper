Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KINKADE (voice-over): This was the scene after a window popped off the plane while it was midflight. The 737 Max 9 had taken off from Portland, Oregon, late Friday afternoon en route to California. A passenger said the window came off shortly afterward. According to FlightAware, the plane was only in the air for about 20 minutes before turning to Portland airport in an emergency landing. Here's how one passenger described the ordeal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMA VU, PASSENGER, AA FLIGHT 1282: So I was seated, letter on my seat, 18-B. And it's so weird to me because I guess I was under the impression the whole time that it had happened in the exit row. But it was actually behind me. So it was toward the back of the plane. I was sitting in the middle. If you looked out the window to my left, I could see the wing. So that's what was going on.",

The safety of the civilians inside Gaza will also be a top issue for him. When he left here after his last visit in December, he left the Israeli government essentially with a plan to come up with what happens the day after the war. We've got some of that from the defense minister, a three-page document. Phase III, which is sort of where the military is in Gaza right now, sees the north of Gaza as Special Forces operations clearing tunnels and that sort of thing. South of Gaza, it is still going after Hamas leaders there and also trying to track down the missing hostages. It's the day after, the fourth phase, that's causing consternation here is Israel and perhaps for Secretary Blinken as well when he arrives because it short on detail. It says that there will be a situation where Hamas poses no threat, that there are no Israeli civilians, that there is the ability for the Israeli Defense Forces to come in and conduct operations. There will be some sort of international coalition led by the United States, with partners from Europe, regional partners here as well. That will be the front, the focus for the humanitarian, the rebuilding. But no concept in this day after of what sort of Palestinian Authority or how it can be constructed, what Palestinian leadership politically that could be for Gaza. But even this three page document has come under criticism from within in the cabinet, causing consternation there. And criticism as well from politicians within the cabinet, that the chief of military staff has come up with a plan to investigate the failings of October the 7th, to try to get operational improvements right now on the battlefield. He has been criticized by right-wing members of the cabinet there. The criticism ranges from the day after plan is really just like the day, before it isn't strong enough. And the criticisms are that the military shouldn't be doing, this shouldn't be having the investigation right now like this. It's a toss-up between the military and the politicians. These are divisions. The defense minister has come out in support of the army chief of staff in that October 7 investigation at a military level. Meanwhile the key player in the war, cabinet, Benny Gantz, the opposition leader, who came into the war cabinet, has said that the prime minister needs to get his act together. He needs to lead, he needs to either focus on security and unity or politics. If you go the politics route, he is saying, you don't have security and unity. So even this plan for the day after, that Secretary Blinken is going to be coming in and hearing about, even that is causing division. So it is a weakened political situation that Secretary Blinken comes into. Yes, a long tough week of diplomacy for the U.S. secretary of state -- Nic Robertson CNN Tel Aviv Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The first one, as you suggest, is to try to keep this from turning into a wider war.To some degree, that is beyond the control of any of those he is visiting. The groups that have been launching these attacks are almost entirely Iranian-backed forces. Iran is a country in which the United States, has no diplomatic relations, he is not visiting there. All he is doing is talking to people who he hopes will be talking to the Iranians. When he gets to Israel, it is really complicated for the reasons Nic laid out. Tomorrow, it will be the three month anniversary of the horrific terrorist attack that led to 1,200 deaths in Israel. What you are hearing now is the sound of this unity government beginning to tear itself apart over the question of how to investigate what happened in the past and how to go deal with the future. On the first, it strikes me, it is really hard to imagine the IDF investigating itself. This really needs to be an outside investigation, a 9/11 kind of panel.

Secondly, if he didn't see them, why did they miss so much? Thirdly, why was the response so slow? All of those are considered to be potentially career ending for -- or prime ministership ending for prime minister Netanyahu so he wants to delay that day. Second, the arguments over how it is that Gaza should be governed -- the more they continue, the more it looks like the Israeli cabinet does not have a plan. The more it makes you wonder, what is it that they were planning as an end game here? I'm not sure they know.

There are other conditions that could be put on that aid. When you think about it, the bill already has aid in it for Ukraine and the Ukraine aid is heavily conditioned.

Here the justices have accepted a petition from former president Trump's lawyers to review whether the Colorado Supreme Court made a mistake when they removed Trump from the ballot.It's unclear exactly which questions or which issues the court will decide. But the big question in this case that has been litigated across multiple states with different outcomes is whether Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution applies to presidents. This is a question that has divided even judges within one state, Colorado. And this is a so-called insurrectionist ban. This section of the 14th Amendment prohibits anyone who engages in an insurrection from holding future office. But it does not explicitly say that it applies to the president. And that is one of the issues that the justices will likely have to weigh in on. The other big issue that's out there is, how this is enforced. Is it up to the states, the judiciary, is there a role for Congress? Right now they are not making it clear, the justices exactly, which questions intend to answer. Trump lawyers are framing this case as a request to return choice to the candidates and the voters. But the challengers insist that Trump's conduct in and around January 6th is exactly what this post-Civil War part of the Constitution is meant to protect against. Here is how this is going to go down. They have a briefing schedule that is pretty expedited; we'll see those briefs soon. And then on February 8th, there will be oral arguments, likely probably the biggest oral arguments of this. Term although there could be other cases that they're asked to weigh in on related to the 2024 election. Then they have to make a decision, putting enormous pressure on Chief Justice John Roberts to build consensus behind the, scenes and come up with a path forward, where, at least the vote count, whatever it ends up being on whatever decision they make, does not appear partisan. Certainly an enormous case for the court and an enormous test for the chief justice -- Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.

First of all, is it up to Congress to pass laws telling us how the 14th Amendment works or is it up to the states to figure it out on their own? If the Supreme Court decides this is only up to Congress, that will end the Colorado challenge, put Trump back on the ballot in Colorado and effectively end all the challenges we've seen all across the country. And I think the second issue is, does the 14th Amendment apply to the president as a, quote, officer of the United States? Again, if they answer that, no, it does not apply to the president. That ends the Colorado case. That ends all the other cases around the country. This will be historic, no matter which way they come out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
