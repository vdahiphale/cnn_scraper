What we know is that 10 people have been killed, and the shooter is also dead. That's according to the police. So, they said that the immediate danger is over, but they're still evacuating the building because some of the students have locked themselves in different classrooms during the shooting.

And that is the thing that gives me pause. But, there is a political component here too, which is that this is happening 25 days, as you point out, before the very first Republican caucuses, which then another week later is the first Republican primaries. We all know that whenever Donald Trump is vilified, and I'm sorry, and really made the victim, he benefits politically. And so, there is a real political consequence here to the Colorado state's Supreme Court, and then the Supreme Court acting, and that -- frankly, all of this elevates Donald Trump and creates a momentum politically for him, regardless. I'll just say one other piece and then I can't wait for Errol.

So, this was actually being marketed, and people were -- and it made me feel slightly uncomfortable that there was a kind of political reason for it. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if it's politics or not. It is plagiarism, or it is not. And in this case, it absolutely is. I mean, the original examples, I thought were bad enough, but the most recent kind of tranche of 40 odd other citations that weren't citations, including one that was absolutely shocking to me, is that she appears to have plagiarized her acknowledgments. There is acknowledgments in a paper which seemed to be borrowed from somebody else in her own department, which was really, really stunning to me. And of course, look, I mean, when they -- these people who are up on Capitol Hill, you have a difficult situation where you understand what Elise Stefanik is doing.

The people who are ultimately powerless, people who don't have a large reputation. They don't have allies. They don't have a big platform. They had (ph) to stay around. So, about a week ago, I said I don't believe to a friend of mine that Ms. Gay is going to go anywhere. I think that she is probably going to weather this, although these new allegations do change my mind slightly. But, you see a number of people who have been accused of plagiarism, but are kind of too big to fail. They're too famous to get dislodged from their positions.

But, we understand from Czech Police, who are about to hold a press conference, at which we hope to find out more, John, about who this shooter was, what his motives may have been. But, at least we understand for the time being a terrible toll as a result, 10 dead, 30 wounded, with no word yet on the precise nature of the wounds or how severely or critically wounded they may have been. But, this would have been in the afternoon hours when it happened, late afternoon, a busy campus in the middle of a bustling city. There would have been plenty of people around. What we saw on some of the images that we were getting from Prague just a short while ago, John, were first of all, as the shooting was taking place, students barricading themselves inside of rooms, seeking shelter on window sills, climbing out of windows to try and hide and cover and find safety where they could. The man himself very quickly eliminated. But, as I say, for the time being, no indication as to why he may have acted the way he did. And I think it's important to understand how rare these sorts of mass shootings are here on the European continent. So, extremely shocking scenes there from Prague. We understand that the Czech Prime Minister is on his way to the scene, as is the Czech Interior Minister. And as I say, soon a press conference in which we hope to find out more about what theories they may have had about why this man acted the way he did today. But, tragic scenes coming to us there from the Czech capital. Videos also, John, that show the immediate aftermath of people just trying to run away from what would have been scenes of extreme violence and presumably very loud gunshots. But, a terrible toll already this afternoon, John.",

Melissa Bell in Paris, thank you.Now, if you want to understand the state of the race this year, you need to understand there is a much larger normal -- much larger than normal number of third-party candidates running for President. Already, independent voters outnumbered Democrats and Republicans. But, in this case, one of these independent candidates, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he is polling higher than any third party or independent candidate in a generation. That's drawing increased scrutiny as well as prominence. Back to our panel. Guys, I'd be remiss to not note that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. just won, hot off the presses, the dubious annual honor known as the \"PolitiFact Lie of the Year\". I'd like to read you the citation. He said \"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign based on false theories is PolitiFact's 2023 Lie of the Year. Kennedy's political following is built on a movement that seeks to legitimize conspiracy theories\", going on to describe vaccines and medical experts and COVID-19 conspiracies. I'm acknowledging that. But, that is not the focus of this conversation, because I don't think you can make light in any way of the impact that these independent candidates could have on this election's outcome. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is polling very well. I'm going to show you a poll recently from Michigan, obviously, one of the key battleground states of this election. This is from late November, early December CNN poll, Trump in first place, Biden trailing by eight percent. But then, look at the independent candidates who are over a quarter of the electorate in this. Bobby Kennedy Jr., Cornel West, and other one percent, Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate got well over one percent in 2016, making up the margin of victory between Trump and Hillary Clinton. And then there is the possibility of a No Labels, the third-party candidacy as well. This is an unprecedented situation. You all know I'm a nerd about this kind of thing. But, the highest net percent vote for a third-party candidate over the last 100 and plus years, Teddy Roosevelt and Ross Perot at 19 percent. This was potentially much higher than that. So, how do you see this impacting the ultimate outcome? Michael, we'll start with you.",

But, in 2000 where Ralph Nader got 98,000 votes in Florida, which George W. Bush ultimately won by 537, meaning there is almost 98,000 Green voters in Florida who thought Al Gore wasn't good enough on the environment. I think that we all know how that looks in the rearview mirror of history. The question is, do you think the left understands that legacy, or are they going to walk into this buzzsaw again?",

He is by all accounts a man of deep Catholic faith. Raphael Warnock, an ordained minister from MLK's own Ebenezer Baptist Church serves in the U.S. Senate. And even though it's largely forgotten, there was once a tradition of sort of a social gospel in American politics where there was an effective religious left. I'm sure Martin Luther King, an example of that, even though it's in kindle. In the 1920s, there is Rabbi Heschel and Jimmy Carter, who actually, ironically, is our first modern born-again President, a Democrat, before the Moral Majority moved that movement decidedly to the right. My question to you is, is there a chance of that faith tradition being rekindled in a way that can make religion less polarizing in our politics today, make it more bipartisan article of faith?",

I think the difference in this moment is the sort of radicalism and conspiracy-laden politics that have infiltrated the evangelical church, whereas the progressive church still is more wedded to some of those traditional social gospel tenants. And I want to be clear, part of the reason I wrote this book is as a warning against political idolatry and political identity in the church, period, across the board. I think it's unhealthy. To your point, listen, if we were to have something of a ceasefire moment here across the board in American Christianity, and if actors of good faith in both parties were willing to not just selectively apply biblical principles as they might pertain to their partisan platform, but if they were willing to embrace a holistic vision of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and if they were willing to put that into practice in their politics, and let the chips fall where they may on election night, then that would be one thing. But, I think what we see consistently is that people in both parties have a very opportunistic approach to the intersection of faith in politics, and they are willing to adopt certain Christian doctrines when they are consistent with their own partisan goals. But, this -- the sort of thing you're describing, I think, would be wonderful. And I think it's probably unlikely because, John, here is the thing. Bad theology makes for good politics, but good theology makes for really bad politics. And that is a realization that people in both parties came to a long time ago.",
