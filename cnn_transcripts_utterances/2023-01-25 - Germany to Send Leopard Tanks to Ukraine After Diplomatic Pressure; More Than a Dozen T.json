This of course comes as U.S. officials say they're finalizing plans to send dozens of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, and as Germany now says it will send those highly coveted Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as well. This, of course, on the heels of weeks of very public diplomatic pressure, not to mention what's happening behind the scenes. Officials in Berlin say this could all be up and running, the tanks there, in about three months.",

The Russian ambassador to Germany says that Berlin's move brings the conflict, quote, \"to a new level,\" as Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says that Russia will destroy U.S. tanks in Ukraine.Joining us now CNN White House reporter Natasha Bertrand, also CNN's MJ Lee, she's at the White House. Natasha, first to you. I mean, the question is how this fits into the broader plan here given the number of tanks already deployed there by Ukraine and Russia. Is the U.S. view that this is a game changer?",

      "sentences": "In a way. So they view this as more kind of long-term investment, right, because obviously this Abrams tanks are not going to be hitting the ground immediately. It could actually take as many as three, four months for the Ukrainians to even be trained on them, so it's going to take a little while. But what we are told is that this could potentially be game changing in terms of breaking through Russia's defensive lines in Ukraine, right.This is something the Ukrainians have been asking for because they want to take that fight directly to the Russians so that they can take back that territory versus of course kind of striking them with the longer-range equipment that the U.S. has given them. They are still asking for those extremely long-range missiles, so that they could hit targets that are farther away. But in terms of actually a grinding fight that allows them to actually break those Russian lines, they say that this equipment could be game changing. And the reason why the U.S. has been pushing Germany for weeks, if not months to give them the Leopard tanks is because the U.S. also believes that this would be very effective in allowing them to potentially take back territory in the east and the south, primarily the south. So what we're seeing today obviously is a pretty dramatic departure from what we saw last week from the U.S., but we're told that this has been the product of a lot of discussions between the U.S. and the Germans to try to get to the same page.",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, we should be hearing actually directly from the president himself. He's expected to give remarks on Ukraine and this expected announcement of the U.S. sending these Abrams tanks at noon at the White House. And as Natasha alluded to, you know, this is such a notable reversal of position that we are seeing from the Biden administration.You know, U.S. officials, including officials at the Pentagon, have been saying for a while when this issue has come up, that these tanks are just so complicated. They are very difficult to train people to use them, not to mention the amount of time that it would take to physically get these tanks over to Ukraine. And so you have to look at this in the context of what Germany has been doing. You know, German officials have made clear for a while that they would only be willing to send these Leopard 2 tanks if the U.S. were also willing to go ahead and send these Abrams tanks. So it is an effort by the U.S. and the Biden administration to sort of spur Germany to act and take this action and also now other European countries that have access to these Leopard 2 tanks to also go ahead and send this kind of capability to Ukraine, obviously at a really critical time. You know, as we approach the one-year mark of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, I think it's so important to underscore how sort of consistent President Biden has tried to be in emphasizing that the U.S. is not interested in making any large, sort of unilateral decisions that at every step of the way during the course of this war it is really important for the Biden administration to work in conjunction with the alliance that already exists of countries that support Ukraine. And I also think Natasha made a really good point about how this shows that the U.S. is continuing to make a long-term investment because, again, getting this equipment to Ukraine is going to take so much time. So that also just gives you a sense of the mindset of U.S. officials as they look ahead to this war and how it is going to progress in the months ahead.",

That is not really what's happening right now, but in the latest few years, it seems that the tornadic activity has shifted to the east.And why is that? It's because of this, the Gulf of Mexico. And it's because the drought out west doesn't give up its humidity for the tornadoes in tornado alley. It's more humid, it's more volatile to the east. We should have 36 tornadoes in January.

But all of this from the Deep South, Gulf Coast, tornado alley here, Hoosier alley centered right over Indianapolis and all the way around there, and then Carolina Alley.Why? Because it's where the jet stream is placed. Yesterday, came down, made a big swoop through the Gulf alley, the south alley. When this happens in Hoosier alley, it's going to look just like this.
