The President certainly objected through it, but he thought that it would force President Biden to the table to start negotiations over raising the debt ceiling as the calendar gets closer and closer to a potential catastrophic default.The White House response, two House Republicans succeeding in their efforts to pass that bill, nothing has changed. But as officials made very clear, the Republican bill -- not only as a non-starter, but it will not set up a meeting between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy over the debt limit. They are happy to discuss longer term budget and fiscal issues. When it comes to the debt ceiling, their position is the same has been for months. They want a clean debt ceiling increase, that one off the table and they are willing to have those negotiations. And if it wasn't clear from White House officials, well, the President just a couple hours before the vote made it clear himself. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm happy to meet with McCarthy, but not on whether or not a debt limit gets extended. That's not negotiable. I notice they quote Reagan and I quote -- they quote Reagan all the time, and they quote Trump, both of which says -- it says I'm paraphrasing.

They do not want to do the same thing that has been done over the course of the last 13 or 14 years. They want to take this off the table as an issue, as a potential crisis, as a point of leverage from one party in government that holds one chamber in Congress. That means they are not moving anytime soon, which is of course, a problem if Republicans don't agree to put a clean debt ceiling increase onto the floor, which they have made abundantly clear, they won't. So a big question in Washington right now is, how does this end? Someone is going to have to break. There is no threading the needle or finding a pragmatic middle ground between these two positions. They are completely -- completely against one another. And now, White House officials feel like they hold the political high ground on this issue, they believe that Republicans will eventually have to break.

The circuit court in Washington rejected the former president's emergency attempt to block former Vice-President Mike Pence from testifying about the direct conversations. That order is the latest boost to the investigation into Trump's actions after the 2020 election, and likely lead to Pence's testimony before a grand jury. Trump could appeal again, or press the issue at the Supreme Court, but it's unclear if he will do either. Well, clashes in and around the Sudanese capital keep undermining the 72-hour ceasefire between Sudan's army and paramilitary forces. But the head of the army has signaled his willingness to extend the troops to another three days, and has agreed to talks in neighboring South Sudan. The Rapid Support Forces have not responded to the proposal yet. The current ceasefire is due to expire late Thursday, local time. Each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement. The fighting, now in its 2nd week, has already claimed more than 500 lives, according to the health ministry, and wounded nearly 4200 people.

But, as David McKenzie reports, even those that are still open, are struggling to keep up with the casualties. And we want to warn you, some of the images you are about to see are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A brave Sudanese doctor takes us inside a frontline hospital in Khartoum, filming over several days. Dr. Howida AlHassan and her team are barely coping at Alban Gadid hospital. They talk about ceasefire, but there is no ceasefire. The wounded keep coming in, she narrates. The same staff has been here for 11 days. They're facing a deluge of civilian victims, many with multiple gunshot wounds, wiping away the blood because the casualties never stop. My son was wounded, says this man. And I come because many hospitals aren't working. DR. HOWIDA ALHASSAN, ALBAN GADID HOSPITAL (through translator): I'm astonished how we're able to continue. We don't sleep. I wouldn't call what we do sleeping. I will call it fainting. We faint and we wake up again. I'm surprised how we are managing. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Dr. Howida says everything is running out. They are giving smaller doses of medicine to ration their supply. We use the equipment and the instruments more than once, she says. We can't sterilize properly. There are just too many wounded. ALHASSAN (through translator): Soon, we'll have no bandages, no medication, no anesthetic drugs, and no oxygen. The situation is bad with all the meaning of the word. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Bad, and it will get worse, unless help comes soon or the fighting stops. Sudan's Doctors Union says that more than two-thirds of hospitals are shot in the capital. Eyewitnesses and doctor groups say that hospitals are being targeted with heavy weapons by both sides, which they deny. As foreign governments speared their diplomats and nationals out of Sudan, Dr. Howida says that her conscience compels her to stay. ALHASSAN (through translator): I believe the numbers of casualties and wounded will increase after the foreigners are evacuated. God knows if we will be alive or dead. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Sudanese blood is one blood, she told us. I beg you to silence the sound of the rifles. David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's also a signal of how the U.S. views the Indo-Pacific, its priority region, as the U.S. shifts its focus to China and the Indo-Pacific region and away from the wars of the past and the Middle East. This is also a task of acknowledgment that diplomacy with North Korea has not worked. The White House has tried multiple times to create some sort of bridge or line of communication with North Korea, but Pyongyang has not responded. In response, the U.S. has increased its exercises, its military cooperation with South Korea, even as the North Korea has pushed the bounds of its military testing, its ballistic missile launches, and more. U.S. responding by showing just how close it is, and getting even closer to South Korea. Now, the U.S. hasn't said how soon that nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine might show up in South Korea, normally the movement of ballistic missile submarines is a very closely-held secret, and something that is generally very highly classified. But we did just see the USS Maine, an Ohio class ballistic missile submarine service in Guam, so perhaps that will be the sub making a visit to South Korea.

      "sentences": "Walt Disney Parks and Resorts filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in federal court against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The 77-page lawsuit alleges that DeSantis engaged in a year- long effort to punish the company for its opposition to a state law that bans the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.According to the lawsuit, the company's First Amendment rights were violated by Governor DeSantis, and there was, quote, a targeted campaign of government retaliation, orchestrated every step by DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech. In a statement to CNN, DeSantis' office criticized Disney and said, quote, we are unaware of any legal rights that our company has to operate its own government, or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state. The lawsuit is the latest escalation in a year-long fight between DeSantis and Disney, one of the state's largest companies, and it now heads to federal court where a judge will decide who is the victor. For CNN in St. Petersburg, Florida, I am Steve Contorno.",
