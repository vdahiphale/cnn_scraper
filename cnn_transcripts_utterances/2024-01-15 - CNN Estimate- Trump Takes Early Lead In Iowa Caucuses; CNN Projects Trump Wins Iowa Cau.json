Their choices could charge, of course, once they're inside the room and they cast this ballot.Right now, we have this key race alert. And Donald Trump is the early leader in the Iowa Republican caucuses based on our entrance poll of caucus-goers. And our entrance poll shows Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are in a tense fight for second place. Remember, this is all based on early results from our entrance poll of voters on the way into the caucuses. They could still change their minds once they get inside, so this might not reflect the ultimate winner, but it's a pretty good sense of what voters are thinking as they go to caucus.

So are you part of the MAGA movement?Remember, we said 53% of the overall electorate, according to these entrance poll say, yes, they are part of the MAGA movement. So how does that 53% split? Well, not surprisingly since the MAGA movement, overwhelmingly, they vote for Donald Trump -- 78% say they're intending to do so as they walk in, 10% for MAGA voters for DeSantis, 9% for Ramaswamy, and again probably not surprising, that Nikki Haley is down to 3% among this cohort in the electorate.  Then we looked at the white evangelical vote. John King was just talking about this Jake. It makes up about 51%, about half the electorate say they're white evangelical. That's actually a little bit down from what we saw eight years ago as an overall share. But look at this, guys, 55% of white evangelical voters are voting for Donald Trump, according to these entrance polls that. That number from Donald Trump eight years ago was 21%. He is more than doubling his support among evangelicals. DeSantis who made the big push at 24%, Haley at 12%, Ramaswamy down at 8%. Among the very conservative caucus-goers, again, this is about 51% of the overall electorate that identify as very conservative -- a larger share than eight years ago, and it's Donald Trump's cohort yet again, 62% of them are supporting Donald Trump. Remember, this is half the electorate, and he is winning nearly two-thirds of that half of the electorate. DeSantis 24%, Ramaswamy at 10% with the very conservative voters. Haley, again, making a bigger play for moderates and independents, she's down at 5%. And then look at how independents are playing here. They make up about 16% of the overall electorate. 16% of the overall electorate say they are independent. Donald Trump is winning independents. He's got 47, more than doubling Haley's total at 20%. She's basically tied with Ramaswamy there at 19%, and DeSantis is pulling in 14% of the independents, again, a small slice of the Republican caucus-going electorate are only 16%, but even Donald Trump is winning independents' bid.",

So what are we looking for tonight?Number one, you know, Boris Sanchez was talking to you from here and he said the turnout was down, anecdotal. I'm just saying it's based on experience. But if turnout is down here, that's bad for Nikki Haley and potentially for Ron DeSantis in the sense that the Des Moines area and the suburbs tend to be a Democratic. You know, this county, in the general election is plus 15 points for the Democrats. It's one of the few blue spots in Iowa, but it is where you find moderates. It is who you find the dependents. It is a place for us Democrats like the gentleman who was with Kate earlier. Once you cross over, you would find it here. So shorter drives. If you live in an urban area, a suburban area, it's a shorter trip you're preaching. It's still dangerous. It's still nuts out there, but you're not driving 25, 30 minutes like you might be in some of these rural counties. So if that holds up, he's in one spot. Maybe it's not like that the next precinct over. But if that holds up, that's bad news for the non- Trump candidates because this is where you would find your non-Trump voters. One of our voters from All Over the Map Project, Chris Love (ph) was just texting me. He's here in Black Hawk County in Cedar Falls. He sent me some pictures. They got a pretty good turnout at his precinct. There are several precincts. It's a big county -- the fifth largest of the 99 counties. Again, in the fall, this is likely to be a Democratic county, but there are a lot of rural areas where he's a Trump voter and loyal Trump voters. You have a lot of Trump voters out here. But again, you have a suburban area here where Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. If they're going to cut into Trump, this is one of the places they need to do it. He texted me a photo first of the crowd showing up and then a Nikki Haley supporter giving a speech. The Iowans, he's a firm Trump voter. He's not going anywhere. they love this process, and so he's being respectful. He sent me a picture of the Nikki Haley vote. If that tells, what does it tell you? It tells you pretty soon you'll be over here and we'll be watching the map fill in. If the candidates are giving their speeches, once they're done with that then they actually get about the process of voting. And so our reporters are in the right places. (Inaudible) is out here as we talked to him earlier right on the Nebraska border, southwest Iowa. This is conservative Trump country. Trump doesn't run it up, if we don't see big Trump votes, then that's a sign we've got something to watch. If he does run it up here, then the question is if Trump is doing what we've watched him do every time he's on the ballot, run it up in rural America, the question is how is he doing when you get into suburban America. And that's the test tonight. If Trump can do the rural area and then do fairly well in the suburbs, that's a big win. If they can get to him in the suburbs and DeSantis and maybe Haley can compete, a little bit of Ramaswamy in the rural areas, then we got down. We're about to find out.",
