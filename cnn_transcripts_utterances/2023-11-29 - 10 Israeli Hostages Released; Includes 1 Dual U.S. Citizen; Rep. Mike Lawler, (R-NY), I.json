Israel says a new group of hostages has been freed and includes this group an American citizen. Moments ago we saw the Red Cross convoy leaving Gaza and entering Egypt.The IDF says this group consists of 14 people, they're headed right now to meet up with Israeli forces. Forty-eight year old Liat Beinin is now the second American released since the start of this pause in the violence between Israel and Hamas after we saw a four year old Abigail Edan released earlier this week. Let's get right to CNN's Oren Liebermann who's in Tel Aviv and CNN's Jeremy Diamond who's in Ofakim, Israel. And Jeremy, we're starting to learn more about this new batch of hostages including this American dual citizen. Tell us more.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right. Among these 10 Israeli hostages who have been newly freed there are also for Thai nationals who have also been free. But I want to read you some of the names that we are getting. They include, as you mentioned, Liat Beinin Atzili, that 48 year old American citizen. She is one of three American citizens that a U.S. officials were hoping could be released as part of this deal for women and children.The other of course, was Abigail Edan, who has been released. There is still one other American woman believed to be held hostage. In addition to that, Raz Ben Ami, 57 years old, Raaya Rotem, Yarden Roman, Amit Shani, Ofir Engel, Gali Tarshansky and Itay Regev. I want to tell you about two of these individuals. First of all, Raaya Rotem is the mother of Hila Rotem, who was released on Saturday without her mother, despite the fact that they are believed to have been held in captivity right up until a couple of days before Hila was released. Israeli officials very much viewed that as a violation of the deal to release -- the fact that she was released without her mother, but it appears that she has now indeed been released and is on her way to Israel. The other person I want to tell you about here is Yarden Roman. I've spoken with the Roman family several times and her story is really incredible. She was taken captive on October 7 alongside her husband, as well as her daughter. But at a moment of opportunity, all three of them decided to jump out of the vehicle that they were in, that Hamas militants were driving them towards the Gaza Strip, but she was carrying her daughter initially, but when she realized that her husband could run faster, she handed her daughter to her husband, he was able to get her daughter to safety, but she was unfortunately captured. And now after more than 50 days of captivity, she has indeed been freed. I also want to tell you, Jake, about the scene behind me, you have dozens of Israelis who earlier today greeted those two Russian Israeli women who were also freed not as a part of this main framework between Israel and Hamas, but as part of a separate agreement that appears between Hamas and the Russian government. And they are still here hoping that those now newly free 10 additional Israeli citizens will make their way here as they head to this airbase in front of us and then on their way to hospitals in Israel.",

They came together in Washington to push lawmakers and the Biden administration to help them get their loved ones back. Coming together, they say not only gives them the solace of being among others who know their pain. But we heard them say that their unity around saving the hostages has changed, at least for now, the trajectory of the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUBY CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN, IDF SOLDIER: The beginning of the conflict, I think the Israeli government was more focused on going after Hamas. I think the fact that the families have come together, we each feel collectively that we have 240 new family members. And I think the success of the families being together and being able to unite around the hostage issue and getting the people of Israel behind us has changed the perception of the government of Israel, understanding that the only topic that the government of Israel is going to be judged by the population is how many hostages? How fast are they able to get them out? And I think that perception has changed. And I also think the United States and the people of the United States have contributed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MIKE LAWLER (R-NY), FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: Well, not only have we met with some of these families today here in Washington, but over the course of the last, you know, 50 days we've met with dozens of families, including when Jared and I were both in Israel. And I think the families have had a tremendous impact on making sure that this is a priority, both of the Israeli government and the United States government. And frankly, I think the administration has done a good job on negotiating with Qatar, with Israel, and through Qatar or Hamas to get these hostages released. Obviously, we want them all released.

And he has painted this picture of Hunter Biden. Let Hunter talk, bring him to the committee. What is the chairman afraid of? Why is he afraid of transparency? Trump has asked for cameras in the courtroom. No, they want to put Hunter in the basement so they can come out and then tell their side of the story.

CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is here with me now. Sanjay, a record high. What else did this report find?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, let me give you some of these numbers. And the bad news is the record high as you mentioned, Jake. So what does that mean? It meant roughly a rate of 14.3 suicides per 100,000 people. So just think about that. If you live in a community of 100,000 people in 2022, 14 people would have died by suicide in your community. It's not equal across the country but that's the sort of national average. You add up all the number of suicides, what they found was around 49,000, close to 50,000 people who died by suicide in 2022. Also, I found something really interesting, Jake, the last time it was this high, was back in 1941. So we went back and looked what has been going on in the United States. And that's a little bit of a reflection of what has been happening with suicide in this country, just to give you an idea. So you can stare at that for a second and say, OK, so early 2000s, we had a real low, and then it's been sort of steadily increasing since then what's been happening in the country during that time? That's one of the questions people ask. Let me give you a little bit of good news in all of these. It's not great news, but a little bit of good news, children and teens. If you look at the youngest people who were studied who are part of this survey, you'll find that actually over this past year, the numbers have gone down among 10 to 14 year olds, 15 to 24 year olds, and 25 to 34 year olds. But Jake, something seems to happen around mid-30s. That's when you start to see the numbers actually start to flip. And that's what accounts for most of the increase in suicides over this past year, Jake.",
