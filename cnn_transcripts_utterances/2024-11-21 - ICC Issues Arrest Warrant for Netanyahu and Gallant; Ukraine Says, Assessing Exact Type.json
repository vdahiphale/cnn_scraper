And breaking just in the last couple of hours, the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes in Gaza. And in Ukraine, Kyiv is assessing just what sort of missile was launched at Dnipro after accusing Moscow of firing an intercontinental ballistic missile at Ukraine. If it is found to be an ICBM, this would mark the first time Moscow had used such a weapon in more than 1,000 days of war. CNN has obtained these images of debris from the missiles fired overnight as Ukraine tries to determine the damage. House Republicans have blocked the release of an Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz, Trump's pick to run the Department of Justice. Democrats have filed a motion calling for the entire House to vote on making the report public. Well, we start with Russia apparently upping the stakes in its war on Ukraine. Ukraine's military says it is now assessing whether Russia fired an intercontinental ballistic missile during a morning attack on Dnipro. Well, video obtained by CNN shows the moment of impact. Ukraine says the weapon had the characteristics of an ICBM. One western official says it was ballistic but not an ICBM. The Kremlin itself is not commenting. Well, CNN also obtained exclusive pictures that show missile debris from the strike. A source says the fragments pictured do not necessarily all belong to one missile. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Kyiv. Here's what he had to say about the attack last hour. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And his Air Force have been more explicit, directly suggesting that. A western official speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Southeast Asia has hinted that this may not have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, just a ballistic missile. The semantics here, the capability, the range, how long it actually ended up being fired. Ultimately, though. I think what appears to have happened here is Russia has used a new type of missile in this particular attack. Their bid, as I say, of showing that there's more in their arsenal than they've used yet. I should point out this obviously had a conventional payload upon it, but much of the arsenal it might be reaching towards are delivery devices that may also contain or maybe designed to transport nuclear warheads. No suggestion that's the case, but that's sort of the subtext, potentially, of them reaching into ballistic missiles of this particular of this nature. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that's a -- you know, it sounds like semantics, but it really isn't. I mean, Russia does feel that. So, I think what Russia is saying is we are going to do everything that we can to signal to the United States that you are involved in the war directly. And so you have what did you have? President Putin, you know, just on the 1,000th day of the war, there's an announcement that the nuclear policy, the strategy of Russia, is changing. And that would allow - - it's always allowed Russia to respond to conventional attacks that are very major, you know, a threat to Russia, to respond to nuclear powers that are using conventional weapons. But now they're saying, if there's a country, and we can say -- let's say Ukraine, which is not a nuclear country, but it takes an action, it attacks Russia, and it is supported by a nuclear country, the United States, then that gives Russia the right to respond with nuclear weapons. So, we're getting into the territory of very, really direct threats here. And I think it's a very dramatic and very dangerous moment, because of not only the words, but the potential for this to, you know, spin out of control sometimes because it wasn't planned.

Now, experts say it won't make a decisive military difference in what Joe Biden has decided to do but it certainly, as you have rightly pointed out, escalated action on the part of the Russians, although some will say the U.S. and Ukraine simply reacting to Russian aggression.

The International Criminal Court accuses them of war crimes in Gaza. Israeli officials call the charges absurd and anti-Semitic. The ICC also issuing a warrant for Hamas leader Mohammed Daif, although Israel has claimed he was killed earlier this year. Deif is accused of crimes against humanity involving Israeli civilians.

And it's those laws that the ICC is using in its allegations that it has reason to believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have been involved in war crimes, and specifically they talk about the war crime this way, the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and crimes against humanity, of murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. This is very legalistic, but the ICC believes that it has the evidence to support this. What it means for the prime minister is the potential here of being arrested in any country that's a signatory to the Rome statutes because a country that's a signatory to the Rome statutes is legally obliged to detain the person who has the arrest warrants out against them and then transfer them to the ICC to face charge. That's 124 countries. Many European countries, the U.K., Germany, France, for example, if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now visited those countries, they would be obliged to arrest him and to send them to the ICC. So, these are the implications, the political implications at home for the prime minister I think are negligible. It's the international pressure that is continuing to mount up on him.

That's why he faces so much criticism here. What the ICC is doing here is putting specific blame on him for specific breaches of war crimes, crimes against humanity. What the defense that you hear coming from officials is that this is anti-Semitic, against the state of Israel. And I think there is a broad swath of people here now, and there certainly was back in May, who, when the ICC back then said that they might issue or was seeking to issue arrest warrants, really felt that this was the ICC, U.N. and other international institutions, don't get and understand what Israel is facing, that doesn't understand the predicament the country is in, and feeling that these international, particularly these organizations that have the backing and influence of the U.N., that they're against Israel. And that led, I think, to a sense of people, some didn't care, but a sense of rallying around the country, not the prime minister. These are important, internal differences. Absolutely, though, people here will use this to criticize the prime minister, but I don't think they're going to be in the majority at the moment, Becky.",

It doesn't do well to assuage concerns and uneasiness with people in Congress who are going to have to be confirming him. That's why you're seeing such a big push and really attention being given from the Trump team as, you know, J.D. Vance goes around with both Matt Gaetz, but then today, Pete Hegseth, to sit in on these meetings with these key Republicans who are going to be deeply involved in that confirmation process. Now, I can tell you as well, as it relates to these allegations, I would keep in mind that Donald Trump was the main person gunning for Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon. And that process moved very quickly. They had called him up to -- or down, I should say, Mar-a-Lago to have some meetings with him. And then very quickly after, Donald Trump announced that he was going to be his pick for the Department of Defense. Very little vetting was able to be done in between that process and during that process. And we know that they were initially caught off guard by a lot of these allegations. They now have this police report, and we've seen just as recently as today, Donald Trump's team is still sticking by Hegseth. They're saying that the police report shows that no files were charged -- or no charges were filed against him. And I've heard the same in my conversations with Trump people as well that since there weren't any charges, they're going to press forward and continue to support him.",

And at that point, the committee will take a formal vote on whether or not to release it. But Democrats across the board just see this as continuing to delay and potentially bury the findings. The committee had already delayed this meeting once. House Speaker Mike Johnson, is saying that this report should not see the light of day. So, there is a lot of public pressure from Donald Trump and his allies to not have this report come out. And we're going to have to see, if it really ever does see the light of day, Democrats are trying their own maneuvers to try and get this report out. Some Democrats are trying to force a vote on the House floor to release this report. We don't know if that's going to be successful, but given the very narrow margins in the House, it would only take a couple of Republicans to vote with Democrats to get this to be released. So, there are a lot of factors at play here. There's also the Senate Judiciary Committee is requesting this report as part of its vetting process of Matt Gaetz.

Let's get you back to our breaking news this hour, and Israel denouncing the International Criminal Court'smove to issue arrest warrants against its prime minister and its former defense minister, calling the decision absurd and anti-Semitic. Well, a judge has issued warrants for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant. The court said it found, quote, reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Netanyahu bears responsibility for war crimes, including starvation as a method of warfare. Well, the ICC also issued a warrant for Hamas Commander Mohammed Deif, although Israel says he was killed earlier this year. The E.U. and, for example, Jordan, say the rulings are not political and must be respected. Let's get you more significance on the ICC's move and what it means in practical terms. Luis Moreno Ocampo is a lawyer who served as the first prosecutor of the ICC from 2003 to 2012. Rosa Freedman is professor of law, conflict and global development at the University of Reading. Good to have you both. Before we get into the mechanics, sir, let's start with you. Can you just take us through what has been going on in the months since we got the news that the chief prosecutor was seeking these arrest warrants? I mean, these are controversial. There is an enormous amount of pressure on the ICC at present. The Israelis calling this decision absurd and anti-Semitic, others who support this decision by the ICC suggesting it is not at all political and should be adhered to. Luis Ocampo, your sense, if you will, just walk us through how we got to this point and the sort of pressure the ICC is under at this stage. LUIS MORENO OCAMPO, CHIEF PROSECUTOR, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 2003- 2012:  We'll start with the crimes, because it's very limited to the starvation part of the campaign. The ICC is not making findings for bombing or genocide. It's just a very limited charge, starvation. And everyone knows starvation happens because Mr. Gallant openly said from the beginning they will do it and President Biden spent one year begging to Israel to let food and water to go. So, the facts are non-controversial. And the legal characterization was, okay, it's a world crime of starvation and the judges said you cannot use starvation to attack civilians to combat Hamas. And that's very clear. Israel can stop this tomorrow, Becky. Israel can stop this tomorrow. How? If Israel starts today a real investigation against Prime Minister Netanyahu, the case will be stopped in the ICC because the ICC acts when the national country does not act. So, now go to political consideration. Israel want to stop this. Well, do the cases yourself. That's it.",

But some suggestion, certainly, that there is some signaling here by the Kremlin about its capacity to strike longer-range and across continents, correct?",

And given the very limited utility in military terms of using an ICBM, if indeed this was an ICBM with a conventional warhead, the employment of a system, be it an ICBM or an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a conventional payload, as we've seen, was probably done for signaling purposes.",

I'm looking at a week which started with Olaf Scholz or a decision by Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use longer rangemissiles, a call by the German chancellor, Olaf Schultz, to Putin for the first time in two years and then, you know, ended with the use potentially of an ICBM. The decision by the U.S. to allow these longer-range weapons to be used has caused some to become really very concerned about how this conflict is escalating. Does the introduction of these new weapon systems, both from the Ukrainian side, and indeed from the Russian side, tip the balance in the war in any way?",

At the same time, the Drug Enforcement Administration finding less fentanyl in the drug supply. Well, joining me now from Atlanta, the home for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CNN Medical Reporter Jacqueline Howard. This is really important stuff. So, can you just explain a little further what is behind the decline in numbers, which, of course, is very good news?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Becky. It does look like there are several different factors behind this decline. We know thatthere has been expanded access to fentanyl test strips, and those are the strips that you can use to test for the fentanyl substance. We know that there's been expanded access to Naloxone. That's the medicine used to reverse an overdose. But we also know, based on numbers from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, we have seen fewer pills containing fentanyl out in the U.S. drug supply. So far this year, as you see right there, five out of ten pills tested showed that they contain potentially deadly doses of fentanyl. That's compared with last year. Last year, the number was seven out of ten pills tested contained potentially deadly amounts of fentanyl. So, we are seeing less fentanyl out in the drug supply, but there are two things to keep in mind here, Becky. We know that number one, these numbers are just looking at pills, so not powder, for instance. Number two, there's still a large amount of fentanyl out there, even though the share of pills containing fentanyl has declined. We do know so far this year, according to the DEA, they have seized more than 334 million deadly doses of fentanyl so far this year. So, while we are seeing this decline, we can't ignore that there's still a large amount of fentanyl out there that the DEA is addressing at this moment.",

So, this is a very, very potentially deadly substance that we know is out there. And, again, even though we have seen progress in the United States' fight against this and against the overdose epidemic, there still seems to be more work that needs to be done.",
