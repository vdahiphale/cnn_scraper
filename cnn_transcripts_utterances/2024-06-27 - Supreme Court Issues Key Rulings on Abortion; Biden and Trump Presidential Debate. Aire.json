      "sentences": "You are in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Wolf Blitzer in Atlanta. We're following two huge stories happening right now. You're looking live at the U.S. Supreme Court. Just minutes ago, justices handed down several rulings, including a major decision on abortion. More on that in just a moment. And one ruling not released today is Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity. We're standing by for that in the coming days.Both those issues are likely to be center stage tonight in a historic presidential debate here in Atlanta. President Biden will face Donald Trump in a primetime showdown here at the CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. And America, of course, the world, will be watching. Take a look at this, a New York Times/Siena College poll shows nearly three out of four registered voters in the United States plan to watch tonight's debate. Let's begin this hour over at the Supreme Court. CNN's Pamela Brown is joining us right now. Pamela, what can you tell us, first of all, about the abortion rulings handed down just minutes ago?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, what the high court did today with this opinion, officially released, we should note is it essentially put the near total abortion ban in Idaho temporarily on hold. So, what this means is that women in Idaho, they can get an abortion if there is a medical emergency, not just when, you know, their life is on the line.When this near total abortion ban was in effect, some women had to be airlifted out of the state because providers were worried that if they did an abortion, if there was a medical emergency, that they could be prosecuted. So, what this does is it puts that law temporarily on hold. And we should note that the justices did not to go as far as to say federal law supersedes state law. And that's notable because there's the Idaho law, but there's also 13 other states with these near total abortion bans. So, this does not settle that. You see in this opinion released today, Justice, you know, Brown Jackson say, look, this is not a celebration. This is, you know, kicking the can down the road, essentially, because you have these other states with these near total abortion bans. It doesn't settle that situation. So, we could very well see this issue back before the high court next term and beyond. I now want to bring in our panel, CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid and CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. Paula, there are still six pending opinions. This is far from over. Tell us more about what we're expecting and when we could learn what those decisions are.",

      "sentences": "So, it appears that we're going to go into next week. There are opinions expected tomorrow and then likely on Monday. They have these six outstanding cases, some really big ones, right? We have a big question about immunity for former president, something that could be really one of the most historic decisions in recent memory for the impact it could have on presidential power.There's also this outstanding question of January 6th defendants who have been charged with obstruction and whether that law was properly applied, again, something that could really impact a lot of cases that have been brought by the Justice Department, including, depending on how it's decided, the case against Former President Trump. There's also at least one big outstanding question related to social media and the ability of states to regulate social media platforms. We saw the justices kind of sidestep a question about the federal government, pressing or flagging disinformation to social media companies yesterday. But there's another social media case asking a similar but different question about whether states can force social media companies to keep conservative viewpoints on their platform. So, there's a bunch of big questions, but one of the biggest ones is something that no one's really talking about because it's really in the weeds, but it could have an enormous impact on Americans, and that is the power of federal agencies, the deference granted to federal agencies when it comes to big questions in the government, and whether that power should go from federal agencies, to the courts, that is actually expected to likely be the last case we get because of its enormous impact on American life.",

And I would argue that if Jack Smith tries to take Trump to trial in October, right, that late, we're going to be right back here with another question about whether you can take, you know, the presidential candidate for one of the leading parties to trial during that critical period. I think it would just open up new litigation.But certainly, one of the biggest questions we are facing is this one about Trump immunity. But it is surprising that they have let so many cases wait this long, right? And that we're actually going to go into July, which is incredibly unusual. It appears that maybe they are having some trouble building consensus. Remember the Supreme Court is under enormous scrutiny for a partisanship, for questions about its legitimacy and its fairness. So, the chief justice is under a lot of pressure to try to build consensus, especially across these key cases like immunity.",

I think it's ultimately up to the chief justice to try to build consensus and try to protect at least the optics and the reputation. How you do that? It's unclear if they're able to, like we said, you know, put out a couple of wins for the Biden administration before walloping Jack Smith on immunity. It's unclear if they're actually that coordinated.But it has been fascinating to watch. I caution, though, a lot of these decisions, like the huge one we were waiting on abortion, is really a non-decision. They decided in the State of Idaho, but they left one of the biggest questions of the day, which is what do you do in the case of abortion when there are conflicting state and federal laws now that they have overturned Roe v. Wade? This is one of the biggest questions out there, and they haven't answered it except in the State of Idaho. So, even though we did see that unusual alliance there, the question hasn't really been answered.",

I mean, we've seen polls, their approval rating in the American public, which matters, is at an all- time low. And one thing I've learned from my years of sort of practicing law and covering law is they're human beings. And they try to make it like they're in that big fancy marble building and they wear black robes. And so, we are just sort of these mythical creatures in the sky. They're human beings.They watch us. I promise you they read the newspapers. They're aware of what's being said. They're conscious of reporting about them and they do think about these things. They do think about timing. They do think about how is this going to land. So, you know, we'd be speculating to get into the specifics. Well, why do they maybe release this or not release this with the debate tonight and that kind of thing. I think that's sort of an endless speculative loop. But they're human beings and they think about this. Chief Justice Roberts has made clear, and if you've talk to Joan, who is his biographer, I believe, that his hope, his goal, was that his court would be known as one that sort of transcended ideological boundaries, but I think really the opposites happen. And by the way, this -- the ethics scandals that have been brewing are really harming the court's sort of integrity and confidence as well.",

Whose vacancy or whose death potentially could cause an enormous impact on the election. If they're not even giving us explanations when they're not on the bench, they do not provide a lot of information. More transparency from the court could potentially help. I think it's reputation and trust in the high court.Because it really is astonishing. Pam has covered it. I've covered it for a long time.

We've talked with doctors there who are practicing a family medicine. We've talked with patients who are pregnant in Idaho.

The court said they shouldn't have taken the case and they sent it back down. But anything that touches on reproductive rights, the Biden campaign and Democrats see as a winning issue for them. They look at public polling. 74, 75 percent of American voters believe that there should be, to some extent, these rights.
