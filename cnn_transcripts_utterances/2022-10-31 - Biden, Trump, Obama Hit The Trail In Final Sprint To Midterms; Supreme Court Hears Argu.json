President Biden heads to Florida next. Former Presidents Trump and Obama are also lending their star power to candidates in key states this week. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is joining us. Jeff, how critical are these final pitches in these places?",

This is one that's been really interesting that we've been keeping an eye on for some time. Senator Maggie Hassan is a Democrat who is locked in a pretty tight re-election race, but not one of the closest. But this is interesting in a sense, look at the endorsement the former president tweeted out this morning on his own social media platform. He said he's giving the full and complete endorsement to a Don Bolduc. \"He's asked for my endorsement and he's got it, complete and total. His opponent is a disaster on crime, the border, inflation and all else. Vote for Don Bolduc.\" So we will see here. The reason this race is significant is because it does potentially hinge on the majority. Democrats face a big headwind next week, and they're looking at some potential challenges in some of the second-tier battlegrounds, that certainly is one of them. So both former presidents trying to fire up their respective bases -- Ana?",

Justices are considering whether some universities violated student rights by using race as a factor.

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, two cases today. One against the University of North Carolina, the other one against Harvard. The UNC case just wrapped, and the Harvard arguments will begin at any minute now.Interestingly, the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, is actually not hearing the Harvard arguments. That's because she recused herself from the case because, before she joined the court, she was on the board of overseers at Harvard. The Supreme Court will be considering whether or not to completely ban affirmative action at colleges and universities all across the country, despite the fact that the court has upheld affirmative action since 1978. These two particular cases were brought by a group of students called Students for Fair Admissions. They've been arguing that affirmative action discriminates against Asian-American students and whites in favor of black and Hispanic students. Now they have actually lost repeatedly at the lower court. This has now gone up to the Supreme Court. The arguments today. And it's quite likely that this solidly conservative court will end up banning affirmative action. We've heard from the justices in three hours of arguments this morning. The conservative justices leaning that way. In particular, they've been asking, why race-neutral factors aren't enough, and why colleges shouldn't rely on race-neutral factors when they're looking to diversify their campuses. One justice we've heard repeatedly from on this issue is the chief justice, John Roberts. And we know, in past years, in past cases, he has repeatedly been critical of using race in any number of scenarios. So it is all a question as to whether or not this court will ban universities and colleges from considering race at all as a factor in admissions. Interestingly, over the past several years, nine states around the country have banned affirmative action. And what we've heard from some universities in those states, particularly the University of California system and the University of Michigan. They say that, in those resulting years after affirmative action has been banned, Ana, they say they have not been able to achieve the racial diversity on their campus that affirmative action allowed. So these colleges saying, for the most part, it's been a detriment to them. But it does seem that this court is poised to overturn their own precedent and possibly ban affirmative action. It's something we'll know more in the next year. Their opinion likely issued in the spring or the summer -- Ana?",

Many, many years from now. The thing is, scientists aren't sure exactly when. CNN space and defense correspondent, Kristin Fisher, is here to explain. Just how worried should we be, Kristin? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Ana, these asteroids definitely pose a risk but it's a different risk. I tell you what what's more concerning is almost how they were found. There were three large, near-earth asteroids that have been hidden by the glare of the sun. Kind of lurking there. And it really poses a problem for telescopes on the ground that are critical for spotting these potentially earth, problem-causing asteroids or asteroids that pose problems for earth. You have to use telescopes to spot them. And so astronomers found these three asteroids. Two of them are big enough that they are categorized as planet killers, which means that they are about a kilometer or .6 miles across. And one of those asteroids is the largest potentially hazardous asteroid to be discovered in the last eight years. And it does have an orbit that could come close to earth at some point. We just don't know when. Likely many, many generations from now. But certainly could pose a threat down the road. And this is something that happened back in 2019, something very similar, where astronomers noticed a potentially dangerous asteroid, just a few days before it made a very close pass to earth. And so you know, Ana, we talked a lot about NASA's DART mission, recently. This mission to slam a spacecraft into an asteroid and push it off course. NASA was successful in doing that. But in order to make that technology successful, Ana, you have to find the asteroid. You have to see it well in advance. And the reason the discovery announced today is so concerning is because these asteroids, again, just snuck up on astronomers but would not allow NASA the time to deploy the kind of technology that was used successfully used during that DART mission -- Ana?",
