We'll look at how the country descended into out-of-control gang violence and a state of emergency. Then, trouble for Trump after the former president faced a skeptical court over his immunity claims. I'm joined by constitutional law expert, Noah Feldman. Plus, amid Israel's relentless war with Hamas in Gaza, the IDF says that its actions are proportional. Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham joins me with his investigative reporting that could indicate otherwise. And \"Io Capitano,\" a new film tells the harrowing tale of two migrants as they try to reach Italy. Hari Sreenivasan meets the man who inspired the film, Mamadou Kouassi, and its director, Matteo Garrone. Hello, everyone, welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ecuador has declared it's facing an internal armed conflict. Security forces have been ordered to neutralize several criminal groups accused of spreading extreme violence. Now, it comes after an extraordinary 24 hours that saw violence broadcast live on television after masked gunmen stormed a TV station taking staff hostage. Now, the country is in a state of emergency with reports of looting and explosions. The trigger appears to be the escape of a major gang leader from prison. Ecuador was once a tourist friendly, peaceful island in an unstable region. But thanks to the drug trade, violence has steadily been rising in recent years. Correspondent Patrick Oppmann explains what led to this point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As cameras broadcast live, armed gunmen take employees of a TV station in Guayaquil, Ecuador, hostage. The journalists are threatened and force to the floor at gunpoint while viewers watch. The latest scenes of out-of- control gang violence plaguing the South American nation. Ecuadorians say they are in shock. LUIS ARTURO BELTRAN, WAITER (through translator):  All citizens are afraid. Today there were attacks in Quito, Cuenca, Kibera, everywhere. OPPMANN (voice-over):  On Monday, Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, declared a state of emergency a day after the government said notorious gang leader, Adolfo Macias, known as Fito, escaped from prison in Guayaquil before his transfer to a maximum-security facility. DANIEL NOBOA, ECUADORIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The time is over for when those convicted of drug trafficking and murder tell the government what to do. OPPMANN (voice-over):  The government implemented a curfew and mobilize a manhunt of 3,000 police officers and members of the armed forces to search for the escaped gang leader. The gang struck back on Tuesday, raiding the TV station, taking police and prison guards hostage, setting off bombs and attacking a university. Ecuador had long been spared the epidemic of violence carried out by drug cartels throughout much of the region. But as a country has increasingly become a key trend shipment point for illegal drugs, heading to Europe and the U.S., local dings partnered with cartels have battled each other and the government for control. In 2023, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated after naming individuals he said were involved in the drug trade. And then the six alleged hitmen arrested for his killing were apparently murdered in prison as well. Villavicencio's running mate on Tuesday called on the country to unite to defeat the gangs. ANDREA GONZALEZ, ECUADORIAN POLITICIAN (through translator):  This is the moment that Ecuador stands and leaves behind political terrorism. OPPMANN (voice-over):  The country's president, Noboa, on Tuesday, declared several of the gang terrorist organizations in order the armed forces to, quote, \"neutralize the violence.\" Police at the TV station said they had arrested 13 alleged gunmen and rescued the hostages. As the government declares war, though, there is no sign the gangs are backing down. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It came down thatit was heaven for the criminals to operate, according with the system that we have for many years, for example, and that's very difficult to understand for anyone who doesn't live in either Latin America or Ecuador, you cannot have -- the authorities cannot have any guns in the prisons. And the reality was, because they were rehabilitation centers, you cannot have weapons. So, you only have people who were helping them in the rehabilitation process. And the reality is those were heavens where they were operating. And now, we are changing that because we need to create a new jail system for these kinds of criminals where the arms are not in their hands, but they will be in the hands of the armed officers who are controlling those prisons. So, that's one of the biggest change that we have to do is going to take time because you are talking about thousands of criminals that were operating from the prison. That's why the ones that are -- that left the prison, it was because of this decision they understood that that will not be a heaven for them to operate their criminal activities from the prisons. So, all those kinds of things we have to change will take time. But we have now, first of all, the legal framework, the unity of the country that support those measure, the whole Congress yesterday in an anonymous vote support the decision of the president of this new decree that it will allow the police officers and the members of the army to come back to their level. Another regulation that we have, it was originally and our officer could not shoot if it was a threat, but they needed to wait for the criminal to shoot first because it was only when they respond.

Trump's lawyers argued that prosecuting him would open a \"Pandora's box\" of indicting other former presidents for actions they took in office. The judges didn't seem to be buying it though, raising the potentially extreme implications of presidential immunity. Noah Feldman is a constitutional scholar at Harvard who testified at Trump's first impeachment hearing and joins me now from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Noah, it's good to see you.

The court should either say right away, we're not hearing this, which means that the D.C. Circuit's decision would remain in place, or they should say, we're hearing it, and they should hear it on the double and themselves decide it really quickly. In terms of whether they should actually hear it, it really depends on whether you think the court has an obligation to take up every question of national importance. I think this would potentially be of national importance, that would be an argument for them to take the case. But it's also true that they can just say, we have no problem with what the D.C.

They'd make sure it was really a crime because presidents don't want to start the practice of being prosecuted after they leave office. But here's the really perverse part. Trump's lawyer was making a kind of veiled threat. He was saying, if Donald Trump is elected, he will make up some very ridiculous and doubtful criminal charges and try to go after Joe Biden. I mean, you heard him say it. He said, we would -- maybe Biden would be prosecuted for not handling the border in Texas properly. That's not a crime in any way, shape or form. It's up to the president, as the head of the executive branch, to decide how we're going to police the border. And so, there couldn't conceivably be any crime even hinted out there. So, what you've got is Trump's lawyers saying, our client is so crazy that if he became president, he might charge someone else for what's not even a crime at all.

And that's a good principle and it's in our constitution. An impeachment proceeding is not a criminal trial. It doesn't go in front of a jury, it goes in front of the Senate. The standard of proof is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. It's not clear exactly what the standard is, but it's a lower standard than that. And if you're impeached, you don't suffer any criminal consequences. You just lose office. So, in all of those ways, the impeachment trial is nothing like a real criminal trial. It's actually -- impeachment is actually a political process created by the constitution so that the sitting Congress can impeach and the Senate remove someone who's violated the principles of the constitution.

The IDF says it aims for proportionality and precision in its military operations. Our next guest tonight paints a very different picture. Yuval Abraham is an investigative reporter for Israel's \"+972 Magazine,\" which is jointly run by Israelis and Palestinians. And he joins me from Tel Aviv to discuss his reporting. Yuval, thank you so much. for joining us now. Your investigation discusses the IDF's \"expanded authorization for bombing nonmilitary targets\" and the \"loosening of constraints regarding expected civilian casualties.\" Talk to us about what you found in your reporting and how that lies in contrast with how the IDF Says it's conducting this war, in your view. YUVAL ABRAHAM, JOURNALIST, +972 MAGAZINE:  Yes. So, I found three main things. The first is that the military completely abandoned previous protocols that were in place aimed at regulating the killing of Palestinian civilians. So, for this operation, for example, in assassination strikes aimed at senior Hamas commanders, sources in intelligence have told me that the military is knowingly killing hundreds -- several hundred Palestinian civilians per assassination attempt. The second thing is that the military is the military is heavily relying on artificial intelligence to generate targets for such assassinations with very little human supervision, according to sources. And finally, the last thing is that there is this concept in the military called power targets, which are targets that are hit not for their military value, but because it's a way to hurt morale in Gaza and to cause civilians to place pressure on Hamas. And my investigation on \"+972 Magazine\" and Local Call, it's based on seven intelligence sources, and I am continuing to speak to these intelligence sources also in the past few weeks.",

You said something earlier that stuck with me. I'm not a military expert, our viewers aren't either, but we've been watching this war almost 24/7 for the past three months unfold on television. How is how Israel is conducting this war? Obviously, a much larger scale following a terrible -- horrific terror attack of October 7th, but it's in an enclave and it's against a terror group it is very familiar with. How are they conducting this war with Hamas differently than they have in past wars?",

And they calculate the probability that a certain individual is associated with Hamas and the probability that a certain individual is associated with a particular phone number, for example. And they do so on a massive scale, generating hundreds of targets every day. Now, sources have told me that the military knows that these systems are not always accurate, and the policy is not a zero-mistake policy. The military has commented to my piece and says that a human is always in the loop with artificial intelligence. And I'll just give you an example. OK. I've recently met a source who has operated these machines and he told me that he bombed dozens of homes every day. And I asked him how many of these homes were created by artificial intelligence as targets for assassination. And he said, all of them. I just have to green light it. And I asked him, well, how much time did you spend per target looking, supervising what the machine created? And the source said that there were weeks, that there was so much pressure to create as many targets as possible that he spent 20 seconds per target, and the supervision was to check if the A.I. generates target for assassination is a male or a female. If it's a female, they know it's for sure a mistake the A.I. made because women are not supposed to be generated as targets. And if it's a male, they would authorize it because it's -- according to that source, because it's not 100 percent, but it's probable that this is a Hamas person. And in each one of these strikes that were being authorized, we have civilians being killed as well.",
