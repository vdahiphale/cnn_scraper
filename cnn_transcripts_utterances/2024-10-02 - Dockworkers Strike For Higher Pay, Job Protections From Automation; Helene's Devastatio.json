      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, this is a really niche industry, but a really important one for the global economy. This material called high purity quartz is an essential component for the microchips that we put in many of our devices, our smartphones, our cars, artificial intelligence systems. And this town of Spruce Pine is home to these two mines that produce 80 to 90 percent of the world's high purity quartz.Those mines have been shut down since last Thursday. And experts are saying that if these shutdowns go on for another week or two, that that could really disrupt the global supply chain for these microchips, which could lead to chip shortages, price hikes. And just to put this in perspective, I think many people remember back in 2021 when new price new cars briefly became really expensive. That was because of a chip shortage. Car manufacturers couldn't make new cars because they didn't have the chips to put in them. And those kinds of shortages, price hikes could play out across lots of different kinds of consumer devices if we see another chip shortage. Now, the companies that manage these mines say they're working to bring them back online. But it's not clear how long that's going to take, in part because they need people, they need employees to run these mines. And those folks have just seen their lives washed away. I mean, you see those pictures, people's homes destroyed. So really, there's a lot of pressure on both these companies and the federal government to bring these mines back to production and ensure the employees are in a position to start work again.",

      "sentences": "So we are just one month right now, of course, from the election. And a federal court here in Washington has just released what is expected to be the most comprehensive look so far into the 2020 election interference case against former President Trump.As you said, our team right now is going through this. But some of the things that we're looking for are potentially never-before-seen evidence. Like, for example, what former Vice President Mike Pence or former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told investigators. But this is really unusual. Of course, though, this is an extraordinary case. Back in July, the Supreme Court ruled that former President Trump does have some immunity from prosecution. And tasked the judge overseeing this case, Judge Tanya Chutkan, with trying to decide which parts of this case survive that decision. So the special counsel, Jack Smith, he recently submitted a roughly 200-page filing laying out what he believes his case looks like after that Supreme Court decision. Because, remember, the Supreme Court decision was not only about the types of charges you can bring against a former president, but also the kinds of evidence that you can use. So right now, they are making what kind of looks like an opening statement that you would make in trial to the court, trying to convince them that a large portion of this case should survive even after the Supreme Court's ruling. Now, former President Trump's lawyers have opposed releasing much of this. But right now, we are going through to see what new evidence or new details from this case are going to be revealed in this highly unusual and historic filing.",

And I would expect that the former president, as his attorneys have, he will try to argue that releasing this is some form of election interference. Again, this case is not expected to go to trial anytime soon.If former President Trump is reelected, this case is expected to be dismissed by his attorney general. So the idea of releasing a long narrative like this from prosecutors, highly unusual. And his lawyers have argued, as they really have in all of his criminal cases, that any effort to release additional evidence is an effort to interfere with the election. Now, look, there's no precedence for this. I mean, this is just this is just such an extraordinary circumstance. But I think that's what you're going to see next. The former president is going to argue that allowing even a redacted version of this filing to be released to the public is going to potentially hurt him in the election. And that this is part of this larger conspiracy that he alleges by judges, by prosecutors to hurt his chances in November. So I would expect that after initially we look and find the new details. I think that this is absolutely going to be used again in the court of public opinion to once again try to frame the former president as a murder or a victim of the justice system.",

They have a 30-day unwritten rule, a 30-day quiet period that begins effectively on Saturday. Right. Because you're about a month away from the presidential election. And so the Justice Department really would not be able to release any of this, you know, in the next 30 days. However, this is something that a judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan, has decided is appropriate for the public to see. Obviously, there's a lot of information. You can look at some of the pages in here that are redacted. There's details in here that will not be public. But one of the things that is notable in here already, just from reading just the first few pages of this document, is you can see the emphasis that the prosecutors have made on the idea that what Donald Trump is accused of here in this case has to do with private conduct. That it is not what he did as the then sitting president of the United States. That what he was doing was in his private capacity, in his personal capacity, trying to essentially steal the election that he had lost. And so that's one of the things that you see already in some of the language that is written in this filing that the court has now released. Again, just a few days before the Justice Department's 30- day quiet period goes into effect, guys.",

So somebody who was working in the White House from August 2020 on and that the Justice Department says to the court, this person is important in this case because even though they were working in the White House, they were there to serve as a conduit of information from the campaign to Donald Trump, the defendant.This person is not named. It is person nine in this. But this is the sort of person who would be a very key grand jury witness and then who would very likely be a key witness at trial. If Donald Trump were to go to trial as a defendant, some of the details that they're laying out here that they believe, the prosecutors believe Judge Chutkan needs to know as she decides whether there is immunity around Donald Trump. And they're trying to convince her there isn't. Because what Donald Trump was doing was part of his campaign, his political effort and not his official duties as president. One of the things they're saying is that this person was having conversations with Trump, saying these fraud allegations about the election could never be proved in court and that it was B.S. what was happening here. And then at the same time, Trump was talking to that person about putting an outside attorney in charge of the legal effort to try and undermine the election. That person ultimately becoming Rudy Giuliani. But person nine is one of those many, many witnesses in this investigation who are anonymized in this document, but who the Justice Department is telling the court, look into this. This is the evidence we have. And this is the type of witness we would have to go before a jury at a trial to say that Donald Trump was acting in an illegal way. That should never have the protection of the presidency around it, that it was campaign activity, even though person nine worked in the White House.",
