All as Israel's war on Gaza continues and fears of a wider war intensify. Prince Turki Al Faisal joins me, the former Saudi intelligence chief. Then, as \"Barbie\" mania hits award season, actress America Ferrera on its blockbusting impact. Also, ahead, Former Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger tells Walter Isaacson how Taiwan's recent election could transform U.S.-China relations. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we start in the Middle East where the crisis may intensify as the U.S. redesignates Yemen's Houthis as a global terrorist entity. Of course, all roads lead back to Gaza and Israel. According to the health ministry in Gaza, more than 1 percent of the enclave's population has been killed since the war began, including more than 10,000 children. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described it as heartbreaking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: What we're seeing every single day in Gaza is gut-wrenching. And the suffering we're seeing among innocent men, women, and children breaks my heart. The question is, what is to be done? We've made judgments about how we thought we could be most effective in trying to shape this in ways to get more humanitarian assistance to people, to get better protections and minimize civilian casualties.

      "sentences": "Blinken also talked about after the war, about the Arab world normalizing relations with Israel. But he insisted that Palestinianstatehood is now crucial to \"a genuine integration.\" A point that was hammered home at different events in Davos by different U.S. officials and by Saudi Arabia's foreign minister. Joining me now is Prince Turki al Faisal, a senior member of the Saudi royal family and elder statesman. He served for many years as head of intelligence before representing Saudi Arabia as ambassador to Washington and London. And he's joining us from Jeddah now. Welcome back to our program, Prince Turki. Let me start by asking you about this reopening the idea of normalization. This was apparently practically on the table before October 7th and has obviously been, you know, swept away in the interim. What do you make of this being raised now, seriously? PRINCE TURKI AL FAISAL, FORMER SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: Well, it has never been closed, Christiane. There were several statements before and after October 7th. When Saudi officials maintained that reaching a settlement for the Palestinian issue will lead to normalization and mutual recognition with Israel. As you know, that's the whole basis of the Arab Peace Initiative that the Kingdom proposed 21 years ago and Israel has refused to accept. So, that door was never closed. What is perhaps necessary now is instead of having Secretary Blinken lament the deaths of the Palestinians, maybe he should go forward to implementing the United Nations resolution that call for the recognition of a Palestinian State. That is the only way that the conflict will be stopped finally.",

You know, there is a U.N. resolution back in 1948. 181 I think it is, of the General Assemblythat called for the establishment of two states in Palestine, a Palestinian State and the Israeli State. The Israelis, of course, went on and established that state. The Palestinians did not. Now you can simply say we go back to a Resolution 181 and the Palestinian State will come out.

That said, we all accept that it is the United States that can pressure Israel to reach any accommodation. I remember when Henry Kissinger, in the old days after the Ramadan War, actually forced Golda Meir to resign in Israel because she was standing against his disengagement talks.

And we were almost there, and there was an announcement by the U.N. representative to the Yemen of a roadmap for peace between the Houthis and the legitimate government. But unfortunately, the Gaza affair upended all of that. And we go back to the original issue, which is solve the Palestinian problem. And that will open the doors for peace, not just in Palestine, but in Lebanon, in Syria, in Yemen, and in other places as well. This is the same thing that we've been telling the Americans and the Europeans since 1948. You have to be fair to the Palestinians and give them their state.",

I want you to explain that a little bit, because, I mean, let's face it, you all also have a lot of power, and there wasn't a huge amount of love for the Palestinian cause when the UAE made their normalization.

They got a lot of political cards out of that. And one of them was to -- as I mentioned, to push Golda Meir out of office and have the disengagement talks. Mr. Biden's embrace of Mr. Netanyahu, only a few days after October 7th, I think, gives him that kind of card to play. And as I see from polling done in Israel, Mr. Biden is more popular in Israel than Mr. Netanyahu. So, that should be something that Mr. Biden can play. As well as Secretary Blinken, and his statements about, you know, going to Israel as a Jew and not as an American had an impact on the Israeli public there. So, these are cards that the U.S. can use to push Israel. And they're not going to push them into hell. They want to push them into a peaceful situation.

And at that time, the president of Egypt and the king of Jordan made very, very clear that that was by no way acceptable and they wouldn't allow it.

And some -- one of them actually, a minister even recommended using the atom bomb on Gaza, to blow it off the earth -- the surface of the earth. So, that is one thing. But look what they're doing in the West Bank, while everybody's attention is on Gaza. There -- they've already arrested, I don't know, 6,000 or 7,000 Palestinian residents of the West Bank under whatever excuses that they have put up. They have killed over 500 Palestinians since October 7th. That is not a sign that they want the Palestinians to stay where they are. And I'm reminded of 1948 when we heard even Israeli soldiers who participated in that war talking about a deliberate policy by the Israelis then to create fear among the Palestinians by genocide and by murder and by driving them out of their homes.

We're helping brave Ukrainians defend their country so that we don't end up with Russia threatening our NATO allies and pushing us to the brink of a third world war.
