I'm Jessica Dean alongside Boris Sanchez here in Washington and this is CNN's Special Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.Just moments ago, an IDF spokesperson said Israeli soldiers had completed their encirclement of Gaza City nearly a week after expanding their ground operation into Gaza. And a short time ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken departed for Israel with the new U.S. ambassador to that nation, Jack Lew. Secretary Blinken said a main objective of the trip will be to find \"concrete steps\" to minimize the harm to civilians in Gaza who face on average several hundred Israeli strikes a day. More than 9,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack on October 7th that killed 1,400 Israelis. That figure is from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I do want to get back to what I was talking about, which is this idea that Israeli forces are really closing in, encircling Gaza City right now.But what's interesting about that is that even as they are moving into that Hamas stronghold, the largest city in the Gaza Strip, they are also still dealing with Hamas fighters on the outskirts of that city. And in fact, in the northernmost part of Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops initially moved in. We were today across the border from Beit Hanoun, which is the northeastern most city in Gaza City. And we could hear active fighting throughout the day today, both artillery mortar rounds going off, small arms fire between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. And so clearly, even as Israeli forces move into those more urban areas right now, they are still dealing with fighters on the outskirts. And part of that is because of that tunnel infrastructure that Hamas has built over years and years, dozens of miles of tunnels where they not only are able to evade Israeli forces, but where they can also potentially ambush them and we know that that has been happening over the last several days as we now approach the seventh day of this expanded Israeli ground operation.",

Mai, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate your time and you sharing your family's story with us. We understand that your mom and sister got to the Rafah Crossing. Your mom was on a list of those who were able to get out. Your sister, though, was not. And this is the fourth time they've now been turned away. Tell us more. MAI ABUSHAABAN, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN WHOSE FAMILY IS TRYING TO LEAVE GAZA:   Right. So unfortunately, as you said, this is the fourth time that my mom and sister have made the journey to the Rafah Crossing point and it's also the fourth time that they've been turned away. My mom's name was on the list of people approved to leave today, but my sister's name wasn't. Obviously, there - one is not going to leave without the other, so they went together and unfortunately, they were unable to cross. On my end, I tried to call the embassies in Cairo and Jerusalem. I tried to contact the State Department here in the U.S. And unfortunately, I couldn't really get a hold of anyone to give me some sort of concrete guidance or a direction to move forward. It's been completely just nothing short of chaotic and I'm worried for the safety of my mom and my sister. They're trapped sometimes without food, water, electricity, as bombs are dropping and flying above their heads.

It's important to know earlier in the testimony of Eric Trump, he basically said, I didn't know anything about financial statements until this attorney general's investigation started just a few years ago. But it seems like the attorney general's office is catching him in some contradictions. Let me point out one to you in this graphic we'll put up for you. The attorney states, assistant state's attorney general says, \"So you did know about your father's annual financial statement as of August 20, 2013, didn't you?\" And Eric Trump responds, \"It appears that way, yes.\" And the state's attorney sort of keeping up with that line of questioning, pointing out contradictions or seemingly contradictions through phone calls, through emails, through even a prior deposition of Eric Trump, where they're trying to show that he had knowledge of these statements and in fact he helped prepare them. So that's sort of why it's getting a little bit tense on the stand. At some points, Eric is raising his voice on the stands. It's a little bit more tense than it was for Donald Trump Jr. when he took the stand for about three hours today. He continued to still distance himself from any preparation of the documents, just like Eric is also trying to do as well. And then he talked to the cameras after he left for - after he got off the stand. I want you to hear what he had to say.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Many are too old. Many are too young. They're too infirm. They need help in the hospitals. Others are staying behind to care for them. And so what you are seeing is that the thousands of civilian casualties, over 8,000 are occurring as these military operations are going forward. And these are becoming ripe for recruitment by Hamas. And in fact, what you're likely going to see is that Israel is going to produce more terrorists than it kills.

What I'm pointing to is that the very effort to kill terrorists today can lead to massive civilian collateral damage, more casualties and these folks have families, they have cousins, they have brothers who can become terrorists tomorrow. And so the effort to kill terrorists today, even when successful in killing the terrorists, can ultimately produce more terrorists weeks from now, months from now, and produce a new, larger generation that isn't mobilized right now.So the problem isn't just the tactics of how you identify friend from foe. This is the narrow part of the problem. The bigger issue is how do you separate politically the population of the Palestinians who are not terrorists from Hamas, and how do you stop that local population from joining Hamas in the future. That's why we need a new conception, which right from the beginning joins the military operation with a serious political plan to have a pathway to Palestinian statehood. This would create a real opportunity, a real alternative for the Palestinian people. Otherwise, they've got nothing, no choice, but to end up supporting Hamas.",
