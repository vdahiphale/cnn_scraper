Meantime, in Gaza, officials say Israel has withdrawn from the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza after an operation there that turned an entire apartment complex, apartment blocks, into heaps of rubble. Officials on the ground say hundreds were killed. And to the south, this is some of the latest damage in Rafah. A hospital says an airstrike killed 10 members of a single family. Half of the dead were children; the youngest, just 3 years old. A U.S. official says American and Israeli officials will meet virtually today to talk about Israel's impending ground operation in Rafah. Well, vital aid is entering Gaza via new routes. The World Food Programme says the Erez crossing into northern Gaza has been used for the first time to get food in, while to the north of Gaza, the first aid shipment to arrive at Israel's port of Ashdod has also entered the Strip, they say. This map should help you visualize what routes we are talking about here. That shipment from Ashdod completed the journey in WFP trucks to the Kerem Shalom crossing, which you can see to the south of Gaza near Rafah. The reopening of that crossing at Erez so vital to allow more aid to enter the blockaded enclave. One person who knows that only too well is Sigrid Kaag. She is the U.N. official tasked with getting humanitarian supplies into the Strip. She is in Gaza right now. This is her fourth trip there. And we spoke exclusively earlier today about the complexity of delivering more aid and about plans now in their infancy for the reconstruction and recovery of Gaza once the fighting stops. She's in Rafah and, if you listen carefully, you can hear the buzz of drones above her. We started by focusing on the next steps needed to try and save lives. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

At the same time, the complexity of operating inside Gaza,in an environment where everything needs to be a given a permit, needs to be coordinated, where roads are in such bad repair that actually the trucks can't move. That if you don't have fuel, you have the best drivers in the world but the truck won't go an inch. You cannot collect under those conditions. So these are the elements that need to be sorted, for which we need Israeli either concurrence or swift approvals for this to actually be functioning. It is a complex supply chain operation, so to speak. But a lot of it depends on decisions. Today, however, a number of my U.N. colleagues are heading to Kerem Shalom to indeed make sure that we take and organize as quickly as possible the load, the cargo that's still there. But for us to actually have volume consistency is sustainability. A number of these other factors need to be addressed. And myself (sic) but also my colleagues are in constant discussion with Israeli counterparts in order to get this addressed and fixed.

And they told the judge that's because aspects of their identity had been out there and been made public. They raised concerns about phone calls that they had gotten from friends, families and colleagues, questioning their identity as a juror. So the judge deciding that, yes, this juror could be excused, bringing our number back down to six impaneled jurors. And prosecutors are also raising a question about another juror who was seated on Tuesday. They want to talk to this juror and question them about information they've dug up in the last two days that suggests somebody with the same name was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political ads. Prosecutors say that this would contradict what this juror told them under questioning on Tuesday. So that juror hasn't arrived at the courthouse yet but will face questioning from prosecutors and from the judge when they do. But ultimately now, we're still -- we're seeing the process that played out on Tuesday start all over again, the night a new group of 96 jurors has been brought into the courtroom. They've been given instructions by Judge Merchan and told that they -- what the burden of proof in this case is, what the facts of this case are. And they've been asked the question that all the jurors on Tuesday were asked as well, can you be fair and impartial? They're now going row by row, each juror of the 96, answering the question of whether or not they can be fair and impartial in this case. And once we're through that, that will eliminate a significant group of the jurors. You will remember on Tuesday that question actually eliminated 50 of the 96 jurors who were in the room that day. So want to see how many do say that they cannot be fair and impartial and are excused as a result. But once that number is narrowed down a little bit, prosecutors and defense attorneys will then have the opportunity to question the remaining jurors about their answers on this questionnaire. The 42-question questionnaire that asks things like, have you ever attended a Trump rally, have -- what social media accounts you subscribe to, where do you get your news from? These are all things that prosecutors and defense attorneys believe they need to know in order to seat a jury in this trial against Donald Trump. And look, it remains to be seen how many jurors we will end the day with. Again, we are down to six now, so we need six more plus about six alternates. But Judge Merchan on Tuesday did say that he hopes just have opening statements at the start this trial on Monday. So we'll have to see if these questions about the jurors who've already been seated, if that impacts that timeline at all.",

And it's possible he could be retried on the charges. But he's going to hail anything like that as a great victory. And even if he's convicted, of course, it will be because, without the slightest bit of evidence, President Biden ordered the legal officials in Manhattan, which he has no right to do, to undertake this prosecution. Trump's base is going to believe whatever he says or they already don't care. They've made that clear. But it's all aimed at that slice of voters, several percent of voters, who actually are movable, who really are undecided between Biden and Trump or may be voting for one of the independent or third party candidates.

There are tools that are being developed to cast shade over the Earth, to brighten marine clouds,make them brighter, reflect more sunlight, not to create rain. But this practice is basically trying to squeeze as much rain out of whatever is in the cloud. There is no such thing on Earth. There is no plane that can fly into an empty sky and create rain clouds or overdose the sky somehow. What cloud seeding is, is just putting silver iodide or even just saltwater into an existing storm front to give that water, that moisture, something to cling onto and turn into a raindrop. And so even if the UAE had flown their cloud seeders before the storm, they couldn't have made it any worse than it was going to be in the first place. There is no real science that it even works in the first place, because it's really hard to study how much rain came out of this cloud versus this cloud at the same time. But they do it to try, in arid regions, to get more moisture out of there. This is purely the result of that big, slow-moving front. On a much warmer planet, a warmer atmosphere can suck up more moisture from the tropics and then just firehose it in a place like Dubai, which was not built for the atmosphere of Singapore. No one was thinking about drainage or catching all of that precious water and holding onto it for the next drought. And so this is a warning and we need to heed it.",

And I'm looking at this little wiggling bundleof joy and looking out on a world in lockdown and had been covering climate and had a very sort of dark perception of the world I just brought him into. And so as a cathartic record of what was happening, just all of this seismic turmoil in the world and try to gather ideas for how to -- he should build his life. Where should he live? Is there a haven? What kind of house should he build? What will the food supply look like? But the more time I spent, the more he grew up -- there's my daughter, Olivia, who's 16 years older -- the more I met helpers and doers and dreamers, who are tackling these huge problems around our water cycles, around air temperature, how to build stronger homes, how to build, grow regenerative agriculture. And in the end, Becky, against my better instincts that came away with much more hope, much more wonder than worry where it's such a seismic time. And if we can get this generation plugged into their natural surroundings -- that's me up on a glacier in Iceland there -- to understand how our little decisions add up to big consequences globally and provide the tools for them to get through this. It's going to be tough, not just physically, practically but psychologically, how to think about this very tough problem.",

And right now, thecheapest fuels humanity has ever known is solar plus storage or offshore wind. It's why Texas leads the United States in green energy. The economics of it right now just make more sense than the ideology or the politics of the past. So now it's just a matter of changing the story. During the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., Dr. Martin Luther King didn't say, I have a nightmare. People knew the nightmare, he said I have a dream. And we don't talk about the dream of healthier, more resilient, sustainable communities, where people can still make a fortune but do it in a way that doesn't wreck an entire ecosystems. And to empower our kids with the knowledge that pulling together the great movements in human history have come when we look out for each other and people we've yet to meet. And so I don't know, just trying to start a conversation on that path.",
