The way \"The Washington Post\" put it, it was Stormy Daniels testimony on sex, lies, and money was risky for both sides. How do you measure success or failure with explosive testimony like that?",

The whole purpose of cross- examination is to set up your case. At the end of the day, you could talk about sex day, night, and in-between. Do you know about business records? Do you know about ledgers, ma'am? Do you know about invoices? You have no knowledge or nothing to share what that jury with respect to that, is that right? OK. So why are we here, right?Now, we know why we're here, because she provides the motivation and the impetus for the Trump team, right, to kill her story. If it gets out, that's the argument, the voters may, for example, abandon Trump. So they're overwhelmingly concern. But at the end of the day, obviously, right, it's salacious what she has to testify to. But does it go to material facts of the case? The whole purpose in my view, just my view, that she testified and they went after her, the defense did, right, another time, was for the ego, I believe, of Donald Trump. I want you, he probably told his team, to humiliate her, right? I want you to just really skewer her on the witness stand. And you really don't try a case for your client. You try it for the jury.

And I expect, John, that this will simply add another layer to the tensions that we have been witnessing between the United States and Israel over the course of the last week. When you think about the number of issues that have currently come up that have caused tensions not only between the two countries, the two administrations, but directly between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, we really are at a seemingly low point in relations between the United States and Israel, despite the fact that the United States continues to give enormous support to Israel in its war in Gaza. We have seen over the course of this week as President Biden made these very public statements threatening to withhold additional weapons shipments to Israel if it moves forward with a major ground offensive in Rafah. And just yesterday, we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister firing back, essentially saying that Israel will fight alone if it needs to and talking about this disagreement with President Biden hoping that the US and Israel can get over this latest disagreement as he sees it. There is no sense drawn despite these tensions that Israel is going to back down from its current plans to expand its military activity, to expand into potentially a full-throated ground offensive into Rafah, into those population centers that President Biden has drawn as a red line here, all indications are that from Israeli officials that I've been speaking to, that they are defiant in the face of this enormous and mounting US pressure. There are of course realities on the ground, military realities in terms of the munitions shipments that could be cut off to Israel here, but nonetheless, the posture currently from the Israeli government is one of full speed ahead.  No indication yet as to when that ground offensive in Rafah could expand into something much more significant, but we are, of course already seeing major impacts on the ground. One of Rafah's three hospitals has already shut down as a result of these military activities. We are seeing about 110,000 people according to UNRWA, who have already been displaced to areas north of Rafah and simply not adequate conditions for those people with many more who could potentially follow -- John.",
