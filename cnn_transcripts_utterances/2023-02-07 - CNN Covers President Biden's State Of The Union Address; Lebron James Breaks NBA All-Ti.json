There was a very powerful moment this evening when President Biden specifically praised your husband, Paul, who we all know was grievously attacked.

What it meant was that so many of my colleagues -- of course, the Democrats, but many of the Republicans -- have been very prayerful and kind about this. So, some of them weren't, but most of them have been. And so, when they responded to that, it had some authenticity for me. It wasn't just they're applauding because it really matched the words that they had said. And it was lovely of the president to make mention of it not because just as a personal matter, but in terms of what it meant for our country, that any of us in the public arena could be under siege.",

It is about eight points more democratic than the general population at large. So, keep that in mind as you now look at these numbers of the response of speech watchers. Thirty-four percent of those watching the speech tonight said -- had a very positive reaction to Joe Biden's speech, 38% somewhat positive, 28% negative. Add these positive numbers up, that's 72% positive. And if you look at that, compared to previous Biden state of the union address, you will see over time that 72% is roughly what we have seen in the past. Yeah, so, 72% this year, 71% last year. His first big speech, which is not officially state of the union, was at 78%. But he's right in line with where he was last year.

Right? There's a difference there. So, yes, he was not going to go proactively in that place he does when he's in a pure partisan political setting, but they played right into his ability to draw the contrast with Republicans that he has been drawing throughout his entire tenure, constantly telling people, this is not your father's Republican Party, and they did not like it was their father's Republican Party.

You don't get to see F-22 shooting down a balloon every day. But I think there was a little bit of frustration that was kind of blown out of proportion, and I think that they did not want to lean into that too much. And on top of that, I think there was a clear attempt to take the temperature down on China there. They did not want to amp things up, to make this a kind of (INAUDIBLE), we shot down your balloon sort of thing. He even mentioned, we will work with China in areas where we can find an agreement. I think this was Biden being, you know, I mean, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Seventy-one percent of speech watchers said the right direction, 29% said the wrong direction. But I want to compare that 71% to what people thought prior to the speech because we were able to look pre-speech and post-speech. And so, you will see here the movement of people who thought his policies would move the country in the right direction. Prior to the speech, 52% of these speech watchers said they believe Biden's policies would move in the right direction. And then after watching the speech, that went up to 71%. We see something similar on economic policies, specifically, Anderson. So, 66% of speech watchers said Biden's economic policies move the country in the right direction, 34% say the wrong direction. But again, the impact of the speech prior to the speech, these folks said -- I think it was roughly maybe 50% of these folks -- said that his economic policies would move the country in the right direction. But after the speech, that went up to 66%. That is exactly what the White House is looking for on the eve of a president likely to announce a reelection campaign.",

A challenge, not just for Joe Biden but the Democratic Party, more for the Democratic Party than Joe Biden, has been, in many ways, the abandonment of voters in the middle of the country, the abandonment of non-college educated voters. I mean, there was one line in the speech, I think John King mentioned it earlier, he said, let's offer every American the path to a good career, whether they go to college or not. I think that was a really important message because there is this sense among those voters in particular, the Democratic Party is basically an elite, college educated party that looks down on people who work with their hands, work with their backs.

And I think it is true for him.And I know that you cannot just get out there and brag on yourself. I think he did a good job. A lot of this stuff that the Democrats got done, sometimes with Republicans, sometimes on our own, in the last two years, you won't even see the benefit of that for another 12 months or 18 months as some of these infrastructure projects come on and people started getting these jobs. As we start reshoring, talk about America first, as we start reshoring some of these technology jobs, some of the CHIPS manufacturing stuff, you're going to start having people with a real reason to hope again and to believe. The other thing he pointed out was the manufacturing jobs coming back. We have growing manufacturing jobs here in a way that we haven't for two generations. So, there is help on the way.
