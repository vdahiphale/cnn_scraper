So we'll keep an eye on what the current first family is doing right now. In the meantime, let's bring in CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, when you think about first ladies, and you think about the modern, you know, kind of -- calling it the modern-day first lady but the ones that have been in office over the last several terms, Rosalynn Carter really set the standard and really made the mold for this modern Office of the First Lady of the United States.",

She would have an office in the East Wing and would have a staff. She was the first lady who formally asked Congress for that. So she definitely modernized the role of the first lady.She of course championed issues that were near and dear to her, mental illness. She spoke about it out loud. And she also, as Wolf's report there was just saying, she was an essential figure in her husband's administration. I mean, think about a first lady attending a National Security Council meeting. Think about a first lady attending a cabinet meeting. She did that with a regularity. And I recall being at the Carter Center over the years and looking at the exhibits and it is indeed as they were essentially co-presidents. Obviously the president had the final word here, but she was the political one. And reading back and studying about her life, she was the driving political force of this and she made no apologies for that. So it's almost unthinkable in today's world that first lady could be that forward, could be that political. But she in fact that was her life blood and she was a shy young girl. But she overcame that and certainly was essential to him becoming governor and then president. They of course were both from Plains, Georgia. He knew her since they were 3 years old. So really an extraordinary, extraordinary life. But there's question that she did modernize the role of first lady.",

It was of course a very different time. So that was not that controversial of a position for her to be so involved in the president's day to day meetings and so involved in his agenda and administration because she was not seen as being ambitious in her own rights.Of course there were many similarities between her and then Hillary Rodham Clinton, native Arkansan like you, Jessica, and she of course was viewed in a more ambitious way. So just if you look at the passage of time, Rosalynn Carter was much more involved in President Carter's administration day to day than Hillary Clinton was in Bill Clinton's. But certainly they were viewed very, very, very differently. DEAN: Yes. There's no doubt about that. All right, Jeff Zeleny, thank you so much for all those reflections and context there. It's so important as we really mark this remarkable life of Rosalynn Carter. I want to go now to Rafael Romo who is live at the Carter Center in Atlanta.

We were here on Friday when the Carter Center announced for the very first time that the former first lady was going to start receiving hospice care at home in Plains, Georgia. And at the time many people across America, the Carter family and many people across the world frankly were hoping that it was going to be a case where health professionals were going to be treating the symptoms of dementia.Many of our viewers know because we have reported it that she was diagnosed with dementia back in May. She was 96 years old. The former president Jimmy Carter is 99 years old. He was put in home hospice care back in February. So everybody was hoping and expecting that it would be a case where she was going to be just made comfortable, treat the symptoms of dementia. But those hopes vanished not too long ago when the Carter Center here announced that former First Lady Rosalynn Carter had died at the age of 96. And she is being described, Jessica, by the Carter Center as a passionate champion of mental health, caregiving and women's rights. There's also as you mentioned before a statement from the former president himself saying that Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. He also said that she gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me. And it is just amazing to remember, Jessica, that not too long ago, just before the former president's birthday in October, the couple visited a local festival in Plains, Georgia. It was a surprise visit. Nobody was expecting that, given the state of health that they're both in, but they managed to do that. It was very significant for people who attended there. And also just to think about the role that she played not only here in the United States but around the world. Myself having travelled to different parts of the world to cover news especially in places like Latin America where she is remembered equally fondly with former President Carter as a champion for democracy, helping people there establish very trustworthy institution advancing the cause of democracy there as well. So she will be remembered by many people, like I said before, not only here in the United States but also around the world -- Jessica.",

Julian can talk about first ladies. Really after Eleanor Roosevelt, we had decades in which first ladies were mostly out of the public eye or at most involved in very ceremonial causes.And she was someone who, you know, long before Hillary Clinton, long before Michelle Obama, who was seen as someone with her sleeves rolled up, engaged in many of the same political and diplomatic in many cases worked as her husband. And as you point out, identifying with this cause which had even more stigma than now was really a reflection of her character and her strength when there was something that mattered to her, she was not at all deterred by what conventional precedent had been and I think she was a very good example of that.",

But then you had a real quiet period in terms of a first lady being so active. She was active as an adviser to her husband. She was active on a diplomatic mission to Central and South America where she was meeting with key figures and being part of a process to rebuild relations in the region.She was important in the campaigns, not only as an adviser but in 1976 as part of the campaign, the Carter family was part of what they sold.

So you have there in Georgia, a lot -- you know, we've talked a lot about her moment in the White House. But so much -- most of her life was obviously outside of the White House. And it was mostly in Plains, Georgia. What should people know about the person she was, the family that she had, and what meant something to her? BILL NIGUT, CO-HOST, \"POLITICALLY GEORGIA\" FOR AJC AND WABE 90.1: Well, Jessica, if you will allow me, I'd like to first make clear that we talked a lot about how Mrs. Carter fought mental illness and how it needed to be treated. She was a lifelong fighter for better services. And one of the things that she cared about most was having insurers provide the same coverage for people with mental illnesses and addiction that they gave to other health problems. And she held a series of mental health symposiums at the Carter Center. And in one of them in 2013, Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius in fact said that the federal government was establishing just that new rule. That people with mental illnesses deserve the same coverage from their insurers as people with, say, cancer or other diseases. And Mrs. Carter believed that that rule would help destigmatize people with mental illnesses. Now that unfortunately hasn't really come to pass. And right here in Georgia, the state has been struggling to improve its mental health services, it has been one of the worst in the country in providing help for people who need it. They're getting better here in Georgia, but Mrs. Carter had some substantive successes that I thought were really important to point out in this conversation.",

I believe his governor's race was against Lester Maddox in the south.And, you know, they kind of presented themselves as figures of tradition who nonetheless accepted and did not fight against the way society had changed in the '60s and early '70s in the same that Nixon was seen as resisting those cultural changes. And they were kind of a hopeful turning of the page I think in the way that they kind of blended what America had been with what America was becoming. And in many ways, you know, that is still the fight we are having between the forces that -- the portions of society that are comfortable the way we are changing and those that are not. And I think the Carters, although he certainly had his difficulties as president, of course as a one-term presidents in many ways were an important cultural symbol. It was going to be all right.

And seven months into this conflict, it has not received the attention from the world that it should. How much does access to that region play into that? We just saw you struggling to get in there. ELBAGIR (live)from bad actors (ph) across the conflicts that we cover is that the communications network is usually the first thing that they target. And we're seeing this in Sudan, that it's very difficult to call in. It's very difficult to get any kind of reliable information. And it's incredibly dangerous. And it's reaching a point where, in Sudan especially, as we're hearing and investigating these reports, that the violence that is being meeted out there really has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Refugees are telling us, when they cross over to a safe haven, that they are being stopped from leaving. It is so incredibly difficult, which is why the people that we spoke to for this documentary -- honestly, Jessica, I really can't imagine what it feels like to take that kind of a risk. To be willing to put yourself in danger, after everything that they have been through, because they want the world to know what's happening. They wanted to take this opportunity, Jessica.",

Because one day, we were crossing back to where we were staying in Port Sudan, and someone shouted out of a window. And it was, actually, one of my mom's cousins, and he wanted to tell me that another relative had passed away. So, there were these horrible moments, where, you know, I was kind of pulled out of the distance that I always try and maintain to cover these stories. But, at the same time, I think it's an important thing for us, as journalists, to sometimes have that experience. To know what people risk. To know what people go through to talk to us. To know what it's like to see the places that you love and know destroyed. I wouldn't recommend it. But I think it -- I hope that it comes across to the audience in the way that we told the story.",
