Wonder Woman, will join me live find out why Wonder Woman herself is putting her power behind Kamala Harris.But first joining me here is Congressman Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat. Congressman, thanks very much for joining us this morning. Really appreciate it. As you know, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a key battleground state. We saw the candidates crisscrossing Pennsylvania over the weekend. How -- how is your assessment of the race right now? Has Kamala Harris made up some -- some ground in Pennsylvania versus the President? REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): Yes, it's been a -- a pretty remarkable 29 days from that remarkable early afternoon on a Sunday when -- when President Biden shocked the -- the political world and did something that no other president had done in our lifetime. I think since then, you have seen a surge of enthusiasm. You can sense it here. It is palpable among the delegates and my colleagues in Congress. Now, in terms of Pennsylvania, I've always said, whoever wins our state will be the next president. 2016 Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania by 0.5 or 1 percent and was elected president. Joe Biden won it by 1 percent in 2020. The election were held today, I think would be very close. I think Kamala Harris would win it. But again, I expect Pennsylvania will be a one point race.",
