The National Weather Service says it was an EF-2 tornado that ripped through here with winds of up to 135 miles per hour. And this is the devastation and what is left behind when a storm of that magnitude kind of rips through a neighborhood like this.And you just see a pile of cars here, four cars and trucks piled up against one another. We have seen dozens of homes and residents who have spent the last 24 hours cleaning up, essentially just starting to build piles of debris that will have to be hauled away. So it's been a very intense time here. Emergency officials say in this area of Valley View, there were seven people who were killed, Bianna, including four children. And one of those was a mother who was with her two children. Then there was a five-year-old and a two-year-old who were found. The sheriff told me, said they had they had found -- rescue teams had found them in a field around here on ATV machines. So just horrific stories that came out of this storm. And many of the residents, we said that we had spoken to were trying to desperately figure out a way to protect themselves in a nearby convenience store. There were more than 100 people gathered inside. Walls collapsed. They had to be rescued out of there as well. So it's just a simply a devastating storm that we've seen rip through here in darkness on Saturday night, a treacherous scene. And the cleanup continues here today. Bianna?",

ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Bianna. Scary incidents occurring in Massachusetts over the weekend. Well, police say these four girls between the ages of nine and 17 were attacked without warning, unprovoked at this AMC movie theater in Braintree. They were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and are being treated there. The hospital is in the Boston area. Our affiliate, WBZ spoke with a witness.

They were also taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Now, a suspect in the McDonald's stabbings, 26-year-old Jared Ravizza saw was arrested 15 minutes after fleeing the scene. He is now facing multiple charges according to the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office, including assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was also being treated at a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and is expected to appear in court on Tuesday, but some of the details of this incident are really frightening. Prosecutors allege Ravizza arrived at the scene of the McDonald's stabbings in a black Porsche Macan SUV. This was similar to a vehicle that had been seen at the site of the movie theater. Surveillance footage from the McDonald's appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-thru window and stab the male victim with a large knife. Then the video shows the suspect park his car, enter the restaurant, and stabbed the female victim before fleeing in the car. Police say that while the two attacks happened about an hour apart, it appears as though the crimes are related. Preliminary investigation is showing that, but this investigation is active and ongoing according to state and local police. Meanwhile, there was more violence in Connecticut. State Police there say a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River has been taken into custody in Massachusetts. Now, police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut death investigation was connected to these stabbings in Massachusetts, but still a series of scary events occurring over the course of the weekend.",
