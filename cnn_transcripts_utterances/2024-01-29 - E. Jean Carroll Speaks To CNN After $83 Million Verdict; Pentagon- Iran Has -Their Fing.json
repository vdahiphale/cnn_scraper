The duo published their findings, today, in a science journal. It's a great mystery where great white sharks give birth to their pups. And seeing one swim in the ocean like this is extraordinary.

Jean Carroll, in her first CNN interview, since her $83 million victory against Donald Trump, what she says she plans to do with the money, and what it was like to come face-to-face, with the man found liable, for sexually assaulting her. Also tonight, the three U.S. soldiers killed in a drone attack, all from the same Army post in Georgia, as the Pentagon says Iran's fingerprints are on the strike, and President Biden is preparing to respond, tonight. Also, a scandal that has engulfed the United Nations agency, bringing life-saving aid into Gaza, as a dozen U.N. staffers, accused of helping Hamas, carry out its attack on Israel. Now, major countries are suspending their funding, with Gazans on the brink of starvation. I am Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, as another major decision is looming, for Donald Trump's finances, there is a very real possibility that he could be on the hook, for half a billion dollars, in court judgments, by the end of this week. The judge, in his New York civil fraud trial, is expected to rule, very soon, deciding whether Trump owes hundreds of millions of dollars, after he was found liable for business fraud. Tonight, the former President is still reeling, after the last court decision. He's been lashing out in his rallies, and on social media, about all kinds of grievances, but notably, not one that he had been mentioning, repeatedly, on a daily basis before. That's E. Jean Carroll. Perhaps now he has 83 million reasons to think twice about doing so. His attorney however, is speaking about the case. Alina Habba has sent a letter, to a judge, who is presiding over the defamation case, tonight, accusing Judge Lewis Kaplan, of having a conflict of interest, with Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan. Two Kaplans, I should note, as they stressed repeatedly, as this trial was going on, are not related. But that's not what Trump's legal team is arguing about. That's not what they have. More on what they are saying, in this new filing, in a moment. But first tonight, to the first CNN interview, my colleagues, Poppy Harlow and Phil Mattingly, spoke with E. Jean Carroll, and Roberta Kaplan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POPPY HARLOW, CNN CO-ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING: What was it like to be with Donald Trump in that courtroom? He did not attend your first trial. But he was there, when it came down to the money, and what it would cost him. You hadn't seen him since 1996. E. JEAN CARROLL, WON SEXUAL ABUSE, DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP: I hadn't seen him since he assaulted me in the dressing room. And preparing to see him was terrifying. The days leading up, as Robbie brought me around stronger and stronger, it was so -- I hadn't slept. I hadn't eaten. I couldn't think. I lost my language, when she was trying to prepare me to go to do testimony, in front of Donald Trump. And then, when we were in the courtroom, and Robbie went to the lectern, she said, good morning, E. Jean. Please state your name and spell it for the jury, for the court. And there he was. And he was nothing. He was -- just no power. He had -- he was zero. That was -- I was flabbergasted. And from then on, we just sailed through it. She brought me in. She said, say your name, and I just looked at Robbie, saw he was nothing, and it came out from there.",

But the reality is Gaza also shares a border with Egypt. What's Egypt's plan for Hamas? What's Egypt's plan for all these Palestinians? Everyone is worried, as I am, about the future of these Palestinian civilians. Why not let them out of southern Gaza? Why not let some of them get into Egypt? What -- like, there's over 20 countries in the Arab world that expressed horror about what's happening in Gaza. Clearly, the infrastructure that's in place in Gaza cannot sustain protecting these civilians, from the horrors of Hamas. In fact, Hamas is controlling these resources.
