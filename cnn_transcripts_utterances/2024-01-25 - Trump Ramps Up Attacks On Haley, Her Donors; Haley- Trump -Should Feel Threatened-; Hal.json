Trump is furiouswith his last remaining rival Nikki Haley and the donors sustaining her. Plus, right now, President Biden is on his way to Wisconsin where he'll tout his record on infrastructure and the economy. Biden flipped Wisconsin in 2020 and he will almost certainly need it if he wants to win again in November. And Donald Trump once again looms over Capitol Hill. The former President is pressuring Republicans to reject any immigration deal in order to deny Joe Biden a political win. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Thursday, January 25. There are nine days until the South Carolina Democratic primary, 30 days until the Republican contest there. There are only 284 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. From attacks to threats, Donald Trump is so angry he is now promising retribution against Republicans who give Nikki Haley money to help her keep running against him in the Republican primary. Sources tell CNN that Trump is becoming increasingly angry with Haley for refusing to drop out, with one person close to the former President saying \"Before she was a gnat, now she is an enemy, and Trump plans to bludgeon her in the lead up to South Carolina.\" Trump is threatening to blacklist her donors, posting that \"Anyone that makes a \"Contribution\" to Birdbrain\", again, that's his word for Haley, \"from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them.\" So far, Haley is not backing down in the face of Trump's threats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump got out there and just threw a temper tantrum. He pitched a fit. He was insulting. He was doing what he does, but I know that's what he does when he is insecure. I know that's what he does when he is threatened. And he should feel threatened without a doubt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

SarahMatthews was Deputy Press Secretary in the Trump administration. She was also a spokesperson for Trump's 2020 campaign. Margaret Talev, Senior Contributor for Axios, and Kristen Holmes, CNN U.S. National Correspondent, who covers the Trump campaign for us. Thank you all for being here. Sarah, I do want to just start with what we saw you tweet earlier -- or sorry, last night. You screenshotted the donation that you sent to Nikki Haley's campaigns, had done joining me in donating to Nikki Haley here. You obviously already comfortable being on the blacklist. SARAH MATTHEWS, FMR. DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY FOR PRES. TRUMP: Yeah. Permanently barred from MAGA camp. I feel like I already am. But, I encourage others to go out and do so too, because that's a ridiculous statement from Trump to say that he doesn't need those supporters, because he does need her supporters, many of them moderate Republicans and independents who he would need in a general election if he is the Republican nominee. And so, I think it's kind of reminiscent of what we saw in Arizona when Kari Lake ran for governor there. And she said, I don't want McCain voters. And look how that turned out for her. So, he needs all the voters he can get. And I encourage others to donate to Nikki as well, just as I did.",

I mean, they're looking at that. They've been looking at that. So, that's one part of this. The other part of this is that this is deeply personal right now. Donald Trump is clearly lashing out. He is attacking her. They're telling him that he is going to win South Carolina and by big margins. They have that infrastructure on the ground there. But, he has been leading by 30 points. So, it's not as though she should feel threatened by her in South Carolina. A lot of this is the fact that he doesn't want to prolong this. He wanted to move on. He wanted to be the winner and just go forward. And now he is annoyed that he doesn't get to do that and he has to continue putting on this campaign. MARGARET TALEV, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS, &amp; DIRECTOR, DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM &amp; CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE AT SYRACUSE UNIV.: Yeah. I do think that's what's going on here. It's funny, because both Trump and President Biden have said, essentially, the primary is over. Now, we're in the general election. But, these are general -- these are primary election campaign tactics. And I think it looks to me like what he is trying to do is, has less to do with Nikki Haley than it has to do with anyone in Congress who hasn't already endorsed him, anyone out there who is thinking about speaking out against him who is a Republican or a Republican leaner. He wants to see how many more people will fall into line the same way that sort of DeSantis and Tim Scott and all these other folks have. You can't campaign this way in the general election unless you really think the Democratic turnout is going to be so low and independent turnout is going to be so low that all you have to do is enthuse your base.",

But, you're seeing again -- I mean, I spent the entire Trump administration being asked by -- I was up on the Hill. So, people are always asking me like, when are Republicans going to stand up to Trump? When are Republicans going to stand up to Trump? And it just never happened. It feels like we're seeing that again this time. And even when I talk to Nikki Haley supporters kind of behind the scenes, I'll say, well, she does have this path. Like we might be able to work at this way or that way. And while I acknowledge -- I mean, she is out there fighting. I also feel like I've seen how the Republican Party deals with Donald Trump, and it's to basically roll over.

And I think that some of them, it's preserving political capital. In the case of Governor DeSantis, they think he has his eyes set to 2028. He feels like he needs to come out and support Trump. He is probably not going to be as enthusiastic on the campaign trail for him, as we're seeing from someone like Vivek Ramaswamy or Senator Tim Scott, who I think -- those folks have their eyes set on potential cabinet positions or even VP slots. And so, I think that it's not surprising to me that they're all coming out and doing this. But, it is disappointing, because if Republicans actually cared about prioritizing winning, then we would be endorsing someone like Nikki Haley who beats Biden by 17 points.

There does seem to be an element for Nikki Haley that's different than that, whether it's kind of business-oriented people who are concerned about the way Trump deals with.

And some of the people from DeSantis did move over to Nikki Haley, kind of this idea of people who would do anything to not have Donald Trump but still want a conservative candidate. And they're watching all of that. I think a big part of the concern is, how long does she actually stay in this? Now, there is two schools of thought. I am hearing from some Trump advisors. You think she is going to drop out before South Carolina that they're doing a bunch of beta testing on the ground in South Carolina, and if she actually doesn't rise in the polls that she is going to drop out. And then the other part is that maybe she has the funding to just keep on going and wait until Super Tuesday and see what states there she can maybe pick up or at least half the states, some delegates to try and keep the momentum going.",

And so, this is going to be difficult for Joe Biden. As we've discussed, people, I feel like even though we know that the economy is improving, there are metrics to prove it, the Biden campaign has been harping on this, branding it as Bidenomics, which I think was a fatal mistake, quite honestly, to brand it like that, because for so long, they were trying to paint a rosy picture and tell people that things are improving. But, people still aren't feeling those effects, because I think they're still recovering from when inflation hit its peak in 2022.

There has been an effort on the right to try to scuttle this, including by the former President, and very frankly, because he is concerned about giving Joe Biden a victory at this key moment in the campaign season where he has been seizing on immigration. That has been clear from one Republican after another saying that that's what they believe is driving Donald Trump, and that could ultimately force a lot of Republicans to side with Donald Trump if a deal is ultimately reached here, which is now raising fresh concerns that nothing will get accomplished, not this immigration deal, and not the Ukraine and Israel aid that comes along with it. And I spoke to, just moments ago, Chris Murphy, who was one of the key negotiators in all of this. He said they're still going to try to see if they can get some sort of deal and had hoped that the Trump is not influential enough to kill this altogether. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): We don't live in a world today in which one person inside the Republican Party holds so much power that they could stop a bipartisan bill to try to give the President additional power at the border to make more sense of our immigration policy, I would hope that one person isn't so powerful inside the Republican Party to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin.

I mean, I was a Republican when I was a kid, and they weren't any of my high school. They weren't any. Not anybody around. So, I'm pretty comfortable right now, because the state is full of Republicans. We're going to vote, between 575,000 and 700,000 people. That's more than the first two contests, almost times two. So, we're going to work hard and see what we can do. Poll numbers are just that. They were a little wrong in New Hampshire. We had a good race there. We'd loved to have one, but it's enough. And then, we're going to sit here for 30 days and we're going to campaign and we're going to talk to people on street corners, and we're going to show the difference in the chaos versus a new path to leadership.",

And I think it's just a reminder to any of the young folks watching at home that you should never want power that much that you're willing to debase yourself in that way.
