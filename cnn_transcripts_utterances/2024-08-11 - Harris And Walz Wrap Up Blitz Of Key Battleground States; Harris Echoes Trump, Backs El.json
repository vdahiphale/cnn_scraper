That's all it is. And when you spend just a few minutes, say five or ten minutes a day, every day, spending time just, you know, closing your eyes, looking downward, and just experiencing your thoughts, your emotions, your feelings, the world around you, it actually does incredible things biologically.[06:40:06] So, it reduces the cognitive and the biological effects of stress on the brain and the body. It settles our central nervous system. It reduces that fight or flight instinct that we all have when we're stressed, and it actually improves thinking and learning and performance. It's one of the reasons why you probably noticed a lot of the Olympic athletes are doing mindfulness. There's even a space in the Olympic Village for that this year. It's incredible that it's become so under, you know, it's becoming better understood. The only point that I would love to make is that it is a practice that needs to be done every day. It is not something that you do just when you're stressed. You build the capacity to have stress resilience so that you're less stressed less often.",

This includes the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, the polio virus vaccine, hepatitis A, hepatitis B vaccines among others.And the researchers looked specifically at children born between 1994 and 2023. And the researchers found that routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented more than 500 million cases of illness. About 32 million hospitalizations and more than one million deaths. This is all within a child's lifetime. And the researchers say that results in a direct cost savings of more than 500 billion for the country. When we think about the medical costs and the researchers say this results in an indirect cost savings of about $2.7 trillion. Now, in this new report, it is noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we did see delays in some childhood vaccinations. This is because some pediatrician's appointments were delayed, canceled, or missed due to the pandemic. But also, this is partly due to the spread of misinformation leading to some families becoming more vaccine hesitant. But the researchers emphasize that now is the time to make sure your child is up to date on their routine vaccinations. We're currently in the back-to-school season. So, remember to talk to your pediatrician about what's needed for you and for your family as you head back to school and as you think about your routine vaccines. Back to you.
