In London, it's nine o'clock in the morning and we begin with the fallout from the Matt Gaetz ethics report as MAGA Republicans are now urging the former GOP congressman to fight for his political future. All this despite the salacious details and evidence that was unveiled by the U.S. House Ethics Committee in the report released on Monday. It concluded that Gaetz paid women thousands of dollars for sex that included a 17-year- old girl. It all happened while he was a sitting member of Congress and he used our possessed illegal drugs on multiple occasions, according to the findings. And yet even with this damning report, Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast that Gaetz and his words must return like Trump returned. And Bannon urged him, \"Don't back down, double down.\"Gaetz, of course, was Trump's initial choice to be the next U.S. Attorney General. These allegations ultimately doomed that nomination. He has long denied all of it and he has tried but failed to block the report from being released. CNN's Katelyn Polantz breaks down the evidence that's in the report.",

LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIV. OF LONDON: Like Trump, as Steve Bannon was saying, Gaetz will follow a similar strategy here, which is to deny the allegations, to denounce the moves against him as politically motivated, and then to distract or to deflect and to point the finger at someone else or to pick up on another story. And yes, these are very serious allegations. But I think we live in a political ecosystem now where there are many people around who support President Trump, who believe that his allies are being targeted for political reasons. And even though we might say, look, this is a Republican-led committee, this was a Republican House of Representatives that looked into this, that may not be seen as particularly relevant by the type of people who are active in the Republican Party and who vote in Republican primaries. And so I think as long as Gaetz feels that there is still a constituency within the Republican Party who votes in primaries in Florida, then I don't think we can count him out. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
