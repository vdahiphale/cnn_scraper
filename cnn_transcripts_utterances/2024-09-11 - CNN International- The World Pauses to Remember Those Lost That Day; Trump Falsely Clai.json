In New York, as I noted, the service underway now at the site of the 9/11 Memorial. The families of victims of both the 2001 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing reading now the names of their loved ones. This will continue for the next couple of hours. We are also awaiting the next moment of silence, which will observe the moment that flight 175 struck the South Tower of course, at 08:46 a.m., the first plane struck the North Tower. Among the family members and those remembering their loved ones down there today, of course, you'll see an Honor Guard. You see a number of first responders. You will also see a number of dignitaries. Among them, the Former President Donald Trump there at Ground Zero, along with the members of his family, and Senator J. D, Vance, his running mate. You see Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, pardon me. Also on hand, President Biden, Vice President Harris, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, also there as the events began earlier this morning. Those are just some pictures, of course, of the memorial there where each of the names is etched. A number of family members arriving earlier in the day with roses, we're told by our colleagues down at the site at Ground Zero. As they mark this somber occasion, it is a day where you can feel it in the air in New York City. It feels a bit heavier as people remember where they were as they think about the lives that were lost. and as they reflect on what these 23 years have been like. I want to pause now as we listen in just ahead of this next moment of silence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What Harris wanted to do was to show the American people the worst aspectsof Trump, to try and remind them what it was like, the bitterness and the chaos during the four years when he was president. So, she baited him on issues like immigration, on his friendship with Vladimir Putin. All of these questions she used to leverage the perceived faults in his character to undermine his own case. This was especially so on the question of immigration. That's an issue where Harris is shown by polls be quite vulnerable in this election. But Trump wasn't able to prosecute a good case. Instead, he often exaggerated the extent to which undocumented migrants were coming into the country, no more so than when he latched on to this conspiracy theory or this racial slander that's been percolated on conservative media about how, allegedly, Haitian immigrants were eating pets.

He's also casting doubt on a second debate, but he was the candidate who spoke for the most amount of time last night. I thought that was a really interesting statistic.

And proving her point, from her point of view, at least, that he should never be allowed back into the Oval Office again. On the question of a second debate, the fact that Trump doesn't seem to want a second debate, and the fact that he's now saying the moderators were biased, the whole biased, the whole thing was rigged, I think, is a tell. It seems to show that he believes he lost this debate, and his best interests and hopes of winning this campaign lie in perhaps not exposing himself to that all over again.

But also, important that it's a path to a two-state solution and dignity and respect for the Palestinian population here. And of course, that marks her out from Trump. And the reason that she was so strong on defending Israel, because that was Trump's attack against her, that she would be weak on it to the point of saying that he thought if she were president, then within two years, there would be no state of Israel. Look, I don't think there was anything in there that people here in this region hadn't heard before. Some of it is perhaps a little uncomfortable the way that Israel responds to its -- in its right to self-defense sits uncomfortably with this government. There's no doubt about it, because of the implicit criticism. But we didn't hear from anyone in the government commenting, because they have actually heard all this before, from Harris. We did hear from Yair Lapid, one of the sorts of leading opposition figures, saying he felt that it was good that both had had a heated debate about the importance of supporting Israel. But when it came to this issue of two state solution, when he was being interviewed. He said, look, we're nowhere near that for the next couple of years.

What's helping us on the downside, Becky, and perhaps that's even more important, oil, gasoline prices coming tumbling down, and we've seen it all prices are down a quarter in the last 12 months or so, and that really is helping the overall pain that people are feeling here.

They sort of, you know now the students I have now COVID was their shock moment. So one is that, and we see through that, that you know, or Hurricane Katrina, that we have climate and cyber and other terror threats, including domestic threats now, and things like January 6 and, of course, the international threat that we're sort of now in this all-hazards world, right?

I mean, we remember it from the just the experience of flying, which has been so impact, being on airplanes that was just been so impacted to surveillance, to the fighting of two wars and its impact on so many military people and their families, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I will say. And this is just, you know, this is me reflecting on students. It is now hard for them to understand what that meant for the United States, because they don't know what it meant, what it was like to be the United States on September 10, the Cold War was over. We won. There were best-selling books called \"The End of History\", and some believe that the liberal Democratic agenda would win throughout the globe. China was barely mentioned, and they're just entering and trying to figure out a world that's very different than the one that we felt on September 10. I want to say something else about American competency. They look at the wars and how they were fought. They then look at other issues impacting this generation. You see it in the polling from the climate, but in particular about guns and COVID. Those are the existential threats they go through or are going through. So, their remembrance of or their understanding of 9/11 will be very different. It's incumbent on us to remind them, but I also think it's incumbent on adults to reflect on mistakes that we made because of September 11 and what -- and how that has impacted the world our children are inheriting. I think it's incumbent on both generations, or all generations, to do that. Maybe 23 years gives us an ability to do that, because it's not as raw as it once was.",

We just didn't worry about it. So, this was the biggest rod he had to beat her with. And I'll sort of give him an 8 out of 10 for his efforts here. It's tough remember, Becky, you and I know the person on the people that are most influential on bringing inflation down is the Federal Reserve. And they have to hike interest rates at a time when it's already very painful for people. We had that period where Trump was potentially talking about having a say in Federal Reserve policy. That's a complete no, no. He's backed off that in terms of the ways that they can go about this. Harris, for her part, has talked about tackling price gouging, tackling big companies that are artificially keeping prices high. That created a sort of shudder across markets. I don't see that working very well. He's talked about pumping more oil and gas to bring energy prices down. We're down a quarter over the past year, so very little, actually, I think, net in terms of the policies they've announced. It's all about the Federal Reserve.
