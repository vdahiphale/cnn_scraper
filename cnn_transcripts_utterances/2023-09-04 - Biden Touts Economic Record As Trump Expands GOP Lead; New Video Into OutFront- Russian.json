I mean, on the one hand, many officials believe that continuing the slow progress of implementing the signature laws that President Biden signed last year will chip away at some of that pessimism. There's also a sense that some deeply partisan views about the economy and the country overall simply are not movable.And then there is also a belief that even if some of those views are movable, that there's enough time between now and Election Day for the momentum in the economy to shift. So, that's why President Biden is doing speeches like today's right now, to try and set the agenda of the 2024 campaign, and sharpening the attacks on his most likely future opponent, of course, former President Donald Trump. I mean, there are more than a few echoes of 2020. Whether it's the Scranton versus Park Avenue overtones, or just the audience of President Biden's speech today, the focus on trying to shore up support among labor, which is a critical constituency for Democrats. And many of those rank and file workers stuck with Trump in 2020. Just today, the head of the United Auto Workers, Shawn Fein, was on CNN. And he told the network that any endorsement for Biden would need to be earned, and that actions speak louder than words. And the irony there, Brianna, is that the issue for the UAW in not endorsing Biden is electric vehicle tax credits, a cornerstone of one of those signature laws that's going to be a cornerstone of the campaign. So, even policies design to win over some Democrats are going to cost votes elsewhere.",

So, who are we really talking to, a number of disaffected Republicans and independents who are there for Democrats during the midterm elections. I think they're going to be incredibly receptive to leaning into this economic message.

The problem is we're in this period where he's indicted four times, impeached twice as former presidency and they've not tried to define why that makes him unfit. They've in fact in some places gone on to almost defend them when indictments come down. So, I'm not shocked by the fact that he's doing better.

And they have improved the economy.On the flip side of this is Donald Trump who is four times indicted, and was -- in my view, the de facto head of an insurrection on January 6. So, the question is what is it that you're looking for, do you want someone that's going to run the bureaucracy, manage government in a good way, but also be able to protect voters against the disillusion of many of their rights? There's really only one choice you have. So, while I may understand to some extent people's views of who they think should be president. You know, again, when I was -- my first choice for president in 1992, my first vote was Bill Clinton, who was I think 46 when he was elected. So, I get that. If you're younger than a Gen X-er, you've seen a lot of young presidents in your lifetime.

I say this every time to note that Donald Trump is just several years younger than Joe Biden as well. This is an issue on both sides. But I do think it's a very real one, 73 percent of Americans care about it. And here is why, and I don't to be morbid in saying this. The average age of an -- a median age for the male in the U.S. is about 78 years old. So, people's perception is Joe Biden has outlived their grandfather, just statistically speaking. So, it's hard for them to see why this is someone they think they can trust in office for four more years.
