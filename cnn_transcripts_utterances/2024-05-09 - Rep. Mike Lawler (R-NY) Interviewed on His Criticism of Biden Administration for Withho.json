Those funds are used to fund Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis.So what the president is doing here is capitulated because of electoral politics, because he's concerned about the vote in Michigan and Minnesota. And that is taking precedent over eliminating a terroristic threat. And to me that's unconscionable. I don't care how many ways he tries to spin this, that is absolutely unconscionable. Congress passed aid to Israel just a few weeks ago. The president has a responsibility you to move that aid expeditiously.",

And that is partly because, they said, try to help Donald Trump's reputation after all this information that she put out there about the alleged one night stand she had with him. She also talked about, she said, look, it was consensual, but she intimated, look, there's a power balance, and she talked about him sort of blocking her way to the door. What is happening here?

You got what you needed out of her.Now, a little inside baseball. Here's the issue. The judge is not going to permit a renewed and a new cross-examination. They've covered ground, that is the defense team. You're not allowed to say, OK, I'm going to have a do-over. No. There's something in the courtroom called \"asked and answered.\" That means you asked the question. The witness answered. Counsel, move on. And so with respect to a renewed strategy, if it's ground that hasn't been covered, fine. But the judge will not allow them to go back. Why do I think it's a mistake, Sara? You got what you wanted out of her. Cross-examination is to make your closing argument. The closing argument to be made is you heard her, ladies and gentlemen. She said she hated the former president. Would you trust someone who hates my client? Could you put any stock in any word she says? You know why she's here everybody. You can savage her in your closing argument. The whole essence of cross-examination, yes, to attack credibility, yes, to speak your narrative if you're the defense, but to make the argument. You've got that. What do you lingering on? Are you lingering on because it's all about this affair, the affair, the affair. This is not a trial about an affair. It's a trial about business records. Keep your eye on the prize. And so I think renewing it and it's a longer cross is a mistake, but that's my view, and everyone does things differently, and potentially they have an effective strategy. My view is I don't think so.",

I think this is one witness, one issue.And at the end of the day, listen, this witness serves as the impetus and the motivation as to why Trump did what he did.

All of this went down last week in Okaloosa County, Florida, when Sheriff's deputies said they were responding to a disturbance in progress called, but all of that is in question right now. According to this witness who was on the FaceTime call, Fortson was on the phone call. He heard two knocks at the door, went to the door, saw no one in the peephole. He gets scared, goes and grabs his legally owned gun and according to the witness, that's when Sheriff's deputies allegedly burst into his apartment and opened fire. CNN affiliate WEAR says that Fortson was shot at least six times, including once in the chest and this is what the Sheriff's deputies are saying in response to what happened last week. \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, the deputy reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun, and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement. That deputy went on to shoot Fortson who later succumbed to his injuries.\" The statement goes on to say: \"The deputy was placed on administrative leave and they've asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct an investigation.\" This has all developed very quickly. Ben Crump, the famed Civil Rights attorney is now representing the family and we expect to get more details about what happened here in Okaloosa County later this morning, Kate, at a press conference at 11:30 -- Kate.",
