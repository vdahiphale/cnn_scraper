So they would need to charge that case in Florida, and then option C, the big one is it could be that they're considering -- prosecutors are considering charging the big case, potentially against Donald Trump in Florida, rather than Washington, DC and prosecutors have a lot of discretion about where they can --",

The argument would be well, he took the documents from DC, right? That would be sort of the scene of the crime. But the counter argument to that is yes, but if the facts are, and Kaitlan would probably know this, if he took the documents out of there and sent them down to Mar-a-Lago before noon on January 20th while he was still president, that's not going to be a crime, it doesn't become a crime until he loses the power of the presidency and then he illegally has those documents.

According to a Ukrainian officer who operates in the area very close to where Fred is right now, he told us that he had seen catastrophic effects on the Russian troops. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. ANDRII PIDLISNYL, ARMED FORCES OF UKRAINE: Their positions were fully destroyed. They are full with water. They have a lot of wounded people and dead people for now.

And that's one thing to keep in mind, is that you have the shelling going on. It's the middle of the night and people are hearing these mortars and artillery going over their heads as we speak right now. So that's definitely something that's extremely difficult. But what the folks who are conducting this, who are trying to get people out of their houses are telling us is when this started, in the early stages, they were able to take regular cars and get there and tried to get these people out. But it became very, very quickly and very soon afterwards that they needed big trucks. And right now it's pretty much all boats. So the situation certainly is deteriorating. As of right now, the Ukrainian official says about 1,000 houses remain underwater, and that's just in the area that's held by the Ukrainians. Obviously, as Sam was saying, situation on the Russian side or on the Russian held side, we should say, seems to be as bad, if not worse, Anderson.

First of all, he had asked for a transfer to the New York field office, which is the most expensive FBI office in terms of quality of life and living on an FBI salary. So he needed money. He was having children. He couldn't support his life. At the same time, he was a disgruntled employee. He wanted to be a field operative. He wanted to do the sort of things I was doing as an FBI ghost undercover, chasing targets, using disguises, telephoto lenses, that sort of thing. But his skill set was as an analyst. He was very adept at analyzing large amounts of data and distilling it down to that one actionable intelligence point that would allow someone like me to do what I did. He was angry at the FBI because he wanted to be James Bond. And they made him, in his mind, a librarian. So you have a disgruntled employee with a large ego who had the financial problems, which is a triggering event. And those are all the ingredients you need for a trusted insider. He was not recruited by the Russians. He volunteered his services and maintained a code name. Never let the Russians know who he was for his 22 years of espionage.

Hanssen was going to retire in April, just a few months. And so the FBI very quickly put together an operation to catch Robert Hanssen, which was called the Information Assurance Section. It was a way to lure him back from the Department of State, put him in a highly prestigious position, give him access to information and hope he made that final drop to the Russians, that would give us a slam dunk case to put him away.
