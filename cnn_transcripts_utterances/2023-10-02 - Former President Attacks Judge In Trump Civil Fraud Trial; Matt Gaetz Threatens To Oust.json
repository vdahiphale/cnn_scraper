But in opening statements, the state attorney general's office made their case that year after year, loan after loan, former president inflated the value of his assets on these financial statements in order to get better terms for insurance and for for bank loans.So what - what they previewed in their case is they said that they will call some witnesses who will testify to this, including Michael Cohen. He is Trump's former fixer. He's the reason why the agency's office started this investigation after his testimony on Capitol Hill, where he said that Trump did inflate the value of the assets when it would benefit him. They also said another Trump organization executive will be testifying that the chief financial officer of the company had told him that Donald Trump liked it when his net worth went up. And that is the basis of this theory of the case, that he had inflated the value of his assets to increase his net worth so he could get these loans. Now, Trump's attorneys pushing back, saying that this is not fraud, this is real estate, that everyone comes up with their own valuations and it doesn't mean one person has committed fraud. They said that there's no conspiracy among the children. Donald Trump is also accused here of conspiring with his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. And they're saying that the only evidence in this case is based on the serial liar, Michael Cohen. Now, politics did enter the courtroom here because one of Trump's attorneys, Alina Haba, began her opening statement saying that the attorney general's office could have brought this case several years ago, even before they did an investigation. A nod to some of the statements that James has been making, including ones that they pointed to this morning outside of court. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LETITIA JAMES, ATTORNEY GENERAL (NY): My message is simple. No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you think you may have, no one is above the law. And it is my responsibility and my duty and my job to enforce it. The law is both powerful and fragile. And today in court, we will prove our case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now for several months we have been asking campaign advisors how are you going to navigate 2024 presidential campaign looming trials and today we saw at least part of that. They are essentially trials, they turned it today, into a campaign event. When Trump was leaving Trump Tower, I think, blasted out a statement on Letitia James, one that you would likely see against a political opponent. You've seen Trump there at that event going back to the cameras back to the microphones time and time again. Getting more updated remarks very similar to what he's saying in the first place but still going back to that attention. You know that's something that former president Trump likes. He likes the visuals, he likes the optics and this is clearly a way for him to take control of the narrative so we're talking about campaigning in the middle of the trials, well how can you make this essentially a plan to take all the oxygen out of the race. And that seems to be what they are doing.And Trump himself really said as much making this political when he was asked why he was here today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I do want to note one thing here, I was watching him go back and forth to the microphone and that reminded me of 2016 when he was in Scotland at his golf -- his golf course there and he was with reporters and he just kept going to the microphone, essentially like a rolling press conference. That's really what he's doing here.You remember this is Trump in his element. When the cameras are around he is a showman at the end of the day.

But I think it's important to note here what the Trump team has learned here over time.So you had four federal indictments, 91 criminal charges, and they were working all summer long to make lemonade out of lemons. Nobody would want to be indicted on criminal charges. Certainly not a former president who's seeking the presidency again. And yet they found if they can lean into this, portray him as the victim, it helps rally their base. And it totally dominated the headlines and therefore starved his opponents of oxygen. And so when it came to a day like this, where it's not required, unlike the federal indictments, they said, hey, we should run that same kind of playbook. We want to continue to starve our Republican primary opponents of any oxygen. We want to dominate the information flow.

It could happen within the next two days if Gaetz makes that motion today. He has not done so yet. It would need five Republicans to vote to kick him out of the speakership if all Democrats agreed to vote that way as well. What Democrats do remains the key question at that moment -at this moment, as Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, has not made a decision yet as he weighs what to do. I asked the speaker just moments ago about what will happen. Will he continue to try to become speaker? If he gets kicked out, which would lead to a new speaker's race, will he put himself up as a candidate again and again and again? And he indicated he's ready to fight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I asked him, how long are you willing to take this fight in the weeks and days ahead? He said, if I have to go 14 or 15 rounds, that's how long Kevin McCarthy went back in January to become speaker.
