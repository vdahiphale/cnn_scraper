We'll discuss the politics and possible punishment.Just hours after celebrating back-to-back national championships, tragedy strikes the Georgia Bulldogs football team. What we are learning about a deadly car accident in Athens, Georgia. Plus, epic flooding in California, deadly winter storms have forced evacuations, shifted landscapes and caused millions of dollars in damages. We're live in Monterey County with the latest. Good to have you with us. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden is under growing scrutiny over his handling of classified documents. And Republican lawmakers who now control the House of Representatives are now ramping up the pressure. The Republican Chairman of the House Oversight Committee has asked the White House for visitor logs from Joe Biden's Delaware residence where several classified items have been found. James Comer is also seeking records and communications related to searches of the president's homes and other locations. On Sunday, Comer said he wanted Mr. Biden's case to be treated just like the probe involving Donald Trump and his own handling of classified documents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  At the end of the day, my biggest concern isn't the classified documents, to be honest with you. My concern is how there's such a discrepancy in how former President Trump was treated by raiding Mar-a-Lago, by getting the security cameras, by taking pictures of documents on the floor, by going through Melania's closet versus Joe Biden, and they're like, okay, your personal lawyers who don't have security clearance, yep, they can go through, they can just keep looking and keep looking and, you know, determine whatever's there. That's not equal treatment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Democrats say it's a false equivalent to compare this to Trump's classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home. But Republicans say they want to see justice applied equally claiming that Mr. Biden is receiving preferential treatment. And they're calling for more investigations in addition to the special counsel appointed Thursday. So, Charlie, I'll turn to you first. Who is right here? What needs to happen next?

And it's important to note that they knew this -- these documents existed or some of them on November 2nd. The election would be held five days later. Did that have an effect on the outcome of the election, the fact that there wasn't a big red wave as anticipated? It could have had some effect.Joe Biden, I mean this is out-and-out hypocrisy. With that said, there are obvious differences between Trump and Biden here, right? So, Biden is a case study in what to do when you find documents that you're not supposed to have. Do you turn them over to the National Archives. Whereas Trump was defying a subpoena and covering up documents and refusing to turn them over, which is why Mar-a-Lago was raided. So, there are significant differences here I think in terms of the potential charges they're facing. It appears that Donald Trump is being investigated for possible espionage charges and obstruction of justice. These are not things that Biden will likely face although we don't know what's in the documents. He's cooperating. With that said, I couldn't agree with Charlie Dent more, but this goes to the core of the Biden brand which is his competence, that he's the adult in the room, that he holds himself to a higher standard. So, I think it would damage his brand even though we are not going to be talking about what's essentially a paperwork issue going into the 2024 election. But these are the two likely candidates and Biden has hurt his brand.",

So, at the end of the day, obviously, NARA, the National Archives, right, they need to have and not to -- shift the blame.But they need have a better system here and better coordination between the recordkeeping that's happening at the White House and the archiving that happens after a president leaves. It is very clear the current system isn't working.

Storms have been slamming the state for weeks now, flooding roads, homes, and businesses, causing mud slides, and leaving at least 19 people dead.Rainfall is continuing to decrease, but about 14 million people remain under wind advisories across the southern part of the state, and more than 8 million are under flood watches until Monday evening including in the bay area. And take a look at this dramatic rescue in San Diego. It took 90 minutes in the rain and wind to remove the driver of an SUV that had plunged over a cliff. Well, fears have now passed that flooding could cut off the Monterey Peninsula on California's central coast from the central services. Local reports say a majority of evacuation orders have now been done graded to warnings. Officials say they will still keep flood precautions in place for the weekend and they're telling residents to remain vigilant. So, let's get some more perspective now from Nicholas Pasculli, the communications director of Monterey County. Thank you so much for being with us particularly at this difficult time for your county and of course your state. So, there was concern that the Monterey Peninsula could be cut off by flooding, but many of the evacuation orders have now been downgraded to warnings at this point. Still, this is as close as you've all come, isn't it, since the big floods in 1995, and there's still significant flooding and extensive damage. What is the situation right now? Can you tell us?
