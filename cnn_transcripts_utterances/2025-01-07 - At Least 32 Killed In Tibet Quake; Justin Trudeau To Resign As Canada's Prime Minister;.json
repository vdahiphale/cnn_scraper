Not only is the death toll rising, but we are starting to get a better idea of the damage. In fact, the Chinese Air Force has now been activated to help in any kind of search efforts. According to one government figure, at least 1,000 homes have been damaged.Let me walk with you through some of the pictures right now. A number of buildings have damage. We have seen rubble in the streets, making it very difficult for people to get around this particular area. This is Shigatse. It's about 100 miles away from the epicenter. But at times we saw pictures of debris in the road, making it very hard for people to get around. We had a glimpse inside of a restaurant. There were some broken glass. Some of the fixtures had fallen. So the damage is now being assessed. At least 38 people have been injured, according to the government. You can see a chandelier has been swinging in addition to more damage on the roads. At one point, I think earlier you saw some video of people inside a grocery store when the shaking occurred, items started to fall from the shelves and people immediately took cover. We've also been scouring Chinese social media to get some accounts from people on the ground. We heard from one person who said they were sleeping, and the force of it was so strong that it woke them up. In fact, we are now getting reports from the geological service here in China that at least 49 aftershocks were recorded and that tremors were felt nearby in Nepal and in India. As you alluded to earlier, this is a very remote part of Tibet, very close to the Himalayan border with Nepal. The epicenter, again, 100 miles away from the most major city, that being Shigatse. And that too has some very special meaning in a part of the world that is seen as very sacred and spiritual. That is where the Panchen Lama sits and lives. And of course, that being the second highest spiritual leader in Tibet Buddhism after the Dalai Lama. Again, earlier there were reports of nine people dead, but then quickly we saw the death toll start to rise. One person did comment on Chinese social media that this occurred just about two weeks prior to the start of the Chinese New Year, which is a very sacred time for people here in China, and that the timing of this weighs heavy. Polo, we are reaching out to local officials from our spot here in Beijing. Obviously, this is a fluid story and numbers will change. And certainly we are staying on top of it from here in Beijing -- Polo.",

Freeland added that the government needed to start pushing back against America First economic nationalism. A former high school teacher and the eldest son of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada's most well-known prime ministers, Trudeau was elected three times. He became a poster child for the country's progressive agenda on the global stage, seen as an antidote to Trump during the incoming U.S. president's first term. His government pursued policies on alleviating child poverty, gender equity, cutting middle class taxes, and the legalization of cannabis. And while he was generally praised for his handling of the pandemic, voter sentiment has soured since.

We don't know. I mean, it's Conservative, the leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, talks a big line. We'll see. I mean, Canada is in a very, very weak position. The economy is heavily dependent on exports to the United States. Oil and cars in particular. So any disruption of that could be crippling to the economy.

He was in a position within the party where he had to name senior officials in his own government who really weren't part of his movement, but were kind of concessions to other power centers in the GOP.The Supreme Court at that point, when he came in in 2017, was 4-4 with Anthony Kennedy as really an unreliable vote from the point of view of conservatives as part of those, you know, four Republican appointed justices. All of that obviously is enormously different today. I mean, you have GOP leadership that is much more deferential to him. Trump has been able to make loyalty to him personally. The key variable in his appointments, and you have a solid six three conservative majority in the Supreme Court. Business leaders are more willing to kind of genuflect toward Trump than they were four years ago. That should give him more leverage to advance his agenda. But the downside is that there were a lot of Trump ideas in the first term that might have been very alienating for the public that got stopped by one or the other of these power centers.

His trolling of Starmer is not new. Last summer, claiming racist riots were tipping the U.K. into civil war. But this, and his international meddling, is reaching new levels. Since becoming President-elect Donald Trump's adviser, Musk's words have more muscle. The power pair have teamed up on calls with world leaders, notably with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one day after the U.S. presidential elections. But it is Musk's right-wing push, picking up on what former Trump strategist and adviser Steve Bannon began eight years ago -- championing Europe's far-right populist disrupters -- that has Europe's leaders worried. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): Ten years ago, if we'd been told that the owner of the largest social media networks would support an international reactionary movement and directly intervene in elections, including Germany. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Musk also supporting the hard-right AFD, Alternative for Germany Party, which has been accused of resurrecting Nazi rhetoric ahead of elections there next month. But Musk is going further right than Bannon, attacking a staunch Trump ally, Nigel Farage, saying, \"Farage doesn't have what it takes\" to lead his upstart Reform U.K. Party. Farage, the British populist who pushed Brexit just hours before Musk's put-down, had counted the tech titan a supporter who might finance his fledgling party. NIGEL FARAGE, LEADER, U.K. REFORM PARTY: The fact that he supports me politically and supports Reform doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Why the falling out? Possibly differences over this man, known as Tommy Robinson, a jailed anti-Muslim campaigner who fanned the flames of racist riots last summer. Musk praises him. Farage doesn't. The question in Europe now: how far right will Musk go? Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
