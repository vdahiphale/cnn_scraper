We have new reporting on how team Trump is preparing for multiple contentious confirmation battles.Plus, rejection to affection. After disavowing project 2025 on the trail, Donald Trump is tapping an architect to the far-right plan for a critical post in the White House. And pardon the tradition. A lame duck just spared 240-pound turkeys from the kitchen table. We'll tell you how peach and blossom rode the gravy train all the way to the White House. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headline at Inside Politics. We start at Mar-a-Lago. Team -- Trump transition team is shifting its focus with the president-elect's cabinet now filled out. The next step is Senate confirmation. Some like Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, are expected to fly right through it, but several others are facing big questions over their character and qualifications. CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, right by Mar-a-Lago. So, Alayna, what are you hearing about how team Trump is preparing for these major battles?",

He has just a few cabinet positions left, but really a lot of the attention now within the transition team is turning toward how they're going to get these people confirmed.And part of that is trying to feel out, what are these different, particularly the more controversial picks. What are their key vulnerabilities? We know that RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, that are all people that we're hearing some consternation from on Capitol Hill. Consternation that I know the Trump transition team is picking up on, and some of it they've already been aware of when they were selecting these different people to fill these certain roles. Now, a part of this is we're going to see these different candidates going to Capitol Hill, meeting one-on-one with senators behind closed doors, like we saw Pete Hegseth and Matt Gaetz do last week alongside VP-elect J. D. Vance. And really, it's in those meetings that they're trying to get a sense of, OK, what do you need to hear from us in order to make this confirmation process go more smoothly. And really, I think that's the key focus now with people at Mar-a-Lago is back channeling with people on the Hill, trying to get a sense of how they can assuage those concerns before really we see these confirmation battles play out in public.",

They're called memoranda of understanding, also known as MOUs.And part of that because they have not done that and missed some of these deadlines, we are not seeing the traditional processes be followed, that includes FBI background checks on some of these candidates, which is normally required by many in the Senate in order to move forward with their confirmation process. Now, when I talk to the Trump team about this, they say that they have not -- you know, they've made no promise not to sign them. They say they still might, they still may go through this. But as of now, the vetting that we are seeing conducted of these different nominees are happening by a private firm and different research firms helping with that. And so, I think we've seen a lot of, you know -- and you've seen this as well, Manu, people like Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar saying, they want to see these background checks from the FBI before feeling they are comfortable to move forward with this process.

Even though, as some Democrats have pointed out, they're slimmer than perhaps they were when they flipped under Obama.But all that to say, I think the general theme of the picks that Trump has selected is this idea that he likes to assemble a marketplace of ideas. We can call it the Agora approach. He wants people from different backgrounds with a spectrum of ideologies. They are not dogmatic. They're not monoliths, and he wants them to present him a menu of options, which -- from which he selects the way that he wants to proceed on any number of types of policies. The problem is that that is what led to infighting in his first term, and that's what all has already started to lead to infighting among some of these folks, even during the transition because they have such a wide variety of views and such strong beliefs about which direction the administration should go in. There is also another interesting trend that has continued from the first term of Trump to now the second transition. And that is he's really enamored with the fact that Democrats still want to serve for him. In the first term, he had Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin, and his son in law Jared Kushner, you know, all sort of reformed Democrats. This time around is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He has Tulsi Gabbard. He has a Scott Bessent, all of these folks who essentially converted from the Democratic Party to him. And in the words of one aide, he's really enamored by the action.",

They were in his team already.So yes, he does want a different point of view, perhaps, but one overarching theme is loyalty to him. That's one of his biggest regrets from the first term. He was sort of open to these outsiders who didn't know that well. And his biggest regret is Jeff Sessions. He did know Jeff Sessions, well of course.

And just talking to some Republican staffers this morning and over the weekend, Tulsi Gabbard is at the top of that list. There's no doubt about it So, the Senate Intelligence Committee, it's one of those rare places that still -- you know, there's bipartisan agreement that they want someone serious in that.

Because I think if you look at the cabinet, these are who likely will not be disagreeing with Trump, maybe not all of them, but certainly a majority of them.And honestly, they were picked not just because of loyalty because they have an appetite to take on the system in a way that Donald Trump feels that the system was not just unhelpful to him, but actively targeted him. Now, when I talk to people close to Trump, they say that he and others around him believe that they have a large mandate, a large roadway to kind of institute what they want to do with the government because of their decisive win, even though it's getting smaller kind of by the days go on. But because of their decisive win, I think what they really have is the opportunity to show the American public that they can do well in the economy. And then after that, they can kind of put into place, or they have that really large roadway to do everything else that they want. But the economy is going to be important here, because if people feel like they are not bringing down prices, which I think is why a huge portion of why Trump won so decisively. They're going to be in trouble for all the other places that they want to implement changes in the government. But for the Trump campaign and for the transition, they feel that they have a lot of ability to do a lot of things when it comes down to tearing down these key parts of the government that have been in place for decades.",

Trump, I think in talking to people who have knowledge of the way that his mindset worked around this pick doesn't want someone who's going to come in and sort of reverse some of the things that the Biden administration has done, or to perhaps go against his policies on tips and on wages that he has promised on the --",

But when I talk to Trump advisers, they say, pay less attention to Project 2025 and more attention to what's been published by the America First Policy Institute, which basically is borrowing from Project 2025 and figuring out what from that is passable, and what of that aligns with what the president has done.
