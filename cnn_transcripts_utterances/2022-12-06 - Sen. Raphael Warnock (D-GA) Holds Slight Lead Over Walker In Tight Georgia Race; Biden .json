And I just spoke to an official in Cobb County there, and I'm told around 76,000 votes are still outstanding. Day of votes, that means people who went to the polls today there in Cobb County, those votes are still outstanding. So, we're still expecting a pretty large amount from there. And there's about 12,000 or so outstanding votes from mail-in ballots as well.Now, I asked a source when we're going to find out more, when more votes will drop from there. And this person said, as soon as they drive back from the polling areas with the memory cards, they're plug- in and uploaded to the system. So, we'll just have to wait and see. But it is certainly getting down to the wire now. And I just also talked to Gabriel Sterling, the election official there on the ground there that we've been talking to throughout the night, and he said, after 10:00, this is when we are going to be getting a better picture now of the outstanding votes in these urban areas in the Atlanta area and also learn more about when we are going to get to find out what those votes are.",

      "sentences": "All right. Pamela Brown, thank you so much.Let's take a look at some these counties where the vote is still outstanding. Because, John, the reason why we're hearing from Jeff Zeleny that there are people in the Walker campaign who are still kind of nervous, even though he's only 13,785 votes behind, and then certainly with 10, 11 percent of the vote outstanding, that could be quickly covered up, i's because a lot of the outstanding vote is in these Democratic-leaning counties that are very populous. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Most of it is right there. Most of the votes still to be counted is inside that circle. And what you notice about that circle? Not only is it blue, to your point, to your point not only is it blue, Pamela was just talking about Cobb County. Raphael Warnock is getting 62 percent of the vote right now. It does mean it won't come up a little bit more than that, but that's one there. So, you're here in Cobb County over there, you can come across to the other side, back in the day, George W. Bush carried this county, it used to be a Republican county. Look at that, 90 percent of the vote now in, 62 percent of the vote for Raphael Warnock. So, not only is the vote is in these blue areas, but so far in the early vote and the day of vote counted so far, Senator Warnock is keeping these big edges in this county. Again, Fulton County, we're up to 67 percent now. Let me get rid of the circle so it doesn't distract people. 67 percent, he's still above 80 percent. So, as the rest of that comes in, is it possible Herschel Walker does better than 19 percent? Of course, it is, of course, it is. The question is, is it enough when you get to this point? So, you come back out, 15,373 votes again, again, most of the vote outstanding here. Not all of it. You can look at this way as well to understand where the rest of it is. There are some small pockets of votes. You see the red circles are Republican areas. So, there are some Republican votes out there. But you see these big circles and so many circles here, this is, again, Fulton County, the suburban counties around it, that when you come back to the normal map, not only are they blue when you go county by county, they're very deep blue. And so, if you are in the Warnock campaign, you are ahead, up to 90 percent of the vote now and you know what has happened in the last several elections. This is the area that tends to come in late. You just heard, describing they're driving the voting cards from the precincts (INAUDIBLE) and you watch votes are changing, it's 12,419 votes, they are changing as we have this conversation because a few -- sometimes there's a couple hundred, sometimes it's several thousands, and off you go. But you're up to 91 percent now. If you are in Vegas, that is your bet. We're not done yet. But because you know where the outstanding votes are, that is why there is some pessimism in the Walker campaign.",

Let's put it this way, he needed to do better, right? Where is Herschel Walker overperforming? He is overperforming in some of these red counties. That means his percentages are higher now than they were a month ago, and that's significant. That's a lot of places, right. But look what is gray. So, here's the flip side of that question.

That's exactly the right expression because he's doing it here where it matters in the major population centers. In the smaller urban areas, Columbus, Augusta, Savannah, where the Democrats live, this -- he's doing better, this is where he's from, this part of the state here are. He's doing better where the Democrats live. And he's also doing a little better in places that tend to vote red. And that has been, again, Stacey Abrams, a strong Democratic candidate, did horribly in rural Georgia. Raphael Warnock doesn't do great but he does better.And just as we talked about underperforming for the Republicans in the suburbs, Senator Warnock performs. And maybe it's just Herschel Walker, we'll see how this one ends up, but he tends to overperform. And then you asked the other question. So, where is Warnock underperforming, only in a few counties. And, again, we are not at the finish line. So, to be fair, you need to look at this when we get to 100 percent. But if you get your indications now, the reason -- and is it is not only a 4,000-vote lead. I mean, this is still a competitive race. The issue is when you just walk around to try to look at the places where there are Republican votes, you are at 99 percent. I'm just picking these counties randomly just to see. And you just see all of them at 99 percent. I'm not trying to make anyone dizzy at home. But you're seeing the 99 percent in these small Republican rural counties, and then you come up here where the Democratic votes are, like DeKalb, 65 percent. And you're just looking -- you're looking 175,000 votes, 15,000 votes, just by comparison, right? So, you've got a third vote still to be counted here. And you come out to these smaller counties. And even if there is still some to be counted, you are talking 16,000 votes. So, the people, more than 50 percent of the population is right here in the circle, and that's where mostly outstanding votes are. So, again, 4,000 votes, you are not celebrating yet.

They have become pretty reliably Democratic suburbs. So, what you have around -- just imagine, wherever you live, right, you live in an urban area, you drive out, you have the close-in suburbs. And then you go a little further out where you start seeing maybe a couple of farms still, and then you're out in the ex-urbs the and the box stores and things like that.

Well, let me go to the practical and then the moral. The practical is that it will make it easier for us to get nominations to the floor. We've seen a lot of obstruction on that point. A number of the president's nominees are still waiting for key positions in different agencies, judges, even though we've confirmed 90 of them, we have many more to do. But the moral is Raphael Warnock. We love the guy. He is true, amazing patriot in terms of the work that he's done for his state, the leadership he has shown on health care and we want Reverend Warnock back. We're feeling really good about this, all these votes that are out in Fulton County and in the metropolitan area I think bodes well. We always knew this was going to be a tough race, Jake. No one thought it was going to be a landslide but we feel good.",

They stack the rules. They made major changes to the rules, including that you could not register in a runoff. In the last election, tens of thousands of people registered in the runoff. We were not allowed to do that in this election. And, so there were many problems with the changes to the rules. But through it all, Reverend Warnock never gave up. He kept to his core values, pushing health care for the people of Georgia and the country, pushing the work we need to do to have people's back when it comes the economy. And mostly, over 30 percent of voters who voted Democratic in this last election, and this is important, said they voted that way because of democracy. Donald Trump's shadow looming big-time. Right before this election, he actually said he wanted to terminate portions of the Constitution. Georgians noticed. Last time, they stood up, including moderate Republicans and independents.

Obviously, it's exuberant in here tonight, and this is what Democrats have been telling me all evening, that this really solidifies Georgia as a true battleground state.Democrats fought hard in the final hour to get that Saturday voting. They are indicating to me that they think that that was really crucial as well in ushering in this victory tonight. But this still shows that Democrats are still in play in the state. They won no other statewide races during the general election, the governor's race on down. But, tonight, they have a victory. Jake? TAPPER (voice over):  A big victory, a huge victory for Democrats. And, Dana Bash, in the midterm elections, not only did Democrats not lose any Senate seats, they actually picked one up. BASH (voice over):  It is really remarkable when you see the map. And you know this, Senator, because they were quite literally all over the map campaigning for and with your colleagues. And those who wanted to be in the Senate, like John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, given every headwind that Democrats have had, they are now one up from where you were before. KLOBUCHAR (voice over):  Yes. But could I just celebrate for one moment. Pretty cool. I came on the set, we were 800 votes behind, and suddenly, here we are. And this is what we thought was going to happen. And, again, democracy on the ballot. The fact that Raphael Warnock and so many of our candidates were high quality, had the back of the people of this country, and then finally, no one wants their freedoms taken away. And the Dobbs decision and what we saw out of that with moderate Republicans and independents joining Democrats who say, wait a minute, reproductive freedom means something to me. All of those issues were on the ballot in Georgia and Raphael Warnock never wavered. And I'm so happy for him today and for the Senate that we're going to have him back. He's a force. MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  So, you had raised a lot of concerns about Georgia, the election law that had been put in place there, you and other Democrats had as well, suggesting it was probably Jim Crow-type legislation that was enacted in the state. We're seeing about 3.3 million voters, according to election officials, showed up today. Is there any evidence that those fears were borne out that you and other Democrats raised over the last year? KLOBUCHAR (voice over):  We don't know what the totals would have been if it would have been easier for people to vote. And what we are seeing across the country -- remember, they were trying to ban standard day voting right before the election. Who does? Usually, when parties lose an election, like what happened with Trump and a number of their candidates in the midterms, they stepped back and say, what should we do about changing our policies or their candidates? What they've been saying is let's change the voters. Let's make it harder for people to vote. Georgians respond to that. They don't like. BASH (voice over):  Yes. In the meantime, we should just actually sort of mark the moment. It's a pretty cool shot right there, the picture that we're seeing from Warnock headquarters, because this is not a -- it's a re-election, but it's actually his first full term. He's run the last few years twice. PHILLIP (voice over):  This is the fifth time he's been on the ballot in two years. Two points about this. Obviously, Democrats really, as Senator Klobuchar knows, worked their butts off in the state of Georgia, going back even before 2020. This has been a many years'-long effort to create a ground game where one really did not exist at the statewide level in the state. But it is also a catastrophic failure for Republicans to lose two Senate seats in a red state where they could have had a fighting chance because of some really key missteps and failures, frankly, to acknowledge what was happening and respond to it. When Trump basically depressed his own vote, that really sealed the deal back in 2020 and set up a chain of events that has led us to this moment. For the next four years, at least, Georgia is going to have two Democratic senators. And that is going to give Democrats, for a little while longer, a real opportunity to lock in some of these gains that they have been working on for all of these years. And it is going to be that much harder the next time around for Republicans to try to claw this back. I think that this was a key moment for them and they missed their shot.",

There was a celebratory, for really quite a lot of the evening as the lead was seesawing back and forth with Senator Raphael Warnock. But we are expecting Herschel Walker to speak here. I'm told he's been huddling with his advisors and his wife, Julie Blanchard, who is perhaps his closest adviser. Officials I'm speaking to believe he will offer a concession speech, but we certainly will see what he does here behind me here. He is not giving any indication that he would not do that. Republicans certainly are talking here about how close this race was and they do believe it was close because he made this referendum on Joe Biden. Of course, there will be many recriminations about the type of candidate -- the type of campaign he ran, the type of candidate he was. But for now, at least, tonight the final race of this election cycle is over. And one more handpicked candidate by former President Donald Trump has been defeated. So, certainly that will be one of the ongoing lessons of this campaign. Even talking to some Republican supporters here, they believe that this was a very winnable race. Look at this very close margin here. They believe this was a race that Republicans could have and should have won.

While we wait for possibly Herschel Walker and definitely re-elected Senator Raphael Warnock to speak, let's chat some more with our august panel, including of course, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from the great state of Minnesota.Look, obviously, Raphael Warnock, Senator Warnock ran almost a textbook campaign and I don't want to take anything from his victory because he really -- he did a lot. I have to ask, though, it really seems as though Donald Trump does you guys a favor by picking these candidates for the Republican primaries that are very deferential to him and very supported by the MAGA base, but just lose election after election when it comes to independent middle of the road moderate Republican and Democratic voters. Whether it's Mastriano and Oz in Pennsylvania, Masters and Kelly Ward in Arizona, and on and on and on. I know you don't want him to run for reelection, but like, he's constantly doing Democrats favors by picking these candidates who can't win. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  I guess I think of it a different way. I think that why can't the Republican Party say goodbye? Why can't the Republican Party stand up to him, like Liz Cheney has done, like Adam Kinzinger has done, and a great political risk in her case? He didn't run again, in her case, she got defeated, but they stood up to him. And I think more people are going to have to do that. And when more people do it, then they actually don't lose. But what's happened here is repeatedly they don't stand up to him. And look at what is happening. You are right. Some of the biggest vote getters in the country were actually people that maybe you didn't hear of. Steve Simon, secretary of state candidate Minnesota, who got the most in our state was running against an election denier. Or Fontes in Arizona, in Maricopa County despite Mark Kelly's incredible victory, and Katie Hobbs and the like. He did the best in that county. A lot of this has to do with Donald Trump, I agree. But at the same time, I love that we put up candidates that are the real deal. And the state saw through whatever political lens they had, or the, of course, everything everyone's been through with COVID and inflation all over the world. And they said, you know what, I believe Raphael Warnock is going to have my back and he's going to help our country, and he's the right guy in terms of our democracy. And that we saw all over the country. Everyone that counted us out. we know this. Including maybe a few pundits on this network had counted us out, but we never gave up.",

Just a couple of days ago, President Biden said the next nominee for the party, maybe it will be him, maybe it will be someone else.

So, that is a big piece of it.But also, we've seen across the country they are bringing in independent voters, moderate Republicans, particularly on and reproductive freedom when the Republicans doubled down, so many of those people racing to the governor's offices and state capitals on the Republican side to see who could be the first one after the overturn of Roe v.

But he said running for public office in his home state of Georgia was the biggest honor of his life. And tonight, I'm told he will concede. Now, he has not been a big proponent of election denialism necessarily. But he has not necessarily pushback on it either. And of course, he was recruited into this race by former President Donald Trump to run. But I'm told he has no appetite for continuing this. He has no appetite for going forward with this race. In fact, the crowd behind me here was watching on the screen on Fox News as they called this race. And just a hush went over the crowd and really, not much reaction at all. So, there is no sense here at least that this is going to go beyond this evening. Perhaps it will in the mind of some supporters who simply cannot accept election results.

We'll see if Herschel Walker decides to that here.But, you know, this moment is going to just prompt such a significant amount of soul searching among Republicans about exactly what they did wrong here and how to avoid this next time. Next time, they'll have a more favorable map. They can certainly take back the Senate majority. But they could also fail again if they nominate candidates who are lackluster. These are racists.

And I think it matters because in Georgia, voting matters, especially to black voters who fought and bled and died for the right to be able to do it.
