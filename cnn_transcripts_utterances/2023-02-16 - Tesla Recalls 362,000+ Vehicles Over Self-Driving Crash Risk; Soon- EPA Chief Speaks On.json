      "sentences": "Well, this will be the first time that we hear directly from President Biden in a formal setting on the downing not only of that Chinese spy balloon but also those three unidentified objects that were down by U.S. fighter jets between Friday and Sunday. And to get to this point, a couple of things had to happen because the White House has really been in discussions over the last several days about the wisdom -- the merits of the president potentially addressing this issue. They were wary at first of making this a bigger issue than it actually is. And they were also wanted to make sure that the president waited until the intelligence community had a more firm assessment of the situation before he got ahead of any of the facts in this case.And so, what has changed over the last couple of days is not only have we seen lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both parties increasingly calling for President Biden to address this issue for the White House to show more transparency on this issue, but also what we've seen is the intelligence community growing increasingly confident in their assessments that these unidentified objects that were shot down over the weekend were likely benign, or for some kind of commercial purposes, not linked to that Chinese spy balloon, which traverses the whole of the continental United States before eventually being down off the coast of South Carolina. And so, today, we're expecting to hear President Biden explain to Americans what the United States actually knows about these unidentified objects. And also, to lay out some of the steps that he's taking. We know that he has tasked the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with leading an interagency group that's going to involve officials from various federal departments and agencies to look at how the United States handles these situations. And we also know that the White House is developing protocols going forward for how these types of objects are treated, whether or not they are shot down, and what indeed, would merit these objects being shot down. And one of the key factors here is looking at the height at which these objects were flying. That was part of what prompted the shootdowns over the weekend because they were flying in that range of commercial airspace, whereas that Chinese spy balloon was flying much higher at about 60,000 feet. And that's why they allowed that one to float over into the ocean before ultimately shooting it down.",

      "sentences": "So, Victor, Bianna, we are talking about a lot of vehicles here. Three hundred -- nearly 363,000 Teslas that are now being recalled by the company. That is a large portion of all four of their models. And it's because of that self -- full self- driving beta software that's on board. You can see the models on your screen. So, we're talking about certain model S, model X, model 3, and model Y vehicles spanning 2016 to 2023, depending on the model.And now we've gotten this recall notice from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and it really lays out what it says the problem is. It says that the self-driving software could allow the vehicle -- the Tesla vehicle to act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, it could enter a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or it could proceed into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution. And the system could respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits, or it may not adequately account for the driver's change in speed if it exceeds -- when it exceeds posted speed limits in the area. So, this report lays out Tesla's response as well saying that it was clear Tesla did not agree with the agency's analysis here, that the software was unsafe, but decided to issue this voluntary recall where they're going to be releasing this free over-the-air software update. The question now is how is this software update actually going to fix the problem. Remember, this technology has been under the microscope for years now. And this recall is coming less than a week after we saw an attack ad during the Super Bowl created by the Dawn Project that showed Tesla's smashing into mannequins of children claiming that the vehicles are using this unsafe software. Now according to this recall notice, Tesla has identified 18 warranty claims related to these issues. But as of now, no reports of any injuries or deaths. We are still waiting for a more -- formal response from Elon Musk, but I can tell you he just tweeted in the last few minutes saying that the word recall for this over-the-air software update is just flat wrong. So, again, that's the response from Tesla at this point, but the big headline here, 363,000 Tesla vehicles that are being recalled, Victor and Bianna.",

It is certainly possible that the president is completely right about these objects, and the intel community is completely right about them but they're -- the one thing that we have to be careful of is not to mirror image the way we do things with what other countries are doing because the distinction between the private sector and the public sector in other countries is not as profound as it is here in the United States. So, I wanted to be very cautious.These may be from a different entity. They may be something completely different. It may be completely benign.

      "speaker": "NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Exactly right, Victor. I mean, John Kirby, who is the spoke -- one of the spokespeople for the National Security Council did say earlier this week that it is the preliminary assessment of the intelligence community that these three objects that were shot down were not being used for intelligence purposes and that they were likely benign, they did not have hostile intent, and that they were likely balloons, but were not necessarily being used for surveillance. And that is something of course, that the president did echo here. Hedid say -- he did go a little bit further saying that they could have been, you know, tied to private companies, for example, are used for things like weather. But ultimately, it was the message that we've been hearing over the last week, which was that this was done out of an abundance of caution. And of course, that it was done because they were at a particular altitude that was potentially dangerous. Now, the one thing I did find particularly interesting about Biden's comments which did seem new is that the president has directed his team to come up with policy parameters so that they can better kind of figure out essentially what poses a threat in U.S. airspace and what doesn't, so that they're not constantly shooting things out of the sky, right, every time they see one. This was a really unprecedented series of events where they saw these three objects in one after the other and shot them down with U.S. fighter jets. And these policy parameters, the president said, will be classified so that enemies don't have a roadmap to evade our detection. So, clearly, moving forward, the president has heard some of this criticism that this was a bit much, right, and moving forward. They want to establish some kind of parameters so that they're not having to do this constantly because, you know, the American people as well as lawmakers, were saying that they need to know more about what the U.S. -- what the threshold is going to be right for actually taking these objects out.",

And there really isn't any national -- international law that applies to that right now. So yes, Secretary of State Tony Blinken could convene with other world leaders and try to figure out some new norm to apply to that.But China doesn't pay attention right now to the international waters issues off its coast. So, why is it going to sign on to anything that limits what it can do between 60 to 80,000 feet? Now, what shooting down those three objects did do, however, is notify anyone who might have gotten sloppy with following FAA or FCC regulations for their weather balloon launches, everyone is going to be really careful about filing their flight plan from now on.",

But I do think that what he did reveal today actually just shows how little he's able to say. I mean, he's talking about very sensitive national security issues, a lot of which is classified. And so, the degree to which he can be transparent to the American public is always going to be limited to some extent.I think it was important for him to explain what happened over the last several days and over the weekend and to make it clear to the American public that there was not this sort of ongoing, perpetual threat of these balloons flying over U.S. territory. But I think beyond that, I'm not sure what more he can say to the public. And I think the White House probably feels like this is as far as they are willing to go. I mean, they've really hesitated to even get to this point, to come out and speak. And I think that this might be barring some other kind of major incident. This might be one of the few times that we hear the president talking about this particular issue out in public, just given the sensitivity of the matter at hand here.",

The first of which was to make clear that the U.S. views this as a violation of U.S. sovereignty to have that balloon flying over the United States. The president called that violation of sovereignty unacceptable. And he reiterated that he makes no apologies for taking down that balloon.But on the other hand, you also heard President Biden talking about the future of the U.S.-China relationship. And this is something that he has come back to time and again, which is the notion that the United States doesn't see a conflict with China. But that while there will be competition, that it doesn't want that competition to boil over and to spill over into any kind of conflict. But the president throughout this really what I found interesting was he was not directly addressing the criticism that he has faced, but he was effectively addressing it by mentioning the fact that it was the military who advised him to wait, for example, until that balloon was over water in order to shoot it down. He referenced the fact that it was -- he was following the advice of the military in the case of those three balloons that were shot down over the weekend. That is also a reference to some of the criticism that the president and the U.S. military may have overreacted as it relates to these instances. So, President Biden very clearly wanting to show that he acted on this with purpose, and also to note that in allowing that balloon to cross over the United States, they were still able to protect those sensitive military sites and also able to track that balloon, analyze it, and get information out of it. That was also clearly a defense of his actions and a justification in the face of some of the criticism that he's faced over the last week.",
