Now, with waning support in the West for his enemies, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears more emboldened than ever to pursue his war on Ukraine. And he met with his Defense Minister today, saying Russia should expand on its recent battlefield success after the fall of Avdiivka. Putin mocked Ukrainian forces, saying they fled the town in chaos. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator): The leadership of the Ukrainian armed forces issued an order to withdraw its armed forces when they were already on the move and leaving the settlement. As I understand, that was done for political reasons in order to cover up the move and give it the appearance of an organized withdrawal. We see and know that was not the case. That it was in effect, they ran away in the literal sense of the word. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is a real possibility that Donald Trump may be elected again. Of course, Trump is already furthering Putin's goals by pressuring House Republicans to deny Ukraine additional aid and appending his party's tradition iron-clad support of NATO. Now to an update from the battle front in Russia's war on Ukraine. Ukrainian Air Force reporting on Monday it shot down two Russian fighter jets in the east. It says more Russian warplanes were shot down over the weekend. On the ground, Ukraine's Armed Forces said they held off Russian attacks in the Zaporizhzhia region after quote, \"difficult night\". And this dramatic video looking out from Ukraine shows the intense fighting with explosions ripping across the snow-covered fields. All this, of course, after a stunning loss for Kyiv. The Ukrainian military is expecting Russian forces to keep advancing after they captured Avdiivka in the Donetsk region. Let's get more on all of this, joining us now from Kyiv is our chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Christiane, great to see you. Let me pick up really with Avdiivka. For weeks on the show, we've been hearing from our correspondents saying that Ukrainian troops in the ground have been rationing ammunition. How much then is the fall of Avdiivka here linked to this waning support, Christiane, from U.S. What is the view from Kyiv?",

They held off the Russians, they pushed them back, and since the Western NATO started helping them with weapons, they more than held the lines. They regained territory. Now, obviously, the counteroffensive didn't go as planned. But here they're saying, and also indeed today at the White House, they said, that the congressional gridlock that disallows any Ukrainian military aid to get here in time is directly responsible, for instance, for the fall of Avdiivka over the weekend.

They pushed them away from Kharkiv and they were on the front foot, and Russia was on the back-foot. That was the moment that many international experts and many Ukrainian military experts said was a window of opportunity to rush aid in, military aid in, even up to they said, aircraft. Now, we saw over these years that a lot of aid was rushing in and even aircraft apparently have been promised, but too slow and late. Even with that, even with the late and the slow, Ukraine has held them off. Now, you can see the exact opposite. The minute the pipeline is frozen and that it doesn't move, it is -- it is showing up on the frontline. It's as brutal and as simple as that. Ukraine was trained, the people were able to use all the aid that was sent here, and they were motivated and they were holding the Russians off. And now it's a very difficult situation, and we're entering the third year of this war, and Ukraine is somewhat on the back-foot in those key areas that you were mentioning and showing on that map up there. So, they just hope that, you know, Congress will, in fact, get its act together and pass the aid that, you know, United States has been promising. And let's face it, for all of NATO, this has been about supporting and defending, you know, democracy and freedom and the international rules of the game. But also as Ukraine keeps saying, you know, Putin may not be satisfied with just Ukraine. It may go further. And that Ukraine is fighting the battle between Putin and the West. So, the battleground is being fought and upheld by Ukraine. And they're fighting it and not having to bring NATO soldiers here to fight it. So, the least they ask is the weapons to do it with.",

And yet, it's also important to keep in mind that the United States has once again today played its traditional role of defender of Israel at the United Nations Security Council, using its critical veto power to once again safeguard Israel from a potential resolution here, that Israel clearly was not in favor of. You know, and so, the United States, very much playing that role, also looking at this temporary ceasefire  resolution. And so, you're seeing them kind of try and stand by Israel, play their role of traditional stalwart ally, while also being increasingly vocal in their criticism of what they see Israel as doing is out of bounds. Israel for its part has not yet reacted to that temporary ceasefire resolution that the U.S. is currently drafting, but we did hear the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations slam Algeria's ceasefire resolution, which failed only because of that U.S. veto, saying that this ceasefire resolution would ensure only one thing. And he said that, that is the survival of Hamas. He also said that, that resolution would essentially ensure that the 130-plus hostages who remain in Hamas captivity would remain in Gaza. And he said that Israel does seek a ceasefire, but on its terms only. And those terms are to see Hamas unconditionally surrender and also to see the release of all of these hostages. So, there's no question that Israel is finding itself increasingly isolated on the world stage. The United States, once again, backing up Israel. But even there, it's clear that there are -- there is a lot of tension, and that tension could continue to escalate should Israel move into Rafah without properly accounting for the evacuation of civilians that would, of course, cross the line for the United States.",

      "sentences": "Well, officials are keeping the details fairly close to the vest, and you did hear President Bidensaying as he was leaving the White House to come out here to California, describe it as a major package of sanctions. And you'll remember back in 2021 when President Biden sat down with President Putin in Geneva, he actually warned him of, \"Devastating consequences if Alexei Navalny were to die in jail\". But the ensuing years, the U.S. has piled tons of sanctions on Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, so has many European countries, many in the West. So, it does limit, I think, the options that President Biden has on his plate to further punish Russia for this particular instance. But President Biden certainly making clear that he does hold Putin himself responsible for this death, whether he was directly responsible in the form of ordering up his killing or responsible through imprisoning him in this labor camp. The U.S. and President Biden making very clear that they hold the Kremlin and hold President Putin directly responsible. So, what sort of sanctions these looks like, I think, remains to be seen. We did hear from the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaking about this a little earlier. And he described this as sort of another crank, another turn of the wheel on the sanctions regime on Russia. He said that the U.S. had been, sort of, going through the targets. That it still had available to it and trying to identify where they could, sort of, tighten the noose even more on Moscow as they work to punish it, not only for the killing of Navalny, but also for the ongoing war in Ukraine. And so, certainly we will hear more about this later this week. But this all comes against this backdrop of this broader political debate in the United States about providing more assistance for Ukraine that has been caught up on Capitol Hill. A number of congressional Republicans just opposed to sending billions and billions more American dollars to Ukraine to sustain its fight against Russia. And I think, certainly, the death of Navalny only ratchets up the stakes of that debate. And President Biden has made clear, in his words, that history is watching and that not providing Ukraine the support it needs would essentially amount to handing a victory to Putin himself. And so, certainly, I think, this only ramping up the stakes for Biden as he tries to make this case to Congress. Isa.",

Do you agree with that? Would the city be under Russian occupation right now if U.S. military assistance, for example, had continued to flow uninterrupted? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.). FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE: Well, there's no doubt, Isa, that the West, the United States and others failed to deliver to Ukraine what was needed for them to continue the successful defense of Avdiivka, there's no doubt about that.

On the other hand, never in my life did I imagine that the Republican Party would be part of something that enabled Russia to have this kind of success. But I have to also say the president who, otherwise has done a good job here, the president has also failed to clearly identify that we want Ukraine to win. Nobody believes this statement anymore that, you know, we're with you for as long as it takes. Apparently, it doesn't look like we are.

They're actually is a lot of ammunition available, but most of what is produced is already on order for other customers, like in the UAE or Uganda, places like that. So, the European Union has to reprioritize where some of this ammunition is going to. And of course, they will have to protect companies somehow. These companies are not charities. So, there is ammunition available. Do we have the political will to do what's necessary to focus it towards Ukraine? That's where we are falling short. And I will say also, if the way that you neutralize Russian mass, what they're doing around Avdiivka, for example, is with long-range precision weapons that can destroy Russian headquarters, Russian artillery, Russian logistics. So, why does the administration continue to refuse to provide ATACMS, which is a 300-kilometer range weapon. It has that precision. This is where -- there's a disconnect.",
