This is what Trump posted.\"Through hard work, talent, and luck, I currently have almost five hundred million dollars in cash, a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president.\" Now, we should note that over the course of his long career, Donald Trump hasn't always been the most reliable arbiter of how much money he has in one place or another.

That is the very cash that Letitia James and the Democrats were targeting. So he's trying to say that this $500 million is the amount that Trump has said that he has earned from all of his properties, you know, which he has publicly disclosed, not saying that it is actually what he has on hand now because he's already posted $100 million bond for E. Jean Carroll, roughly. And, you know, they that -- but that still would leave about $350 million. You know, their position is that they can't put all of that into a bond because they have to run the business and do payroll and those sorts of things.

It's worth remembering that the last U.N Security Council resolution didn't go through because the U.S. vetoed it and said, look, what's important right now is the negotiations. That's the key and anything that upsets those, we have to avoid that in the U.S. said the last U.N. Security Council resolution risked doing that.
