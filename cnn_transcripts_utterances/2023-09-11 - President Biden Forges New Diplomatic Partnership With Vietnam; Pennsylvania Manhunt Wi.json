It was the strongest quake to hit this country in well over a century, and that epicenter of it was less than 50 miles from the historic city of Marrakesh in the Atlas Mountains.And that means that terrain has been has significantly complicated rescue and recovery efforts. Roads leading to some of the hardest-hit villages are destroyed. You can see the Moroccan armed forces here arriving at the epicenter for the first time just a few hours ago, taking days to get there. In some towns, people have been stranded for almost three days, begging for more help from the government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  You can smell the corpses everywhere. It's a shame the authorities didn't help these people. Some people have received aid, tents, and food. However, some villages have not received anything, especially in the mountainous areas with dangerous roads. I hope that the authorities and civil society will show more solidarity in these areas. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 2,000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late on Friday night. (on camera):  The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Moulay Brahim killed 25 people. Three or four are still missing, believe buried in the rubble. And this is a pattern that has been repeated throughout this province. And it looks very often like there's been some kind of airstrike, the collapsing buildings here actually leaving holes as if they have been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine. But this has been an all-too-natural disaster. (voice-over):  At least three elderly people have been entombed here in the remains of their hotel and a fourth guest is missing.

A South Korean government official tells CNN that Kim is believed to be traveling to Vladivostok, about 80 miles from the North Korean border inside Russia. The White House is again today urging North Korea not to provide or sell arms to Russia, as U.S. officials warned that heir arms negotiations between those two countries are actively advancing. Russian Defense Minister Mr. Sergei Shoigu visited Pyongyang himself in July, hoping to buy artillery ammunition to bolster the war effort in Ukraine, Russia running short there. U.S. officials tell us there are major concerns about what North Korea could get in return, and that Pyongyang wants technical help, not just for its satellite program, but also nuclear-powered submarines. CNN's Melissa Bell is following the story for us. She's in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Tell us more about this. It's not exactly a sign of strength for Russia to need North Korea's help in the war at this point, but it appears to be getting it.",

The American administration also saying, urging Pyongyang to stand by what had been public pronouncements that it would not be arming Russia during this war in Ukraine. And yet, as we're hearing, this train that you mentioned that is said to carry some 20 bulletproof wagons, it's not a very fast train, Jim. What we understand is that it'll take it a good day to get to Vladivostok. We're hearing also from the Russian side confirmation that this meeting is going ahead in the form of comments that have been made by Dmitry Peskov, who's the Kremlin spokesman, to a Russian journalist a short while ago speaking of bilateral talks that are to go ahead and an official dinner that's to be held in Kim Jong-un's honor. Now, what we understand is then that will be happening in Vladivostok. And, of course, the point is, and one of the reasons American officials have been warning about this, Jim, is that each side has something they can expect from the other, so, on the Russian side, very basic needs indeed, those munitions that I mentioned a moment ago, but also some of the raw materials to help Russia fuel its defense industrial base. On the other hand, Pyongyang is after much more, it is said, sophisticated weaponry, things like advanced satellites and nuclear- powered submarine capability. With each side looking to get something from this, these much-feared talks do seem now to be going ahead, Jim.",

So the North Koreans conveniently have the same types of weapon systems that the Russians have, at least the older systems that the Russians use. And that includes the same caliber type of weapon, like a 152-millimeter rocket. That would be something North Koreans have in abundance. They could use some of their stockpile to help the Russians with their efforts. Of course, raw materials, another big thing. And, of course, rockets and missiles, they have been delivering them all the time. Finished products, as well as the raw materials to make those products, are key elements there.",

The issue that you run into, though, with sanctions, as you mentioned, really run out of effectiveness. So what could they do? We could mount, for example, a cyberattack against North Korea. Not saying they're going to do that, but that is something that's in our arsenal that we could potentially do. There are other things that we could do potentially that would get closer to a conflict with them. But I don't think we would go that far. But that is something that we would have to look at. We could also potentially go after other people that are connected to the North Koreans, maybe Chinese officials, Chinese businessmen, people that are facilitating these kinds of things, and as well as, of course, Russian businessmen that would be doing the same thing. SANCHEZ:  And potentially some clandestine options that we won't hear very much about. Meantime, on the Ukrainian front, there's a disparity between the top U.S. general, Mark Milley, and officials in Kyiv over how much longer the Ukrainian counteroffensive can last, given that weather conditions are going to be changing very soon.",

So, basically, what you're looking at is, in places like this, you have got cold fronts that would be coming into areas like here. You have got all kinds of things that could change. And, of course, it's a muddy season again. Just like the spring is, the fall is also a muddy season in Ukraine. So one of the things that they would be looking at is actually changing the way in which they would ramp up weapon systems to this area. I think the chairman was basically incorrect in saying that this was a time limit that the Ukrainians have, but the Ukrainians know best the rhythms of the battlefield. And the key thing is, with climate change, it's highly likely that the fighting season is extended anyways.",

They are targeting the northern part of Chester County. It's probably about 30 miles or so north of where the prison has been. But this is the state of play right now. They are not searching in the perimeter that they focused so much time on, and they lost him once he slipped that perimeter. Let me explain, though, because I -- in order to really drill down on the importance of this moment in this case, you have to understand where we were back on Friday. Remember, just a few miles from where we are at the command center,that was where the perimeter had been set up. There were the largest number of law enforcement officers that had been on the job for this entire manhunt just on Friday going into Saturday. We saw people checking cars, checking trunks. That's the environment that Cavalcante was able to escape. So let's talk a little bit about what we learned yesterday. Cavalcante slipped that perimeter. And law enforcement said that he actually was able to steal a van from a dairy farm nearby, and it was because the keys were left in that van. Then he drove more than 20 miles to the Phoenixville area. And, as you said, he tried to contact some of his known associates. Well, the associates did not offer him help, but we did get insight into what he was doing, because he was spotted on a Ring doorbell camera. And that's where we saw the most recent image change, clean-shaven, now wearing a green hoodie. Then, yesterday law enforcement found the van. It was abandoned, though. Cavalcante was nowhere to be seen. Now, Brianna, I want to take a listen to what a former roommate of Cavalcante actually told one of CNN's affiliates over the weekend.
