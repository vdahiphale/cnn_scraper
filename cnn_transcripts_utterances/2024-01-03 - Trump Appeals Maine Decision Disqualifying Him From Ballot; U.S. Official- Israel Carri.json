Trump's lawyers arguing in their appeal that Bellows was a, quote, biased decision-maker with no legal authority. Here's Bellows last night on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The key about this case is that this judge has already found that he is liable for the defamatory statements that he made in 2019, that was based on the jury, a separate jury's decision back in May about related false statements that he made, so in that jury trial back in May, the jury found that he was liable for $5 million in damages.And so the judge now that's presiding over this case that is coming up says, look, that issue has been decided. He is liable for defamation, so the only question that is going to be handled by this new jury here in January is just how much Donald Trump has to pay in damages for his misconduct.

That official also says the Biden administration was not told of the operation in advance. Reporter Elliott Gotkine is live for us in Tel Aviv. Elliott, good morning to you. What are you hearing about this? Are there signs of retaliation for what Hamas is now calling an assassination?",

      "sentences": "No signs yet, Kasie, and the big concern is not so much that Hamas will return. Let's not forget that Hamas and Israel is engaged in a war ever since the militant group carried out its massacre of October the 7th. So, I don't think the fear is the retaliation from Hamas, but mostly from Hamas.Let's not forget that this attack, which Israel has not officially claimed responsibility for, took place in the southern of Beirut, in Lebanon, which is usually where we have flare-ups between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian proxy which is based in southern Lebanon, and which has been firing rockets and drones and missiles towards Israel since October the 7th. And to which Israel has been responding in kind. So, I think the concern is that this could escalate what's already what's already a kind of simmering war on the border between Israel and Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, and turn it into an all out war. But, of course, the question is, does Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, really want to expand its arsenal and its intentions on escalating here, because of this assassination of Hamas leader. And I should also point out that it's something that Israel seemed quite keen to avoid. We heard from Mark Regev, one of the spokesmen of the Israeli government saying, without taking responsibility, that this appear to be a targeted strike aimed at Hamas and wasn't aimed Hezbollah. The implication being this should not be seen as a reason to escalate. But it's so interesting that we do hear these from U.S. officials, from Israeli officials, and yet the official Israeli line is -- well, you know, we're not saying we did not do it and yet you heard also from Danny Danon, this is a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations. He's from President Benjamin Netanyahu's own Likud Party, posting on X, formerly Twitter, of his congratulations to the Israeli security forces. And saying that they were responsible for the massacre of October 7th, you know, Israel will close accounts with them. And it's also worth noting, Kasie, that as well as having the means and motivation, Israel has made threats to take out Hamas leaders wherever they are in the world -- Kasie.",

And there would be a severe reaction.So this concern that about this reaction from Hezbollah, but also crucially Iran that backs Hezbollah and is a big player really in that region. A big concern when it comes to regional war. A spokesperson to the foreign ministry saying, I will give you this quote. The killing would undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers, not only in Palestine but also in the region, and amongst all freedom-seekers worldwide. So concerned that it would stoke tensions in the sort of places where a regional war could potentially explode. But this is all words and we have a lot of words certainly over this war.

I mean, we've had developments here. The Israeli defense minister has said that there will be some change, and also, interestingly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was saying that there had been ultimatum from Hamas on the release of hostages that are still held in Gaza. It's not clear to me exactly what that ultimatum was, but he does say it is now, quote/unquote, soften slightly. What does that mean to you?",

He seemed to refer to that position being soft and we haven't heard from Hamas on that.Again, very difficult to get confirmation on all of that we just have to look at really what Qatar is saying and whether or not there's any progress in hostage negotiations. That could be the source of that. So, there's some hope obviously amongst the families that could lead to some progress on hostage negotiations. On the war itself, thousands of troops being brought back into Israel, so the suggestion from that is that they are tamping down the aggression. I don't think that's true. We've heard the defense minister and Netanyahu say they are in for a long war. I think, effectively, they're bending in. They need to retrain troops, perhaps. Or give them in. There was a lot of pressure on the economy right now with all these reservists in actions. So, they need to bring them back to help with the economy. But, certainly, the war isn't ending anytime soon, but it might be entering a different phase, I guess.",
