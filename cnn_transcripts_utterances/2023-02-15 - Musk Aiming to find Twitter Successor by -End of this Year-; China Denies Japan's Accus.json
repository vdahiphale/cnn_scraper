Justahead on today's show dramatic rescue is still taking at this place in earthquake ravaged Turkey and Syria. The death tolls they're now surpassing 41,000. We're live with the latest. Plus, a surprise development in U.K. politics Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon announcing her resignation, Sturgeon is the longest serving Scottish First Minister, she says it's simply time to move on. We have a live report. But first important economic out numbers just out in the U.S. and they've come in surprisingly strong retail sales up by a much better than expected 3 percent in January. That's after two straight monthly drops, sales excluding autos also beating expectations, Americans apparently still ready to shop despite a stubbornly high inflation. As we found out Tuesday, consumer prices still not coming down as fast as the Fed but like food and energy prices in fact heading in the opposite direction. U.S. stocks are on track for a lower open as investors try to debate how the Fed will respond to all of this new data. You can see the DOW; NASDAQ and S&amp;P futures all off by about three tenths to half a percent. Let's call it economist fearing that the U.S. Central Bank will have to hike rates much higher than expected in the months ahead. Investors of course, had been hoping for a Fed rate hike pause. Let's get more on today's economic numbers. Paul R LA Monica joins me now. So Paul, will you look at this report. Look, it's the biggest retail jump and almost two years what stands out to you? Where are people still spending strongly? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, this was an amazingly strong report Rahel, you have to look at the fact that consumers clearly are willing to go back out into the real world, if you will, and spend on things like dining out you saw the surge in the sales, retail sales numbers for food and drinking establishments. So people clearly willing to spend money despite the fact that inflation remains persistently high. And it was a very strong report across the board across so many different categories like clothing, autos, it was very solid, but it's going to probably give the Fed more reason to raise rates, as you mentioned, for a longer because they want to get inflation down and cool off the economy just a little bit.",

There's been chatter that perhaps NicolaSturgeon wouldn't be leading the party into the next election, which has to be January 2025, and Scotland at the latest, but the speed of this came entirely unexpected. Journalists were scrambling to be there for the announcement this morning. Now, the reasons that Sturgeon gave were a mixture of personal and political, she did say that she wanted to spend more time focusing on Nicola Sturgeon, the person being able to see her friends and taking some of the burden off her family. She spoke about how the political climate had become more brutal in recent years, and that people perhaps don't understand the toll that that can take. But her reasons were also political, and she said that she didn't want to be taking key decisions for the party if she wasn't 100 percent sure that she'd be leaving it in months or years to come that she wanted them to be able to have a fresh start. But of course, behind all of this Rahel, is inextricably linked to Sturgeon and the SNP the question of independence and whether or not sturgeons continued role at the helm of government and the party is really the best thing to try and achieve that.",

But if we learn nothing new, then we could perhaps interpret as part of a trend or perhaps normalization of the idea of leaders stepping down and acknowledging when they feel burnout rather than clinging on to the very last having to be pushed out. Like for example, Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, all politicians that deny that they've lost an election. It's interesting that they are both female leaders. As you mentioned, Ardern, who's in her 40s, Sturgeon is in her 50s, saying that she just didn't have enough gas left in the tank and Nicola Sturgeon also talking about the fact that it does take a toll. And I've been working in politics and covering politics for more than a decade. And there has definitely been a worsening of conditions in some respects for members of parliament and politicians. Of course, people are justifiably critical of their leaders, but the fact that you can't escape this criticism, whether it's trolling on social media, or concerns about your personal security, or the security of your family. It's hard to ever get a break from it. And I think it is more all-consuming and all encompassing. And perhaps these two leaders have acknowledged that and recognize that the political calculus means that they just not in the best position to achieve what's most important to them in that role.",

The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not like this accusation, it firmly rejected this and accused Japan of participating in a smear campaign against Beijing. And of course, the tensions continue to between Washington and Beijing ever since that Chinese balloon was detected at the beginning of February, flying nearly across all of the U.S. and then being shut down by a U.S. fighter jet. And last week, the U.S. slapping sanctions on 6 Chinese companies linked to China's Military Aerospace Industry. We heard this threat from China that it might take some kind of actions, unspecified, against entities in the U.S. that are threatening China, this back and forth continues to go on where China has accused the U.S. of flying balloons over Chinese airspace something that Washington denies.

And just weeks before that invasion, in February of last year, the Chinese and Russian leaders stood side by side and declared that they had a friendship, a partnership with no limits. So not only is Wang Yi visiting France, but he will also visit Italy, Hungary, which has taken a much softer position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And he is expected to address the Munich Security Conference this weekend. And that's going to be attended by NATO countries that are rushing weapons like tanks and anti-aircraft defenses to Ukraine. So it'll be interesting to hear what kind of align he will take at that meeting. And then he's expected to go meet with senior Russian officials in Moscow as well. That's coming up to the one-year anniversary of this disastrous war. One final note, Rahel, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will also be at that Munich Security Conference.

U.S. stocks are lower across the board DOW, NASDAQ, S&amp;P all off by about half a percent, the NASDAQ is off one quarter of a percent.

So social security checks were a little bit higher, there was deep discounting after the holidays. So they were sales that Lord people to buy things they might have put off at the end of the year. So you see this roaring back of consumer spending, even accounting for inflation. This isn't just higher prices for what you're paying for things, its higher prices and buying more of it. And this is the strongest growth we've seen from month to month since March 2021. So the feels, to me a little like reopening kind of euphoria, food, bars and restaurants for cars. So there's some pent up demand for cars. So that's part of this number is a car sales. So that could be temporary. I mean, you don't buy a new car and then buy another new car, right. So that could taper off a little bit here, but certainly a strong number overall. And 6.4 percent year-on-year, I mean, again, outstripping really kind of inflation. So it's a lot of different things at play here. And you know, I've been looking my sources, you know, emailing, you know, this is a stake in the heart of recession fears. Another one says a surge in sales eases the first quarter recession fears. I mean, this is not recessionary kind of behavior.
