Now, the reason for that is because these groups are very close to Iran politically and geographically. And crucially, they haven't been degraded in a way that other proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon have been, which in the words of one analyst who I spoke to earlier today, is now fighting for its existence. That analyst, who is a former colonel in Israeli intelligence, telling us that she thinks there's a high possibility that any response from Iran will come through Iraqi militia groups that are pro-Iranian. As you mentioned, the Israeli government has said it's on a high state of readiness in case there is kind of some kind of a response. But they're not going out there yet and saying, look, we definitely know there will be one. They're saying they're still looking at the decision-making process inside the Iranian leadership to determine whether or not or what exactly Iran intends to do. So, you know, the country very much sort of bracing itself, waiting to see what Tehran does in the days and the weeks ahead.",

There are 101 of them still being held inside the Gaza strip. And even though it's positive that talks are underway to try and, you know, make that happen, you know, there's been no progress really on any of those fronts. There's been an intensification of Israeli strikes in Lebanon and in Gaza. And, of course, the hostages are still very much in uncertain circumstances being held inside the Gaza strip.",

Here in the image, you can see some of these volunteers and personnel are right now working, trying to remove all the mud, the water, the debris that was blocking this road. And this is important because that's the only way that the emergency service can get inside of these cities. Mayors of these towns are asking for immediate help to get some water, some food for their citizens. Also, it's important to highlight, in this road, as in many others here, there were tons of cars and vans that were blocking the traffic. We were told earlier that some of the officers deployed in this point that they have worked severely over the last hours. And while they were towing away some of these cars, they found some bodies inside. Now, this is what the authorities are fearing the most, the finding of bodies in different parts of this very affected cities. Right now, the toll, by the latest update from the authorities, is that 202 people died because of this flood water. So now it's a task of rescue against the clock to try to find with life all these people that were reported missing. CNN, Pau Mosquera, Chiba, Spain. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There we're two lawsuits that I filed ,both, by the way, were on behalf of senior Homeland Security officials from Republican administrations who are arguing for tougher border security. But here's the thing. He's saying this and making up these lies because he doesn't want to talk about his own record of failure on this issue. Both Democrats and Republicans have completely failed when it comes to solving the crisis at the southern border. And folks here in my district are incredibly frustrated with it. Incredibly frustrated with Democrats pointing fingers, Republicans pointing fingers, everybody playing games with this instead of solving the problem.

And when he got to Congress, he voted, not one time, not two times, not three times, not four times. He voted 13 times to restrict women's access to abortion services. And I know he's pleading with everybody to believe him now that he wouldn't support a national abortion ban. But here's the truth. When he was behind closed doors in the fall of 2022, right after Roe v. Wade fell, he expressed his support for an abortion ban. And here's the -- here's the most important thing on this. I believe you asked him, I've asked him, voters have asked him, would you please support the Women's Health Protection Act and put Roe v. Wade back into law? And he refuses to do it. It's been sitting on his desk for two years, and he won't do it. I'm making a commitment to my voters. You send me to Congress, I will sponsor the Women's Health Protection Act.

And obviously, the top of the ticket matters, especially in a place like New York that is expected to go blue as it has over multiple previous presidential cycles.I'm wondering what it's like to run in a situation where, whatever Vice President Kamala Harris does, whatever former President Donald Trump does, impacts your race so much. Especially when we've heard some of the rhetoric that we've heard from President Biden calling Trump supporters \"trash\" to multiple things that Trump has said about --for example, women saying that he's going to protect women even if they don't want protection.

And to this day, I don't know whether my neighbors and friends are Democrats and Republicans. I know there's a lot of folks who support President Trump and they're the people who raised me, and they're wonderful people. They're not garbage. With respect to the top of the ticket affecting this race, I actually don't see it the way you described it. Voters in this district -- we're not a swing state for the presidential election. Voters in this district are focused on the issues that matter in this district. One of the things that I talk about probably the most on the campaign trail is bringing good manufacturing jobs back home to communities that have been hollowed out by terrible trade deals. Communities that have been sold out because the big special interests come in and buy a whole bunch of politicians with the corporate PAC checks. We're all just sort of fed up with all of that, and we want change. And that's what I'm running for. And that doesn't change based on what's happening at the top of the ticket.",
