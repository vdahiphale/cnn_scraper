At least two that we know made a direct impact.The Iron Dome activated, lighting up the night sky, and really even by the standards of what we have been seeing over and over again over the last 37, 40 hours now. This was a particularly fearsome barrage of rockets. Again, it does seem to be a little quieter now. We have been hearing a lot of planes overhead.

There was clearly a very fearsome battle that went on between Israeli forces and these Hamas militants.Thousands of young revelers as you said had gathered at this peace festival. It was supposed to be they were dancing the night away, they were celebrating the end of high holidays, and at about 6:00 a.m., a barrage of rockets started. Then according to people who were on the ground basically all hell broke loose. Militants stormed the festival. They began killing people. Shooting people, stabbing people, kidnapping people. Most crucially, Wolf, it's still difficult to know about the fate of some of the people who attended. We spoke as you mentioned to that NGO or volunteer group that basically has been helping to identify some of the human remains. They said that at least 260 bodies have been found there but there are still people unaccounted for, and as I said, we saw the bodies of many Hamas militants along that way. Those bodies have been left out. We saw evidence that, again, Israeli forces have put up quite a fight there. One situation where an Israeli police truck had T-boned what appeared to be a truck full of Hamas militants. So certainly, it was a brutal, bloody battle. It went on for hours. Some of these young people were hiding. They were calling their loved ones. They were desperately begging to be rescued and so many of these people still don't know where their loved ones are. Have they been taken hostage? Have they been killed and not yet identified -- Wolf.",

Hamas has claimed that it's had multiple fighters who have been able to infiltrate across that border as early as this morning. We certainly passed the scene or came close to a scene, we had to turn around, where Israeli forces were engaged in some kind of a firefight with what they believed to be Hamas militants on the ground.And I would say that really is the sort of all pervasive fear at the moment, Wolf. One understands that there are multiple things that Israeli forces are contenting with, but the priority at the moment seems to be very narrowly focused on trying to ensure that these towns, these villages, these border areas are completely cleared out or that Hamas militants are completely cleared out of these villages so that people can safely be extracted from their homes. Some of them have been sheltering in place now for almost 48 hours. So that is clearly the most burning priority for Israelis on the ground.",

As I mentioned, the first priority is to stop the infiltration, to fix the border. We saw a lot of materials like heavy building materials being taken, assuming that that was to try to repair these areas where those breaches were made. Then beyond that, of course, you have the priority of trying to rescue these hostages who are being held captive, trying to ascertain how many of them are still alive. Where they're being held.Then you have the broader issue of how to deal with Hamas' leadership inside the Gaza Strip. There have been a number of air strikes throughout the day but the real question is whether that will be followed up by some kind of a ground incursion. Certainly from what we saw today moving up and down that area along the border, a huge amount of military hardware is funneling in. A lot of reserve is funneling in. We saw tanks, we saw armored personnel carriers, and we only expect to see that tempo continue. And as you said, Wolf, there is no sense yet of how long this would take but Israel's leaders are certainly telling people to brace themselves for a long fight ahead -- Wolf.",

As you know, the fact that there is not a permanent House speaker really means that the U.S. is in unchartered territory right now.Over the weekend, we heard one U.S. official saying that this is simply a unique situation and U.S. officials are trying to sort of figure out given this political situation what exactly can they do, and can they not do. For example, as we were discussing before, if the U.S. determines that it wants to get through Congress an assistance package for Israel, how does that exactly work when you appear to have a not permanent House speaker who isn't able to sort of exercise the full authority that a permanent House speaker would have? So there is a messy situation on Capitol Hill that the White House is currently having to contend with, but they are being very frank right now that they, too, are sort of figuring out what exactly this means for any future aid that they might want to give to Israel.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So one of the big things, Oren, that you have to look at with a carrier strike group like this is that it's a presence, it's a military presence in the region, and every time there's trouble in the region, you send a carrier strike group to show the flag of the United States. This aircraft carrier can have up to 70 aircrafts on it. In some cases all the way up to 90. It holds strike group. And so it's a formidable force. Includes such weapons as the F-35, and also has F-18s on it, so it is a major player in the region anytime it goes into an area.",

And one of the key things that you have to look at is, you know, this is a really densely populated area because the way in which all of these areas are mapped out, you have the highest population density in the world in this very small, you know, less than 130 I think square miles area, and that is something that is really, really difficult when you have a whole region like this.

So surely, Iran is very opposed to the potential of this deal? Yes, they have a long relationship with Hamas. And of course, Hezbollah is sort of an arm of the Iranian government effectively. So, you know, we don't know what's going to happen next. But that's the kind of scenario that we're looking at.",

There are concerns, I think that this will be among the options down the line being presented to the Israeli Security Cabinet as what the Israeli military might do is some kind of attack against Iran, particularly if they see a lot of Iranian fingerprints on this Hamas operation, which does have, I have to say, all of the hallmarks of a specialist operation. It is certainly advised by if not devised and supplied by Iran. I think that would be a possibility of sort of direct involvement by Iran.I don't think that they would want to get any of their personnel directly involved. They have got their personnel, of course in Syria, and they have been hit in Syria in the past by Israel and not retaliated directly using Iranian personnel. But obviously, using proxies such as Hezbollah, and of course, Hamas. So I think they would rely here on Hamas as a proxy, Hezbollah as a proxy, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which they also back as a proxy, but I think they'd be unlikely to get directly involved. More likely, though, is potentially -- only potentially down the line, Israel, treating this moment as their 9/11 moment and seeing if they can't, if they were so minded, do some kind of preemptive strike, for example, against the Iranian nuclear facilities.",

They could have, of course, an equal and opposite reaction, because Iran now will be blamed by those three big elements even though the Saudis are supporting the Palestinians, they will be very unhappy by the use of this very extreme form of violence.And of course, the hostage crisis is likely now to play out and really dominate all political and diplomatic activity once even after the guns have fallen temporarily silent. That is going to be where the diplomacy will lie. That will be the focus of Israel's efforts and those will involve, no doubt, back channels through Qatar, Egypt, possibly even ultimately, what Hamas wants is direct talks with Israel over these hostages.",
