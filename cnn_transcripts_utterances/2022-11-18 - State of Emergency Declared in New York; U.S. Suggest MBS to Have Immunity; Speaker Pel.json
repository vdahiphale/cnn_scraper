That was seen as a move to help strengthen MBS's immunity claim. The State Department says sovereign immunity is based on, quote, \"longstanding and well-established principles of common law,\" and its suggestion of immunity for MBS in Khashoggi's murder is purely a legal determination. It did, however, condemn the murder as heinous. Khashoggi's fiance and human rights group DAWN filed a civil lawsuit in Washington back in 2020 against MBS and 28 others involved. And as you say, Kim, U.S. intelligence concluded that the crown prince ordered the murder of Khashoggi who was an outspoken critic of MBS.

It was in the air for one hour and nine minutes.Now in response, South Korea, actually conducted its own exercise. They conducted what they're calling a transporter erector launcher striking exercise. Now, a TEL, a transporter erector launcher, that's what North Korea likely launched this ICBM from in the Sunan area of Pyongyang, that's where their international airport is. These are the kind of this big thing that you roll the missile out, and then -- and then you can basically aim and fire on relatively short notice. It's very difficult for spy satellites to detect a transport or erector launcher. But what South Korea demonstrated with their own exercise was they had their F-35 stealth fighters, you know, fly in and destroy, you know, a mockup of one of these things.
