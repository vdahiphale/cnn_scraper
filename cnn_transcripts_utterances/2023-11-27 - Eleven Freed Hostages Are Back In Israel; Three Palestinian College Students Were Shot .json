For every one of those 11 people who are experiencing their first day of freedom since October 7th, there are others who are still being held hostage. I mean, just think of it. All the kids released today by Hamas still have fathers in captivity. And for seven weeks, we've all been waiting. We've talked to mothers, we've talked to fathers, sisters, brothers. While so many of their loved ones are still unaccounted for, there are others whose tonight, their prayers have been answered. Remember Erez Kalderon, who turned 12 in captivity along with his 16- year-old sister, Sahar? I talked to their mother, Hadas, just three weeks after they were taken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ofrit, thank you so much for joining us.I mean, it's so hard for so many people to wrap their minds around even the stories that are coming out of what so many people endured. We are yet to scratch the surface, as you can imagine, of what else has taken place. We've been watching these videos, Ofrit, of helicopters, of vans bringing hostages to hospitals. How are doctors getting ready to receive these hostages? And, of course, you've got the physical, you've got the mental that's going to come along with it. OFRIT SHAPIRA-BERMAN, PROFESSOR, HEBREW UNIVERSITY: So, hello. Good morning. At least in Israel, it's morning. First of all, it's important to say again that the western world has actually no experience in treating children who were held as hostages or so many women or actually so many men. The men aren't back yet. So, what we've been doing here in Israel is actually reading every piece of article that has ever been published. I think the medical examinations are probably a little bit easier to figure out. I mean, the physicians probably know what they need to check. They're doing blood tests and all other kind of stuff. They're trying to figure out what's the short-term effect of the captivity and what will be the long-term effects. We will need to find out. The mental state is probably the more difficult issue because those people who are taking hostages have all witnessed the most horrific atrocities before they were taken kidnapped. They were all seeing other people being murdered. Very often, their own parents or their own siblings. And then they were taken away to a place that we consider to be one of the most dangerous places, at least for us. They were held underground, overground, often without food, very, very often without at least one of the parents. In the case of many of the children, without either parents. And, you know, while you were showing the segments and you were interviewing Idit, I couldn't see the picture, I was just hearing the voices, and I could literally feel how my heart is broken again because I've spent a lot of hours with people who have survived the massacre and with families of those who were kidnapped.

Tahseen is here as a Palestinian citizen.And, you know, Hisham, as an Irish citizen in Ireland, would be recognized as a person and supported in his experience, his historical experience and his cultural experience. The Irish are incredibly supportive of the Palestinians. In America, the mainstream media and certain high-level government officials have called for really brutal action against the Palestinians, the Palestinians in Gaza, and have stood by or the other ones have stood by as the one in 200 Palestinians have been killed. I mean, the equivalent of the deaths in Gaza in America is roughly a million people in proportion to the U.S. population. So, I think, you know, Hisham and Kinnan and Tahseen, I haven't asked them about this specifically, but in this context, which is very toxic towards Palestinians and Muslims and Arabs and in a current cultural state where people are othered very easily, it is easy to make a link between the actions that dehumanize Palestinians in general and the actions of someone who used his gun to express his opinion. We are still waiting for the details of the investigation. I was really impressed with the Burlington Police and the U.S. government. They very quickly moved to resources to allow for the investigation of this as a hate crime. The investigation is still ongoing, and I trust that it will be -- we will get information as it comes out. But this is a dangerous time in America if you are associated with a group that is involved in these conflicts. There is too much hate speech against all sides.

There is not a single group in this country more loyal than Black women and followed by Black men.And while you see some movement here and there, it is not proportionate in terms of our overall support for the Democratic Party. Now, that's not to say that African-Americans are going to all of a sudden support Donald Trump. That's not what I'm saying at all, Laura. But what I am saying is that if the Democratic Party wants to continue to receive the support from Black voters, particularly younger Black voters, there have to be real deliverables, tangibles that people can feel and say, okay, this is what I'm getting in exchange for my vote.
