Just 862 votes -- 862 votes separate the two, Laxalt is in the lead for now. But there are still votes left to count that could come in at any moment. This is why Nevada is so crucial. The balance of power in the Senate right now is tied at 49 each. If Democrats can keep Nevada, they control the Senate. Next door in Arizona, a big win for Democrats last night with Senator Mark Kelly holding on to his seat against the challenge from the Trump-backed Republican contender Blake Masters. Over in the house, Republicans are just seven seats away from taking the majority there. The Democrats are still in the hunt. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Nevada for us. Rosa, election officials and Clark County have a massive task on their hands. And they are trying to get through all of this. They said that they'll have a release of a new count later on tonight.

I think, you know, one of my arguments about American history and American reality is that there was never a once upon a time, and there's never going to be a happily ever after, because this is a human undertaking. It has to do with our habits (ph) of heart and mind. It has to do with human frailty and our fallen (ph) natures, and just trying to get just enough right.But that's what America is at its best, right? It's that just enough of us do the right thing, just enough of the time, that we keep this experiment and the journey toward a more perfect union going. And I think what was so unsettling, and you were at a front row seat over the last five years or so was this notion that perhaps just enough of us weren't going to show up anymore. And that appetite and ambition, the appetite and ambitions of one interest, one party, one person were going to triumph over what American politics ought to be, which is an attempt to win elections, create solutions to given problems, for a given period of time. And then doing it all again. That's what politics is. It can't be total war every afternoon. It can't be total war by tweet. It can't be total war by election. It has to be a mediation of differences. And I think President Biden's victory in 2020 was the first great act in this drama of trying to create a longer lease on life for this experiment. And I think in many ways, 2022 will stand as a really important midterm election, as important, really, as any I can think of. You know, heck, Abraham Lincoln lost functional control of the House of Representatives in the middle of the Civil War.

Historically, as you were saying, you know, presidents struggle. The party in power struggles during a midterm, and President Biden's approval rating was in the 40s, the economy was getting low marks from voters.

I mean if you think about civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights. that's the story of the country. And in our best moments have been moments, where we have expanded the capacity of people to determine their own destinies within the constitutional structure, as opposed to limiting them.

If you change the prism a little bit, and think of it as liberty, thatis not religious tolerance, but religious liberty, then liberty is sacrosanct. Nobody can take away your liberty. Tolerance comes and goes. And at the core of the American insight is that we are free people. And that applies to our health care decisions. It applies to our decisions about how we want to make a living, how we want to raise our families, and who we want to vote for. And I think that that sensibility was very much in the country. It's been manifested in the vote.

We know that both airplanes involved were part of the airshow, and (INAUDIBLE) of the Air Force.The big air show for World War II airplanes and both of these airplanes both served in World War II. A B-17 Flying Fortress, the bomber that you've seen in movies over and over again, and a P-63, a pursuit plane. Those are exceedingly rare -- there are only about eight B-17 (AUDIO GAP) maybe even fewer p-63s, probably three or four worldwide. You can see in the video and it's horrific that P-63 ran into the B-17 bomber, the larger airplane. And a rain of parts came down in the middle of this air show, and had a huge fireball. What we're hearing preliminarily is that nobody on the ground was hurt. These air shows involve a lot of risk and a lot of discipline from the pilots. It is a practice and well-perform thing that they do. But the issue here is that we just don't (ph) know all that much about how this took place. What was going on at the time, if the pilot of one of the airplanes lost sight of the other one? We do know that these airplanes were performing in the air show. They were not giving (AUDIO GAP) at the (AUDIO GAP) the FAA investigators. But right now, they're just learning about this as well. And they're just getting early information, too. So as we get more from federal authorities, which will no doubt be investigating this, we will share it with our audience. But also, it's important to note out that this video that you are seeing will be a huge part of this investigation. You know, in an era where everyone has a camera, these are really key investigative details that investigators will be looking at to try and figure out exactly what went wrong here. Beyond the obvious loss of life, what is also so sad about this is that these people who fly World War II airplanes like this devote so much immense skill and resources to try and keep this flying (INAUDIBLE) a piece of living history. We've seen that go horribly awry today. It's also important to note that in air shows across the country, these happen every weekend. This was on Veterans Day weekend. Of course, that is, you know, a big reason why these were flying, and underscores the importance of the sacrifice the veterans have made. But (INAUDIBLE) in decades since somebody on the ground was hurt or killed. It's an incredible risk to the pilots and they know the risk, but also, the audience is typically very safe.
