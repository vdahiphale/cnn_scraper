One of them was Ethiopian-born. Another one is a Bedouin. Again, back to that oppressor versus the oppressed construct that he was trying to shatter, they're not all white people in Israel.

It's prime time. I have - all the big TV networks were broadcasting this live and he tried to reassert his image to the Israeli people as the one who's the most influential politician in America. Why is he doing this? Because he came here as a very weak Israeli prime minister. Seventy- two percent of Israelis, according to several posts, said that they want him to resign. More or less the same number says he wants early elections. His favorability is 30 percent in all the polls - 30-, 32 percent on a good day. You know what he did not say in that speech? A word that he did not say since the beginning of the war, since October 7th, he did not say it was under my watch. He did not say I'm taking responsibility. He did not say I will do whatever it takes to repair everything I've done and my - everything my government has done. And a lot of Israelis were watching this tonight know exactly that. He used the soldiers as political props. He did a lot of his, you know, regular shticks during speeches. This, you know, I could have written the speech five days ago and it would look more or less the same. So I think I'm not sure how much this speech will help him back home as he expects.",

      "sentences": "And can we just emphasize where things stand right now? We are almost 10 months into this war, and Netanyahu has said that some 14,000 Hamas fighters have been killed. Even if we take that number to be true, and of course there's almost no way of verifying, that's only half of the Hamas fighting force.When you look at the leadership, there's only one of the top three leaders who has been confirmed killed. There's possibly a second - likely a second Mohammed Deif, the head of the military wing who has also been killed. Yahya Sinwar, the overall leader of Hamas, remains alive. We are 10 months into this war and a significant portion of Hamas is still on the battlefield. So I think it's very interesting to see that evolution of the Netanyahu language there. For months and months, he defined total victory as the eradication, the erasing of Hamas. And now he's talking about it in a way that we've heard some American officials talking about it, degrading them militarily, taking away their ability to govern. They are not governing the Gaza Strip right now. No one's governing the Gaza Strip. And in fact, U.S. officials believe that Yahya Sinwar and Hamas are ready to relinquish the control of Gaza. But I think one of the greater concerns is going to be in the long run, you are inevitably going to have a strong ideology in Hamas that is only growing more popular, both within - among Palestinians and in the Arab world because they are seen as resistance, and thousands of fighters left on the battlefield and a large pool of Palestinians who have been facing what we - this utter devastation for the past 10 months, who will be ripe for recruiting in - as future militants.",

And listen, there is a sense that Americans do need to be more educated on what's going on there, on the history of anti-Semitism, on the ways in which anti-Semitic tropes led to the Holocaust.

And then when it comes to the big question that they all have, when are my family members going to come home, he did promise that.

      "sentences": "Yes. That's right, Dana. I think the Israeli prime minister paid a lot of lip service to the issue of the hostages. He talked about it during a section of his speech. But if you look at the overall context of the speech, the overall content of what the Israeli prime minister said, he talked far, far more about achieving victory in this war against Hamas, about destroying Hamas' military capabilities and vowing we will fight until we achieve victory.He said some phrase like that a few different times throughout the speech. He talked about that far more than he did this ceasefire agreement, which U.S. officials as well as Israeli officials have indicated to me in recent days is very much within reach. One official actually told me that it's now up to Israel, that it's now up to the Israeli prime minister effectively to decide whether or not he actually wants a deal. And as Barak was saying there, the Israeli prime minister has told his delegation to hold off on traveling to meet with the mediators and share Israel's latest response until after he meets with President Biden tomorrow, effectively pushing off that trip by the delegation, most likely until after Shabbat. So that would probably be on Sunday. But I think beyond that, Dana, I think what we also need to do here is fact check a few key things that the Israeli prime minister said, because he made several claims here that it tempted to not only defend the Israeli military's conduct in Gaza, but that also flew in the face of many of the facts on the ground. When he was talking about the ICC's claim that Israel is starving people of Gaza. You know, he talked about big numbers of aid getting in, but there is just very, very clear evidence. You talk to any humanitarian organization that actually works on the ground in Gaza, the United Nations and even when you look at Israel in the way that they have turned on and back off the faucet of aid to Gaza, there is clear evidence that Israel has not always allowed enough aid in, that they have not done enough to de-conflict militarily to provide safe routes for that aid to get in. And you also have to remember that ministers, members of Netanyahu's own government, called for starving the people of Gaza in the earliest days of the war. Then he also made this, frankly, laughable claim that there are practically no civilians who were killed in Rafah. I can think of several strikes in which civilians were killed. So that just doesn't even pass the smell test. And then he once again cited this West Point expert, John Spencer, claiming that Israel has the lowest civilian casualty ratio. You talk to any other expert on the conduct of militaries and warfare, including how the United States has carried out its campaigns, and they will all say that Israel has not taken nearly as many precautions as most modern militaries do in warfare in Gaza.",

They're not capable both because of just physical lack of capabilities, but also they are corrupt. They need reform. They need a lot of fixing up to get to that point. The main question is the following and I think Barak did allude to it. Will we start in a process that will say, when the Palestinian Authority is reformed, is capable, they will run Gaza, in which case we can start the process of reform today? And this is, by the way, what President Biden talked about when he talked about the regionally united Palestinian Authority. Now, this is not only essential for getting the Palestinian Authority into Gaza, but it's also essential about something else that actually Bibi himself, Netanyahu himself, mentioned, which is bringing Arab forces and Arab countries to help rebuild Gaza. Every Arab official that I spoke to in the Gulf, Jordan, Egypt, et cetera, will tell you we will not come in unless we're invited by the Palestinian Authority and if we are seen as a step towards bringing in the Palestinian Authority. So I think in some ways the Palestinian Authority today cannot do it. But unless we put - bringing the Palestinian Authority back as an objective, unless we start today to reform the Palestinian Authority, to fix it up, to deal with the corruption, but also to build the capabilities, we will not have the regional coalition that will come and rebuild Gaza. So this is another point that I suspect will be very much on the agenda tomorrow when Bibi meets with the President and with the Vice President.",
