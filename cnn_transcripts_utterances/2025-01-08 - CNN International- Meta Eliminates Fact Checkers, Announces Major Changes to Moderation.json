But look at the incredible amount of wind that's not only shaking this vehicle, but taking those embers and quickly spreading them across the road, starting and igniting additional, what we call, spot fires. This is the moment that the Palisades Fire erupted yesterday, and you can see the direction of the wind with the smoke plume just emanating out into the open of the Pacific Ocean.Here's what I'm concerned about, as it stands right now, the immediate threat. You're looking at West L.A. County and the Palisades Fire, the area that's burned is right here. You can see some of the topography. These are actually buildings, homes, residence, apartments, businesses. This is a canyon right here. And with the video I showed you just a moment ago, you can imagine, the winds whipping up and over these canyons and into the valleys below, taking the embers, spreading them, and starting additional spot fires. You could see one there, there's another one. That is how quickly and how rapidly that this will spread. So, what we've got right now is this northerly component to the wind. If we start to see what's called a backing of the wind to more of a north-northwest, that would put more of Western L.A. County at threat. So more residential area, more densely populated areas. There is some relaxing of the winds forecast later this afternoon.

The flames are being fanned by hurricane-force winds, which are expected to last for much of the day.

But even when they're out there in the number that they are, and keep in mind that L.A. County is asking all firefighters to report to duty even if they're off. That's how bad this is.They still are trying to stop these houses from burning. I think at this point, most people have probably evacuated, but still, because of the nature of where they're fighting, that's what makes it so much more difficult. So that's why the focus right now isn't on containment, it's on at least saving lives, saving property, getting people to get out. But it's not just here. Think about how the resources are being drawn out because you have here, you have the Eaton Fire, you have another fire they're preparing in Malibu for possible evacuations.

The case centered around payments his then lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to an adult film star to keep her from talking about an alleged affair Trump had with her.The sentencing in that case is scheduled for Friday. The high court granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution and Trump hopes that decision will shield him from sentencing in the case, although it's really just a formality. Now, the incoming U.S. president opened his first news conference of 2025 with a laundry list of grievances and provocative remarks. Donald Trump touched on everything from potential territorial conquests to windmills and low flow toilets to the war in Gaza. Trump also ruffled the international community by talking a lot about land grabs as he has been doing the last few days. He refused to rule out the use of military force to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland, and he said he was open to using economic force to make Canada the 51st state.

That, of course, is a complete abrogation of the principles that the United States has stood for at least since the end of the Second World War. It -- Trump doesn't see alliances as a way of multiplying U.S. power, of making the world safe for democracy and market capitalism. He sees the world very much in terms of spheres of influences. I think that's why he's always so keen to sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping.

And this is where Trump's territorial grabs in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere come into play.If he thinks it's just fine for the United States to supposedly march into (inaudible) or to try to annex Canada as the 51st state, he's likely to be much more sympathetic to Putin's argument that Ukraine actually is really part of Russia, which it isn't, and that therefore the invasion was justified.
