A major national poll out this morning shows Harris with a narrow lead over Trump outside the poll's margin of error for the very first time since she entered the race four weeks ago today. And a brand-new CNN analysis finds a new potential path to victory for the Democrats through the Sun Belt states of Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. Right behind me this week, Harris will try to build on her momentum in what is basically a neck-and-neck race with remarks by top Democrats, from Barack Obama, to Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and President Biden, who will appear with Harris on stage tomorrow night at a much different convention than was originally planned for him, while Donald Trump tries to keep some of the spotlight on himself this week with his own events. Last night, in a rally in Pennsylvania, he made numerous personal attacks against Harris, which we will get into later. But he did also make some policy arguments that perhaps some voters may find persuasive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He made a very selfless decision to pass the torch to Vice President Harris, who's a courageous leader, a compassionate leader, and a commonsense leader. And she's ready, she's willing, she's able to get the job done. There's a lot of excitement, a lot of enthusiasm, and a lot of energy with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz at the top of the ticket.

There was an economic catastrophe that resulted from the shutdown of our economy. And, of course, there was a democracy catastrophe related to the January 6 violent assault on the Capitol incited by the former president as part of the effort to halt the peaceful transfer of power. And so, in the context of the economic catastrophe, the shutdown of the economy had consequences. And when demand came back, the supply chain needed to, of course, catch up. And so that is a process that has been under way that has triggered an inflationary environment. But it's fair to say that part of the challenge that many everyday Americans have felt is that price gouging is occurring by some bad actors. And it's reasonable for us to look into how we can stop it from occurring. Vice President Harris is simply saying we have to make sure that markets are properly functioning.

Look, as Nikki probably wouldn't point out because she was the alternative, almost any other Republican candidate would be winning this race by 10 points. And so the message is very clear. If you stick to the issues, if you stick to what matters, this should be an easy race for Donald Trump. It really should. The delta that you're seeing right now is, Trump does better with males by about 10 points. But where this giant shift in August has come is with the female voter. Frank Luntz pointed this out in his polling. He's down 10, 12 points at least, with females. And they're going to come out in much bigger numbers than they previously would have if Biden were the candidate. If you talk about these economic issues, if you talk about -- remind folks that he's running against the most liberal and most unpopular vice president in history that has now laid out the worst economic plan ever laid out by a Democrat candidate -- even Obama's team is panning this as a disaster for America. So she then picked her own vice presidential candidate, which is also one of the most liberal, progressive governors in the country that has huge issues in terms of supporting public safety. All of these things are lining up for a huge Republican win. He's got to deliver. And we have also showed him exactly that playbook to do so. If he can get it together in the last 60 days, he can. And remind folks that they're -- as individuals, they're more important than the government. This Democrat administration, Harris' administration, right -- she's not new to this game. She's been there for almost four years -- has really tried to dominate with a big-government solution. It hasn't worked, right? So if he sticks to what matters, he sticks to what made this country great, he can be very successful in November.",

And they have done a very good job of that, at the same time kind of capitalizing on Trump's reaction, right? They knew that the former president can be a very reactionary person. And I saw that clip that you just played. Trump can say, look, I'm entitled to be -- to personal attacks. Nobody cares what you're entitled to. Do what you have to do to get the votes and win. This is an election. It's about delivering those votes, talking to those independent voters, especially those moms, those suburban females that typically wouldn't have come out strong for Biden. You have got to get them back on the team. There's time to do it, because they care about the economy. This whole idea that inflation was driven by price gouging, that's a bunch of nonsense, that the government's going to control prices to solve it. I just heard Hakeem Jeffries say that that's -- her plan is the American way. It's one of the most un-American plans that has ever been proposed. Free markets, entrepreneurship, competitiveness, her plan would crush all of that, right? So let's do those things that got us out of economic slumps in the '80s and in the '60s.

So whether that would actually come to fruition or not, I don't know. I don't think so. He kind of used those types of threats in the first administration. We got a better NAFTA deal under former President Trump, NAFTA 2.0, which has been a huge success in a lot of different ways. And now we have to deal with the issue of China, right? That's a real threat and making sure that not just the jobs are protected in America, but the workers are protected and we can keep those dollars here, instead of this massive trade imbalance. He's willing to talk about it. He's willing to take it on. Kamala Harris doesn't even understand tariffs, to be honest. Kamala does not even understand these international issues.
