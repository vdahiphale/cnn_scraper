This rebellion, though, is coming from House conservatives with more than a dozen of them voting to bring down this procedural step to show their dissatisfaction with the deal that was cut from Speaker Mike Johnson.Now, this is a playbook that they have used before. It is also a playbook they used against Kevin McCarthy. Right after he cut the debt ceiling deal back at the end of May. This is a sign that they're frustrated. I just finished speaking with Bob Good, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, who told reporters that they have two demands. They want, as part of the spending deal, to include border security. They also want it to include further spending cuts. If you remember, the deal that was announced on Sunday by Speaker Mike Johnson in a dear colleague's letter included the fact that this spending deal was $1.59 trillion with $886 billion in defense, $704 billion in non-defense spending, but then $69 billion in reprogrammed funds that would go into the non-defense side. It's that $69 billion side deal that has frustrated and angered the House Freedom Caucus. They're arguing that is something that the Speaker never should have agreed to. Now, while Good and his colleagues are deeply frustrated right now with the Speaker, no one is calling to oust Speaker Johnson. And I think that that is a really important thing to note here, because this is different than the rebellion so far that we saw against Kevin McCarthy. That doesn't mean that the anger doesn't build. That doesn't mean that the frustration doesn't build. But Good was asked specifically about whether or not Johnson's job was in jeopardy and he said that reporters needed to stop comparing Johnson to McCarthy because they are different. They had different levels of leadership experience. I think that's really important to note in this moment as we are watching House conservatives show once again that they are willing to stand in the way if they don't get their way on these spending agreements.

His lawyer said that Hunter Biden is willing to appear for public hearings, testify under oath, but is not willing to sit for a closed-door deposition. That is the point. That is the point that Hunter Biden was trying to make today by showing up.He pulled a similar move back in December, the day of his closed-door deposition. He came to Capitol Hill and did a press conference outside the Capitol. But Republicans have pushed back on that. They said that's not how congressional subpoenas work and that he does not get to dictate the terms of how he complies. But ultimately, it is going to be up to the DOJ to determine whether or not to prosecute Hunter Biden here. That's because the House committees will send this to the full floor. The House presumably will vote on it as soon as next week and then it's going to be referred to the DOJ.

What did you make of the surprise appearance by Hunter Biden? Is this a good legal strategy? RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: It's actually - it is complicated. So usually I would say that it makes no sense for someone who has been indicted to show up and try to make any public statements of any kind. It's usually best to remain silent. But in Hunter Biden's case, he's been charged with crimes that most people aren't charged with. In other words, typically, if you didn't fill out the right form or made a false statement on a form about prior drug use, you're not usually - that's not usually a firearm offense that's brought by federal prosecutors. And similarly, failure to pay a rather small amount of taxes, that's usually something where you get a penalty letter, not a felony indictment. And so I think his legal team has calculated that they need to change the public narrative surrounding Hunter Biden. And so since there was a subpoena for private testimony, they're making a big show about his willingness to speak publicly because he wants an opportunity to try to sway the jury pool, gain some sympathy and perhaps convince prosecutors that it's not worth moving forward with these charges.",

But he needs to change public opinion because there's been a very concerted campaign, public campaign against him.And so trying to move the needle on that is probably his best move and so I think that's why his lawyers have pursued that sort of strategy.

It was crazy. But - so from Trump's perspective, he's hoping to have a big win in Iowa, barnstorm through New Hampshire and then beat Haley in South Carolina. I certainly think, for Haley, she could come in second, do well in New Hampshire and make an argument to donors in particular that she's got some momentum. And, hey, maybe we should have a number two waiting in the wings just in case Trump isn't actually able to fulfill - to actually be our nominee.

I think we have to remind ourselves 60 percent of Republicans don't want Donald Trump to be the next president.

House Republicans have been targeting Mayorkas over his leadership as migrant crossings have reached record highs and the border crisis becomes a defining campaign issue.In a statement, a committee spokesperson said it will ensure that the public is aware of the scope of Secretary Mayorkas' egregious misconduct and refusal to enforce the law, but also that this process is completed promptly and accountability is achieved swiftly as the American people have demanded. Democrats are calling this impeachment push meritless. Joining us now is a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Republican Congressman from New York, Anthony D'Esposito. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. Why impeach Mayorkas? REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): Well, thanks for having me. And yes, the Homeland Security Committee, the Republicans have laid out over the last 13 months a really comprehensive review and investigation into the dereliction of duty of Secretary Mayorkas. It is clear that he has zero operational control of the southern border. We've hit - set new records here in the United States of America, and they're not ones that we should be proud of. We've seen almost 3.8 million individuals that have come across our borders since president - the President has taken office. We have nearly 1.8 million gotaways that have come into this country. These are people that we know of that we have no idea what they're doing, who they're associating with or what they're up to. And that's in addition to the people who have come across the southern border that we have no idea of, again, what they're doing or who they're associating with, but we can't even account for them. This is a threat to our national security. Quite frankly, he has betrayed this nation. And there were members of - even the Democrats today who said - an individual who betrays this nation deserves impeachment. And I think everything that we've laid out over this five-phase process, and again, I'm someone who has spent a career in the NYPD most of it as an investigator. And I think the Homeland Security Committee, led by Chairman Greene, did an excellent job. It wasn't rushed. It was thorough. We laid out five phases of where Mayorkas has failed the American people and failed his oath.",

He is saying there that this isn't about Mayorkas, that this is about Biden administration policies. What do you say to that? So why focus on Mayorkas then?D'ESPOSITO: Well, clearly Mayorkas is following policies set forth by the Biden administration. But the last time I checked, Secretary Mayorkas is the secretary of Homeland Security. He's the one that took an oath to protect this homeland, to protect us from enemies, foreign and domestic, and he is failing. I mean, you could look at it any which way you want. There have been polls that have been done where 75 percent of Americans have said that the southern border is a major issue and that - those just aren't Republicans. Those are Republicans, Democrats. Listen, I represent a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 80,000 and it is the biggest issue that is talked about on an everyday basis.",

When you take an oath, you have to overcome policies like that and make decisions based on the best interests of the American people and he is not doing that. Many observers think that you are moving forward on impeachment just to impeach someone. And to that point, this is going to be going through the Homeland Security Committee because there is resistance to doing this through the Republican-led Judiciary Committee. As you mentioned, you come from a district that is not red, right? This was a Biden district. Does that not give you pause when I talk to you about how - the process of how this has to go through, because there is resistance on the Judiciary Committee. D'ESPOSITO: Well, let's clear something up. It was a district that Joe Biden won in 2020. It is clearly red now because we won it in 2022 and anticipate winning it again in 2024. I mean, in Nassau County, the last few elections, it is entirely red. From actually the city line out to the east end of Suffolk County, Long Island is a bright shade of red. Does it cause me pause? No. I said that I looked at this investigation that the Homeland Security has done over the last 13 months, it was comprehensive. It was done in a manner in which we took our time and it wasn't done on a partisan basis. I mean, you speak to individuals. Look at my home state of New York, I mean, you have the mayor of the City of New York who is a Democrat who has flat out said that this issue is going to destroy the City of New York. The governor, who is a Democrat, has said that there is no room in New York (inaudible) ...",
