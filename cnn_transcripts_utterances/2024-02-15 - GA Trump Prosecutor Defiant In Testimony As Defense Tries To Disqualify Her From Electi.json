      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins, on what has been one of the most dramatic days, in the long running legal saga of Donald Trump. And I don't say that lightly, tonight.He and we learned today that the former President of the United States will face his first criminal trial, on March 25th. All in one courtroom will be defendant, Donald Trump, adult film star, Stormy Daniels, and hush money payer, Michael Cohen. We are about to bear witness to history, yes, once again. But the drama does not end there. It was almost surreal to watch, for hours, on live TV today, another Trump criminal case. The top prosecutor, in Fulton County, Georgia, Fani Willis, took the stand, in her own defense, as Trump and some of his 14 remaining co- defendants are trying to have her thrown off the case. Let me get you up to speed. It's a lot to pay attention to here. The lawyers are trying to establish that Willis hired the lead prosecutor on this case, Nathan Wade, when they were already in a romantic relationship. And they allege that she benefited, financially, from that relationship. Wade also took the stand, today, and things got really, really personal. Questions about their romantic relationship, when it began, when it ended, trips that they've taken together, their money, where it went, where it came from. After Wade got off the stand, it still wasn't clear what Willis was going to do. But right as one of her deputies was objecting, to her being forced to testify, she made this dramatic entrance, and had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Also here with us tonight is Atlanta -- from Atlanta, is the former Georgia prosecutor, Sarah Flack, who previously worked with Fani Willis. We'll get to you in a moment, Sarah, because I know you have a lot of thoughts. You were in that room today. But Elie, when we start with this, and you just look at what happened today, I think the question is did the defendants get what they wanted here, in the sense of demonstrating this conflict of interest that they say, exist? Or did Fani Willis help herself? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: I don't think the defendants got what they were hoping for today. I think their proof came up a little bit short. There's still more to come tomorrow. But ultimately, I was not super- compelled by either the timing angle, or by the financial angle. Fani Willis, to me, was such an interesting witness, because by the book, she was a dreadful witness. She was evasive. She was non- responsive. She got asked simple, factual questions, and responded with these monologues. She attacked her questioners. However, on the other hand, she was a powerful presence, in that courtroom. She owned that courtroom. I mean, there was a moment, when she even reminded the judge that she used to be his supervisor. She was telling the judge what to do. And I do not think the defense lawyers landed a punch on her that will leave a mark. I think when it came to the financial part, it's this mishmash of she sort of reimbursed with cash, a few times here and there. But they didn't drill down on specifics. There was not that moment where I said, aha, now they've got her.",

And so, if you look at this witness, who came in and she said, this is what happened. And they said, well, you've got a reason to lie. You were mad at the D.A. when you left. Well, OK. But the people, who really seem to have the biggest reason to lie may be Mr. Wade and Miss Willis. And so, the judge is going to have to weigh those things out. But there are a lot of circumstantial things that I think support the friend. Wade and Willis admit that he was going to her house alone in 2021. That's a little odd. I mean, she claimed that she was doing strategy meetings, over the indictment, or something like that. That's nonsense. That she's repaid him in cash. Cash that can't be tracked, you know? There's no receipts. There's no nothing. But suddenly, we're just paying in cash? Cash isn't accounted for on forms, or in tax filings, and that type of thing. So, there are other things, I think, the judge will use to look at. I thought she was a terrible witness. I thought she looked like she was unhinged. And we say down south, a kicked dog barks. And I thought there was a lot of barking, coming from the stand. Her indignation might have seemed more genuine had she not let this simmer for about two months.

I think the defense is going to have to really wrap up, and tie up the conflict, the purported conflict here, without sort of fishing. I mean, we get it. They had dinner. They were in a relationship.

They just sort of left it at this vague thing, I don't know, stacks of cash. Do you have receipts? Not really. When did you pay? I don't know. They need to drill down. How did you get this money? What documentation do you have? Where's your bank records? When was the first payment? How much? How did you document this? What was the balance? It's left in this murky sort of gray area. And that's not going to be enough for them to win. The other thing is on the timing of the relationship, personally, I doubt that they started the relationship afterwards.

They can even dismiss the case. But she came out of the game, just completely out of the gate, guns blazing, so to speak. Why? Because she went directly to the prosecutor -- the attorney, who was trying to litigate this matter. She was indignant. She was also persuasive. They did not test her, a great deal, in terms of trying to undermine her testimony. Remember, what their responsibility was here, was to prove a through line. Did she financially benefit from having hired Nathan Wade? They talked about dueling sources of income. They talked about different methods of payment. But did they make that through line? So far, no. And the one -- the one witness, who testified today, Kaitlan, to talk about and conflict what they had said, and contradict, the start of the romantic relationship, was somebody, who appeared to be a disgruntled employee, with an axe to grind, who was not later corroborated, or rehabilitated on that point.

Because what the attorneys were focusing on was one single paragraph, about Fani Willis' finances, in your book. I kind of wonder when you heard this today, you were wondering if they're missing the point of the other 324 pages. MICHAEL ISIKOFF, CO-AUTHOR, \"FIND ME THE VOTES,\" CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT, YAHOO NEWS: Well, they actually missed the point of the paragraph that they were asking about. Because there is a passage in the book, in which we're talking about, and quoting Fani Willis, about the financial troubles, she was having, after she ran for a judgeship in 2018, and lost. And she was talking about how she was drained. She was a single mother at that point. She wasn't -- she didn't have a lot of clients, in her law firm. And she was struggling. And she talked about that. And that that was -- that was a reason that she hesitated, when -- about running for D.A. in 2020. But if they had read the next couple of paragraphs of the book, they would have understood that after her concerns, about her financial troubles in 2018, she was appointed to a judgeship. She got a healthy salary, from that. Her law practice improved. And her finances were fairly much better at the time.

But when Trump leaves office, in January of 2021, there are a series of internal meetings, between DOJ bosses, and SDNY folks, who had prosecuted Michael Cohen. And the ultimate decision that that DOJ made is it's not worth it. Now, that raises another question, though. What is Alvin Bragg, your successor, and I should say, a former colleague of mine, what is he doing? What is he seeing that the Southern District isn't seeing? And the key to me is Michael Cohen. He's going to be such an interesting -- there's going to be a moment where Michael Cohen, takes the stand, in a criminal trial, against Donald Trump. I'm interested what you think of his credibility. I mean, Michael likes to claim -- I know, Michael. I consider him a friend. But we know his history. And Michael likes to claim that the only things he ever lied about had to do with Donald Trump. That's not really true, though. He was convicted of personal tax fraud. He now claims he lied, when he pled guilty to personal tax fraud. I see him as a problematic witness.

Alexander Smirnov is a former FBI informant, now accused of lying to the FBI, and creating false records, tied to claims that he made about President Biden, and his son Hunter's dealings, with the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. For almost a year now, House Republicans have championed these now- totally-discredited claims, from this informant, without naming him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

If you talk to them, tonight, they'll tell you this isn't really all there is to this impeachment inquiry.

They've had Republican witnesses, who have essentially undermined the thrust of the case they were making, even before you get to their kind of star informant, now actually going to jail, for lying about what was at the center of their case. So, I think it's a little -- it's -- this is a moment, where Republicans are looking at, how badly they fumbled the ball here, and they're saying, well, actually, our intention was never to get into the end zone? That's crazy. That's not quite -- that's not quite true. And I think what we've seen, time and again is that this has blown back politically, on Republicans. We've seen, this has been a concerted effort, for, as I say, many months, I mean, years, really, to try to make this stick to Joe Biden, to try to make this kind of the center of their case against Joe Biden.
