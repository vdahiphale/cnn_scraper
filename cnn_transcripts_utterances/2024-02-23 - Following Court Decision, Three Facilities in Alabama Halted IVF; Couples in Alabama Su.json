I know, I know, I said. There was nothing else to say. My heart was heavy and I felt powerless since I was now unable to complete the course of treatment that she, her husband, and I agreed to months ago since the loss of their third pregnancy. And that, I assume, is just one of so many families that you've had to talk to. What position does this put you in? What are you hearing from patients? DR. MAMIE MCLEAN, FERTILITY SPECIALIST, ALABAMA FERTILITY:  So, the position that it puts me in is an impossible position. As a reproductive endocrinologist, I need to be able to offer the state-of- the-art modern medicine for our patients in Alabama. This ruling makes it impossible for me to offer IVF. This means that my patients won't be able to access the best fertility care in the state which leads to fewer babies and fewer grand babies in Alabama.",

But the mere fact that IVF has become one in this moment -- I don't know. What does it say to you? How do you react to that, Doctor?DR. MCLEAN:  So, in my clinic, this is not a political issue. This is a human issue. This is about having the American right to decide whether to have children, when to have children, and to be able to make the choices with your doctor about how it is best for you to have a child. We know that there are patients considering moving embryos across state lines. That's not in their best interest. In Alabama, we need to be able to offer the most advanced fertility care to our patients and to the citizens of the state. We've actually just heard word that the two largest shipping companies are no longer offering to ship within Alabama. So, unfortunately, the -- this new development this morning limits my patients' options even further and is completely unacceptable based on this ruling.",

It's -- it is tough. But both for coming on. Doctor, thank you for what you do. Rebecca, it's wonderful to meet you.

It's in the middle of writing that Colorado ballot case regarding whether Donald Trump can be kicked off state ballots. That's underway behind the scenes. So, they are thinking of other things other than Special Counsel Jack Smith, the immunity issue, and Donald Trump. But that said, they do have a private meeting that's underway right now in a small conference room off the chambers of the Chief Justice John Roberts in which they're handling some of the business from this week, including an important environmental protection case that they heard -- on Wednesday.But among the business that they are likely going to consider this morning is what to do with Donald Trump's appeal of a lower court opinion that said that he should not be shielded from criminal prosecution in the election subversion case that Special Counsel Jack Smith has brought on behalf of the Department of Justice. Just to remind everyone, that's the one that's testing whether Donald Trump will go to trial on charges related to his 2020 election aftermath behavior before the 2024 election is held. So, we could, as early as this afternoon, see an order from the justices that would set perhaps -- this is one option, perhaps a schedule for filings and oral arguments on the merits of that question, that could be pushed into next week, or John, one other possibility is that the justices outright deny Donald Trump's appeal of the lower court ruling and just let stand what is actually a very comprehensive opinion from the D.C. Circuit. Saying, whatever protection Donald Trump had while he was in office from prosecution evaporated once he became a former president.",

And if that's happening, which I think is -- you know, there's a small possibility that's happening, I frankly am one person who thinks that the justices want to themselves have the last word on this. But let's say, you know, under your scenario, they're going to deny Trump's appeal, any kind of extra writing from any justice who doesn't think that's the best course, that would be being drafted right now, and likely not ready to be issued immediately.Again, we don't know exactly what's happening, but I think -- again, just -- this is speculation at this point, the more likely possibility is that they will hear this case, and we're going to get some sort of timetable of how expedited that hearing would be. Would it be something that would lead to a decision that would come, you know, early in the spring, or frankly, just by June, or even at the end of the year when the election's already kind of come and gone.",
