Quote: We have a crazy SOB, that guy Putin and others. And we always have to be worried about a nuclear conflict. But the existential threat to humanity is climate, he said. Continuing the back-and-forth, the Kremlin fired back today, criticizing President Biden for sounding like a, quote, Hollywood cowboy. And more specifically, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, quote, clearly, Mr. Biden is demonstrating behavior in the style of Hollywood cowboy to cater to domestic political interests, unquote.

And with me now is said Republican presidential candidate, GovernorNikki Haley. Good to see you, Governor. Thanks for joining us. I want to start with the fact that Congress right now appears to be barreling towards a March 1st deadline to fund the government or face a partial shutdown. Speaker Johnson facing pressure from the House Freedom Caucus to include policies in the government spending bill that would frankly never pass a Democratic-controlled Senate, let alone be signed into law by President Biden, such as, for example, zeroing out the salary for the secretary of homeland security, Mr. Mayorkas. So the options Speaker Johnson is facing is either pass another continuing resolution or allow the government to shut down. If you were president, what would you advise him to do? NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If I were president, I would remind every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, that they have just one job, one job, and that's to give us a budget on time. And Congress has only given us a budget on time four times in 40 years. And so what I would say to them is if you don't get us a budget on time, you don't get paid, period. It is not our job to get into their squabbles in Congress. It is their job to give us a budget on time and not make the American taxpayers feel this. That is a huge problem. We don't need to know how you make the sausage. We just need to know what gets done. And right now, nothing is getting done in D.C. That's the problem. That's why I'm adamant about term limits. That's why I'm adamant that they shouldn't get paid if they don't do their job. And that's what I think the American people want.",

Donald Trump, last week, one of the most important things we learned is that he's been having private conversations about the idea of supporting 15-week ban. And part of what's important I think about both of these stories together is we can't let Republicans, Democrats back off of what they're doing here. What they're saying about IVF, I think every Republican candidate, I want them asked if they agree, and I want Americans to take if Donald Trump seriously when he says he will pass a national abortion ban, that's what that is.

But one of the problems that's recurring here is AT&amp;T with 100 million customers across the United -- across the United States, a country of, you know, 380 million people, was not communicating clearly today. It was multiple hours before they had a banner on their website telling everybody what they already knew, which is their service was out. Their social media on X, once known as Twitter, was all about other things, not the outage and even at this hour, we haven't heard from a chief executive or a technical person with information. You know, the model that you and I know from crisis management and watching these things unfold is here's what we know. Here's what we don't know. Here's what we're doing to fix it. This is when were going to get back to you and whether its in this room or on what platform. There was a great lack of communications so that even at this hour, as you and I sit here talking about this, we can't say, here's what AT&amp;T is saying in detail. We do know that the government communicated about cyber actors from China and Russia infiltrating critical infrastructure systems, hiding tools within there, laying dormant but we also know in these cases its most often if it happens at 4:30 in the morning, there are some pretty pre-programmed systems change that's being executed that causes a domino effect that no one expected.

In fact, not even decide where the funeral is going to be until she actually gets to Moscow with the body, which would be flown in on a special plane. I mean, Jake, clearly the authorities are not thinking about the welfare and the state of mind of than the Navalny family, they're much more focused on how this is an intensely political event. Alexei Navalny is somebody who is, you know, was able to bring out tens of thousands of people onto the streets of Russia in life, because of his anticorruption campaign. And the authorities are now incredibly concerned that the funeral may provoke another outpouring of pro- Navalny support. And, of course, people who support Navalny are against the Kremlin and against the authorities, and that's something they very much want to avoid, Jake.",
