I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, hours after the worst terror attack on Russian soil in decades, Vladimir Putin attempts to link Ukraine to the massacre, a claim the U.S. and Ukraine say is untrue. Israel's defense minister will travel to The White House to discuss efforts to retrieve the remaining hostages in Gaza as their families plead for their release. And the Princess of Wales says she's touched by the outpouring of support she has received following the announcement of her cancer diagnosis. Russia says the death toll from Friday's concert hall terror attack will go higher. So far, officials say 133 people were killed and more than 100 others injured. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared Sunday a day of mourning. Outside the venue, near Moscow, people have been leaving flowers and stuffed toy animals. It's the same in other parts of Russia, like this spot in St. Petersburg. Russia says it's arrested the four gunmen who carried out the attack, and survivors are telling harrowing stories of how they escaped. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you look back at speeches and pronouncements and statements from Islamic State leaders over the years, Russia is frequently singled out. There's many things that Russia has done over the years that have not gone down well with Islamic State and indeed Islamic State Khorasan, the affiliate base in Afghanistan.And that ranges from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to its actions in Chechnya, to more recently Russia's military operations against Islamic State fighters in Syria. And more recently, I should say, the Taliban in Afghanistan is a major rival of ISIS-K, Islamic State Khorasan. And the view of Islamic State is that Russia is friendly with the Taliban. And, in fact, back in 2022, Islamic State Khorasan staged an attack on the Russian embassy in Kabul. So, there's all kinds of reasons why this group would want to target Russia. And it's interesting that we tend to think that it's the U.S. and its allies and partners that Islamic State wants to go after, but it really has a lot of reasons to go after Russia as well.",

It was the parent Islamic State that took credit for the attack through its official channels, though I really would not be surprised if Islamic State Khorasan was involved with this, just because, you know, for one thing, it is, I would say, the most active, potent affiliate of Islamic State today.And it's been able to build itself up in Afghanistan, where it's been able to benefit from a lot of things. And that includes being in a situation where it's no longer being targeted by airstrikes, by NATO, which, of course, left the country many years ago.

And, of course, now the Taliban itself is going after ISIS-K hard. It's a bitter rival of ISK. But it's a group that continues to remain resilient. And I think that's another reason why we should be so concerned about it.And for until relatively recently, most of its attacks were taking place in Afghanistan and in the region, Pakistan, and it also carried out a few attacks in Central Asia. But now we're seeing this capacity to project power and project threats well beyond Afghanistan. So, it's that resilience that really stands out and makes it so dangerous, in my view.",

I think that there tends to be this pattern of prematurely assuming that a particular terrorist group is dead and not a threat anymore.This happened with Al-Qaeda some years ago, and a number of policymakers were saying that the threat wasn't there. And now there's been this tendency, I think, to assume that Islamic State is not really much of a threat anymore, in that, indeed, the parent Islamic State lost its territory in the Middle East that it had for many years. And we haven't heard as much from the group as we used to. But there is this pattern of large global terrorist organizations maybe struggling, but they have affiliates, they have regional affiliates that manage to remain strong. And I do fear that this attack from Islamic State's perspective was extremely successful in that it was a mass casualty attack, the Russians were not able to stop it. That could embolden the group, both the parent Islamic State, as well as ISK, and it could prompt additional attacks, whether in Russia or elsewhere. And, again, ISK has been linked to attacks, both successful and foiled in Europe and the Middle East in recent months. So, I think that it's very important that we not be complacent about the threat posed by this group.",

He says it invests in the American people and strengthens the economy and national security, but he also acknowledges this was a compromise, and not everyone got everything that they wanted. And you are seeing both sides emphasizing what they say they're getting out of this bill. For example, there are 2,000 new Border Patrol agents funded as part of this package, 8,000 more detention beds for migrants, and you hear Republicans emphasizing how this bill strengthened security on the southern border. What you hear Democrats emphasizing is the billion dollars for federal childcare and education programs, like Head Start and the $120 million for cancer research, also included new money for Alzheimer's research. What this bill also does is cut funding to the U.N. agency that's responsible for getting aid to the Palestinians. The Biden administration has accused some members of that agency of aiding Hamas. Now, in that statement, President Biden does point to the next big funding battle on Capitol Hill, which is this fight over more aid to Ukraine. And you'll remember President Biden has requested $60 billion in additional assistance for Ukraine. That has stalled on Capitol Hill as many Republicans, particularly those closely aligned with the former president, Donald Trump, said they say that they won't approve any more assistance to Kyiv. President Biden has said that this is necessary, and you are hearing ever more urgent calls from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has said that if American aid dries up, that Ukraine could lose this war. Now, the House has gone on break for Easter for two weeks, so we won't see any movement on that Ukraine aid in that span. What we do understand is that the House speaker, Mike Johnson, has tasked members of the House with coming up with some options for providing that Ukraine aid, but it remains very unclear at this moment how that will move forward.

But what Republicans have learned over 30 years of experience, going back to Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, is that shutting down the government simply is not a tool that can allow you to get to what you want. All it really is is like kind of holding a grenade while it goes off in your hands.

The latest on the winter storms dumping heavy snow in the first week of spring. Stay with CNN. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [03:45:00] COREN:  190 countries around the world marked Earth Hour on Saturday with landmarks like Sydney's Opera House switching off lights for an hour. It's a way to show support for the environment and raise awareness about climate change. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower unplugged powering down the designated 8:30 P.M. local time. The lights only stayed off for seven minutes rather than the hour that is usually observed. Well, several landmarks in India participated in the event which started in 2007. This is a historic railway terminus in Mumbai. While in the capital, New Delhi, the typically brightly lit Howrah Bridge went dark as well. India's presidential palace took part in the event showing solidarity with the movement to save the planet. Some people in Northern Chile are being forced to ration their drinking water because of years-long drought in the region. CNN's Isabel Rosales has this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Reservoirs in Northern Chile don't look how they should. Years of drought in the Andean nation has left reservoirs bone dry and locals with limited water access. One has completely dried out. Heriberto Perez raised his livestock here.

They conducted a recent analysis and found that eight of the ten largest lotto jackpots in history have been reached in just the last three years. And half of those eight we actually saw in 2023.And then there's the other question of why we're seeing these on a more frequent basis. Nerd Wallet also trying to answer that question. Well, for starters, both major lotteries, Mega Millions and Powerball, they changed their rules of the game, making it even harder to win. So, every time there's no winner, that jackpot amount will basically increase, and it continues to happen until there is an actual winner. Rising interest rates here in the U.S. may also have something to do with it. They affect the advertised jack pot amounts, which are actually based on annuities. Remember, anybody who wins, it's usually given that options of either getting that lump sum cash amount or several annuities over several years. And then, finally, there are simply more people playing the lotto. Nerd Wallet finding that every time the jackpot amount exceeds $1 billion, usually people who may not be playing the lotto might think twice and actually will buy a ticket. And because of that, there are essentially more people playing, and all those sales, portion of those actually going into the jackpot, but the odds are still so poor that it doesn't necessarily matter how many people are playing. Mega Million is estimating that the odds of winning in Tuesday's drawing 1 in over 300 million. Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.",
