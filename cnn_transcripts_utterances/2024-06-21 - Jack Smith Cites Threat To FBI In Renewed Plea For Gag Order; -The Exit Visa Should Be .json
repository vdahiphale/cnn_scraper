The Supreme Court, upholding a gun control law, for the first time since the justices expanded gun rights, two years ago. There was also a notable absence, as we await blockbuster rulings. And what Donald Trump said about immigration, a head-snapping change that has not the left, but some on the far-right unhappy tonight. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, not one but two prosecutors sounding alarms, about the danger of Donald Trump's words, warnings at the local and state levels that if Trump is free to say what he wants, people's lives will be at risk. It's a claim that's actually been well-documented, up and down the judicial system. In the words of a D.C. Appeals court a, quote, \"Predictable torrent of threats of retribution and violence\" erupts when Trump goes after anyone connected to a case against him. Or take the judge, in his civil fraud case, who was, quote, \"Inundated with hundreds of harassing and threatening phone calls, voicemails, emails, letters and packages.\" Even the judge in his federal election subversion case found, quote, \"Such statements pose a significant and immediate risk.\" A risk that's no longer theoretical. There is a Texas woman that's now facing charges, for telling that very judge, quote, \"You are in our sights -- we want to kill you.\" Now, as for Alvin Bragg's office, they brought receipts to back up their claims. 61, that is actually the number of threats against Bragg himself, his office bombarded by nearly 500 threats overall, just since April. Left to compile those threats is the NYPD. Police officers Trump describes like this.

His reason, and I'm quoting here, \"The first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month.\" That would be the one right here on CNN, next week. Trump clearly sees lashing out as a political win for him. He's been raising money off of it, as we know. This week, he amplified his former White House strategist, and now fellow convicted criminal, Steve Bannon's vowed to quote, \"Get\" former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, who is now an analyst for CNN.

There's been obviously, as you documented, so many different cases, that the former President has said things publicly, and then that is affecting the prosecutors, the law enforcement officers. And these are real threats. I mean, in Jack Smith's filing, he lays out an actual attack that was made -- attempted to be made, in Ohio, against federal law enforcement officers. And so, this is a real threat environment. I suspect, as a former Justice Department attorney, that the number of threats are probably even more than what is being revealed publicly. And so, what these law enforcement leaders are seeing behind-the- scenes, is even more serious, even more worrisome to them, as individuals with responsibility, to protect their folks.",

It started immediately after the verdict. How real is this threat against people, who didn't ask to be part of this case, or even people who could be mistaken for being attached to the case, but aren't? BARBARA F. WALTER, AUTHOR, \"HOW CIVIL WARS START\": We now have real data showing that violent rhetoric leads to violent acts. And we know also that there's been a real surge, in violent threats, in actual violence, in domestic terror. And it all stems from Trump's loss in 2020.

I think the Attorney General, other prosecutors, and maybe Smith, if he's allowed to do that, can speak out and say, this kind of rhetoric is very dangerous, and it affects the system, and it affects people. I get why the prosecutors, the lead prosecutors say, it's OK to talk about me, but not my staff. But there's a danger to allowing them to be talked about, to be disparaged as well, because it trickles down to the rest of the public, and the rest of the staff. And I think public statements would be appropriate, to warn off people making statements like this. That doesn't mean you're being unfair or persecuting people. If it's a crime, it's a crime.

The laws on swatting are really weak. So, right now, those types of cases are handled at the local level. There's no federal law on it at all. And what that means is that these cases are actually not really being brought to justice, because there's jurisdictional problems, at the state and local level, they have trouble investigating these cases, and actually being -- bringing the perpetrators to justice, and actually prosecuting them.

So, when you talk about the judiciary, that's Federal Marshal Service that has to increase their protection. And if he continues to win, I mean, then we're going back to one of the clips that you played earlier, which was of Steve Bannon saying that there also will be the legal system, potentially, in a future Trump administration, brought against individuals. So, sort of using prosecutorial power for political purposes, as payback. That's as even a separate threat from the physical safety threats that we're encountering now. I tend to think that one of the reasons, the former President has continued to be able to make these types of statements, is because he was not charged with incitement, as it related to January 6th, you know? The federal -- the Special Counsel had to make decisions, about what to charge. And he chose conspiracy to defraud the United States- related charges. And then he chose obstruction charges, which we're waiting for that one Supreme Court case. We've talked a lot about immunity. But we're waiting for the obstruction case to come down, to see if those cases hold on the obstruction piece that the former President's been charged with. But he wasn't charged with incitement. And as a result, he has been able to continue to walk right up this line, tiptoe over it, but not actually be held accountable for statements, that are potentially encouraging people to take other action.",

We need to take the reporting that we see, accurate though it may be, with a grain of salt the size of the Empire State Building. Because Donald Trump is going to make up his mind today. He'll change his mind tomorrow. He'll change it a third time, fourth time, fifth time. And what it's going to come down to is what does Donald Trump think, at that moment, when he finally makes the decision? Does he decide, I need to boost my support with African American males? OK, well, then maybe it's Tim Scott. Maybe it's -- maybe it's Ben Carson. Probably not. Maybe it's a Byron Donalds. Does he say I got a problem with women in suburban areas?

Today's ruling, on gun control, was just one of several blockbuster Supreme Court decisions we've been waiting for. So, let's discuss with Kim Wehle, Professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. Also, the Author of the forthcoming book, \"Pardon Power: How the Pardon System Works - and Why.\" [21:35:00] So, the biggest case, undoubtedly, the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on, is Trump's immunity claim. There has been a lot of debate. I know here at CNN, every day we're like OK, is it going to come today? Is it going to come today? What do you think is going on? How do you think it's going to play out? PROF. KIM WEHLE, AUTHOR, \"PARDON POWER\": I think the court is going to manufacture a test for criminal immunity. And I say that because, in this moment, there is no such thing as criminal immunity for presidents. And this is a conservative court that reached out to take this issue. So, I think they're going to establish a multi-factor test that will separate public functions, from private functions, and parse, is a president acting privately or publicly, and for certain public functions, say, even if what he does would be a crime, that crime cannot be prosecuted, once that person is a private citizen, which would be immunity.",

So, we need to manufacture some kind of immunity in advance. And I think, honestly, the government seemed to concede this really mythology around the pardon power that it's not checked -- checked or balanced by other parts of the Constitution. And as I make the case, in the book, there's actually case law, I think, that goes against that presumption. And it's really a dangerous one.",

It's not allowing itself to be accountable to anyone, for the transgressions, frankly, by Justice Alito, and Justice Thomas, conflicts of interest, and flying of Stop the Steal flag, things like that. That's really the more urgent question.And the government, through the Congress, I really think, needs to put some guardrails around the court. And I actually have a new piece, coming out next week, in \"Politico,\" that argues that Congress could take some legislative steps that are commonsense, so Americans can feel more comfortable and have more buy-in to this powerful body that's really redesigning and rewriting the Constitution before our eyes.",

And so, that kind of talk is not protected by the Constitution, something that could incite people to violence and harassment. And so, the court, these judges have to balance that idea, of protecting people, who are involved in the judicial system. We want people to serve as jurors. We want people to participate in elections. We want people to work for judges, in the courtroom, for example. And if they're worried that they're going to be threatened, and some of these threats are serious, the whole system can break down.

But now, NASA does not have a new return date. Their Boeing-built Starliner spacecraft suffered thruster failure and helium leaks en route to the International Space Station. So now engineers, they're scrambling to understand more about what went wrong. Tonight, NASA did add that the Starliner can be used, if there is an emergency on the ISS. So joining us now is Leland Melvin, a former NASA astronaut. Also, the Author of \"Chasing Space: An Astronaut's Story of Grit, Grace, and Second Chances.\" Leland, so are, helium leaks and malfunctioning thrusters, are they common issues, for a spacecraft to have? What's going on here? LELAND MELVIN, FORMER ASTRONAUT, AUTHOR, \"CHASING SPACE\": Hi, Pam. Thanks for bringing me on. You know we have had these problems before. It was stuck thrusters, and helium leaks. And that's how you -- the helium actually allows you to gimbal your RCS, reaction control system jet, so you can kind of gimbal and steer the vehicle around, when you're in space. So, this has happened before. Now, this is a test vehicle. So this is -- there are things that will always happen in the test vehicle. And both Suni and Butch are test pilots. So, they're used to this kind of thing. But we got to get it fixed. We got to figure it out, get more data. And the reason we're delaying even longer is because we have these two -- these three EVAs sort of coming up. And we want to support the EVAs. I think Suni and Butch have both been working, with the ISS crew, to help make the EVAs go a little bit smoother. So, there's other things they can do on the Station, while we're getting the data to analyze why these things are leaking, and why they're getting stuck.",

And so, the flight will say you have to have three or four to launch. Well, they had two to four. And we declined, as a crew, to not launch, and it delayed three months, about a million dollars' worth of re- working the shuttle. But we got it fixed, and it worked. And so, it's having calm minds during launch, and figuring out what's wrong with the vehicle. Because it is, again, a test vehicle. Every time we launch a shuttle, it was new software on there.
