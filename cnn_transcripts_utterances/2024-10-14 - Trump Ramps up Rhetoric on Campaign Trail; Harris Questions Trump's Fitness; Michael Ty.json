      "sentences": "Yes, and it's a pretty sweeping economic plan. And taken together with her campaign travel this week, you really do get a sense of how urgently the Harris campaign is trying to shore up support, specifically among black men. And this economic plan, at its core, is designed to help black men build wealth, start businesses, protect their assets. It includes proposing new loans for small businesses and for entrepreneurs creating apprenticeship programs, creating a health program specifically looking at ailments that affect black men. She's also reiterating her support for legalizing recreational marijuana and helping black men get involved in leadership positions in the nationwide cannabis industry.And it all sort of lends this sense that the Harris campaign is very much focusing on this - on this group that Democrats have been warning could be slipping away during this election. And Harris' own advisers acknowledge that some black men have felt marginalized by the Democratic Party. And this is really her effort to bring them back into the fold. And you see that also reflected in her campaign travel this week. Today she'll be in Erie, Pennsylvania. She'll be visiting a black-owned business. Tomorrow she's in Detroit. She'll be speaking with the radio host Charlemagne tha God. His radio show is very popular among black millennials. You know, the fear at the Harris campaign is not necessarily that Harris is going to lose among black men. In fact, she is winning by a wide margin in polls. The real fear is that she is underperforming previous Democratic nominees. And in an election that's this close, that could have an effect on the final result. And so you do see this very concerted effort. You know, we saw it starting last week with Barack Obama. We're seeing it continue this week with Vice President Harris really trying to shore up that critical constituency ahead of November's election.",

Not only were four soldiers killed in this attack, but at least 61 others were wounded, eight of whom are still in serious condition according to Israeli authorities. And as you said, no Israeli air raid alarms sounded before this drone struck this base. And this base was quite deep inside of Israel. About 40 miles away from the Israel- Lebanon borders. So, for this drones to make it all that way without being detected, without being intercepted, certainly raises some serious questions that the Israeli military says is working to answer now. They are vowing that there will be an investigation into this and that they will take the lessons from this event and carry those forward.The question now, of course, is how the Israeli military will respond inside of Lebanon. As all of this is happening though, the Israeli military still mulling a potential response to Iran's ballistic missile attack a couple of weeks ago. And with that we are seeing the delivery of this fad air defense system, the terminal high-altitude aerial defense system, a very advanced system being provided by the United States to Israel to defend against future Iranian ballistic missile attacks against Israel. And in addition to the system itself, the U.S. will also be stationing about 100 U.S. troops inside of Israel, which is notable given the state of tensions right now between Iran and Israel.",

Now, of course, we don't know if that threat is credible. We have put out a call to FEMA to try to get more information about that, but we've had two communities that have been impacted by these threats. That's Ashe and Rutherford counties with the sheriff of Ashe County saying this. He urged residents to, quote, \"stay calm and steady during our recovery, to help folks and, please, don't stir the pot. And, of course, Kate, this comes amid a backdrop of misinformation that has been circulating about the federal response to Milton and Helene. This has deeply upset many local officials that I've spoken with, not just in North Carolina, but Florida too, because this is taking up the resources that could be used toward recovery and, instead, they're online, on social media, telling people, hey, this is false information, don't believe this.
