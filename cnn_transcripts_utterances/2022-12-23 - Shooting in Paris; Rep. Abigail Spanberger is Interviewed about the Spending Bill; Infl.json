We are not alone in providing substantial support, and we have led our partners and allies in the provision of aid, be it lethal aid, humanitarian aid, and also in sanctioning Russian oligarchs and those who are behind and supporting this horrific invasion and war in Ukraine. So I am proud to support this additional provision of aid. It is vitally important that we continue to support the Ukrainian people as they fight for their own democracy and the cause of democracy worldwide. SIDNERto see the work of regular everyday people who do keep saying, look, we just need more weapons, we need more money to try and fight this. But there are those on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, some of the extreme parts of the party as well saying things like, you know, Zelenskyy is the puppet or the shadow president of the United States, getting all this money. How do you respond to them? And do they have any -- is there anything that you can see there from their side of things that they're worried about things like what's happening at the border and yet spending this kind of money, giving it to Ukraine?",

And year over year up 5.5 percent.In normal times, that 5.5 percent would really freak me out, but that's down from 7 percent just a few months ago. So, you've seen it month after month. If you look at a line chart, you can see the signs of how that appears to be peaking. You see that. So 5.5 percent. We want to see this trend continue, of course. But this is just another little piece of evidence to tuck over there in the inflation is peaking argument camp. And I think that's what you'll be seeing people talk about today, economists talk about today, that this looks like the worst of the inflation, the red hot, 40-year high inflation appears to be behind us.",
