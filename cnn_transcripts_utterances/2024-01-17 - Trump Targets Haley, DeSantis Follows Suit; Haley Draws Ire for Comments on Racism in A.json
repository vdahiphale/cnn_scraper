And this is not just the black community, right? The Japanese internment. I mean, those families and descendants are still here. My last name is Alford, not because my family chose that last name. That is the name of the slave-holding family that owned us. I know the plantation that we are from in South Carolina, and I am here. My father de-segregated a school. He remembers those things. So why do we have to talk about it as if it is past? This is right now. The pain is real. The survivors of racism, we are here, right?

He was not considered a favorite or a darling of America because he stood up against racism, against poverty. And actually, the greatest threat was that he was uniting poor white people, right, with poor people of color. That was the greatest threat to America, was that he was willing to bring us together. So, again, we have to move past talking about this as if it is history, as if it's not happening right now. And when the Republican Party does this color-blind thing, you're gaslighting people.

I mean, to openly deny that America has ever been a racist country. You know, every politician has ticks that were developed from their start in politics. And clearly, what Nikki Haley saw in South Carolina 20 years ago as a person of color, she had to say things like this in order to advance early on in her career. That, in and of itself, is such a great tragedy. But right now, it's not just horrendous what she's saying, but it's politically stupid. I can't think of one Republican primary voter who is like, you know, I was with Trump, but then Nikki Haley said that we were never a racist country, so now I'm with her. If -- the smart thing for her to do is to focus in on these independent, moderate voters, and try to gain some momentum out of New Hampshire. That is her only hope. But then, of course, she still goes into South Carolina, her home state, where she is trailing Trump by 35 points. This primary, unfortunately, is just about over.",
