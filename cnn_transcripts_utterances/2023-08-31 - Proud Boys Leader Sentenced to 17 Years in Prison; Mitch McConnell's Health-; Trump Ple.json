Trump is the latest of several defendants in this specific election subversion case to enter a not guilty plea, and that means that he's skipping next week's in-person arraignment.

That was the deadline the judge set for these defendants to show up for their arraignment, but Trump waiving that right in this case, along with some of the other defendants we have seen who have also pled not guilty, notably, Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was working for Trump on his post-election challenges.

So -- and you also have Mark Meadows, his former White House chief of staff, who's still trying to get this case moved to federal court, so a lot of different moving pieces here, but, at the end of the day, it does raise a lot of questions about, can Fani Willis try all 19 of these defendants together, as she wanted to, or she's going to have to maybe make a compromise in some way?",

And the judge really listened to the defense. He listened to Joseph Biggs, who tearfully said that he wanted another chance. He said:  I'm not a violent person. I want to get a chance to be able to take my daughter to school. He said he was sorry for what happened and that he is -- January 6 was the last time that he was ever going to do anything as a member of the Proud Boys. Of course, the judge said that this was a very serious offense, that one of the things that the members of the Proud Boys did on January 6 was that they broke the tradition of peaceful transfer of power in this country, something that is forever lost as a result of what happened that day. One of the things the judge said, Judge Kelly, said from the bench: \"The nature of the constitutional moment we were in that day is something that is so sensitive that it deserves a significant sentence.\" The prosecution had requested 33 years for Joseph Biggs. They did not get that, obviously. But this is just one of a number of Proud Boys that we are going to see sentenced here at this federal courthouse in the coming days. You have Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean. All of them are going to be coming through this courthouse hearing their sentences. One of the things prosecutors have argued is that the members of the Proud Boys were vanguards of political violence for a number of years, and that's one reason why they believe what happened, the violence at the Capitol, which is, of course, just a few hundred yards from where I'm standing, deserved to be treated this severely. Seventeen years is what the judge ended up deciding on -- Jim and Brianna.",

Mitch McConnell, as a childhood survivor of polio, walks with a slight limp. He's had incidences of falling in the past. Whether it has anything to do with that, it's really just unclear what has happened. But he has tried to move behind the scenes and tried to reassure his allies and his donors that he is fine. He went to a Republican fund-raiser yesterday. He talked to a number of top Republicans as well who reported back saying that he sounded like his normal self. But there are still some major questions about Senator McConnell.

He had a concussion there, broke his ribs, was in the hospital for some time. He's had trouble hearing reporters, has asked them often to repeat questions. It's hard to tell sometimes if it's hearing loss, which is quite possible, versus just losing train of thought again, and then I think, most recently again, these two episodes of freezing. We hear -- and, again, from Manu's reporting, from Scott Jennings, that it comes and it goes, these symptoms. He can have a pretty quick rebound. And therein lies another clue. That can happen with petit mal seizures, where you have a significant sort of loss of time. Can -- I would be curious to ask him, does he remember that time? If he doesn't, that's another clue as to what this might be. Bottom line, Jim, I hope he's getting it evaluated. My guess is that he is and that the doctors are already aware of this.

It's about a block-and-a-half away from the Gulf of Mexico. And you can see it is just flattened. Back here, we have the Hall (ph) family. They have graciously let us on their property, allowed us to be here through this difficult process. Today is the first day that they have been back on this peninsula in this coastal town. And they're just looking at the damage. They said, looking at this, they were hoping that they'd be able to find some mementos from their parents, from their grandparents. It's been difficult. They do have this chair right here, a couple items that they're going to keep, that they're going to pass along to their children. Other than that, this home is flattened. Now, storm surge here would have been well over my head yesterday. We are talking about 10, 11 feet in some parts. You will see that a lot of the homes are built up on stilts because they're used to tropical weather. Even those, even those high-up homes built for hurricanes got hit, got damaged, got water inside, so the family members looking around here. And this is a site that we see all throughout this town. I will tell you, the mayor told me, 40 to 50 homes are leveled. They are just gone. We see the foundation. The good news is, we're not aware of any injuries, no fatalities. I asked the mayor why. He said he and the police officers, the sheriff's deputies, they came around, they knocked door after door, and they told everyone to leave. Only one person stayed. That person is OK.
