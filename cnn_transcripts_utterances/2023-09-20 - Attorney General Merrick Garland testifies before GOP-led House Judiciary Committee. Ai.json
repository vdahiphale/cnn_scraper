As we all should know, the Justice Department works for the American people to prosecute crimes, uphold the rule of law and Americans' individual rights and keep our country safe. And Congress, of course, has a legitimate duty of oversight.

That's what the American people need. That's what Attorney General Garland has been clear about.He's not going to be used and he said it in his testimony this morning as the -- he's not the attorney for the president. He's not the prosecutor for Congress. He's going to follow the facts and allow his Special Counsel to do the same.

On June 7th, Mr. Weiss wrote to the Judiciary Committee stating you have been -- he had been granted ultimate authority over the matter including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges. But by June 30th, he had changed his tune and said that his charging authority was geographically limited and he -- and it would be up to the U.S. Attorney's office and then you to determine whether he can partner on the case. And if not, he can request Special Attorney status from the AF pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 515.

JOE NEGUSE, (D) COLORADO: I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for holding this hearing. Thank you, Attorney General, for your testimony, for appearing before us and your service to our country. I have great respect for my colleague from Virginia on the other side of the aisle. I am a bit confused as to why they have zeroed in or focused in on this particular letter in such a myopic way, but your testimony and I wrote down words here, that the moment he, meaning the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney Mr. Weiss asked for the authority, I gave it to him. Seems pretty straight forward. And as you said, the letters that Mr. Weiss has written to this committee are publicly available and encourage anybody who is watching these hearings to certainly review those. As you said, clearly, they are consistent with each other in terms of reading those letters collectively. I think it's important, Mr. Attorney General, to perhaps talk a bit about your record and your background in light of the various attacks unfortunately by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. My understanding is that you served as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States early on in your career. Is that right?",

And that my constituents, the folks back in Colorado are grateful for your lifetime of service that you have given to this country.And I recognize that this is, I suspect, a frustrating exercise in terms of this particular hearing, because I suspect that you'd like to be talking about the prevalence of fentanyl in the communities and the work that the Department of Justice is doing to interdict it. The gun violence epidemic in our country and the work that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are doing to stop it. And my hope is that the next oversight hearing perhaps those can be the focus the bulk of the hearing. I would be remiss if I didn't say one note about a rule that the Department of Justice recently promulgated. As you may recall, in 2021, March of 2021, I sent a letter to the Department of Justice requesting that the Department of Justice issue a rule regulating stabilizing braces. One of these braces was used, as you might recall, in a mass shooting in my community in Boulder, Colorado, where ten Coloradans tragically lost their lives, including one police officer. And the Department of Justice issued a final rule earlier this year on this precise topic. Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it their mission to overturn this rule. I wonder if you might be able to just elaborate a bit on how the rule was drafted and deliberated within the department.",

Now, I'm joined here by CNN's Jeremy Diamond, CNN's Evan Perez, CNN's legal analyst Carrie Cordero, and Laura Barron-Lopez of the PBS NewsHour.So we have been watching this lengthy hearing all day. What is your take-away from how the Attorney General has dealt with all these accusations so far of political bias? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, I think he's done about as well as he could, recognizing that Attorney General Garland is about as opposite on the spectrum from the political nature of this Judiciary Committee as one can get. And so, he was in the position of, number one, trying to defend the Justice Department that he is trying to lead in a way that it conducts its business in a nonpartisan way and at the same time, really not answering any substantive questions as it pertains to the Hunter Biden case, which is what the Republicans on the committee want to focus about. And so, he really did put off to the U.S. attorney who is handling that case in the future any substantive questions about that investigation. And that leaves us in a different -- difficult position because, on one hand, it makes it look like he's not answering questions. On the other hand, if he would have said, \"Oh, yes, I have talked to the U.S. attorney about all of his charging decisions and, yes, I have reviewed the file carefully, and I'm steeply involved in the facts,\" then that would open him up to a tremendous amount of criticism.",

And you see that they're trying to create this cloud that ties Hunter Biden to Joe Biden even as they're questioning Merrick Garland.

And I'm curious to see how the hearing next week goes, the first impeachment inquiry hearing because of the fact that to Evan's point, they have been asking a lot of the same questions, are not connecting the dots whatsoever, and that goes to the fact that they don't have any evidence right now that connects Hunter Biden to his father Joe Biden in any wrongdoing.",
