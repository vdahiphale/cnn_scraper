The Russian President says he also offered the Wagner fighters options for their future service. Alex Marquardt joins us live now. So Alex, what exactly did Putin mean by that? And what has happened to Wagner fighters since the failed uprising? Are they in Belarus? Are they still on the battlefield in Ukraine? Where exactly are the majority of them right now?",

But according to the Pentagon, they are not operational. They are not fighting. So it's a very good question of what they're going to do next. In terms of what Putin has now said about Wagner, it appears that he's being rather coy. He's playing with some legalese. But what I think is clear is that Wagner, as we've known it, since the war started here in Ukraine, does no longer exist, that they're not going to be fighting in Ukraine anymore. What shape the organization takes beyond Ukraine, say in the Middle East and Africa where they have significant operations that remains to be seen. Of course, the fate of Yevgeny Prigozhin, of course, still very much in the balance one thing that Putin is saying here is that Russia does not have a law that allows mercenary groups to operate, they are illegal. But Wagner is technically a private military company. Here's a bit more of what Putin said in this interview with Kommersant newspaper, he says, we do not have a law for private military organizations that simply does not exist. There is no such legal entity and he goes on to admit that it is not an easy question. Zain, this interview that he gave was fascinating. And he really got into the details of that meeting on June 29. With members, the most senior members of Wagner right after they carried out this insurrection and marched towards Moscow. Putin said that some 35 Wagner commanders gathered together in the Kremlin. And during that meeting, Putin said you can continue fighting and you can continue fighting under your direct commander whose -- which means gray hair. And apparently according to Putin, the men nodded in affirmation. And then Prigozhin, Yevgeny Prigozhin a Head of Wagner, who was sitting in the front row, apparently told Putin No, the guys do not agree with this decision. So how that meeting ended? We do not know. But it does appear that Putin is trying to divide production from his forces perhaps try to weaken production while still maintain the benefits of the Wagner guys who are still a considerable fighting force, Zain.",

And we're still trying to figure this entire out. Obviously, AI is a cheaper alternative. But both writers and actors are worried that AI could take their jobs. And then you heard about this whole scanning extras, you know, so that they could use the likeness in perpetuity. I keep pointing out, you know, shows like \"Game of Thrones\" or those movies. Remember, you know, Brave heart were these fighting scenes where you have thousands of actors in the background. Well, obviously, you know, those were CGI and computer generated, they're talking about scanning someone's face for a day paying them one day's pay, and then never having to pay them again. Now, you heard the alliance of motion pictures and television come out and say that this is unprecedented in terms of how they've raised the minimum wage, minimum pay, but then they're also saying that the union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless of thousands of people who depend on the industry. It's not just the actors, Zain, as you know its hair and makeup, it's the crews, and it's the catering services. It's the security it's everyone who's out of a job, because writers and actors are on strike. So this has ramifications that go far beyond just the famous faces that we all know and love. And also consumers we're going to see this affect all of us come mid fall if there isn't some sort of middle ground or resolution because how are they going to continue to make shows, you know, there are non-union actors. But if you are, you know, those are independent films, and those projects are few and far between. So it's going to be really hard to see how they're going to be able to make content wrap up these films and promote these film and television projects.

Let's start with this meeting between Antony Blinken and Wang Yi. Just obviously comes out a month, roughly around a month after Blinken traveled to Beijing, the relationship between the two superpowers at that pretty much one of the lowest points in history right now. Is this meeting, perhaps possibly a precursor to Biden, eventually meeting Xi Jinping later on this year? And what do you expect just in terms of any kind of breakthroughs, at least in the short term? IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER OF EURASIA GROUP &amp; GZERO MEDIA: It is, Julia, I expect that Xi Jinping and Biden will be meeting in San Francisco on the sidelines of the APEC summit this fall. And certainly, the more face time those two leaders have directly with one another with a lot of personal history and a reasonable amount of mutual respect. The more stable it is overall in the relationship, but the direction of travel continues to be negative, despite the flurry of high level meetings between the U.S. and China over the last month and a half. There has been no resumption of direct military to military talks, this despite all sorts of tensions and confrontations, over the South China Sea, over Taiwan, over China's military buildup. There continues to be America focused on export controls. And now investment outbound investment reviews that are going to as the Americans say de risk the relationship. The reality is the Chinese see that as containment in, their own economic development.

They didn't get that message Biden then over the weekend, before Vilnius gave an interview on CNN with Fareed Zakaria; he made it very clear this wasn't going to happen. They still didn't get the message. Zelenskyy shows up at Ukraine, I mean, in Vilnius, and the Ukrainian President publicly says, this is absurd. I mean, he's outraged that he's not getting a direct timeline for NATO membership that really wasn't a constructive position for Zelenskyy to take. I mean, of course, he's got domestic politics at home, he's under massive pressure. Heck, he's being targeted every day for assassination by the Russians, like it's hard for you and i Julia, to put ourselves in his shoes. But still, it was very clear that he wasn't going to get a timeline. And I think there are two reasons for that going forth. The first is that any timeline gets undermined if Trump becomes the nominee for the GOP. And that Biden's not going to be able to actually follow through on it. Second, is that many NATO allies, including the Americans and the Germans, the U.K., as well think that, you know, giving the Ukrainians NATO today, as opposed to waiting when we are ready for a ceasefire and negotiations. And then basically saying, you know, this is a -- to be given in return for starting negotiations, when the Ukrainians haven't taken all of the land, remember, Zelenskyy's position is still every inch of that territory has to be taken back, that's nobody thinks that's actually going to happen, at least not militarily.

And after two to three weeks, the cells do what they naturally do when they get good nutrients they grow. And after two to three weeks, we harvest it there is no slaughter in the process.

And want to maintain the traditions and cultures in any dish that in any cultures that it come from, because meat is such a universal, desirable food for us. What we're trying to walk away from is the downsides of how we bring meat of that scale to the table.

And much of the world we're living in is suffering from changes related to climate. And when we think about food production, it takes about two years to grow a cow. It takes about nine months to grow a pig and about two to three months to grow a chicken. And in that lifetime, the animal has to be fed. And it's going to have to go and do its duties and raising animals, healing broken bones, you know, peeing pooping all of that. Now, if we say we don't have to do any of that we can raise meat in two weeks versus two years or two months. We don't have to feed them for that long. You don't have the same level of greenhouse gas emissions. And we have zero methane because animal cells do not produce methane. Is the industrial process that we're shortening by saying two weeks to grow meat versus two months, or two years.

Of course, it's complex to make it takes a lot of research, innovation, complex building of all of these things to come together. So it's expensive for us to make it at this point. But when we go to consumers, we're applying to provide it as a premium to organic, because it provides all of the benefits of eating chicken like we love without the downside.
