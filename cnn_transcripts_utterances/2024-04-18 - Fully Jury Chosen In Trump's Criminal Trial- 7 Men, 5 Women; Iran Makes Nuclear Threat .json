Plus, a CNN exclusive -- I'll speak to the Iranian foreign minister live. He's one of the most powerful officials in Iran. What is Iran going to do when Israel retaliates and how soon will Israel attack? And Jesse Ventura is here tonight. The former governor and professional wrestler once said he'd consider running with Trump. Is that still true tonight? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: we have our jury. Those are the exact words from Judge Juan Merchan, the 12 jurors who will decide Trump's fate, along with one alternative, all been sworn in just moments ago. So as of this moment, Judge Merchan says he wants opening arguments for Trumps hush money trial to start on Monday. This trial is moving at a rapid pace after some major setbacks this morning, they walked in this morning to jurors who had already been selected pick. They were good to go were dismissed. It looked like a real setback, but now, we end the day with 12 and an alternate. And we know that the jury for this Trump trial tonight consists of seven men and five women. And among the jurors selected just today on investment banker who says he follows Trump and Michael Cohen online. There's also a man who works as a security engineer. He says he has no social media accounts and reads a, quote, smattering of different news organizations. Juror number 11 is a woman who works for an apparel company. She was seated despite Trumps lawyers arguing she should be dismissed because she said Trump, quote, seems very selfish and self-serving. And the 12th and final juror on the full panel, not the alternates, is a physical therapist. She told the court she reads \"The New York Times\", \"USA Today\" and watches CNN. Now, before we break down today's developments, I want to explain that I'm actually not in our studio tonight. I'm broadcasting next to the permanent mission of Iran to the United Nations. And we're doing that because we're about to interview Iran's foreign minister live, and the United States has severely restricted his movements. He just arrived in the country for a brief visit and this is one of the only places he is allowed to go. He is one of the most powerful and influential officials in Iran, chosen by the supreme leader to be the face of the country during this time of incredible turmoil. And as the world awaits Israel's retaliation for attacks last weekend. We're going to bring you that exclusive interview live here in just a moment. But first I want to get to our other breaking story this hour and Trump's jury, which could be hearing from the prosecutions first witness on Monday. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT live. He is outside the courthouse here in New York. And, Evan, just how prepared are both sides if this jury pool does not stick?",

You know, in your capacity as a defense attorney, 30 years of experience in New York courts tonight, we have 12 jurors.

He's also starting late.But here's the takeaway from today, Erin, you can see I'm wearing my fishing tie again today, and that's because the former president got another couple of great jurors on his jury. You have an investment banker with that -- belongs to Truth Social, or wealth manager? He's got a really good jury. A And instead of complaining about all the things he -- all the -- he's a busy guy and he's got all this stuff to do, by the way, so do the jurors. The jurors are given up a lot to Mr. Former President. He's got a great jury. And I'm telling you, you ought to be sending them good energy because I think you couldn't ask for a better jury at an New York and they are absolutely -- he's absolutely going to get a fair jury. So, Elizabeth, you were there and I wanted to show some of the sketches that you drew of Donald Trump today in that courtroom. And I know you've been in the courtroom for a lot of cases involving Donald Trump over the year. So, you've seen his demeanor, you know, his face chill expressions.

He's turning around looking at the jurors. These are the jurors who are requesting to be excused. This is juror number two, who wanted to be excused after she slept on it. So he's really paying attention today as opposed to I was not in the overflow yesterdays, but I understand he was nodding off. Today, he was attentive. He was paying attention.

Number two, if this were a street crime case, this jury would -- would convict Trump in a heartbeat, but this is a false business records case, right? This is not about Stormy Daniels is just the first domino, this is about business records and that's why what Trump wants is a really smart jury, the kind of people that would never vote for him as president are the exactly the same kind of people that would find him not guilty when he's a defender.

I think the more education does help the prosecution, but it also helps the defense in this case because the defense wants to say that this case is the about paperwork and I didn't fill it out. I only signed it, I listened to other people and that is something that an educated juror would say -- well, not in my own business, I do the same thing.

Thirty-four percent, say Biden, and 40 percent support former President Trump. You can all see those numbers in front of us in black and white.

And that's where ill sit down with Iran's foreign minister in just a few moments for an exclusive live interview. It is his first interview with American media since Iran attacked inside Israel. Now, I'm here and not in our studios because this is actually one of the only places that the Iranian foreign minister is allowed to be while he's in the United States. The State Department has severely restricted his movements to just a few locations in Manhattan and to JFK airport. It is, though, vital to hear from the Iranian foreign minister right now. He has the supreme leader's choice to be the face of Iran during this crisis, and a crucial player in determining whether the Middle East and much broader plunges into an all-out war. I'm about to go into the Iranian mission to meet the foreign minister for that interview in just a moment. But first, Jeremy Diamond is OUTFRONT tonight from Tel Aviv.

EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): If the Zionist regime commits this slightest act of aggression against our soil, this will lead to a more ferocious and severe response as the Israeli war cabinet meets behind closed doors this week, reviewing military options, Israeli officials are keeping Iran guessing, offering no hints about when or how they will retaliate.",

And I'm here with the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. And Mr. Foreign Minister, thank you so much. Israel has vowed to retaliate against the Iranian strike over the weekend. Do you think Israel could strike as soon as tonight? HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We have given an answer on Saturday night to the action that during the past few months, particularly two weeks ago, the Israeli regime, through the attack carried out against the consular building in Damascus, Syria, our response to the Israeli regime was limited. And stayed within a minimum of frameworks, whereas we could have given a much harsher response to the Israeli regime. Following that, we announced that this response is within the framework of legitimate defense according to international laws. We will not continue. However, in case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level. It will be decisive. Our response will be decisive through the Swiss embassy in Tehran. We have announced to the White House, sent a message to the White House and Washington, D.C., the administration, in which we reiterated that if the Israeli regime commits that grave error once again, our response will be decisive, definitive, and regretful for that. We do not seek to create tension and crisis or increase such situations in the Middle East, and we sincerely hope that the Israeli regime does not repeat the previous egregious error.",

The Iranian drones were geared towards specifically two military targets within Israeli territory, and our collection and information shows and reflects that we were able to reach our objective. One, we showed our willingness. Second, the two military installations from which targets were carried out against our embassy building in Damascus, we carried out operations against those two centers. And the third point is that our operations in response were carried out at a minimum because we were not seeking to hit multiple targets in the occupied Palestinian territories.",

And so as to send a clear message to be received by the government of Israel and to let it know that we do have the means to respond. I will repeat again. We never seek the expansion of chaos and warfare intentions in the region.

Will you strike American targets?AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translator): You see, when we say at a maximum, we mean if Israel commits that same mistake, our response will be regretful for them, immediate and decisive and definitive on and in every Palestinian occupied areas. In previous operation, we announced to the Americans that we will not target American bases and installations in the region, other than if we come across a condition in which the United States of America puts itself besides Israeli -- the Israeli government in order to expand the warfare intentions. It is not within the interest of America to do that. We believe that instead of seeking such conversations, we must seek to pay closer attention and focus on deeper issues. And I said that in my recent talk with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We must focus on Israeli humanitarian abuses, war crimes, genocide.

We do have a religious decree, a fatwa, issued by the Supreme Leader of the Revolution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, and we've announced several times that the entire nuclear program of Iran is in its totality within the framework of a peaceful program, and we have been strictly focused on that goal. But we witnessed over the past few months that repeatedly certain Israeli officials repeated that in order to win in Gaza, a nuclear weapon must be used by Israel. And I do think that America must pay closer attention and focus on the adventure-seeking regime in Israel so that such a crisis will not happen in Gaza.

And obviously the Supreme Leader has mentioned this in a couple of recent speeches. Sources tell CNN morality police have been much more present on the streets in various Iranian cities.There's a woman who didn't want her name used in our conversation. She's afraid of her safety, but just this week she said to CNN she was in the passenger seat of her husband's car without her headscarf. She received a text from police warning her of noncompliance with the hijab policy. The text included her license number and other identifiers of the car, warning her if she violated hijab laws again, her car would be impounded. The context here, of course, is two years ago, the widespread protest following the death of the 22-year-old young woman, Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by morality police because of inappropriately wearing or not wearing a proper hijab. Why is this happening now, and what will be the punishment for women who violate it? AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translator): Well, you see, I wish to speak very transparently. The United States of America and certain Western countries pursue a policy of double standards vis-a-vis many issues. As a matter of fact, a few days ago, while speaking to one of the foreign ministers of a big European country, I told him, do you recall the sad death of an Iranian girl? Do you remember the chaos that was seen across the West because of that event, whereas today over 15,000 women and thousands of children are being killed in Gaza? Nothing happens regarding this specific issue. And a serious action and a strong voice from the European governments, certain European governments and the United States government, we don't hear such voices or see such actions. So the issue of hijab is a very well- recognized and accepted issue in Iran. The policy of double standards and foreign meddling and provocations are seeking to bring about a change of the system in Iran by using women as a tool within the framework of a so-called opposition, whereas women in Iran are an important part of the country, an effective part of the country, influential.",

It was obvious to me that the operation last Saturday was disconnected, did not have an operation advantage and the foreign minister truthfully mischaracterized it as only going after military target.They were successful at the Navala (ph) and Nevatim airbases in the south. But as we all saw, there were, there were drones and ballistic missiles and cruise missiles exploding in various parts of the country.

That certainly isn't something that's necessarily knew. I can tell you that those protests certainly still are very much a sore zero point for those who are in power in Iran.So that's definitely something that we've seen from the Iranians in the past. I think one of the things though that really stood out for me in the interview is that first of all, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is definitely one of the most powerful people right now in Iran, had been actually dealing with him since about 2015. He was then in charge of their Syria policy in Syria for an extended period of time. So when Erin speaking to him, she is speaking to the power center in Iran and like General Hertling, I really found that the fact that he said that there's been so much messaging coming from the Iranians towards the United States is definitely he fascinating, some of the messages that they've been trying to send. One of the other things that I've picked up on as well, and I think also goes to what General Hertling was saying that the Iranian should never do something for the first time in combat, where he was saying that the Iranians allegedly for this maximum strike, that he was talking about that would happen if the Israelis hit back, that the plans have already worked out that they would -- that they would take place as he put it on Israeli territory.
