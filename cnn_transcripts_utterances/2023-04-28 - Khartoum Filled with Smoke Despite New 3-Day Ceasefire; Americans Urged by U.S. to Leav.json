      "sentences": "Yes. Well, listen, Kate, she was able to walk through -- CNN through that journey. And it began pretty early in April when all of these gunshots started to be heard by her outside of her apartment in Khartoum. She is an American teacher, as you were saying, who is living there and working there.And after that happened, she had to move to a safer place. So, she moved to two different hotels. She spent four nights in those separate hotels. And then finally, after what she says was messages from the U.S. State Department telling them that they shouldn't expect any U.S. government-led evacuation. They found out that the French embassy was going to be leading an evacuation and they were welcoming U.S. citizens to get on that evacuation flight. So, on April 24th, she was flown from Sudan to Djibouti on a French military flight. She was along with many other teachers on that flight. And, of course, as you said, she is now finally home here in the United States. But one of the things that she pointed out when she spoke to CNN, is that the Americans who are in Sudan right now, aren't there on vacation. They're there for humanitarian and educational reasons. And that's why she is making the case that the U.S. government should really be doing more to support their evacuation getting out of the country. I want to read to you some of the quotes that she told our colleagues about what she thinks about now that she's safely home but others aren't. Saying, \"I'm out. I'm safe, but so many people I care about and worked with aren't. I just worry now because now the internet keeps going out. So, it's hard to get information and find out who's where and who's safe.\" And Kate, that is the story that we have heard repeatedly from Americans who are there trying to get in touch with their family members back home. The internet keeps going out. So, even if they are in caravans on their way out of the country, the concerning thing is their family members might not hear from them hours on end.",
