In a very public rebuff of the U.S. President, Netanyahu said victory over Hamas would not be possible if the military would not be able to do so. But the Israeli military offensive did not go ahead.

One of the things that the Americans are looking at, John, is the fact that the civilians need to be placed somewhere. They can't just be sitting ducks based on not only the norms of war, but also the laws of warfare. They can't be sitting ducks in an invasion path, and this is exactly what would happen if there's no place for them to go. So, until the Israelis produce a credible plan that indicates where the civilian population that is currently housed in Rafah, where they're supposed to go, that becomes a very difficult point.In that sense, the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, is correct that they need to do something with those. Now, from a military perspective, the Israeli side has made it very clear that what they want to do is they want to destroy Hamas, and they believe that the only way to do that is to go after every last single vestige of the Hamas leadership, the Hamas command and control structure, and the Israeli intelligence certainly believes that those elements exist in Rafah, and that is probably correct based on everything we've seen.",

What will those alternatives be?[00:10:19] LEIGHTON: So, the one way that we could look at this is using what they call the time-sensitive targeting methodologies or high-value target methodologies that the U.S. used in both Afghanistan and Iraq. So, something similar to that where you only go after the leadership of the terrorist organization, in this case the leadership of Hamas, that would be one alternative. Another way to do this is to have, instead of special operations forces doing this, have very concentrated elements of the infantry going in with special operations assistance. But it would, in essence, be the same kind of thing where you don't bring as much firepower to the battle, but you bring what you need. You have very precise intelligence, and you do that. And you do the kinds of things you need to do to, in essence, cut off the leadership of Hamas and eliminate it. That would be the preferred American alternative. And that is certainly a way of conducting this war that the Israelis have tried in part, but they haven't done so completely because they also want to show that they are actually going after all the infrastructure of Hamas, and they're doing it in a meaningful way involving all of their military elements.",
