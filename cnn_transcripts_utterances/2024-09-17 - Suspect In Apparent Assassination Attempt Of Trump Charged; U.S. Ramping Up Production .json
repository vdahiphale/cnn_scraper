Cell phone data shows Ryan Wesley Routh may have spent nearly 12 hours in those bushes Sunday and new body cam footage shows the moment that Ruth was apprehended. The 58-year-old suspect is facing two charges, possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

And the obliteration statute obliterating the serial number, get you up to five years in prison. But I'm not so sure that's the end of the charges. In fact, I think there's a probability that you'll see more as the investigation progresses, like perhaps aggravated assault with a firearm against a federal law enforcement officer. That's when he allegedly pointed that rifle at the Secret Service agent. That can get you up to 20 years in prison. There's a statute against threatening a former president, that can get you up to five years in prison. But it depends what's in his writings, his social media posts, what's in the bag, what's in the car? So, the investigation continues at the federal level, who have taken complete control over this case. Originally, my office was involved. We were going to file some paperwork, some warrants, pretrial detention motion to keep him behind bars. But then the feds came in and they took over the case and we stood down.",

It's garden on one side by water, and it's much easier to close down roads around Mar-a-Lago. In fact, there's a road right in front of Mar-a-Lago that's closed down.Even when the former president is not there, that happened after the first assassination attempt to the consternation of local residents. But when it comes to the golf course, that's in West Palm Beach. It's budded by two major roads. And so it's very difficult to block the traffic, to control people in and out of that area, especially when you have such a large property. It's a larger property than Mar-a-Lago. And you have these big brush -- bushes there where people have been known to go in and out to take pictures of the former president while he's golfing. Paparazzi, the media, usually they ask Secret Service, and if they don't, they're shooed away. And even if they do, they're often shooed away. But I suspect next time, they're going to be a little stricter about people in that area. Maybe we'll have more patrols there, but even if they did, it's really hard to control that area. And if you want to hide out in the middle of the night and hang there for 12 hours. You could still remain unnoticed. We've never seen this type of situation before where instead of a camera, there's a rifle pointed which shows you how impressive the Secret Service was to do that work to see that guy and then open fire because as of now, there's no evidence that the attempted shooter actually shot bullets. It was the Secret Service who shot at him.",

I was not at the press conference yesterday, but the sheriff was there, and they provide the public with a lot of the details. But this guy seems to have a real screw loose. But as far as whether or not he could take an insanity defense, I think that's now unlikely and he may try, but once you flee, once you hightail it out of there and tried to drive away on I-95 north of perhaps go back to North Carolina, that shows that, you know, the difference between right and wrong, and that's the standard for an insanity defense. That shows you knew you were breaking the law to try to escape. So it's going to be harder for him to achieve that insanity defense if he goes to trial.",

So you mentioned earlier on about these 155 millimeter artillery shells that's needed for every day defense. America was making 15,000 a month and now making 40,000. They actually need 100,000 a month and they can't -- they can't make them quick enough to send to Ukraine. And, of course, America needs its own stockpiles if it ever needs to defend itself anyway.

Kasie, this is why we never want to underestimate these tropical systems regardless of whether or not they get a name or they don't, just like this one was called potential tropical cyclone eight. It hadn't formed those tropical characteristics of what we would normally see within a hurricane or a tropical storm for instance. But surely it did its damage.And you can see what it did here along the beaches of North Carolina. This is coming out of Carolina Beach. This is called catastrophic flooding. That was extremely rare. We're talking about 18 inches in a 12-hour period. That's preliminary total. But the likelihood of that occurring 1 in 1,000 years. So this is a significant event that impacted southern North Carolina just south of Wilmington, right about there. There's Carolina Beach. Now, the storm system is moving inland. It's bringing a lot of its heavier rain to the north. The outer banks currently getting hit very hard with some heavy rain at the moment, we have a flash flood warning for this location flood watches in land for parts of Virginia and northern North Carolina. This is where we expect the heaviest rainfall today, nothing like what we experienced yesterday, but there's certainly the risk of some localized flooding across this area. So here's the flash flood watches, or flood watches, Norfolk, southward, towards the outer banks. Notice Wilmington has been excluded from the flood watch, including Carolina Beach as well. So the flood threat for the East Coast, the severe storm threat for the nations interior were kind of sandwiched between two cooler air masses. And you'll see it on the temperature map but right where you see this heat, this is where we could see some of the thunderstorms fire up later this afternoon that could be strong to severe -- Kasie.",
