COLLINSfrom now, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is going to address the American people, a divided Congress and President Biden, hoping to rally support for Ukraine and his people as they brace for a harsh winter under constant bombardment from Russia. Zelenskyy's visit today is incredibly significant. It is his first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February. This as the U.S. is about to send Ukraine the most advanced air weapon in its arsenal: the Patriot defense system. And Zelenskyy is not coming to the United States empty-handed. Those were soldiers surrounding Zelenskyy on the front lines yesterday. They handed him a flag that was signed by Ukrainian troops. They said they wanted him to give it as a gift to President Biden and Congress. For more on the breaking news this morning, let's bring in M.J. Lee, who is outside the White House. M.J., what time do we expect President Zelenskyy to arrive there? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kaitlan, within hours, we expect to see Volodymyr Zelenskyy on U.S. soil. This is, of course, the war-time president who, more than anybody else, has come to singularly represent Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression, has become such a heroic figure to so many people around the world. And this is, as you said, his first time leaving the country since the invasion began some 300 days ago. We expect that he will be in and out of the United States in a matter of hours. And a senior administration official telling reporters overnight that this is a trip that came together, really, in the last ten days or so, that the invitation and discussion about this possible trip was first raised between President Biden and Zelenskyy in a phone call on December 11. And once President Zelenskyy accepted that invitation, then the work really started between the two sides to set up this top-secret visit. Obviously, given the high security concerns, it was really important that this trip remain under wraps until the last minute. And just to quickly give you a sense of what the day will look like, we expect Zelenskyy to arrive at the White House at around 2 p.m. or so. And then, there will be a lengthy bilateral meeting in the Oval Office, followed by a press conference here at the White House -- Kaitlan.",

Thank you so much. We've been speaking for a while here, for months since this the invasion began. And this is going to mark the president's first trip outside of Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine. Tell us about the decision to make this trip. Why now, Sergii? SERGII LESHCHENKO, SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY'S CHIEF OF STAFF: It's certainly important. It's symbolic, and it's crucial moment for Ukraine to win this war. We're looking forward to get better assistance to defend our skies, to defend our citizens. Because last two months was very dramatic in Ukraine when Putin started attack of our critical infrastructure. You know, it's really nightmare in Kyiv, in big cities, when people have no electricity for 24 hours, for 60 -- for 36 hours, for 48 hours. It's really problem. And to keep Ukrainian economy working it's also a big deal, because without electricity it doesn't work. So we expect to have Patriot supply after this trip, and we expect bilateral, bipartisan and Congress support, as well. And we're also looking forward to get ATACMS, the system which can let us defend our territory and to de-occupy what Putin took under control since 28 of 24th of February this year. So 50 percent of our territory is re-occupied thanks to our army, our president and your support, but we still have a lot of things to do and really looking forward to get the support.",

So he keep his word.And at the same time, it's really important for our state to survive. Because cruise missiles and drones destroyed our electricity infrastructure, like for 50 percent, even more, and without the electricity we cannot work. And at the same time, we are not ready to accept ultimatum of Putin, who wants us to accept this territory occupied by Russians is going to be part of Russia. We don't -- we don't want to do this. We're going to fight for victory.

And of course, for president is -- I think, the best moment to travel, because this is the end of the year, when you're going to have some political (UNINTELLIGIBLE).

That's the good news. And I think you'll see -- you'll see Zelenskyy try to do a very Churchillian kind of speech. In fact, Churchill himself came to Congress shortly after December 7, 1941. He came the day after Christmas to sort of rally the United States, the way Zelenskyy is hoping to do. I think that the other side of this, though, is Zelenskyy knows he's headed not only into a long, hard winter but into what could well be years of conflict.

Whether they're talking past each other or to each other is a little bit hard to tell. But I think that, for Zelenskyy, it's a little bit tricky. First of all, there's the logistics, as you suggest, Don. And I'm sure the U.S. Air Force is helping with this. They did the last time he left the country, which was to go to the Munich security conference the weekend before the war. But the bigger trick, I think, at this point is to sustain American interest.

Because if you remember Richard Neal, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, when he requested Trump's tax returns, the whole reason he wanted them, he argued in court, was because he needed to see if this mandatory audit program at IRS was working properly.What's supposed to happen is, when a new president or vice president comes into office, the IRS is supposed to review their tax returns. But according to Democrats' report that they just released last night, one thing that was clear is them is that this program just was not functioning as it was supposed to. Richard Neal argued it was basically nonexistent. The IRS did not review Trump's returns until 2019, according to Democrats, when Richard Neal sent a request for Trump's taxes, arguing he needed them because he wanted to see if this program was working. The argument from Democrats is that this program just was not acting as it was supposed to. And as part of the effort to shore this up, they are revealing that they're going to move forward with some kind of legislation, Nancy Pelosi vowing that she's going to try to advance it in upcoming days. But we should note, there's just a couple days left of this session. In a couple of weeks, Republicans are going to gain control of the House of Representatives.

I mean, some years he paid nothing. And people may be surprised. It may be eye-popping to see how little taxes he paid. FOX: Yes, we're definitely going to get a lot more information once we see the returns that the Ways and Means Committee voted to release. They have to do some redactions on those. But one thing we did get last night was the Joint Committee on Taxation released their own report. Now, these are sort of the nonpartisan number crunchers up here on Capitol Hill. They don't have any investigation power. But a couple observations they made are that, yes, one of the patterns that they noticed was that Donald Trump carried forward a lot of losses, millions in losses. This isn't something that other businessmen and women don't do, but it is something that, you know, raises some questions about what should be done in the future and whether or not this needs some further investigation. Again, the Joint Committee on Taxation not saying it was wrong but just raising some questions about what exactly was deducted and whether it was deducted properly.

So your biggest travel delays for Thursday are going to be Chicago and then up and down the I-95 Corridor, because we're going to have very heavy rain ahead of this system. We have wind chill warnings stretching all the way down to Oklahoma, wind chill watches all the way to the Texas/Mexico border. This chill is going to be felt. If you don't get the snow, you will get the cold. Look at some of these Southern cities; spending 80 hours below zero in Birmingham. Guys, we're going to have travel issues, wind chill issues. We're going to have pipes burst. People could see frostbite set in in as little as five minutes across the Northern Plains. It's going to be huge.",
