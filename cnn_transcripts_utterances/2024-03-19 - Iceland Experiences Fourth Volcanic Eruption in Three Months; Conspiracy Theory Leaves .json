HOLMES (voice-over): Grindavik was first evacuated in November after a series of earthquakes split open roads in the town, heralding the reawakening of a volcanic system which had been dormant for nearly 800 years. Then lava first burst through the surface in December, followed by a second eruption in January that destroyed several homes and buildings in the area. A third eruption last month demolished a hot water pipeline and cut off heat to more than 20,000 people. The last few residents of Grindavik, who had returned to their homes, have been evacuated again. And Icelandic authorities have declared a state of emergency for the area, calling this the most powerful eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What type of voting led to an election controversy during the 2000 U.S. presidential election?Hand-counted paper ballots, mechanical lever machines, punch-card machines, direct-recording electronic devices. If you said punch-card machines, you are correct. A grueling 36-day Florida recount battle stemmed from problems with the state`s punch card machines where poor ballot design left hanging chads on some ballots. Ultimately, George W. Bush won the state and the presidential election. Let`s turn now to elections, where multiple states will be holding their primaries today, including the State of Arizona. Now, the two dominant parties, Democrats and Republicans, have their presumptive nominees for the presidential elections, but there are other primary races still taking place, so these races still matter as local officials work to maintain election integrity, one county in Arizona is dealing with the financial fallout caused by conspiracy theories regarding their paper ballots. Back in the 2020 presidential election, theories surfaced that foreign countries inserted fraudulent paper ballots to influence the outcome. Those who believed these theories wanted more protections, and an Arizona program was created to add extra security features such as watermarks and invisible fibers onto paper ballots. Cochise County`s recorder, the person who helps run elections, decided to participate, but the process took longer than expected and deadlines were missed. The result, this Arizona county now has nearly $200,000 worth of supposedly fraud-proof paper that it can`t use. Our Donie O`Sullivan, examines this expensive mishap. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O`SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is a story about paper. Lots and lots of paper. Americans have been voting on paper for most of the country`s history. But back in 2020, conspiracy theories about paper started to spread.",

This theory that there`s a problem with our paper, so it was a solution in search of a problem because we`ve never had a problem with our ballot paper. There are all kinds of safeguards and on top of other safeguards to make sure that the wrong ballot paper doesn`t cause any problems.
