      "sentences": "Now, I'm not sure they can honestly do anything, because nothing has moved any. I feel like every single time Icome on we say, dead heat, dead heat, dead heat. And I mean if you look at the polling right now, I just want to put this poll in context, right? We have a bunch of national polls that have come out over the last week or so. And they all pretty much say the same thing. Look, you got your CNN poll here that had a tie. \"New York Times\" was out this morning, had a tie. Then you kind of have movement right around the margin of error, right? \"The Wall Street Journal,\" if you like Donald Trump, look at that, plus three. But if you like Kamala Harris, look at that. You got a plus three here and a plus three here. \"Ipsos\" and, say, 24, which is a bunch of academics who have been working with YouGov. But here's the thing that I think is so important to point out. This race right now looks so much different in the polls than the same race or the races the last two times around with Donald Trump involved. You know, if you go back to 2020 at this point, Joe Biden had a nine-point lead in the national polls. Hillary Clinton, back in 2016 at this point, had a six-point lead in the national polls over Donald Trump. Today, Kamala Harris only has a one-point advantage over Donald Trump. So the polls today are considerably closer than they were either four or eight years ago at this point. But that's not necessarily the most concerning thing, I think, for Kamala Harris in our numbers. Let's take a look at the net favorability rate. Now that you have a favorable or unfavorable view and you take the favorable and you subtract out the unfavorable rating. You go back to September, you can see there was some clear daylight between Harris and Trump. They were both underwater, but Harris was considerably less underwater than Trump at minus four to Trump's minus 12. You look at our latest poll, look how much closer they are together. You've got Harris' popularity declining. She's at minus 11, a considerable drop from minus four back in September, while Trump's basically in the same area, all right? But keep in mind, there's one person who's a very important politician in this country that we're not talking about and that's Joe Biden. And I think this is a thing that's almost casting a shadow over this race, right? Kamala Harris frequently gets asked, what would you do if anything different than Joe Biden? And she really can't formulate a great answer for that. And that's a problem for her because take a look at Joe Biden's approval rating in our latest CNN poll. It's only 36 percent. Look at the lion's share, 64 percent of registered voters disapproved of Joe Biden's job performance. And I kind of was asking myself the question, has anybody been able to succeed their president, their party's president in the White House when the president was so unpopular as this? So I went back through history. Was successor of the same party when the president has a net negative popularity, that is, net negative approval rating? Harry S. Truman, was there a Democrat who succeeded him in '52? No. Lyndon Baines Johnson in '68, was there a Democrat that succeeded him? No. How about George W. Bush in 2008, was a Republican that succeeded him? No. The question is, is Kamala Harris about to make history and able to win despite the fact that Joe Biden is casting a shadow over this race and making things very, very difficult for her on the campaign trail? Look, folks. History is made to be broken, but this type of history is not good for Kamala Harris, along with the fact that she has declining popularity, at least in the polls. The good thing for her is Donald Trump ain't too popular himself. Will that be ultimately enough? Only time will tell.",

We are learning therewill be a hearing at George Gascon's district attorneys, many of them in the office in Los Angeles, are going to counter him in court when this gets to a hearing. So you're going to have the prosecution, which will be the attorneys that are countering George Gascon. And then you're going to have the defense, along with George Gascon, saying that they should be able to get out at this point. You know, what is interesting, you're talking about the two new pieces of evidence. George Gascon has been talking about this quite a bit, but in the press conference yesterday, he didn't say anything about the new evidence. He was talking about rehabilitation, but let's make sure everybody knows what he says his new evidence, one is a letter that Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin, Andy, right there. It is undated. There is no date on it. It says that, I'm scared. I never know when my dad is going to come into my bedroom. But he also says, I would love to talk to my mother about this, but I'm scared of that, too, because she always tells my dad anything I tell her. And I'm afraid she'll tell him about this, which is an interesting aspect to this. Now, that letter, I did some research. It's been around for a long time. It's not newly discovered evidence. The other is newly discovered evidence, one could argue. The Menudos, one of the group members did a sworn affidavit saying that they had been sexually molested by Jose Menendez, who was the father of Erik and Lyle. So -- but what the DA is really focusing on is rehabilitation. Saying that they have been in prison for, as he just said, in custody for 35 years, that they were young when this happened, there was trauma. And this would include the sexual assault that has been alleged from the defense at the point of trial and on. It wasn't -- it wasn't public before that. And that they have been stellar in prison. They should be released. It's really revolutionary because this is the highest count in California. It was premeditated, intentional murder, conviction, life without any possibility of parole. So you are changing the structuring system here and ultimately it will go to the parole board. This may last longer than you think it's going to because there's a lot involved.",

These were brutal, premeditated murders. So it's not about excusing what happened.

That's pretty exclusionary, but very rare instances are you going to have everybody in any office, on any occasion regarding any issue on the same page. Ultimately, the prosecutor, the district attorney makes the call. And that call is that he's filing and has filed the issue of their release. And so in terms of that, there'll be a hearing with respect to the merits of that. And whether there should be a release and there'll be some tough questions asked about the appropriateness of punishment, about the issues of newly discovered evidence, about the issue of rehabilitation, about the issue of deterrent, et cetera. And thereafter, to the extent that a judge, after the hearing, believes that this is appropriate, then they would be eligible for immediate release. So it's not like in our system of government in the United States, a prosecutor can wave a wand and say, goodbye, you're released. There's a process. There's a protocol. And, yes, it could take time. There are steps, and that's as it should be, because you want those checks, you want those balances. But more often than not, I will tell you that if you have the prosecutor's real, not only authority to do this, but you have their support, it really gives cover to judges to do it. And I also think we have to talk about this in the context of the times now. I think there's been a reevaluation with respect to sexual abuse and sexual assault and what that means. And it doesn't excuse murder at all. The issue is whether or not it's what we call mitigation. That is, does it provide some insight into your state of mind when you did it? And really, you never want to excuse murder unless it's justifiable you had no choice. But in this instance, whether or not it was something that motivated and compelled them to do it, and it's something that the law can take into account in maybe facilitating their release. And that's where we're at now. But it really looks likely, based on all the support that they have, including public support, that this really could happen.",

The U.S. either ran or supported many of these schools, which were ultimately aimed at trying to strip these children from their ties to their tribal communities and also of their cultural practices resulting in abuse and neglect, and for many, ultimately, death. Now, this is all stemming from a review that Department of Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland, who was the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet Secretary, ordered back in 2021 to review the federal government's practices in these Indian boarding schools. A report was released over this past summer really detailing the level and the scope of the abuse that had occurred at these more than 400 schools across 37 states and then territories. They found that at least 973 children died while in custody. They found unmarked and marked burial sites of about 74 individuals. And, ultimately, they've been able to identify at least 18,000 children who were taken from their families and forced into these boarding schools. Though the government acknowledges that the number is far higher than that. Now, the first recommendation that stemmed from this report was that the U.S. government formally acknowledged and apologized for those actions. And that is what President Biden is trying to do today, trying to correct some of the wrongs of this very assorted period of history in the U.S. Now, Haaland, yesterday, spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One, and she grew quite personal, as her own family had gone through some of these boarding schools. And she said that, at some -- in the past, it had been a far-fetched idea that the U.S. would ever apologize to the survivors and their descendants for these actions, but that is, in fact, what President Biden will be doing today. Now, it does come less than two weeks before the election, when the Native American vote could prove critical here in the battleground state of Arizona. Native Americans make up about six percent of the population, but they do represent a significant slice of the electorate. They are hoping to further highlight some of the work that President Biden and Vice President have done together for this community, but really here today as it is expected to be an emotional moment for so many in the community of survivors, families, their descendants, as they are hoping to turn the page on what was a very dark chapter in the U.S.",
