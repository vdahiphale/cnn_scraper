You're going to see this critical test of the spacecraft. All that's coming up live.Also tonight, new wins for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris four days before their historic debate. Trump getting his sentencing in the hush money criminal case delayed until after the presidential election and Harris poised to get the vote of former vice president and stalwart conservative Republican, Dick Cheney. Plus, the 14-year-old suspect in the Georgia school shooting is arraigned on four counts of murder. His father also in court as he faces rare and serious charges for allegedly giving his son a weapon knowing he was a threat. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news on a very tense, high-stakes space mission. These are pictures from the International Space Station as we count down to the Starliner's undocking just moments from now.

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be staying on board the International Space Station.And so what you're seeing on the right hand side of your screen, that is Starliner. You'll see it slowly start to back away from the space station. But to give you a sense of the actual size, how big it is, I'm actually standing in front of the port, the Harmony Modules port of the International Space Station, where Starliner is going to be undocking from. And so you can see that's how big it is. That's what Starliner is attached to now. It's going to undock. And, you know, the issue with it, Wolf, has been these thrusters, these thrusters misfiring. And those thrusters are the same thrusters that are needed to orient the spacecraft and make those small adjustments when it's in orbit. And so there's been some concern that, you know, if those thrusters misfire again that it could cause some danger to the space station itself and all of the astronauts and cosmonauts on board. So, what's going to happen, the backup plan that they have in place, are springs. There are actual springs on both the Harmony's docking port and Starliner itself. And, you know, in space it doesn't take a lot to get things to move in one direction because everything's weightless, there's no friction. And so, if by some chance those thrusters were to misfire, NASA's confident that those springs would be able to get Starliner a safe distance away from space station, Wolf.",

So far, so good, it's nice to see those thrusters burning, seemingly in a, as NASA would say, nominal way. You see them there. That's good news. This is a breakaway event, though. They want to get Starliner as far away from the space station as quickly possible. Because if something goes awry, God forbid, we have a collision out there. The spacecraft will move ahead of the space station, then over it and then under it, it will orbit four times and then make its way down to White Sands, in New Mexico.

They have the SpaceX Crew Dragon, which is equally capable of bringing these astronauts home, you know, even though it's several months later.And so the question facing NASA is, well, how much risk is acceptable? And when NASA Administrator Bill Nelson formally announced that Butch and Sonny will, would be staying on station and that Starliner would be coming home without them, he said, look, NASA has made mistakes in the past. Look at what happened with the Space Shuttle Challenger. Look at what happened with Space Shuttle Columbia. I mean, Administrator Nelson was a member of Congress and a senator for Columbia, a member of Congress for Challenger. He actually investigated the Challenger disaster. And so he told me that those incidents, those tragedies played a big part in his decision and NASA's decision about what to do with Butch and Suni on this mission. You know, one other thing, Wolf, we also know that there were some disagreements between NASA and Boeing about what should happen here. During a call with reporters just a few days ago, NASA leadership said that, you know, they wouldn't quite describe those discussions as heated, but they said that there were some really tense technical discussions, because Boeing believes that this spacecraft is safe. They believe it is safe enough to take Butch and Suni home. But at the end of the day, NASA says it was just a risk that they weren't willing to take, especially when you have a tried and true vehicle, like the SpaceX Crew Dragon, coming up and capable of taking them home as well, Wolf.",

So, anytime you're a NASA astronaut, but especially anytime you're a NASA astronaut that's assigned to the first crew test flight of a brand new spacecraft, something that has only happened a little more than a handful of times in NASA's history, you know that you have to plan for every possible contingency.So, yes, on paper, this was technically only supposed to be an eight- day mission, but for these two veteran NASA astronauts, you have to know in the back of your mind that you could be up there for much, much longer than that. And both Butch and Suni have already done long duration missions up at the International Space Station. So, they're well aware of, you know, what it takes to be up there for an extended period of time. They're -- also an interesting note about them, they have flown on -- listen to how many spacecrafts they have flown on to get into space. They've both flown on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They've both flown on a space shuttle. They've both flown on a Crew Dragon and now they've both flown on a Boeing Starliner. So, these two astronauts are about as experienced as they come. So, you know, they truly are ready for another long duration mission. What I would say is it's probably more of an issue for their families on the ground, right? I mean even if the astronauts are ready for another long duration flight, it's another thing to tell their wives or husbands or their children's or their dogs, in Suni's case That you know, they're going to be up there for much longer than they had originally planned.

We'll see all this very, very closely and carefully.But, Miles, everything they need, these two astronauts, aboard this orbiting laboratory, they have up there food, water, all the other basic requirements, right? O'BRIEN:  Yes, Wolf. The space station is usually pretty knee deep in supplies. The rule of thumb is a crew of four for four months, they should have enough supplies to do that. It's worth pointing out, though, that when Suni and Butch lifted off, there was a piece of the space station that broke right around the same time, part of the urine water recycling system. And so they asked the crew, they said, hey, you're only going up for a week, would you mind not bringing a packing a bag? And so they went up there without any clothes to make room for this pier. Now, since that time a cargo supply mission has arrived at the space station and there are plenty of stores on board. So, they're not going to go hungry. They got clothing, everything is all set.",

I mean, I think the proof is in the landing, Wolf. If it touches down, as everyone hopes it will, we could say that they could have made it, but who knows. Right now, those thrusters, as you see, are firing and they seem to be firing, as they should. But what had happened and what Boeing and NASA now believes is that a series of quick thrusts in rapid succession overheated these thrusters causing some changes to some things they call poppets, which are kind of like gaskets, and that caused the thrusters to misfire. So, if in the course of returning to the atmosphere those thrusters flying in rapid succession do that again, you might have some thrusters --",

Is the, you know, is the 33, 34 percent of Republicans who are firmly committed Trump, basically, are they going to say, oh, let me think about this again? No. However, we're in an election that is going to be decided, again, by 40,000 people in Wisconsin and 150,000 people in Michigan and 180,000 or so people in Pennsylvania, maybe it's 11,000 votes in Georgia, 10,000 votes in Arizona. And so anyone listening to Liz Cheney or Dick Cheney, there are a lot of, in my travels, there are a lot of Reagan Republicans who are most uncomfortable with Donald Trump as the leader of their party, they might like their taxes cut, they might think he'll close the border, but they don't like his character, that they think he's toxic, they think his tone is mean, they think he doesn't treat people fairly. So, you don't have to have a huge impact. If Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney can move a couple hundred votes there, and then somebody else goes -- this election will be decided on the margins.

He wants to avoid any appearance that this sentencing is being impacted by the election or that this sentencing could impact the outcome of voting in November. And this is interesting because Merchan has rarely conceded the Trump legal team's arguments in and around politics, but here, we also have a new additional element, and that is the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity that could impact this case. The judge pointed out that he routinely pushes back sentencing for all kinds of reasons. And looking at all the factors here, he's decided to push this back until late November.Now, if Trump is reelected, I would expect that his lawyers will try to get this sentencing pushed back even further, arguing that you can't sentence a president-elect. You can see in this calendar right now, this would happen several weeks after the election, but also after the decision by this judge about whether this case survives after the Supreme Court granted Trump some immunity, it is widely expected that this case will survive.
