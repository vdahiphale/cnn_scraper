You are right above me and I'm saying hello to you from the ground here in the heart of New York City, Times Square, and we've got that same view that you have of the ball there lowered. I said a little earlier, Brianna, it gets so exciting when they start raising that ball up to reveal the 2025. That's when you know the party is really getting revved up.Right now, you called it. There are just preparations happening. Let me get out of the way so Jimmy can kind of give you a look at what we're seeing here on the ground. I can tell you we haven't talked I don't know too much about security every time you guys have come to me, but that is happening right now with the NYPD, with federal authorities. We've been seeing some bomb sniffing dogs going through all of these lanes in the middle of Times Square, making sure this is the most secure spot in all of the world for this huge celebration. And these pens, like you said, are going to be filled with an estimated 1 million revelers come rain, come shine, come whatever weather is in store for us tonight. But I did talk to a few people who have been now ushered out into the outer areas of Times Square waiting for their chance to get into Times Square a little bit later this afternoon after the security sweeps are all finished with. And I can tell you there are people from all over the world, all over the United States who just can't wait to get their front row seat to this celebration. And we are here for it, we are excited for it and you know, it's going to be a great time. Again, it doesn't matter if it's raining. Everyone is excited to usher in New Year's right here in Times Square. Brianna?",
