One of the other things that he also touched on, obviously, was the Russian economy, saying that it had been very strong in spite -- it's in the face of a lot of sanctions, of course, from Western countries. He said that right now the economic situation is stable, and he believes that there will be economic growth in Russia. Of course, that's something the Russians sort of have been parading for a couple of months now. So, certainly, Vladimir Putin did seem very confident as he was speaking today, Max.One of the other things that we need to touch on as well, he was asked also about the plight of Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich as well, who, of course, is inside a Russian jail in a trial right now. He said that right now there are talks going on between the United States and Russia to come to some sort of resolution. However, he also said that there needs to be a situation achieved that's mutually acceptable to both sides, to the Russian side, obviously, from his perspective. So, certainly, a little glimpse as to what is going on there. But, in general, you're absolutely right. Vladimir Putin certainly seemed very confident at ease as he was up there on that stage today, Max.",

Fred, thank you so much for that, and watching all of it.European Union leaders, meanwhile, gathering in Brussels for a critical summit to discuss the approval of a multi-billion dollar aid package to Ukraine, and the opening of the negotiating talks with Kyiv as well to eventually grant the war-torn country full membership to the EU. But, most of the bloc's major decisions must be approved by unanimity amongst the 27 member states, and one leader fiercely opposes the EU membership talks for Ukraine and that is the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
