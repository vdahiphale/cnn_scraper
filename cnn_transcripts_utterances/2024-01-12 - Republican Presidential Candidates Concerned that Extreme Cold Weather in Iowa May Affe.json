This is the second wave of that storm, Erica. The expectation here in the city is that there will be, at least today, between three inches and four inches of snow. That's because the lake here has been unseasonably warm. The city of Chicago has also been unseasonably warm. They have not had a high below freezing since November 28th. So that's the good news, keeping a little bit warmer here in the city. Different story out in the suburbs, Erica, where they could see up to a foot of snow.This winter weather advisory from here until Saturday at 1:00, the Illinois Department of Transportation says they have up to 1,800 vehicles and pieces of equipment or more to try to mitigate the storm for drivers and residents, Erica. This is just the prelude because next week our weather team is reporting that it could get shockingly cold. We are talking 30 below with a windchill in some areas of Illinois, Erica.",

We have a lot to get to.And I want to start with the 2024 landscape. You have been at the center of Democratic messaging and strategy for so many years, and I'm interested. You've made the point to my colleague, Dana Bash, a couple weeks ago that this is a moment where the president and his team need to get out more. They have a message. They have a resume. They need to start talking about it more. He's going to be in Pennsylvania today. Have you seen a shift in the message that you think is effective over the course of the last couple of weeks? REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER:  Yes, well, now, we are in the election year, and the president has been working very hard over the past three years to do what is necessary to meet the needs of the American people. Now he can go talk about it. And he has a lot to say. The kitchen table needs are what are the most important to families, but also make the biggest difference in elections. Look at the votes. Look at the job numbers. Over 14 million jobs created while he was president, set unemployment reduced, inflation on the downturn. And I'm very proud of what's happening with health care. He has worked to reduce the cost of health care, whether through the Affordable Care Act or the cost of prescription drugs. People have to know because their kitchen table needs are what are important to them. And the democracy message relates to the kitchen table. Democracy is a personal issue, freedom of choice to have, when and if you have a family, freedom to enjoy your work knowing you have a pension so that your family will be secure. The education of your children, the safety of the environment in which they live, he scores very high on all of those points. And many people are appreciating and enjoying it. They just are not giving him credit for it. And this is what we have to do now is to make sure that not only the president, but other validators come forward to say what he's done. But what's really important to people is what he is going to do. Nobody votes for you for what you've done. They want to know what comes next.",

We have, in 2018, you may recall, people said weren't you lucky that health care became the issue in the campaign? I said, no, we weren't lucky. We made our own luck. We had 10,000 events where people told their stories about what the Affordable Care Act meant to them.Now you have the former president saying Obamacare sucks. No, it doesn't suck. It cures. Affordable care cures. And as you see, record number 20 million signed up, and we still have a couple of more days to go with that. But it won't be -- the surrogate are the people telling their stories across the country and that mobilization to own the ground, to get out the vote, to win the election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.",

It's about their financial health and security as well.And instead of just talking about why aren't they doing more, we are, and we will. And, again, the outside -- our inside maneuvering to get the job done, the president's vision for our country, his knowledge of the issues, his strategic thinking as a legislator are so important, but so is his emotional connection, the empathy he has for working families in our country.

So you want to spend the time talking to them when they are ready to listen.And now that the campaign year has started, then you talk about the weather in Iowa for next week. I'm so sad for the voters there, even though it's just largely a Republican caucus that they have the opportunity to cast their votes in a safe way, and health-wise too because it's so cold, but also the danger of snow. But it is, it is -- election time has this vitality about it. It's exciting, and we respect people's views, respect their concerns. But I've always said you can tell them everything you've done, but nobody gets elected because they deserve it. They get elected because of what they're going to do next. And what he is going to do next is, again, to continue the work he's done for America's working families, whether it's the child tax credit, continuing to save Affordable Care Act, save the reduction in prescription drugs, continue to grow the economy. But again, in a way that gives confidence to people that they and their families have a role to play. People are concerned about innovation and how it affects them, globalization, how it affects them, immigration, how it affects them.

We believe in governance, and we want to get the job done. All of the shutdowns of government have come under Republican leadership, whether it was starting with Newt Gingrich in the 90s and then to the Republicans, when President Obama was president, but the Republicans shut government down. And then under President Trump, when he took pride in shutting Democrats, because they don't believe in governance. So not having a budget, shutting down government is a plus for them. That's what they like. They don't like governance. They don't also like science.
