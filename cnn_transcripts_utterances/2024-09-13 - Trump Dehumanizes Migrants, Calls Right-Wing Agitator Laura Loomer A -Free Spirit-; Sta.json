The count is, of course, honest in swing states, too. But he lost California by five million votes, about 30 points.So even under the wildest imaginary conception of voter fraud, election fraud in this country, that's, that's still bananas. He said, again, as he usually has, that ISIS was defeated in four weeks during his presidency. In fact, the ISIS caliphate or so-called caliphate was declared liberated about two years into his presidency. He spoke of, supposedly, thousands of people being murdered by migrants under Biden/Harris. There have been some homicides in which undocumented people are accused. I don't have a precise number. But it is nowhere near thousands. He said, again, that Venezuela is emptying jails, prisons to somehow deliberately let criminals come to the U.S. as migrants. Even his own campaign, let alone experts, have been able to substantiate that. The experts say it's just not true. And, Brianna, you fact-checked the claim about debate polls. I think we can get more specific. He said he has more than 90 percent support. More than 90 percent of people in one poll said he won the debate. What the heck is he talking about? Those are junk unscientific polls, like polls where some media outlet posts on X, on social media saying, who won the debate, and anyone in any country at any age can flood that so-called poll and say who they thought. It is the scientific polls that you cited, the ones by major pollsters, CNN, yougov, Lajay (ph), that all found that Harris was supported by the overwhelming majority of people who watched that debate.",

There's -- there we're a lot of opinions.There was a lot of data coming in at different times and a lot of people trying to digest that data and understand it and take it forward. I think it was really impressive for our leadership and our management to take the time and listen to everybody's opinion and really try to understand where all of that was going. That's -- that's really a benefit of this organization. You know, we have a lot of people from many different backgrounds. You're seeing two Navy test pilots here. But we have scientists, we have engineers, we have doctors, the whole gamut for putting humans in space. And it takes a lot of people to get on board to have us come up to space, to the space station, and have us come home. And all of those people have -- have a say. They have a direct input. And our leadership really open the door and really was open to understanding everybody's opinion. And that's really impressive. And it's a way, you know, a good organization works, where everybody's opinion is funneled up to their specific director. And then taken into account by the upper management.

Butch and Suni, thank you so much for doing this. And I know you both have done long-duration missions before. You've trained for every contingency. But, you know, NASA Astronaut Frank Rubio, who was in a similar situation as the two of you, he said that he still had a few hard days as he kind of wrapped his head around going from a six-month mission to a 12-month mission. I'm just curious how that transition has been for the two of you mentally, when you learned that you'd be going from a days-long mission to an eight-month mission. Thank you.",

We're professionals.I think I have to say, though, in the back of my mind, you know, there's -- there's folks on the ground who had some plans, right? Like my family, and to spend some time with my mom. And I think I was fretting more about that, like the things that we had sort of all talked and planned for this fall and this winter. And I think I was little bit nervous, to be honest with you, to say like, OK, I'm not coming home for it. But, you know what? Like we both mentioned at the very beginning, everybody is onboard and is supporting us while we're up here.

And I think Leroy understands this perfectly well as an astronaut. Plans change all the time. You think you're going up on one rocket and then they tell you going up on a different rocket.

I just wouldn't have bet my life on it. Right? So I still think NASA made the right decision. And I think Suni and Butch are looking at the same way that it was the right call. It's what they expected. They expected the Starliner to be fine. They were happy for the Boeing teams that put so much work into making it happen that they did have success. And I'll tell you, all the NASA community that really wants to see Starliner be successful, they are much closer to that day when we fly people in Starliner again, given the successful outcome of that entry.

He even ordered women to come to his hotel room and threatened to make their deployments miserable if they complained about it. CNN's Pentagon producer, Haley Britzky, is with us now on this story.

But multiple sources in the guard and experts outside also pointed to the fact that there's this gray area of who really oversees these units. They report directly to the governors of their states, but they also report to the National Guard Bureau in Washington, which can leave this uncertainty of who's in charge of ensuring these things don't happen.
