Those killed were between the ages of 17 to 23. And all were from that tight-knit community. The shooter is still at large, but police say they now have strong leads on the suspect. And this just into CNN. The 16-year-old who was shot in the head by a Kansas City homeowner, after ringing the wrong doorbell, is out of the hospital. \"The Kansas City Star\" says that Ralph Yarl is recovering at home and making good progress. A CNN review of property records indicates that the homeowner is a white man in his eighties. He was taken into custody and released after a 24-hour hold period, spending fewer than two hours with officers pending further investigation.",

Because of that criticism, he will now spend the next quarter of a century in a Russian prison. That's a decision being condemned by the international community as draconian and politically motivated. CNN's Matthew Chance is joining us on this story. So, Matthew, Kara-Murza's lawyers have made it clear they're going to appeal this sentence. What -- what will then happen?",

Rival military generals fighting for control of that country.A short time ago, we learned that Sudan's army chief dissolved his opponent's paramilitary group, labeled it now a rebel group. The army chief and the head of the paramilitary group are at the center of this conflict. It's growing deadlier by the day. Nearly 100 people have been killed so far in clashes over the last three days. Smoke and flames seen near the presidential palace, the army headquarters, also the airport. CNN's Nima Elbagir has been following the developments. Listen, this is descending, and it seems, into a civil war. But you also have this dynamic of Russia backing one side, the U.S. and the West, to some degree, the other. Where is this going from here? NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of the paramilitary forces, was incredibly well equipped and trained and resourced by Russia. And that's really what's tipping the balance, that even that -- even though his men are outnumbered by the Sudanese army, that equipment, that support, that technical technological know-how clearly has paid off for him. We were able to speak to General Burhan, the head of Sudan's military, from inside army headquarters. And it was just as the -- as the fighting was beginning to intensify yet again. I could hear in the background of that call an explosion that sounded like a bomb. I could hear very heavy shelling. It's clear that, for both sides, Jim, this is completely existential. That both sides know that either Sudan's military, which is an organized force, survives and takes dominance, or a paramilitary force with an appalling human rights record, significantly supported by Russia, takes over in such a pivotal country in Africa.",

And they live four streets away from an army garrison. Every time I call home -- and I'm calling a lot at the moment -- I can hear that telltale thud horrifyingly and terrifyingly close. And you know, it's difficult. But I am aware that they are luckier than most other people. We've spoken to, literally they are speaking to us, Jim, on their phones, sheltering on the ground with small children scared to even stand upright inside their homes.

Health officials are still actually investigating what is the exact cause because this outbreak of the fungal disease -- it's called Blastomycosis.It has been linked to a paper mill in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. But the exact cause as to what's exposing people to the fungus that caused Blastomycosis, that's what health authorities are looking into. Now what we do know, among the 97 probable or confirmed cases, there have been 12 hospitalizations. Sadly, one person has died. And just this morning, the head of operations at that paper mill in Michigan spoke with our colleague, Sara Sidner, about this ongoing investigation. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN PETERSON, OPERATIONS VP &amp; MANAGER, BILLERUD ESCANABA MILL: Since we were first told of this from county health on March 3rd, we put a full court press on trying to understand it. And as you said, Blastomycosis is in wet soil. It's our understanding from talking to the CDC, there's no real other studies even close to this in industry. So we've invited a variety of experts who are working towards the root cause. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the district attorney telling CNN, out of Los Angeles, that they are reviewing what the police have sent them.And this is a case that people have been watching all over the world. It made headlines a few years ago when a woman named Effie, who ran a social media account called \"House of Effie\" came forward with allegations of sexual assault by Hammer. And she did a press conference with her attorney at the time, Gloria Allred. And she said that he had allegedly raped her during an incident in 2017, that they met on Facebook, and they had this romance but that it turned violent. So she's actually speaking out to CNN in a statement that we actually have just obtained today. She says, quote, \"I am severely traumatized by Armie. I feel disgusted that he is not taking accountability for what he did to me and that he's resorted to attacking me. Armie has no remorse. He continues to cause pain. And I don't think he has changed at all.\" Now look, we have reached out to Armie Hammer's legal team for comment. They maintain, Boris, that every act of -- anything in a sexual nature was always consensual. Now he did give an interview to \"Air Mail,\" with Graydon Carter, back in February. And he said, look, you know, I wasn't perfect and I dated a lot of women and, you know, there were a lot of things going on but rape was not one of them. So this is going to be interesting to see, what does the D.A. decided to do? It's been two years. We've been watching this. Even our parent company, one of our channels, Discovery, did the \"House of Hammer\" docuseries that everybody was talking about a few months ago. So are they going to bring charges? And could this -- if they do, would it then go to trial?",
