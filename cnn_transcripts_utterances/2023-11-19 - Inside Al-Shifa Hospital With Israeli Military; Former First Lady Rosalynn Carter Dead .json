Officials at that hospital say all the newborns are fighting serious infections and 11 of them are in critical condition.Israel has long said Hamas uses the hospital as an underground command center. Today, the Israeli military released this new video showing the inside of a tunnel on the hospital's grounds. We've reached out to hospital officials about this footage but have not heard back. CNN's Oren Liebermann got a chance to enter with the Israeli Defense Forces Saturday and he joins us now live from Tel Aviv with more. Oren, what did you see?",

Escorted by a tank, we switch into an armored personal carrier for the final stretch. Even through a night vision screen, you can see the magnitude of the destruction on the streets of Gaza City.

But, again, nevertheless, very sad for the people responsible for protecting the Carter family.I'll read you the statement we just got in from the U.S. Secret Service. They say, \"Farewell, Mrs. Carter, your compassion, diplomacy and penchant to make society better for those less fortunate was an inspiration for an entire generation. It has been an honor to protect and serve you for all of these years. You were truly a treasure for our nation and our Secret Service family.\" And just to talk very quickly, Paula, about that relationship, I mean, think about it, obviously the Carter family, their time in office was four years, but that family spent decades in the post-presidency time serving the public, obviously presidents and their family can decide how they spend their time. Some start, you know, private foundations, some give speeches. Obviously we know the most recent former president is now running for office once again. But President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter really dedicated their time to outward facing causes, helping other people, obviously Mrs. Carter focusing on mental health. We know President Jimmy Carter focusing on helping those who are less fortunate, very involved in his church. What that meant for the women and men of the Secret Service is that they were also out there involved in these protective missions, ensuring that they were safe and secure everywhere that they went. And so that relationship was very strong. I'll say that, you know, I've spoken with men and women of the Secret Service. They talk about different relationships. [19:25:04] I was recently in Texas speaking with a member who served on the Carter detail and he said that it was a delight, that's a quote, delight to serve that family. That's not a word that we associate with these, you know, grizzled federal agents who, you know, obviously are detecting threats but they said it was a delight because the Carter family was really very welcoming of their protective detail. You know, they didn't treat them like servants, they didn't treat them as security personnel.

I mean, President Carter during his time in the Navy was out on patrol in the U.S. submarine force and obviously Mrs. Carter at home, you know, taking care of the family, helping with veterans causes she continued even in the post-presidency years, so not just something that's impacting federal law enforcement and the Secret Service but a loss truly to the United States Navy -- Paula.",

This would require the administration to tap federal and local law enforcement officials to essentially undertake this enormous endeavor. And we are hearing from sources that Trump's team is already looking for ways to work around if Congress was to perhaps balk at this, particularly when it comes to funding. They've looked at the idea of diverting Pentagon funds to this immigration project so they wouldn't have to go through Congress. And this is a really big part of what an agenda in 2025 would look like should Donald Trump be the president. We have to note that he is still continuing to inch towards that nomination.

This would make our communities less safe, and it would be diverting law enforcement resources. Again, when Governor Abbott or Donald Trump says that they're for law and order, really what they're talking about is passing unconstitutional laws, separating families, and trying to target communities that are usually poor communities that may not speak English, in order to distract from the fact that really what they're spending their time doing is cutting taxes for billionaires and big corporations, while they try to blame our problems on immigrants or whoever else that can place the blame on.",

And I think that's where we need to get to.I am encouraged by the news that in fact, there are some temporary ceasefire agreements that are currently being negotiated to release some of the hostages. I think we need to get that done, and then expand that to a longer term peace, where we can have sovereignty and safety for Israelis and Palestinians alike without thousands more people dead, be they Israeli or Palestinian. I think Democrats, Independents, and Republicans increasingly want us to leave these indefinite occupations and wars in the Middle East and instead find lasting solutions for peace, and I expect to continue to see the president and other elected officials continue to move our way as we see more and more members of Congress come out for ceasefire.",

Israeli officials insist the Galaxy leader is not Israeli-owned, and that there were no Israelis among the crew. In a statement, the Israeli military described the seizure as a very grave incident of global consequence. A spokesman for the Houthis later confirmed that their forces had seized the ship, which he described as Israeli. He said the crew were being treated in accordance to Islamic values and warned that any Israeli ship would be a legitimate target for Houthi forces. The Houthis along with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria, and various militias in Iraq are part of what is known as the Axis of Resistance led by Iran. Since the war began between Israel and Hamas, the Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles toward Israel, all of which were intercepted -- Paula.",
