There is another hour of trading on Wall Street, but as you can see,what a fascinating day lower, and then you have sort of a volcano in the middle or a mountain in the middle, and that evaporates by the time all is said and done. We'll get to the reasons for that in just a moment. The events that we're talking about, it is the United States versus Google. A landmark antitrust trial began today in Washington. Time to buy a new iPhone charger. Apple's newest model features the lightning charger for the more widely used USB-C. And in a marathon hearing, Israel's Supreme Court reviewing a controversial law that impacts its own powers. Live from New York, Tuesday, September 12th. I'm Richard Quest. Yes, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with the biggest US antitrust case in decades, which is now underway. The Justice Department says the future of the Internet is at stake. Google is accused of stifling competition against its search engine, which the government says controls around 80 percent of the market. The complaint alleges that Google undermines its rivals by making deals with smartphone makers and carriers. Google says people use its search engine because it is the best one and they've made it perfectly easy and free to choose another. Anna Stewart is with me. We'll get to the issues in just a second, sort of the gravamen, if you will of the case. But the case itself, as someone who is old enough -- me, I'm talking about not you -- to remember Microsoft, the DOJ versus Microsoft in the 1990s, which was seminal, and ended up as a damp squib at the end of the century and MySpace and all those other cases. The significance of this, tell me.",

I mean, if you read the DOJ's opening remarks, this is about the future of the internet.But certainly, whether you agree with either side, Google is the dominant search engine, particularly in the United States, 90 percent of your average search engine search is done with Google. So if anything changes, as a result of this case, it will change how people access and use the internet. So there will be a fundamental shift, and also will have a bearing on other big tech giants as well, who will be much more concerned I think about monopolies.",

Listen, this is interesting. The DOJ says that Google is paying $10 billion a year to Apple and other phone providers, browser developers like Mozilla to make sure it's the default user. Is that illegal, though? And Google today says that they say Apple has repeatedly chosen them because it is the best experience for users. They say people prefer it. So at the heart of this case is, has this been done as a way for Google to stifle the competition? And is there a harm at the end of the day to the user? Because the DOJ says anyone with a mobile device, with a computer has been harmed by this lack of competition.",

It said the watch will have a faster processing speed and a better display, and an advanced chip, allowing features such as double tap, meaning you can tap two fingers together to do things like answering calls, and playing music, you don't actually need to touch the screen. It also allows the iPhone 15 and several variants of it. It's got a better camera, automatic portrait mode, a titanium case, meaning it's lighter and stronger. The case takes apparently a long time to create and one of the most consequential features is the new charging port. So now again, the you have the original, the long one. Apple is ditching its lightning port -- and I've got a lightning one here. Yes, something that's lying on here. Here you are. Apple is ditching its lightning for the USB-C, which of course is already used on its own computers. The EU has been pushing companies to standardize chargers so that users don't end up with random piles of different chargers like this. How many have you got? So as the world is cutting down on e-waste, it is all very significant. Clare Duffy is with me. Why was it such an uphill battle for Apple since it already uses the USB-C on its computers.

But I think, Richard, to your point, I mean, looking at all those cables on your desk, I certainly can relate to that. This is going to be a huge convenience for consumers. Consumers are now going to be able to charge their Mac, their iPad and their iPhone, let alone other devices from other device makers, all with the same charging cable. And this comes as Apple is really trying to give consumers a reason to update. The company posted falling sales in the last three consecutive quarters, and so this company needs to get people to want to buy new iPhones. But of course, I think a new charging cable alone isn't going to get people to upgrade. So as you said, Apple rolled out a number of additional features and new updates to the iPhone 15 lineup.",

But what happened was on Monday, the equivalent of eight months of rainfall fell in a single day, filled those dams. These dams weren't very well maintained as a result of the political instability and chaos that Libya has seen since 2011. The dams broke. Basically, it sent a tsunami of muddy water right through the city of more than 100,000 people, and what we heard from a spokesman from the Libyan Army is that entire neighborhoods were washed out to sea, and certainly from the video, that does seem to be the case. Now, the number there we're hearing now is 5,300 people presumed dead, according to the eastern government's Interior Ministry, but of course, there are still thousands of people also missing. So at best, this is a rough, preliminary death toll and we can be fairly confident unfortunately, that the death toll is certain to rise and rise probably dramatically.",

He announced that he was opening an impeachment inquiry led by those three committees that you mentioned around 11:00 AM today. That obviously is coming the same day that the House of Representatives returns to Washington after a six-week recess. In some ways, we expected that this would happen by the end of September, but this is happening very rapidly and it's not happening in a vacuum. The House of Representatives has to fund the government by the end of the month. And so far they have a lot of divisions within the Republican conference of how to actually move forward. A lot of Republican senators that we've been speaking to over the last several hours since this impeachment inquiry was announced have argued that perhaps opening the impeachment inquiry would give Kevin McCarthy a little bit more wiggle room on the spending fight with his right flank. But just moments after Kevin McCarthy announced he was opening this inquiry, you saw conservatives like Matt Gaetz go to the House floor and make the case that he was not going to support a clean spending bill, a short term spending bill, and that if Kevin McCarthy tried to bring one full word to keep the government open, he was going to try and move to oust Kevin McCarthy. So this just shows you that Kevin McCarthy has a lot on his plate right now when it comes to trying to continue to have the support of his right flank while also doing the basic work of governing, which is to keep the government open after that September 30th deadline.",

That's because the House is still dealing with the impeachment inquiry. They are also going to have to figure out a way to move forward with government funding, but the Senate is moving forward with funding the government on a bipartisan basis. They are taking the initial steps to move a series of spending bills that would continue funding the government for a year, and they have Republican and Democratic support for that. So it just shows you that there really are two different ways of governing right now happening in the US Congress.

There is a possibility that in a few weeks, there have beenreports of Benjamin Netanyahu wants to find a compromise on this entire judicial overhaul. And that could potentially cause the supreme court to delay their decision in some way. But as it stands tonight, after 13.5 hours of this marathon hearing in front of a never seen before in Israeli history 15 panel of supreme court justices listening to arguments on their own power, this will move forward. There are some details still, the defendants who are the government and the Israeli parliaments have 21 days to send in further comments in writing. There's a deadline by January for the supreme court to issue their decisions. But right now, Israel is being set up for potentially a clash of constitutional and judicial proportions Israel has never seen before. The reason is because, if the supreme court justices rule that this law that took away some of the power to declare government actions unreasonable, if they say this law should not stand, there is a real question about whether the Netanyahu government will even abide by the rule. And then there becomes the question of who do the authorities in Israel listen to? I spoke recently to a former chief of intelligence from Massad, who said there would be a real question for the chief of police if it happens. Do they answer to the minister of national security or do they listen to the supreme court?",

But it seems as though the train has left the station right now. There are reports that Netanyahu wants a compromise. We have to keep in mind the political realities he's dealing with in his own government. He has far right wing ministers, the justice minister; these people, if they do not agree to sit with him in government, Benjamin Netanyahu is not in power anymore. So he has to balance what they are demanding, what his supporters demand, and also the pressures he's facing not only from much of Israeli public, the protesters on the street, the allies, and as we talked much about here, the economy in Israel. We've seen the credit rating agencies giving warnings about Israel. We have seen the shekel weakening. Investments into startups here, in the tech industry, have been suffering as a result of this overhaul. There's still the big question about how much control does Benjamin Netanyahu really have over the government, as much as he says his hands are on the wheel?",
