But there's a reason we are talking about it. Because the images that could come out of this debate could define the fall race, this incredibly compressed timeline. Collinson writes this, right: \"An open mic would test the Republican nominee's self-discipline in a debate with Harris, at a time when GOP strategists are pleading with him to stick to policy, quit his smash- mouth politics for the good of his campaign. Visuals of Trump talking over and openly disrespecting the woman who has a chance to be the first black woman president would speak for themselves.\" He also says Harris would have a chance to demonstrate the strength in standing up to Trump by reprising her famous riposte, which we just watched in that debate with Mike Pence.

He is not -- he is somebody that a lot of Republicans take very seriously.
