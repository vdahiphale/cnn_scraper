      "sentences": "Tonight on 360, the defense of the Trump trial rest, but not without a damaging cross examination of their only witness.Also, new photos we have never seen before in the classified documents case allegedly showing a Trump aid and co-defendant moving boxes inside Mar-a-Lago before Trump attorneys were to check for classified files. And severe turbulence on board a Singapore bound plane from London. One dead dozens injured how it happened tonight. Good evening. The defense of Donald Trump ended today in a Manhattan courtroom. The former president who's made wild accusations outside the court chose to remain silent and not speak to the jury under oath. The one witness the defense did want the jury to hear an attorney named Robert Costello. The defense called him yesterday to try and undermine the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, Michael Cohen. But today prosecutors badly undermined his. They used emails involving Costello sent within weeks of Michael Cohen's arrest by the FBI in 2018 to show that while Costello was offering Cohen legal advice, his motives seem to mirror then-President Trump's. In one email prosecutors read to him, Costello writes his law partner, quote, \"Our issue is to get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the President.\" This came a day after Judge Merchan cleared the court over Costello's brusque demeanor toward the judge. And once the defense wrapped their case in the early afternoon today, that left hours of battle between the two sides over the seemingly arcane but absolutely vital charging instructions the judge will give to the jury. These instructions will act like a road map for their deliberations over the former president's fate. But because of the current court schedule combined with the long Memorial Day weekend coming up means the jury members are headed home for a long layover and will not return to your closing arguments until next Tuesday after which they will begin their deliberation. The judge today said that should begin next Wednesday. I'm joined now by Robert Ray, the former president's counsel in his first impeachment trial, former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin, former New York Supreme Court Judge Diane Kiesel, and two people who've been inside the courtroom throughout these long days and hours of testimony, Norm Eisen, former counsel to House Democrats during that first impeachment and CNN's Kara Scannell. I want to get, Kara, to the jury instructions a little bit. But first let's talk about what happened to Costello, their only witness that they put on the stand on cross examination today.",

      "sentences": "Right. I mean he was brought in to undermine Michael Cohen's credibility and prosecutor Susan Hoffinger spent the morning trying to undermine Costello's and she asked him seemingly off the bat a somewhat innocuous question to set things up asking Costello if in that first meeting he had with Michael Cohen, if he had mentioned his connections to Rudy Giuliani who was very close to Trump, not yet on the legal team.And Costello had said that no, he hadn't. So then she brings up an email and shows it to him and says, \"You sent this email, correct?\" He says, \"Correct. I did.\" She said, \"To Mr. Cohen?\" \"That's correct.\" \"Two days after meeting him.\" \"That's correct, yes.\" She said, \"I'm going to read this for the jury. 'I'm sure you saw the news that Rudy is joining the Trump legal team. I told you my relationship with Rudy, which could be very, very useful for you.'\" So confronting him with this to get him on the back foot to suggest you did tell this to Michael Cohen in that first meeting, why are you not saying to the jury right now that you did and this all - she - this was a pattern that she used all day asking him questions, then showing him an email. Some knew for the first time that came in before the jury just to show this relationship between Trump's lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Robert Costello to undermine his defense that he wasn't trying to pressure Michael Cohen. The prosecution has said that there was a pressure campaign. They wanted to keep Cohen in the camp and they didn't want him to flip on Donald Trump.",

It is always true that the government calls many more witnesses than the defense. But juries are always interested at the end of the defense - the government's case. What does the defense have to say? What are they going to put forward?And they put forward this guy who, as far as I could tell, the only thing he accomplished was he showed there was a conspiracy of Trump, Giuliani and Costello himself to get Cohen to keep lying to stay on the team with Trump. That to me is inconceivable as a defense strategy. Ultimately, I think the defense can hope this was just a sideshow. It wasn't really about the core issues in the case.

Michael Cohen now is giving you a story that implicates Donald Trump, and he told his own lawyer that he didn't have anything on Donald Trump.Now, I would have asked that in two questions if I had been doing this myself, to be honest with you. I wouldn't have belabored it. Most judges don't like what's referred to as extrinsic evidence of impeachment. It's allowed in. It's kind of narrowly circumscribed. Usually, I would not have - you know, he comes with baggage, and I knew that, you know, that's the risk of calling this witness.

Then you have House Speaker Mike Johnson, other Republican allies, sometimes even dressed in similar ways, including red ties, similar suits. We don't know if that's coordinated. And then, of course, you see the wide range of people that actually come out to support the president. They go inside the courtroom. Then they come outside to where a lot of the press is gathered. They make statements. A lot of what you heard in there calling the trial a farce, saying this shouldn't be happening in the first place. Not so much getting into the facts of the case in specifics, but more so talking about at a large scale, they do not believe this case and trial should be happening.

And during that search, people working for the former president's legal team, they found a document that appeared to be classified that had labeled classified in the president's, the former president's bedroom in Mar- a-Lago. The document was - had a title, according to this - it was a mostly empty folder and it said - it read classified evening summary. There were four additional documents that were found in an office also at Mar-a-Lago. And along the lines of that obstruction, we can throw up those images again of Walt Nauta. That's images that prosecutors say showed Walt Nauta moving boxes again after the Trump team had received a subpoena for them to turn over these documents, moving these documents ahead of a search that was being conducted by Evan Corcoran, who at the time was the former president's attorney.

But here's the thing. Joe Biden is right to call it out. Joe Biden's given strong remarks condemning anti-Semitism in a moment when it's on the rise nationally and globally. But the problem is the moment is very different than 2020. Joe Biden ran after Charlottesville. He said that is what inspired him to run to restore the soul of this nation. Right now, a lot of Americans in the center see liberal college campuses where anti-Semitism is running rampant and it's not being condemned. And then they see this language. And also today at the courtroom, Trump saying things like Jews need to get their heads checked if they vote for Democrats. They may not know where to fall. It's a moment that calls for leadership.

I mean, I know -- I'm not going to drop dead of a heart attack or a stroke. I'm just, you know, like, I don't have those risk factors, right?So out of the blue, suddenly I feel a pain and I'm dying. And when that happens, you don't trust anything. And you think every day, every morning you think this could be an -- this again could be my last day. You just don't know. And I got so sort of weirded out about it that I said to my wife, can you just tell me I'm alive like that I'm not a ghost? Can you just affirm? And she said, of course, you're right here. I'm here. And my mind, I'm like, that's just the kind of thing a hallucination would say. Like, I had a -- was just playing games with myself. And so I -- and then after the incredible anxiety of like I could die any day, not all of us could, right. After that, I got out of that and eventually settled into this really crazy depression. I've never been depressed or anxious before. And I was, it was a talk about a black pit. I mean, I was like, actually worried for myself. And my wife finally said, honey, you're getting a little hard to live with. Like, can you go talk to somebody? And it helped enormously.

I mean, not that you survived, of course, you're lucky that you survived, but that it happened at all. Like, if you could push a button and have it not happen, would you push that button?Really, she was asking, like, was this a blessing or a curse in your life? And I didn't know how to answer. And I finally looked up the word blessing, the etymology of the word blessing. And it comes from the Anglo-Saxon word blaedsian, which means blood. And the idea was that there is no blessing without a sacrifice. That there is no blessing without a wound. And I think, possibly that there -- and I'm, again, I'm saying this as an atheist, but I feel free too, that there's maybe no wound without some sort of blessing. You just have to find it. And when I thought about it in those terms, blaedsian, the old word for blood, when I thought about it in those terms, it sort of released me from this. I was like, that's just how it works. You don't get anything for free and it is a blessing and it came with a wound and here I am. And I'm a lot wiser. I'm a lot calmer. And frankly, I appreciate everything more. It's such a cliche, but it actually did kind of work that way. It was kind of like taking antidepressants or something. I'm like, oh, I'm back. Like, here I am and I'm really alive now.",
