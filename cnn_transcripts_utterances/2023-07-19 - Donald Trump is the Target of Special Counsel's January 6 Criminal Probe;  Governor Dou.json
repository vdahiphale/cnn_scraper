      "sentences": "Donald Trump already fundraising off the target letter he received from the Special Counsel. He's facing a possible third indictment, this time for his actions around January 6. I wonder if that would change anything for his base or his opponents is an open question.Joining me from Sioux City, Iowa is one of those primary opponents, Governor Doug Burgum of North Dakota. Governor, thank you for joining us today. We will talk about your campaign in a moment, but I want to start about the news here that Former President Donald Trump could be facing an indictment in the Special Counsel's January 6th investigation. Do you think the former president should be held accountable for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election? GOV. DOUG BURGUM, (R-ND) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Manu, first of all, grateful to be on the show with you and we're grateful that our campaign that's only six weeks old is off to such a great start. We are looking forward to being on the debate stage. I do want to say relative to this entire industry that's built around talking about the former president, this is -- there's some people that love this, China loves this, Russia loves this because whenever Republican candidates are being dragged into talking about another candidate, nobody gets to talk about their vision for the future, about lower energy prices, about a stronger economy, about a safer world and that's what our campaign is about. And when we are on the ground talking about -- to citizens in Iowa and New Hampshire, you know, they've got real concerns about whether or not we have a two-tiered system of justice. So we know we're at 6 percent polling in New Hampshire.  We reached our 40,000 threshold for donors today, so please do announce that right here on your show, but we know that people want to talk about economy, energy, national security, these are things that touch every American, these are things they are concerned about and that's why our campaign is getting traction. RAJU:  I want to get into your campaign a little bit, I do want to just talk to you a little bit more about this because this is the former president, this is the front runner for the party's nomination, and this is a criminal indictment that he's already had two, he could potentially face a third, so it's very serious stuff here. I'm wondering if you believe he (ph) -- Former President Trump was responsible for any of the violence or destruction that occurred on January 6th?",

And as governor of a sitting state, when people ask me about hypotheticals 12 months and 18 months out, I never comment on those because I have to deal with the real solutions and real problems that are going on right now. And we're running a campaign, we expect to be the nominee, and when we are the nominee, there won't be the distractions because we will be focusing on the issues that matter to America and our place in the world.And again, we've got the Biden Administration, you know, plenty of people are worried about that. We're worried about where we have gone wrong direction on economy, wrong  direction on energy policy and wrong direction on national security. So it's just -- I mean, so we would not even be at war in the Ukraine right now if we hadn't adopted a policy where we decided that we're going to buy energy from our adversaries and then shut down the American industry. I mean, in a Burgum Administration, we will be selling energy to our allies, not buying it from our adversaries. And on the economy we will be focusing on innovation, unleashing the power of the American economy, not trying to regulate every industry out of business. When that happens, that's how you win a cold war with China. That's how we are in a war with Russia, we just haven't sent troops, but most of the things that we want to be talking about.",

This has been a grassroots effort, a group of friends and family called the Sodbusters calling people on their Christmas cards list and saying, \"Hey, this is a guy that you should get to know and get behind him.\"And so, I just want to say thank you to all the people in the grassroots effort to drive this to get to 40,000 donors in 40 days, it's remarkable. Again, when we are -- we know we are at the least- known candidate in the race and so when we see ourselves tied for fourth in New Hampshire on a qualifying poll yesterday, we get excited because we know there is a lot of upside.

And so, this is about a smart strategy. It's about an entrepreneur with a business attitude. This is what we need. This is what we brought to the State of North Dakota. This is how we cut $1.7 billion out of a $6 billion budget. This is how we can reduce the size of the federal government, reduce power to the states, is by using innovation, not regulation. And of course, if you go to a firm today and say, \"Hey, I need online donors.\" They might charge you $100 per customer acquisition.

It is all about (ph) -- that's where things area in Trump line.ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It just seems like it's really this shows the kind of lengths that these different candidates need to go in order to win the support of somebody that still holds a grip on the party. As your story noted, some of these candidates have opposed the Infrastructure Package even though money went to their districts. Others switched parties which overtook the opponent that actually opposed Biden's Infrastructure Package as well. So, it's a bit more largely emblematic of the control that Trump still has because of his base over the party and the lengths that different candidates are willing to go to win his support at this time. On whether or not he's aware of the losses in the last election, I did think another good point in the story as well was just whether this is a matter of capacity.",
