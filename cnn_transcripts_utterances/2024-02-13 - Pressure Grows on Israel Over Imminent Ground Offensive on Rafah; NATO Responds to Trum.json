Part of the rescue involved hours of intense airstrikes around Rafah, killing dozens of civilians, including children. And that has now increased pressure on Israel to stall its imminent ground offensive on Rafah, with the United States, the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and others, raising concerns for the safety of more than a million people taking refuge in Gaza's southernmost city.But for Israelis, on Monday, there were celebrations, as the two hostages were reunited with family, after being apart for 128 years. These images were recorded by the IDF, just after Israel's counter- terrorism force stormed the building where the two men were being held. They were later flown to a medical center in Israel, and despite their ordeal, both are said to be in relatively good health. This is only the second successful hostage by the Israeli military, bringing high praise from Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Netanyahu on Gaza hostage rescue mission, one of the most successful in Israel's history. The Prime Minister also described the operation as perfect, at least twice in his remarks. The number of Palestinians, though, who died is around 100, according to the Palestine Red Crescent and Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza, with no breakdown of how many were civilians and how many were combatants.The Israeli military said back in December the ratio of civilians killed for every Hamas fighter is around two to one. So that would mean around 65 civilians were killed. Netanyahu claims the ratio is one to one, which would still be around 50. So, when it comes to the rules of war, when it comes to the ethics of war, is that an acceptable outcome from a rescue operation? Is it the perfect operation?",

So, there's no way to completely separate Hamas from civilians. So, there are a variety of ways in which Hamas is violating international law, is putting civilians in harm's way.But none of that relieves Israel of its obligations not to kill civilians unnecessarily or disproportionately. And given how many people are now in Rafah and how many of them are in desperate need of food, medicine, shelter, and other essential services, it's inconceivable how a major ground operation could take place without massive loss of civilian life. And Israel would be responsible for that, as well as Hamas. They would both share responsibility for that catastrophic outcome.

COREN (voice-over): Anies, a former governor of Jakarta, has leaned into the K-pop craze, while Ganjar has the most TikTok followers of all three. Perhaps more importantly, Prabowo is being seen by many Indonesian voters as the continuity candidate. Jokowi's eldest son, 36, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is running for vice president on Prabowo's ticket. This presidential election has often seen style put over substance. Whoever does win must immediately begin to tackle the issues voters care about, from cost of living to the environment. Anna Coren, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
