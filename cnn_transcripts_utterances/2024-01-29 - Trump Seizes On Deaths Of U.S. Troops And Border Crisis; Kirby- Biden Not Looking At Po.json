And this is first and foremost among them.The commander in chief has to make decisions regardless of if we're 10 months before an election or a week before an election or what. So from an outsider, it's very easy to sort of throw attacks like Donald Trump did, as Joe Biden did when Trump was the president. So that's just how it works. But watching John Kirby there reminds me so much of other presidents in these positions here. Everyone thinks and wonders if election polling, you know, is guiding decisions. If that were the case, he probably would have already called for a ceasefire, at least among his left flank, because there's no doubt that the White House and President Biden are losing support and losing this coalition. It's really fraying that brought him into office. But look, President Biden, Vice President Biden, Senator Biden, been around this town for a very long time, sometimes in power, sometimes out of power. He's had a pretty straight line in terms of his foreign policy. But there is no doubt that the question was about is polling guiding things. But the consequence of its of his decision is going to guide polling. So regardless of if he's driven by this, it still has an effect in this election year.",

There were proxy attacks after that. American service members died in the months, just a couple of months after that. It's just not -- the facts don't bear it out.But what strikes me as strange, Jeff, is that we're in a really weird place in politics, that this is you know, you don't really normally expect your politicians to be arguing over the bodies of dead soldiers.

From the outset, we've been very clear in warning that anyone looking to take advantage of conflict in the Middle East and try to expand it, don't do it. We've taken steps to defend ourselves and to defend our partners, as well as to prevent escalation. And the President's been crystal clear. We will respond decisively to any aggression. And we will hold responsible the people who attacked our troops. We'll do so at a time and a place of our choosing. At the same time, we remain focused on our core objectives in the region, both in terms of the conflict in Gaza and broader efforts to build truly durable peace and security.
