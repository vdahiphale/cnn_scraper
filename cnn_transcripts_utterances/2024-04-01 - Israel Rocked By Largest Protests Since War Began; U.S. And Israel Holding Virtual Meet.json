It's not enough to just win black voters for this president or pretty much any Democrat at this point. The president won 87 percent in 2020.

I'm just going to read from part of your amazing reporting, and then I want you to talk about it on the other side. \"'You're going to have some people that are able to vote who -- not just because of Joe Biden, not because of Donald Trump -- just feel disengaged from the political process,' said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson. 'I have people in my own family, my own friends network, who probably would not vote in this election, but they will be voting because I'm going to be on their tails between now and November.'\"",

The energy is just not there. And that is going to be a big problem for Biden in this upcoming election is, how do you go out there and really convince them these voters of what you have done and why they should go out and support your re-election efforts.",

It's about a wider range of issues talking about economic opportunity. It's a big tour that Vice President Kamala Harris is going to undertake the next couple months. But also things that are about the benefits that they feel like black voters should see they got from the Biden administration, student loan cancelation, big part of that. And doing it in a way that is a range of things from what they call relational organizing, going to places in the communities where people are who are not normally engaged and trying to connect with them, make a deeper rapport with them so that they carry through November and figure out ways that they can convince these people that there is some reason for them to be engaged in the political process and be engaged there for Joe Biden. One of the -- when I was in Wisconsin doing the reporting for this piece, one of the things that I was told is that 50 percent of the people that they are hitting up with this new approach to organizing were not in the voter file before.",

So they're really trying to strategize new ways to reach this demographic of voters.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Democrats as you mention, Dana, have won about 80 percent or more of the black vote over -- almost every single election cycle in modern history. And so, the question is, do they stay at home, or do they turn out for President Biden? President Trump is showing that he's peeling some away with young black men particularly on concerns around the economy. One Democratic pollster I spoke to recently said that in the focus groups they have conducted, whether it's young black male voters or young Hispanic voters, their concerns are more around the economy. When they hear President Biden say things like inflation -- the inflation rate in the U.S. is amongst the lowest compared to other countries that have come out of the pandemic, that doesn't necessarily resonate with them.",
