I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. With President Biden now out of the presidential race, Vice President Harris is trying to stack up as many possible endorsements as she can as she tries to solidify her bid to be the nominee. President Biden was the first to endorse Harris, leading to flood of elected Democrats also throwing in their support as they do try to coalesce around someone as quickly as possible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  There's going to be a lot of speculation about the vice president, and this is going to be a bit of a speed dating situation because there's not going to be a lot of time. And I think that the fact that Vice President Harris has shown her stuff as a world leader -- she brings receipts to this campaign. She's a fierce debater. She's going to be able to take on Donald Trump and prosecute the case. She was a prosecutor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've seen this play out in many campaign cycles over the years.And so that was the case that happened over the last few weeks. Any sign that he was thinking or considering withdrawing would have been enough for his potential rivals or people that want to get into the nomination to jump in. And so, they made it very clear that he was not going to do so until the very moment he did. And I think there was just a lot of factors that made it increasingly clear that there was not a tenable path forward for him. And we look across the board from people publicly calling for him to step aside, to donors withholding money, to the polls showing a huge erosion among support in the key battleground states. There was just this flood of signs that the party was no longer going to be standing by -- with him. And ultimately, it came down to just over the weekend, Joe Biden and his closest aides, in his Rehoboth beach house as he is recovering from COVID, making this remarkable decision that has upended American politics in the race for the presidency with, as you just said, just over 100 days left until the campaign. Truly a remarkable moment in American politics.",

And it would have been extremely difficult for anybody, even if they have a -- kind of a war chest in their state to kind of come home, make a team, and then run a race with just over 100 days to go.And so, I think that's why you're seeing a lot of these people kind of coalesce around her. I mean, Gov. Wes Moore, as we reported yesterday, is going to be endorsing her later this morning. And so, I mean, there's really not a kind of prominent challenger outside maybe Joe Manchin.

Here's a little bit of what he said on \"STATE OF THE UNION\" as recently as Sunday about President Biden's possible exit. Again, this was before what we saw yesterday from the 2024 race.

      "sentences": "Yeah. I don't think they're all that concerned about that possibility. If you look at just what happened shortly after Biden dropped out and endorsed Kamala Harris, many of these state delegations have already pledged their support to Kamala Harris. So that process is well underway and there's no serious formidable candidate getting into the race at this point or officially declared.And also, let's remember Joe Manchin is not even registered as a Democrat at this point. So, for these delegates who have already been selected based on their pledged support to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the ticket, it's going to be nearly impossible for anyone else to come in and rally enough support to really pose a serious threat. And I think part of what we saw yesterday was this scramble. There was rumors and reporting that Biden was considering dropping out, but he did it in a way that I think most people did not expect -- just putting that statement out on social media. Most of his closest aides and almost no one on the campaign knew it was coming. So it didn't give any other potential challengers time to prepare a bid against Kamala Harris, making her path much easier than it could have been had there been some time -- a leak that he was going to do it and before he officially went out and did it -- put it out on social media and sort of shortly after endorsed Harris really preventing other people from organizing a real bid to challenge Harris.",
