One thing that he said last night, at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire was really warning voters not to get complacent, a message we heard him deliver many times in Iowa as well, but also he argued that he thinks that if he can have a big win in New Hampshire, it could effectively force his rivals out of the race and end the primary early. And he said as much, and I know from my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign and his advisers, they do believe that. They believe that if he can have a really strong showing here in the Granite State, that maybe he can really lock up the GOP nomination early. Now, another big thing that we've been hearing from Trump is him escalating his attacks on Nikki Haley, really, they've become pretty nasty at this stage in the primary. Last night, he argued that she is not fit for office, she is not tough enough for office and also threw cold water on the idea that he could potentially pick her as a running mate. Take a listen.

They intercepted some of those munitions heading for the base. But this is very reminiscent, if we remember back four years, Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, the Iranian -- Iran's sort of top military commander for overseas operations, the United States killed him in a drone strike. And within a week or so of that, the Iranians fired a massive missile barrage at a US airbase inside Iraq. And at that time, again, it was traumatic brain injury that many of the troops there suffered, and it appears, we can't quite compare the magnitude of the two attacks at the moment, but it does appear that some of the troops are suffering from that.

You know, as horrible and as appalling as this conflict has been now, these 100 days or so, it has been largely contained.

He could not go somewhere else.It wasn't until he shifted his campaign when that failed miserably and he started talking about policy issues that Americans are actually interested in that he was able to do things like a CNN Town Hall and do other outlets.
