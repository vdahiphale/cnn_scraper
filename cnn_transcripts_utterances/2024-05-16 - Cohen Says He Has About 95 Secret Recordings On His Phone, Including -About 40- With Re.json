Erin Burnett is in New York outside the courthouse, and we're following all of the breaking details as Donald Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, is back under cross-examination.The defense continuing its effort to discredit the prosecution's star witness, raising questions about whether Michael Cohen answered truthfully about a call that he had in 2016 that's so important to the prosecution's case, when Cohen said he called Trump to update him on the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. Defense attorney, Todd Blanche, pressed Cohen about that call, alleging that the short conversation was really about a string of phone calls that Cohen had received from a teenage prankster, Erin.",
