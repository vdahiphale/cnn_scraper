And that means that the Treasury Department must now begin to use a series of what is called extraordinary measures to avoid default. Extraordinary measures that are no longer so extraordinary since they have been -- they've had to be used so often. This is a completely avoidable problem that falls entirely on Congress to raise the debt limit, something that Republicans are right now refusing to do without cutting unrelated spending to the actual bills that have come due, by the way. Democrats say that is not on the table. If the U.S. defaults, it will cause absolute chaos in the global economy. Christine Romans is standing by for us with this. Kind of saw this one coming, Christine. But we have hit the moment. What happens now?",

      "sentences": "So Kate, the clock starts now. Once the U.S. hits the upper limit of what it could legally borrow to run the government, the Treasury Department now starts juggling with so-called extraordinary measures.Deferring investments into important retirement funds, for example, for public servants; various accounting moves could buy some time and keep the bills paid until maybe June. June 5th is the date that the Treasury Secretary just gave Congress. Then come the really hard decisions, choosing which bills are paid and who gets an IOU instead -- members of the military, Social Security recipients. And what about paying interest on the U.S. debt? If Congress defaults on its debt, it could rock the foundation of the global economy, American creditworthiness. Borrowing costs would spike, stock markets would fall, millions of jobs will be lost. Grave consequences that would stall the U.S. economy at best and risk a financial crisis around the world at worst. And in any case, it would add even more money to the national debt, all over a political fight over paying America's bills. Now the White House warns of chaos and accused Republicans of economic vandalism. Some Republicans insist that the national debt is America's top problem today and they want to tie future spending restraint to paying for what it has already spent. But they haven't outlined exactly where they would slash that spending and, again, the Treasury Secretary just moments ago alerting Congress that she has already begun these extraordinary measures and June 5th is when they could begin to run out.

One of the things that we could see is the U.S. and allies are trying to help the Ukrainians build up Western militarized infantry and fighting vehicles that they want to give to the Ukrainians.So the Strykers are a big deal for the mechanized infantry that the Ukrainians want to build up. But there is also Bradleys that will be part of that as well. And that will certainly help the Ukrainians on the ground. As part of that, also, there is also other countries that will contribute similar vehicles. The Germans have a version they are going to give and the Swedes as well. The Ukrainians are saying that is absolutely key. It was really interesting because I was able to speak to the deputy foreign minister of Ukraine not so long ago and he said that the big problem they have right now is that they're running out of ammo for the old Soviet-style vehicles. So they need Western vehicles. But they want more than just infantry fighting vehicles. They also want main battle tanks. They're talking about the German main battle tank, the Leopard 2. And tomorrow there is that big meeting in Ramstein, where the U.S. and allies are hoping to push the Germans to give those as well, Kate.",

Prosecutors in New Mexico have just announced that actor Alec Baldwin has been -- is going to be charged with involuntary manslaughter for his role in the fatal shooting on the set of the movie, \"Rust.\" Now this all, you remember, happened back in October of 2021. A gun that Baldwin was holding discharged, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, injuring the film's director. The film's armorer will also be charged. Let's get over to Josh Campbell, where this announcement has just come through. Josh, what more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Significant news here. This is what we have been waiting on. The D.A. said she would make an announcement today in this case. This stemming from the October 2021 shooting here in Santa Fe, on the set of the movie \"Rust.\"And the actor, Alec Baldwin, will be charged according to prosecutors with involuntary manslaughter. A second individual, this is the person responsible for the weapons on the set and safety on the set, will similarly be charged. Interestingly, both of these people will be charged with two counts each. And what the prosecutor said is that one of those involuntary manslaughter charges includes underlying negligence. There was some kind of negligence on the part of each of these people. The second charge requires more than negligence and what she said -- and it sounds at there point that they're throwing significant charges up -- but it will be up to a jury, the D.A. said, to decide which definition best fits the circumstances of this case. So it is not just one charge. Both Alec Baldwin and Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer, will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Now a third individual, David Hall (sic), who was the assistant director on the set, he had allegedly handled that firearm that was used to -- in that fatal shooting of Helena Hutchins. And according to the D.A., he's agreed to plead to negligent use of a deadly weapon. And that is a misdemeanor. So he will sign a plea agreement, if that hasn't already been executed, agreeing to plead to that. So three people now expected to be charged -- or excuse me -- two charged, one person expected to plea. There were a host of other people involved in this, who came under scrutiny, that were involved in the props on the set, from the weapon itself to some of the bullets, the live ammunition that we saw. At least as of right now, those people have not been charged. And, of course, we'll be speaking soon with the D.A. to get a better sense of whether this case is now over, is a sense of assessing and then moving to prosecution or if either people might be in jeopardy. That is something that we'll continue to watch. But again the major news here, although these three individuals have claimed they are innocent and continue to say they did nothing wrong, the district attorney's office now moving with charges in this case. Actor Alec Baldwin and the person responsible for the weapons on the set will be charged by the district attorney here in Santa Fe.",

And particularly if you separate Alec Baldwin, the actor, from Alec Baldwin, the producer.It would have been hard to see him charged with a crime in his capacity as an actor here. But he's being charged in effect as someone who was responsible for what happened on the set. And what this involuntary manslaughter charge comes down to is negligence. The law defines that as the duty of care that a reasonable person in a similar situation would have provided, right. And that requires comparing this situation to other movie sets. And what I think the prosecutors found here was that what happened was so unreasonable as to -- and this is the law, right out of the statute -- producing death in an unlawful manner without due caution and introspection. So it is -- this wasn't just a simple accident that happened on a movie set, at least according to the prosecutor allegedly. What this is was such a failure from the leadership on the movie set that led to an incredibly tragic death.",

It is literally a teachable moment for the entire film industry.And we -- I bring classrooms together of film professionals. And we break down the \"Rust\" incident, based on the legal reports of the FBI and the Santa Fe district attorney. And when I ask -- when I turned to the people in the workshop and I say, OK, who is responsible, when they look at this chain of events, give me some names, let's put them on the dry erase board. They don't come up with any less than 10 names. So this was a chain of events that happened long before a gun got in Alec Baldwin's hand and the round left the barrel. It started with the hiring practices and the budgeting and the way they scheduled the show and the treatment of the crew. And the seed that was planted that really was a fatal moment was when somebody provided live ammunition disguised as dummy rounds in a box to a film set. I've talked to hundreds of people now and nobody has any recollection ever in history of live rounds being sent mistakenly to a film set. So that seed germinated and everybody's hands that went through, the prop master and the armorer and eventually the first AD, who inserted himself in this process where he had no business being, each one of those things cascaded in an event that anyone of those things would have stopped this. So yes, are these people negligent? Certainly. But I would offer that there are several more people up the food chain negligent from the very beginning.",

And just as -- yes, it is Alec Baldwin and it is a common name and someone that many people like to watch on television and movies and so on.But as of right now or soon, he will be a charged defendant with a crime. He will have a right to answer for the charges. And certainly under the law, is entitled to a speedy trial, just like everybody else. Now look, one of the defendants here has already pled guilty to an offense. I would guess that -- and this is pure speculation -- perhaps that individual's testimony might have helped support the other charges for the other individuals here, right. But either they get toward a plea agreement or, as Chloe said, he may fight this and take it all the way to trial. Now look, there is a huge disincentive to going to trial because you're going to end up with a heavier sentence than you would have gotten had you pled guilty. So that is a consideration for Alec Baldwin and his lawyers to make. But some people, some defendants truly think that they can kick it and beat it and he may fight it to the end.",

It wasn't one round that happened on that set -- that happened to be on that set. With 25 live rounds, it is incredibly bad odds that something bad is going to happen. They found these rounds scattered in different places, on work carts, in the belt that Baldwin was wearing, was a live round. Live rounds were scattered around the set. So it was only a matter of time before one of these got fired. And the fellow that sent them, I would say that it probably boils down to that. And you've also got -- I think one of the biggest conflicts we have in the film industry is the role of the first assistant director. The producers have seen fit to make them the chief safety officer, because they're on the set at all times. So that means that they're the person that said, let's make it safe and take a beat to check the gun. But they first have another job, let's beat the clock and make our day by the end of sundown.
