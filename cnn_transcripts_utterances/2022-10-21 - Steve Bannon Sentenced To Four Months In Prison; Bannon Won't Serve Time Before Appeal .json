The judge settled on four months behind bars and a $6,500 fine. You know, Bannon didn't want any jail time at all. He wanted probation. The judge made pretty clear today, that was not going to happen.There was going to be some period of incarceration, but you know, a big win for Bannon. The judge said, all of this is going to be delayed, pending his appeal. So, if Bannon is successful in his appeal, if he's able to overturn his conviction, of course, he would not face any time behind bars. If he is not successful, he's looking at that four-months and he's looking at that fine. You know, one of the things that judge made clear, as we were going through the sentencing today, as he pointed out that Steve Bannon really didn't show any remorse for defying a subpoena, for testimony as well as for documents. And he pointed out that there are some documents that he certainly could have provided that Steve Bannon has been out of the government for a long period of time that there were ways he could have been more responsive. And the judge also pointed out that this needs to be a deterrent to other people, a signal that you can't just, you know, get a subpoena and have your lawyer send a letter, and then refuse to provide anything or, you know, even lay out a list of, sort of what your objections are document by document. I think that is the message that judge was hoping to send, you know, ultimately Bannon team feels like this is a victory for them in some ways, because the sentence is delayed. I'm told that he has headed home to film his podcast for the day. Abby?",

And the judge, I think, emphasize that saying that's one of the reasons, the most important reason that he was getting four months in prison.And as for that second thing that you raised, the deterrence. I think the judge, in his reference to deterrence said, it's not to deter Bannon from committing another crime, it's to send a message to other people who might want to try to defy a congressional subpoena, that you're facing jail time and a substantial fine. And that's why he was proceeding with this sentence. Even though he conceded there were some issues that an appellate court might want to look at.",

So, I don't know if it's going to provide any other lessons for others on the committee for that reason. But certainly, Bannon is going to try to use it to increase his own notoriety. PHILLIP: And I just want to remind folks about why Bannon was such a crucial witness for the January 6 committee. It's because he was in the lead up to January 6, basically previewing what Trump was going to do - I am sorry, I should say, in the lead up to the election previewing what Trump was going to do after the election, and also previewing what was going to happen on January 6.

But a key thing in this case had been, that he wasn't working for the White House at the time when he made those comments, and therefore executive privilege was something that he had claimed didn't apply in this case.",

The big takeaway here, Republicans have momentum. Inside Elections is now shifting 21 House races, 13, more than half in favor of the GOP. Joining our conversation is Nathan Gonzales. He's the Editor and Publisher of Inside Elections.So, Nathan, some shifts happening, that's kind of mirroring, you know, the vibe shift that I think everybody's experiencing right now in elections. But just to show people what's happening here. This is where we stood in terms of the House ratings before the changes that you are making today. We had 19 toss ups, but generally speaking, you know, 25 tilt, or lean democratic seats, 13 total lean Republican seats. Let's take a look at where we are today. Now, fewer toss ups, fewer solidly democratic seats, and more seats now leaning in the Republican direction. NATHAN GONZALES, EDITOR &amp; PUBLISHER, INSIDE ELECTIONS: Right. And we've changed our overall range from a Republican gain of eight to 20 seats to eight to 25 seats. So, we've upped that range. And the part of it is that, if you look at our - look at our ratings, and everything breaks, as they're supposed to be that would be on the lower end of that range. But Democrats are significantly - there's more vulnerability, they're just more-softer Democratic seats, and they're so close. And if undecided voters who are prioritizing the economy, they don't think President Biden's doing a good job. If they break for Republican candidates, that's when Republicans start to get on the upper end of that range.",

There's still room for this to change.But if it's moving as fast as it appears to, what we would be looking at, and you know, I think Nathan's data lays this out is some seriously surprising losses, potentially some bigger name Democrats that we didn't expect to lose their seats in the House.

But Iowa Democrats are pretty dispirited about their chances. The governor's race there is so important.So that's one of the many examples, which is really so fascinating. How many governor's races are tied to the Senate races as well. And Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor is likely to win going away there.

And I think that will actually potentially help shape that race. So, all eyes will be on Pennsylvania on election night. And then Georgia into the next month because Georgia is the only state of those battlegrounds that as a runoff election. As you know, so they have to get 50 percent, so that'll probably.

And it was a relatively low-key event, a speech at a fundraiser and touting his bipartisan infrastructure law. But notably, no stump speech, no raucous rally, very different from the GOP midterm strategy. My panel is back with me to discuss. Very different, frankly, from what other presidents have done. But the Washington Post notes this about where Democrats find themselves. The Democratic dynamic contrasts sharply with the landscape on the Republican side. Republican stars such as GOP Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, and former Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina have crisscrossed the country for Republican House and Senate hopefuls, especially those in tight or in pivotal races.
