And so do you have regular communications with, as you say, the other armed groups? \"Yes, we're united,\" he tells me. The gangs have formed a coalition known as \"Viv Ansanm,\" or Living Together, and collectively they push back on foreign intervention, holding tight their grips over a fractured state. Some using terror tactics like kidnapping, rape and murder to sustain control. Is that something you've participated in, in ordering your men and women to kidnap? He says he hopes to defend himself in court against those allegations. And while not denying his followers have kidnapped people, he deflects blame to outside forces for creating a state of corruption as he sees it. He's eager to show us other parts of his home and territory and introduces us to his top commander. So you're his cousin? Security experts suggest Kraze Barye has more than a thousand armed- gang members, including recently escaped inmates. As you can see, a lot of his armed soldiers and followers are around us. And he's suggesting that we follow and drive with him. He brings us to the edge of his territory. We notice his guards, normally curious and watching us, are instead looking outward, cautiously, toward another gang's territory. A reminder that the coalition of gangs might be more fragile than portrayed. In the midst of our tour, a disturbing video starts circulating on WhatsApp. It reportedly shows the devastating and deadly aftermath of an allied gang attack on a community a few miles from where we are. The destruction, the violence, the deaths that have played out, do you take any responsibility for that? He only says he made mistakes and is not perfect. He blames politicians. We're interrupted.

All the more so that in the 20th century social housing was built on the outskirts in the so-called (INAUDIBLE), where occasionally top architects were hired to design vast social housing and sometime grand projects like the (INAUDIBLE) Estate, that was built in the early 1980s.
