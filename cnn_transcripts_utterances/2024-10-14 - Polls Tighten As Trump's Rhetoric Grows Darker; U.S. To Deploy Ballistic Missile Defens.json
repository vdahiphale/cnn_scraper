CNN's most recent poll of polls has Kamala Harris with a 50 to 47 percent edge over Donald Trump among likely voters nationally. But, of course, that means there is no clear leader. New polls released narrowed Harris' margins over the weekend. Both candidates headed to battleground states talking to voters about key issues -- immigration a big one.

[05With a little more than three weeks until Election Day, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both arguing this is the most consequential election of our lifetime. Tom Nichols, writer and former professor at the U.S. Naval War College is the author of the new cover story on this month's Atlantic. It's called \"The Moment of Truth.\" Nichols argues that a second Trump presidency would mark the end of George Washingtons' vision for both the presidency and for the United States of America. Nichols writes this. \"As we judge the candidates, we should give thought to Washington's example, and to three of Washington's most important qualities and the traditions they represent: his refusal to use great power for his own ends, his extraordinary self-command, and most of all, his understanding that national leaders in a democracy are only temporary stewards of a cause far greater than themselves.\" And joining us now is Tom Nichols. Tom, welcome to the show. I'm so grateful to have you. It's so nice to see you again. This is just a remarkable portrait. And in this piece, which I highly recommend to everyone, you write about how went back and revisited as a scholar the history of George Washington, trying to find the man himself. Explain why you did this, what you found, and why it matters so much right now in this moment. TOM NICHOLS, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC (via Skype):  You know, when you go -- I think most Americans -- when you go back and you think about George Washington you kind of have this very stodgy sort of historical figure in mind. I always refer to him as the guy who is giving you the side eye from the dollar bill. The sort of kind of disapproving judgmental look. But he was actually very human, racked by doubts and insecurities like the rest of us. And yet, he made these extraordinary choices. He made choices to constantly -- to turn back the offers of ultimate power. He refused to join -- for example, to join continental officers who wanted to overthrow the Congress shortly after the Revolution because they weren't getting paid and they thought that democracy -- you know, to use a term that we hear now, that democracy wasn't working. He didn't want to be president for more than a term. He really didn't want to be president at all and was pulled back into politics because he cared so much about this country. He was personally incorruptible and worried very much about even the -- even small gifts appearing as bribes. I mean, he could not be more different that the man who is trying to get back into the Oval Office. And I think Americans needs to remember this is our heritage. These are things we expected of presidents because Washington set the bar. And even the worst presidents who came after Washington tried in some way to measure up to that. And Trump just doesn't care. Trump couldn't care less about honor, integrity, and patriotism -- and that's partly why I wrote the piece.",

Things got so out of hand Detroit let two offensive lineman run routes as receivers, then called a hook and ladder to 335-pound Penei Sewell. He's swift, like Taylor, diving towards the goal. And there was a flag on the play though. But Detroit's defense -- they had Dak Prescott seeing ghosts, sacking him four times. Safety Brian Branch intercepted him twice. They did, however, lose their star Aidan Hutchinson in this one to a season- ending leg injury. The Lions roll 47-9. The Tampa Bay Bucs were playing with some extra motivation dominating their division rival Saints 51-27 -- the most points by any team this season. Baker Mayfield threw for four touchdowns.
