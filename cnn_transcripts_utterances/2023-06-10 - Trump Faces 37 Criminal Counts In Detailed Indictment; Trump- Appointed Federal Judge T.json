      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.We're now just hours away from Donald Trump speaking publicly for the first time since the U.S. Justice Department unsealed its historic indictment against the former president. The DOJ laid out its case in stunning detail, charging Trump with 37 counts, including 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information. The 49-page indictment includes new details about how Trump allegedly took classified documents to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in 2021. Then resisted the government's attempts to retrieve those materials. Special counsel Jack Smith also releasing new photos showing the scope of the investigation and evidence, including photos of boxes containing classified markings at locations around Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump is expected to speak at GOP conventions in both Georgia and North Carolina today. CNN's Zach Cohen and Randi Kaye are following all the details for us today. Zach, let's go to you first. Trump is now the first former president ever charged with crimes in federal court. So, how potentially damning is the evidence against him?",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, those photos that you were just showing really speak to the level of detail in this indictment where prosecutors are accusing the former president not only retaining highly-sensitive documents that -- after leaving office that he was not supposed to keep. But then resisting when the government tried to get those documents back.Now 31 of the 37 counts laid out in this indictment related to Trump are about retaining what's known as National Defense Information. And the indictment lays out very clearly what this means, this information relates to U.S. nuclear programs, defense and weapons capabilities, potential vulnerabilities the U.S. has to attack. So really some of the most highly sensitive and highly guarded U.S. secrets were found at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Now, the photos are not only a great illustration of what Trump took, but where he put them once he took them back to Mar-a-Lago. And there's really a stark example of a photo showing classified documents spilled all over the floor of a storage room, and its labeled what's known as -- to be only shared with Five Eyes allies, so the U.S. closest foreign allies and it speaks to how sensitive that document was and where it was found when the FBI eventually went to Mar-a-Lago in an effort to get these documents back. Now, the other charges here relate more to obstruction and to concealment, and again, the prosecutors are really laying out very clear and detailed case showing that Trump tried to resist when the FBI, when the government tried to get these documents back. They even quote a communication between Trump and his former lawyer before the FBI executed a search warrant. And Trump says they're discussing the subpoena and the documents the government's trying of get back and Trump says wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here? And then he goes on to ask his lawyer to pluck out anything that might be bad. So obviously Trump knew that there were documents there and discussing ways to potentially keep prosecutors from getting a hold of them.",

Also we can expect to see a perimeter here around the courthouse, not only to keep the former president safe, but also those who show up here. They're expecting very large crowds of supporters and protesters, as well as media. They did do a threat assessment here at the courthouse. They didn't find any immediate threats and of course this is a very coordinated effort with social -- with Secret Service, of course, keeping a close eye on the former president. Miami PD will make sure that there are detours, and road closures in place where needed. Then you have the U.S. Marshals and the FBI. [11:04:57]",

And when the former president does show up there's, according to my sources, they believe that he will go in some type of entrance where he's -- he's not exposed to the groups that will be out here on the courthouse steps or in the area here.

And so they did the best they can under the circumstances and they made a determination that given the type of documents that he retained, the efforts he undertook to conceal them from the prosecutors, they had no choice but to indict.

Or do you believe that he will be kind of riding this, you know, wave of popularity for a while?

You know, whether or not his numbers will go up or down I'm not really sure what's going to happen there. Frankly, I think he'll probably stay steady. He's already shown, and more importantly the Republican Party has already shown that they're willing to take him as is. They know his weaknesses, they know his faults. There's nobody defending him who actually believes he didn't do anything wrong, you know. And when you look at -- I'm particularly, I guess, drawn to Kevin McCarthy's response to all this. Before we even knew what was in the indictment, McCarthy came out calling it a sham, blaming Biden for weaponizing the DOJ against a former Republican, really minimizing what this could be about. And when he does that it makes it much easier for those Republicans that you were just talking about a moment ago who are saying, gee, I do have some concerns, can he win? It makes it a lot easier for them to stay with him when one of the highest elected leaders of the party is saying it's all garbage, this is all just made up, it's a big sham.

Having said that, you have to keep in mind there are fires burning right across this country from the west to the east. It is on track already to be the second worst fire season ever in this country, and it will likely be surpassed, given the fact this is still early in that wildfire season. Now having said all of this, what is going to help the most is somecooler, wetter weather moving through some critical regions like Quebec, hopefully in the next few days. This will continue to be a problem, though, and I want you to see why. Have a look at this map. This is Canada, in fact, North America as it includes Alaska, the Boreal Zone. It includes millions of hectares of boreal forest. Those places have been susceptible to more wildfires given climate change. It's not a clear pattern, it is incredibly complex. But the fact remains that there have been more wildfires, and they emit carbon of their own that also adds to the climate crisis. Given what you see there, officials in the United States and Canada are trying to see if they come up with some kind of joint fire management system that includes better ways to try and manage a wildfire in the future and also obviously trying to pool resources, trying to really not just prevent the fires, but when they see hot spots, get on top of it right away. Having said that, officials say to prepare for what unfortunately will be a very severe wildfire season, in the months to come. Paula Newton, CNN -- Ottawa. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Dr. Wen, great to see you.So here we are, you know, along the East Coast, seeing, you know, these air quality alerts, give us an idea, general idea of just how harmful can smoke like this, from wildfires, be? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: It can be very harmful. I think many people are already feeling some of the short-term impacts. People have had hoarseness, some coughing, shortness of breath, headaches from that inhalation short term. The individuals who are greatest risk are young children, the elderly, pregnant individuals and people with underlying lung and heart conditions. For these individuals studies have shown that there is an increase in hospitalization due to respiratory issues. When there are -- when there is heavy wildfire exposure, and also that there is an increase in heart attacks, and in cardiac arrest, and the heart stopping because of the stress that's put onto people's bodies during wildfire exposure. So the short-term effects are really significant.",

I would say, though, that for people who had a one-time exposure, so people who last week breathed a few days of hazardous air, for most of those individuals there's not going to be long-term consequences. But that said, with the increase in wildfires around the world it's possible that we're going to see more and more of these events, even from hundreds of miles away, that can affect our health.",

And I would just say people should monitor the federal government Website which is very good, airnow.gov to see what's going on in their area and make decisions accordingly. If the air quality is pretty good, especially if you're a generally healthy person, it's fine to resume normal activities. But if the air quality is borderline and you're in these vulnerable categories consider avoiding strenuous outdoor exercise, staying indoors, running your air purifiers. We've seen that they could be helpful during COVID, they're useful during wildfire season as well. And make sure to keep all your other health conditions as well tuned as possible, especially if you have respiratory conditions. Make sure that you have all your inhalers, and use them as needed.",
