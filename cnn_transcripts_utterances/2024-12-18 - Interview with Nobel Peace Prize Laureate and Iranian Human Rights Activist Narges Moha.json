In Iran, the relentless crackdown on people who oppose the regime has expanded to those speaking out about Iran's failure to support its longtime ally in Syria and criticizing the resources spent on propping Assad up instead of at home. But still, there are those bravely speaking out on issues of human rights, democracy and women's equality, Narges Mohammadi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who has now been in prison for the better part of the last 20 years. The state has accused her of acting against national security, but she has continued to be a voice for freedom and democracy at great personal risk and sacrifice. And now, in a world exclusive interview, she's made the extraordinary decision to speak to us with her message for the world. And she's doing so while out on a temporary release from prison on medical grounds, and she's due to be sent back there soon. Narges Mohammadi joined me from her home for this conversation.

You have had multiple heart attacks. You're a young woman, but nonetheless, you've had multiple heart attacks. How are you treated? MOHAMMADI (through translator):  I do not want to compare the prisons of the Islamic Republic of Iran with those of the Assad regime, because Assad has been toppled. And now, the dungeons have been opened and people have seen how the situation was, whereas the prisons in Iran, Kurdistan, Sistan, Baluchistan, Khuzestan, the doors are still locked and we have no information about what is happening there. So, I can speak about my experiences in Zanjan and Qarchak prison, the experience we had in the IRGC cells, in the security cells and in solitary confinement, they are very, very tragic experiences. There have been prisoners who've been isolated from everyone. They have been in solitary confinement. They have been isolated from society, and they're even unaware of their own case files. There are people who have been in solitary confinement for a long time. As a result, they have suffered from physical ailments and are still suffering. And there are some who have actually died in solitary confinement, and nobody knows what's happened and what happened to their case files. There are many such files, there are not just a few. So, we've been witnessing very disconcerting situations. Perhaps once they open prison doors in Iran, we will see much more.",

MOHAMMADI (through translator):  It -- the three-year period for you may not be too long, but for me, the changes I'd seen in Ali and Kiana in these three years, I was amazed. I was actually a bit shocked. I felt that they had really grown up and I felt that -- and I'd lost the long period of being with them. Because when I left Iran, they were eight and a half years old, and I remember I hugged them, Ali and Kiana, and we sang \"Morghe Sahar,\" which is a revolutionary song, together, and that was ten years ago.

You've got a three-week furlough for recovery from this operation. And obviously, you, your lawyer, your supporters want you to have much, much longer out. But how do you cope in prison? You and the other women who are separated from children, husbands, family? MOHAMMADI (through translator):  Look, life continues in prison. And I could elaborate about life in prison, because it could be maybe a bit difficult for your audience to understand. Look, you have to define life in prison through perseverance and resilience. That's how you can define it. So, if you have that resilience in you, you can be sure that you as a prisoner, you can make some kind of life for yourself in Iran and in the Iranian prisons, especially in the general ward of Evin Women's Prison, especially after the uprising off 2022. Women have become more resistant. They've become more resilient. They've become much stronger since that uprising. Those women have shown their resistance by coming to the street. And those very women who staged the protests have ended up in prison, and they're continuing that resistance, albeit from within prison walls. So, I can say confidently that life in prison continues its momentum. I don't mean that life in prison is normal. No, that's not what I mean. And nor do I mean that it's the government that is allowing us to have some semblance of normality within prison walls and live a kind of a normal life. No, it's no thanks to the government. It's thanks to the strength of the women, their motivation, that we have adopted some kind of normal lifestyle within the prison walls. We continue to be motivated. We continue to have hope. We continue to have our resilience. Look, two of my inmates are on death row at the moment, Pak -- Ms. Pakhshan Azizi and Ms. Verisheh Moradi, but even those facing heavy sentences, and I can see from experience in our ward, we have prisoners who have been convicted and they have to -- they're facing prison terms of 10 to 15 years, some are on death row, but they're keeping their spirits very high. They're creating role models, the models of a life that is based on creativity. They're changing prison to anti-prison. The walls of Evin prison is -- has cracked because of the chance of these women. That's how I feel that they've been cracked.",

What do you want to send to the world in your book?MOHAMMADI (through translator):  Look, this is not the memoirs of an individual. I have tried to illustrate the changes and developments that have been taking place in Iranian society and what the Iranian society has witnessed, especially with regards to women. My memoir is an attempt by me to show what has been happening in Iran in the past decades. The women have been the ones who've been subjected to the most repression in the country. They have resisted, nevertheless, but this resistance was not only to the government, but it's also been a resistance to the age-old traditions that exist in countries, including Iran, countries in the Middle East in general. And there is -- these women have paid a substantial price for that. It has been a resistance accompanied by hope for a bright future. The women have been trying to keep the flames of this hope alive, at least in their hearts, even if they've been unable to express it. This is an attempt to show how the sparks of activism for human rights has managed to overcome the suppression and spread their hope in society. That is what I've been trying to illustrate. And it's my attempt to show that the struggles of -- this is the struggles of a nation. Look, the reality is that we are people, we are women, who are doing our utmost to achieve democracy, freedom, equality. When you look at the history of the struggles of the Iranian people, you can see that the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran has no capacity for equality, democracy, and freedom. And based on the experience of our people, this regime cannot be reformed. So, I think that we have reached a position where we need a transition from the autocratic theocracy of the Islamic Republic. But for this transition, there are conditions. And from -- in my opinion, nonviolence is imperative in this transition. It is one of the important components. Our goal is to achieve democracy and a secular government.",

And so, you know, what we see now is them pulling quickly S-300, S-400 air defense systems out, flying them out of the country. We see the naval forces assets moving offshore. But when it comes to pushing them out and keeping them out, this should not be difficult because, you know, HTS, the rebel group on the ground, knows it for 50 plus years as long as Russia has had bases there, they have been supporting the Assad regime. They have been enabling the killing of Syrians for decades and of course, most notably in the last 10 years since Assad moved to put down the latest resurgence -- insurgency. Russia was bombing Syrians, they were using other troops to engage Syrians. And so, their history there is not good. So, I imagine HTS would keep them out. We know that Moscow is trying to stay in. I think we need to get in on those negotiations as well. And I see already that, you know, the E.U., for example, is talking about there can be no sort of normalization, if you will, let alone humanitarian assistance or rebuilding assistance if Russia is allowed to stay in country. So, I think things like that, a combination of soft power with incentives and disincentives are the way to engage HTS and bring them along so we can see, again, not just a better future for the Syrian people with more normalized governance, but a Syria that no longer has Russia occupying major ports and facilities.",

Are you talking about hand-to-hand combat like the Peloponnesian Wars or you're really man to man in the trenches, or are you talking about the kind of combat that we have today and likely to have tomorrow?

When a society denies the conditions that are necessary to live to its people, and they die because of it, that that itself, he called it social murder. And, you know, there's another -- you know, another Norwegian social scientist termed it structural violence in 1969. And I just think, you know, there are a lot of ways to unjustly and immorally end someone's life before it should have ended. One of them, the kind of violence that we fixate on in this country is a single person with a weapon that intends harm upon another person and then causes it, but there's a lot of other ways to end a life early and unjustly and immorally, and denying people healthcare is one of them, especially when you know, there is so clearly -- you look at CEO compensation in this country, healthcare companies aside, you look at the revenues of a company like UnitedHealthcare and the fact that it denies one-third of all the care that doctors ask for for their patients. Every single one of those denied claims is a potential bankruptcy is a potential sickness, potential death.

Andrew Witty, who is the UnitedHealth Group CEO, wrote an op-ed last week, saying that the --emphasizing the company's mission to make healthcare more compassionate to people and transparent. And he said, and I'll quote here, \"We know the health system does not work as well as it should, and we understand people's frustrations with it. No one would design a system like the one we have. And no one did. It's a patchwork built over decades. Our mission is to help make it work better.\" Like how do you or do you reconcile these statements with the realities that you wrote about in your piece? And then, frankly, they have to know we're true. I mean, they know what their numbers are.",

Ithink it is -- I thought it was really honestly funny that Andrew Witty, the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, thought that after all of the things that have come out about UnitedHealth in recent days, all of these investigations from the last few years, all of these government investigations, all of these class action lawsuits about how the company employs algorithms to kick elderly patients out of rehab beds 14 days after they have surgery, right? How there are internal programs that have been deemed illegal in multiple states about how they have to kick people off reimbursement once they're getting too much therapy. You can't get around the fact that this is how the systems work, that how they generate their profits is not despite the fact that because of the fact that they deny so many people care. You know, obviously it's complicated. It's not exactly that black and white. But that is how this company makes money. So, I applaud the PR team at UnitedHealth Group for spending five days, you know, working every little sentence in there to try to, you know, convince people that they're working their hardest to take care of people. But I think, I -- you know, I think it's not true. I think The Times had to shut down comments on that one because it was -- you know, it was not a successful winning hearts and minds campaign on the part of UHG.",

And you had -- he had a wider margin of victory than he had the last time he ran. And, you know, he did -- no one is disputing that he won this election. They can like it or not like it, but no one's disputing that he won it, which means that more people voted for him. And so, then how do you square that with this sort of outrage at these systems, which he shows no inclination to disrupt?",

I mean, I think that, you know, there are a lot of people -- there are a lot of perhaps under informed voters that still get thissort of baseless whiff of populism off of Trump, despite every single thing that he's ever showed in his life. He's still positioned himself as a populist leader, right, as someone that's like fighting for it. And, you know, if you scratch that one second, it all falls apart, but he has pretty successfully pushed that message. And I think it's -- you know, the sharp right return that every single city and state in the country basically took is -- I don't know, it's -- I mean, it is terrifying to me for a variety of reasons, but I think there's actually something promising in the fact that this reaction has been bipartisan, that you don' -- that actually, this is something that people on the right and on the left and in the center and in the weird sort of diagonal horseshoe, maha (ph), right, left, you know, all of these kind of contemporary configurations of politics or anti-politics that we have right now, there is a populist agenda here that neither party is actually pushing that is profoundly popular, right, that CEO pay is out of control and that these companies are operating immorally and that the enrichment of multimillionaires and billionaires at the direct expense of ordinary people, you know, is unjust. And I find something a little bit promising in the fact that when I was writing the piece, just to make sure that I wasn't getting, you know, lost in my sort of Brooklyn socialist bubble, I was checking lots of places, right? I was checking comment sections on local Fox affiliates, I was checking The New York Post, I was checking The New York Times, I was checking random TikToks, sort of all of these things. And everywhere no one was really saying like, yes, these companies are corrupt. It's all Trump's fault, or it's all Biden's fault, right? Like, people were recognizing that this is a system that kind of neither party is really trying to do anything about. And there is a -- there is like a real political opportunity there, and there's a real potential locus of political promise if only someone would take it up, in actuality, which obviously Trump's not going to do.",
