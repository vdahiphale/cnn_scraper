      "sentences": "Hello, a warm welcome to our viewers joining us around the world. I'm Max Foster. It's Monday, December the 9th, 9 a.m. here in London and noon in Damascus, Syria, where CNN's team heard strikes in the early hours of Monday morning after the fall of Assad's regime. It's not immediately clear who carried out those strikes.On Sunday, the leader of the rebel forces in Damascus delivered his first public remarks since their takeover of the country. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani says defeating the Assad regime is a, quote, victory for the entire Islamic nation. Russia says that President Bashar al-Assad, a key ally to Vladimir Putin, fled to Moscow with his family where they were granted asylum. After rebels took the capital, they said they were actively searching for Assad. Some of the fighters, along with civilians, were seen ransacking his official residences and presidential office. This morning, Syrians celebrated in the streets of Damascus, some waving rebel flags, and state TV marked the fall of Assad on the evening news last night, hours after he was overthrown.

      "sentences": "Yes, this certainly was the culmination, if you will, of a very long day of uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the former Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad. The Russians late last night coming out and confirming that Assad, and as they put it, members of his family had arrived in Moscow and that they were being given asylum by the Russian authorities, as the Russians put it, on humanitarian grounds. So the Russians are essentially saying that they propped up Bashar al-Assad for a very long time.They were, of course, one of the biggest military, also financial backers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and that they would not now drop him and in fact allow him and members of his family to come here and obviously stay here as well now that they've been given asylum. But again, this comes at or came at the end of a large day of uncertainty. And we mentioned some of that in the lead in to our live report right here, that when the rebel forces, when the opposition went into the capital, stormed the capital, when the regime essentially collapsed, they very quickly said that Bashar al-Assad had fled Damascus, that he was not in Damascus, but they did not know the whereabouts of Bashar al-Assad. And it was indeed the Russian foreign ministry that was the first to come out and confirm that Bashar al-Assad had left the country. They came out with a statement in the early afternoon hours yesterday saying that Assad had told his subordinates to make sure that there is a transfer of power in Syria and that he had then left the country, as they put it. The Russians themselves apparently also coming to terms with the fact that the Assad government is no more in Syria. What we are hearing is that here in Moscow, at the Syrian embassy in Moscow, where yesterday we were in front of that embassy, there was no flag. Apparently by now the flag of the Syrian opposition flies there as well. So the Russians now themselves also saying they are going to be working with all groups on the ground. Of course, we know, Max, that the Russians still have a lot of military assets on the ground inside Syria -- Max. FOSTER: This was Russia's key ally, wasn't it, in the Middle East. So what does this mean for Russia?",

      "sentences": "Yes, yes. So that's something that we actually kept an eye on a lot yesterday. And in the beginning of the day yesterday, when it was clear that Assad had fallen, there was a big transition taking place. There really wasn't very much in the way of coverage on state media. They did lead the newscasts, but it certainly wasn't something that was dealt with in depth in wall-to-wall coverage like you would see on a lot of Western channels, a lot of Middle Eastern channels as well.The other thing that we also noticed is that a lot of the information that was being given from state media seemed to come secondhand from Western TV channels or Western media and also Middle Eastern publications as well. Right now, there is a lot more coverage than there was before. The Russians obviously understand that they are going to have to deal with this, that this is going to be a huge topic in Russian society, in Russian media, in Russian politics as well, because of course, it does potentially deal a pretty large blow to Russia's foreign policy, to the power that they can project within the Middle East, but also globally as well. So it is certainly something that is being discussed here in a lot of venues, and of course, also now on state media as well. But certainly, if you look at a lot of the state media, even this morning, I was just watching it before we went to air here, the situation in Ukraine, still very much center stage over what is going on in Syria right now -- Max.",

Thank you so much for that perspective.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli military to seize a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for decades. It comes as Israel warned residents of the area to stay in their homes. Let's bring in CNN's Paula Hancocks in Abu Dhabi. I mean, there have been various sort of movements, haven't they, involving countries outside Syria, within the country. This is an opportunity to, you know, make some, you know, movements around this chaos. How would you regard it?",

And we've heard that they're concerned, as many that have a border with Syria are, as to what comes next.So what we've heard from the Defense Minister Israel Katz is that he has ordered the military to station soldiers, military personnel in this buffer zone. There's a sort of heightened strategic position of Mount Hermon, which sits just on the border between Israel, the Golan Heights, which Israel took from Syria in the 1967 war and has since annexed Lebanon and Syria. So it's a key area which we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They decided to move into when they saw that the regime soldiers from Syria, the Assad regime soldiers, were moving out. They were concerned about a vacuum there and who might fill that vacuum. So what we're hearing from the Israeli side is that they are within this area. Now, it's an area they have not been in for decades, but it is an area they believe they have to station soldiers in. Let's listen to the prime minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have also ordered the Israeli military to make sure that there is no kind of smuggling of weapons from Iran to Lebanon through Syria. So that's another key reason why the Israeli military believes it does need to be there.Now, we did hear that there were airstrikes overnight in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Our CNN team on the ground reported that. It wasn't immediately clear who was responsible for that. We have heard from Reuters saying they believe it was the Israeli military, but the military not commenting on that. We did see, though, just last Friday a rare acknowledgement from Israel that they had carried out airstrikes in Damascus. Usually they don't admit to strikes in countries outside of their domain. But it's certainly a concern for Israel. They had had this uneasy truce, if you like, on that border with Syria. Not that they were particularly supportive or liked the Assad regime, considering there was plenty of weapons smuggling that went through that area to the detriment of Israel. But it was a border they did not feel the need to guard quite so heavily. So they now have these troops in this buffer zone, which separates the Golan Heights and Syria -- Max.",

This video was shot inside the notorious Saydnaya prison. It can be hard to tell in the chaos of these pictures, but we're told these are rebel forces releasing prisoners that were held there. Families have been gathering, searching for loved ones perceived as threats to the previous government. Countless Syrian men, women and children have disappeared into this facility in what's known to be inhumane conditions. Human rights groups say thousands never came out. U.S. President Joe Biden called the collapse of the Assad regime a, quote, fundamental act of justice. He also offered a blueprint for how the U.S. plans to support the Middle East in this moment of instability. In remarks from the White House on Sunday, he's sending U.S. officials to the region and says he plans to speak with his counterparts there in the coming days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country. It's also a moment of risk and uncertainty.

I mean, there's a lot of hope in Syria today because there's no doubt it was a horribly repressive regime, but we don't know what's going to replace it. And this is a strategically important country with a lot of military assets right now.MAJ. GEN. MARK MACCARLEY, U.S. ARMY (RET.): That's absolutely true. And as multiple contributors on the CNN team have said, we don't know what's going to happen next. We're in a phase of jubilance. Assad has been displaced. We have expressions of freedom, appreciation, acknowledgement of all that's taken place. But there's so many multiple factors here. First being that Jolani, who is the titular head of the perhaps new government, his HTA, which was the front leaning forward organization, consists of multiple different organizations that have been in Syria for a long period of time. He's put these groups together. They have successfully coalesced and they've achieved what we're now celebrating. The only issue is whether this relationship will survive this period of jubilance or we'll have a lot of splinter groups trying either to assemble to get something related to a consensus or start biting at each other, scratching and perhaps creating further chaos in the area. The second is that we have the evacuation of what appears to be a significant, but we don't know how do you define the term significant quantum or number of Syrian military personnel. What we don't know to any degree whatsoever is the extent to which the significant arsenals of the Syrian armed forces have either been removed, taken someplace else, whether these arsenals are secure in any sense whatsoever. And thirdly, if in fact these arsenals exist and there is a significant, big, big concern that within these arsenals we might indeed find that cache of chemical weapons, which was a subject of a tool that Assad used back at the time, the commencement of the civil war, the years 2011, 12, 13, 14, and whether those caches of chemical weapons are adequately secured by some authority that is responsible and would either destroy them or remove them as a temptation for any number of players who find themselves within the borders of Syria now, including ISIS.",
