What we know about the investigation so far, we'll take you to the scene. Then the head of mercenary group Wagner says he's handing control of Bakhmut over to regular Russian forces. But the Ukrainians say they haven't given up yet. And then later, outrage in Brazil over a game about slavery. We will explain that offensive as well as disturbing story. But we begin tonight with some developing news here in London. A car has collided with the front gates at Downing Street. That's where the prime minister, of course, and the cabinet convene. I want to go straight now to CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, who is for us this evening at Downing Street. And Salma, I believe this incident is now over. But do we know what happened?",

What we do know, it took place, is that at about 4:20 local time, according to Westminster police, a small vehicle drove very slowly, according to \"BBC\" footage we've seen, very slowly on this street just behind me here, slowed down even further before crashing into those iron gates. That white vehicle is actually still there, Isa, it's just behind that police. We do see that police have brought a tow vehicle and will of course, tow it clear at some point. The man who was driving that vehicle was arrested, of course, immediately by police. Arrested on suspicion of causing damage, criminal damage and of dangerous driving. Now, again, anytime we're talking about a location like 10 Downing Street, the fear is, is that it could have been much worse. But again, the key factor here in that statement was dangerous driving seems to be the greatest concern in this, but of course, it set a great deal of worry in this location. We do have an eyewitness account, an eyewitness who was here and heard and saw the moment that vehicle crashed into the gates. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin again, sounding off, saying his Wagner troops are withdrawing from Bakhmut.

      "sentences": "Yes, Isa, this is potentially a pretty big development if indeed it is true that YevgenyPrigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries are completely pulling out of Bakhmut. It was so interesting to see that video early this morning emerge with Yevgeny Prigozhin; the head of Wagner in it. Essentially going to some of the positions that his fighters were in, some tankers, also some ground troops as well, and telling them, look, we're pulling out. I think in one case, he said 15 minutes, and then we're going to be out here, we're going to replenish, we're going to regroup and then wait for new orders. So, certainly, that's the message that's coming in from Yevgeny Prigozhin and from Wagner, saying,  they are going to give all the positions that they've been holding inside Bakhmut, and of course, we were talking about this so much, Isa, both the Russian military and Wagner say they now control all of Bakhmut, but the Ukrainians continue to dispute that. But Wagner says they're going to give their positions to the Russian military, and then they are going to leave the city. We've actually been in touch with the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian military, to see what they had to say about all this, Isa. And they say at this point in time, they can't confirm that a full withdrawal is actually happening. However, they do say that there's been a significant decrease in the amount of attacks coming from   the Russian side. So that could be an indication that, that is really happening. The Ukrainians also saying that if the withdrawal is taking place, that is something that they believe could be very positive for them, and you know, it was so important for you to show that video of that -- you know, counteroffensive that the Ukrainians say that they started there now. They say they are encroaching on the outskirts, on the flanks of Bakhmut, and they certainly believe if the Wagner fighters are leaving, that could help them in that quest, Isa.",

And one of the things that Yevgeny Prigozhin did as his forces werewithdrawing, he took another swipe at Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said he will leave behind a couple of Wagner mercenaries to help the Russian military in case the Ukrainians come and sort of stand in the Ukrainian military's way. So certainly, there is no love lost. But it is of course, an important question, what happens next for Wagner? Which is a group that has made a difference on the battlefield. It certainly is a difficult factor for the Russian military, but it's also been pretty tough on the Ukrainians as well, to battle these Wagner mercenaries. Essentially, also because those brutal tactics that they've been employing using wave of humans, waves of -- in some places -- in some cases, people who were recruited from prisons to charge Ukrainian positions. Now, what we heard from Yevgeny Prigozhin today, is he said that they were going to go to the rear echelon, doesn't -- isn't clear whether it's somewhere else in Ukraine, but probably, his base is usually are in southwestern Russia, that they are going to regroup there, that they are going to replenish there, and then get back into the fight. It certainly seems though, from what we heard today in that video, that Yevgeny Prigozhin posted, that this is not someone who is not done yet and who is vowing to return to the battlefield of Ukraine with his mercenary group, Isa.",

RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Well, it's a warning shot across the bows. Remember, the U.S. has already lost the most -- the much wanted AAA rating. It did that some years ago in another debt crisis over the debt ceiling and budget deficit cuts. And basically, I mean, look, the U.S., there's a difference here, Isa, between the reality and the technicality. The reality is, the U.S. is still the whitest clean shirt in the dirty laundry. And the U.S. is still the largest market, and it still the place where people are going to want to do the most business. But you can't continue to do that if there is this question over the ability to pay its bills. Yes, it can pay its bills, and it will pay its bills, but there could be a very nasty moment, a technical default, if you will, that would completely and utterly, I cannot emphasize this enough, Isa, if there was even a technical default, it would be the equivalent of the markets being told the earth is flat after all.",

He is focused and disciplined and he can enact a really hardline conservative agenda much better than the former president, if he wins the presidency in 2024. And it does raise questions about the competency of Ron DeSantis' campaign as the moves through this election. You know, people on campaigns try and rule out any problem. They should have gamed this out time after time after time. And he's had months to get his campaign launch ready. So I think those are the questions this raises.

He's basically saying he would flush out the Justice Department and the FBI. He says there are expansive powers of the presidency that have not been used yet. We're getting today some indications that one of the big questions of his campaign is how he will take on former president Donald Trump, a task that most Republicans have failed to enact since Trump became a presidential candidate back in 2015. DeSantis is effectively arguing that, during the pandemic, Trump basically gave the economy and the country over to Dr. Fauci and the health officials in Washington. And basically, washed his hands of the pandemic and that resulted in Americans' freedoms being infringed. So you can see how he's trying to use his own management for the pandemic, in which he flouted government health advice, to get to Republican voters. So that's very interesting.

First, he has to peel away some of Trump's supporters. He's doing that with this bullying persona, by this hardline conservative agenda. He has imposed a lot of really \"make America great again\" policies down in Florida on issues like transgender rights, the health care issues there. The other thing is he's going to try and get everyone else out of the race, so all the anti-Trump vote goes to him. Right now, there are seven or eight Republican candidates. That's going to fracture the Trump vote. If we get to the caucuses next January and February and DeSantis is still one of nine, say, non-Trump candidates, it's going to be very difficult to see how he can overtake Trump.
