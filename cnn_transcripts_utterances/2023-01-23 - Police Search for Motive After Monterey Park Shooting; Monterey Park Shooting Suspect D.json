He is older than most mass shootings in the United States are perpetuated by younger men. JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYSTmoving into is, you know, the investigative phase. And it's tying in together, you know, trying to understand the motive, you know, of this attacker. Why was this location chosen? Was this, you know, this targeted act of violence, was it in response to some sort of grievance with an individual. You know, what were the factors that led this individual to, you know, commit this crime at that location and the secondary site, right. So, is this something that they went into the first location, didn't see the target they were looking for and then moved on to the next location. Again, all of that is going to be part of the investigative process. They're going to start looking at friends, family, interviewing them, trying to understand, you know, was there something -- you know, what was the motivation behind this act? They'll look at, you know, all of the digital trace evidence that they possibly can. Did this person, you know, belong to some sort of group? Did he telegraph any type of grievance or concern that would have led to, you know, this act? This is where investigators are going to start taking the items of evidentiary value from the crime scene, piecing it together with other elements. Again, to try to answer that question why.

One house Republican says the law should be applied equally to the investigations of both President Biden and former President Donald Trump and Democrats say they welcome the inquiry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-ILS): To think that any of them ended up in boxes, in storage one place or the other, is just unacceptable. But having said that, let me make this point clear, Joe Biden has said from the start, we are going to be totally transparent about this. Let the chips fall where they may. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): I do think this was inadvertent. The whole point of having a special counsel is to ensure that and to give the American people confidence in that. But frankly, Martha, I also don't think this is an issue that's keeping Americans up at night. SEN. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Classified documents can never be taken out of a SCIF ever. I am both a former FBI agent and I'm currently on the House Intelligence Committee. That's number one. Number two, we need equal application of the law. And that's what we're going to make sure that we ensure.

      "sentences": "After that FBI search on Friday lasting 13 hours, the White House is getting their message out that they have been fully cooperative in the past few weeks with federal officials.So, the president's personal attorney, Bob Bower, he stressed in a statement that they did provide prompt access to Biden's Wilmington home. And it's clear that Biden's attorneys have been communicating with the team for the U.S. attorney who has been handling this investigation out of Chicago, John Lausch, all before that's eventually handed over to the special counsel that the Attorney General appointed, Robert Hur. Crucially here, Friday's search was not conducted with a search warrant or a subpoena. And of course, that marks a stark contrast to the search that was conducted in August at Mar-a-Lago. That was undertaken after months of back and forth with DOJ officials and Trump's team. And it was after a subpoena and then ultimately a search warrant was issued all because Trump and his team were not handing over what turned out to be national defense information, also classified material. So that's why possible obstruction has been raised as a possible offense in that case. You contrast that with Biden's team. They've made very clear that they've been working with federal authorities on this since November when some of this classified material turned up from the Penn Biden Center in Washington where President Biden had that office after his term ended as vice president. And then notably, in a statement from January 14th, the president's personal attorney said that once attorneys found classified material at Biden's Wilmington home on January 11th, they immediately contacted DOJ officials and they stopped any of their own subsequent searches. And that was all until the FBI moved in on Friday. But to be sure here, the fact that classified material keeps turning up, it is really complicated things for the White House. And it really does make clear that this special counsel investigation has only gotten more involved. And because of that, the big question remains, is this the only search that will happen, the one that happened on Friday? Or will other locations frequented by President Biden be searched in the future? Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Dismissal came a day after the largest turnout so far in weeks of protests against Benjamin Netanyahu's government. CNN's Hadas Gold has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Benjamin Netanyahu isn't even one month into his new term as Israeli Prime Minister, and he will already have an empty minister's chair at his next cabinet meeting. Forced to fire Aryeh Deri after a bombshell Supreme Court ruling last week said Deri could not serve as minister because of his previous criminal convictions and his declaration to the court last year that he would not return to public office. Putting off the dismissal for days, Netanyahu ultimately told Deri he was doing so with a heavy heart and would find a legal way to get him back into government. Needing to carefully maintain the alliance with Deri, whose 11 Parliamentary seats Netanyahu needs to stay in power. Deri's dismissal amplifying an already heating debate in Israel, over Netanyahu's proposed judicial reforms, that would give the parliament power to overturn Supreme Court decisions. Prompting more than 100,000 people to flood the streets once again in protest on Saturday. The third week in a row tens of thousands have come out to decry what they see as the destruction of Israel's independent judiciary, claiming these reforms will help Netanyahu get out of his own ongoing corruption trial, a charge Netanyahu denies. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We will complete the reform legislation in a way that will fix what needs fixing. We'll fully protect individual rights and will restore the public's trust in the justice system, which needs this reform so much. GOLD (voice-over): But the protesters are gaining momentum, and numbers. As opposition leaders, including former Prime Minister Yair Lapid joined them in the streets. YAIR LAPID, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): What you see here today is a demonstration in support of the country. This is a demonstration for the country. People who love the country have come here today to defend its democracy, to defend its courts, to defend the idea of co-existence and of common good. There are people here who love Israel, who came to demonstrate for a democratic Jewish state according to the values of the declaration of independence and we will not give up until we win.
