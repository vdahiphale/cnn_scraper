The Pentagon says that they are tracking these reports, though not confirming anything right out of the gates here. Though being very clear in saying that the United States stands byArticle 5, which is an attack on one, AN attack on one NATO country is an attack on all. And that is the concern here, guys. If these were Russian missiles -- all we know right now is that these were missiles or rockets that landed in this farm that is along the border of Poland and Ukraine in Polish territories, killing two. And if those were Russian, then that is the concern here, that the Ukraine war could extrapolate and become something bigger. But we just don't know right now. It's important to note that we're hearing from Polish officials that their National Security Council is meeting right now. And a NATO official tells me that essentially they're standing by to learn more what they can from Warsaw to then, of course, follow through and talk to all of those NATO allies.",

We don't know yet who is responsible for them. And we don't know if -- you were getting to this -- the question of intent. If this was intentional. But when you have reportedly two people dead, of course, how much does intent matter to Polish leaders? Two of their citizens potentially killed by these weapons coming in.",

Two Polish people are dead.And so surely, in Poland, the military, and I have to assume the Pentagon, have planned for this type of hypothetical on some level, knowing that there might be sloppiness and something might have crossed over the border. And so do we know what the plan was if something like this were to happen?",

The Biden administration, military officials here, very closely with military officials in NATO countries, they've been preparing for a number of circumstances.And of course, you know, one of the major concerns that U.S. and European officials have had is Russia using a nuclear weapon. We know that they are preparing for what they would do in response in that instance. So rest assured that they would have to -- at their fingertips right now a whole host of ways that they could respond to what would be perceived as an escalatory, even if it was accidental, situation. !: All right.

It was a very quick initial court appearance.His public defender said they're not seeking release from custody. So now he heads back to state custody, where he's also facing a slew of charges. Now, for those federal charges, he's looking at a maximum of 50 years in federal prison. And for those state charges, he's looking at 13 years to life. He's also entered not guilty pleas for those felonies. It's been a couple of weeks since he's been accused of breaking into Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home and attacking and injuring her husband, Paul Pelosi. And since that time we've learned a lot through court documents about his alleged intentions. He told authorities that he was trying to get to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and use her so that he could get to another target on a supposed list that he had. He told authorities that there were other government officials and their family members on this supposed list. And he also said that -- he's quoted as saying that -- he's quoted as saying he wanted to break Speaker Pelosi's knees so that she would have to be wheeled in front of Congress. And that he wasn't exactly trying to injury Paul Pelosi but he would go through him if he had to. Paul Pelosi has since been released from the hospital. He's recovering at home from those very serious injuries, including a skull fracture. And the last time that we saw David DePape in court he had a sling. His arm was in a sling from a dislocated shoulder. Today when we saw him in his first federal court appearance he did not have a sling. He seems to have recovered from that injury -- Victor?

He will testify in the next couple of days.But there are some limitations on the scope of questions that he'll be required to answer. Explain those. HONIG: Right. So Senator Graham has only very partial protection from having to answer questions under what's called the Speech and Debate Clause in the Constitution. That says that a sitting member of Congress like Lindsey Graham does not have to answer questions about his legislative activities. That's what the courts found. Now what's legislative? Well, the court said it's definitely not anything you did politically with the Trump campaign. It's definitely not your public statements. And it's definitely not any pressure that you put on state or local officials. I think that's where prosecutors are going to focus their questions, and Lindsey Graham will have to answer those questions.",
