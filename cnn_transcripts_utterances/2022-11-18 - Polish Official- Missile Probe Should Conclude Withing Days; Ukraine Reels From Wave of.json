Amanda, thank you very much.Now Poland is moving ahead with its investigation into a deadly missile that flew over from Ukraine. Now officials are telling CNN when we could hear the results of that. That story just ahead. Plus, Russia pummels Ukraine with new missile strikes. It leaves millions of people in the dark just as cold weather sets in. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Also confirming, of course, that Ukrainian investigators will get access to the site. This is something President Zelenskyy had been asking for ever since we begin to hear Polish, American, NATO officials expressed their opinion based on those preliminary findings, that this was the result of Ukrainian air defense systems rather than a direct attack from Russia.Again, repeated by a spokesman for the Polish government yesterday. That is what the preliminary evidence is suggesting to them. What they've concerned is that Ukrainian investigators, however, will be able to observe those investigations even if they remain in the hands of Polish and American investigators, Max. They will get access and be able to observe. And of course, this is something President Zelenskyy has been asking for. And again, repeating over the course of the last 24 hours. His call once again that you allies step up to the plate to try and ensure the protection of Ukrainian skies. Really using what we've seen over the course, again, of the last 24 hours. Not just continued exchanges of rocket and artillery fire along the front lines, but of course those devastating cruise missile strikes that have been doing such damage, Max, to the infrastructure. 10 million Ukrainians now without electricity. And of course, even as Ukrainians try and deliver some of those services, get them back up and running, there are not just those that are the result of the extra strikes that we've seen  yesterday evening. But of course, there had been the planned outages as well. So, there are efforts underway to try to get power back to Ukrainians. But again, a reminder that those temperatures are dropping fast, freezing or below in many parts. So, course, crucial that they can get that up and running quickly -- Max. OK, Melissa in Paris. Thank you. Let's go to Fred then in Moscow. And, Fred, the Russians are indicating they'll keep hitting Ukraine's infrastructure.",

Two former Russian operatives and a Ukrainian separatist were sentenced to life in prison. But the convictions were handed down in abstentia and none are likely to serve time. A fourth was acquitted. The plane was shot down over Eastern Ukraine by a Russian missile launched and territory held by pro-Russian rebels. All 298 million people on board were killed. Ukraine's president called the court ruling an important for accountability. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also welcomed the verdict. Coming up, likely not a -- what may seem to get her a lot tougher, as basketball star Brittney Griner now heading for a Russian penal colony. But her agent is telling CNN straight ahead. And representatives from nearly 200 nations have been brainstorming solutions to the climate crisis. Coming up we'll find out if the COP27 conference in Egypt actually accomplish anything though.

The question now is whether it'll get the world any closer to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Leaders have been grappling with a host of complex issues as they look for ways to curb carbon emissions and to help poor countries who are most negatively impacted. The U.N. Secretary-General is urging negotiators to work out their differences quickly. Saying the climate clock is ticking. CNN's David McKenzie is covering the climate meeting for us from Johannesburg. There's such a wide variety of topics still on the table, still needed to be agreed. What's the core roadblock here to reach an agreement -- David?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, the world leaders have left and the inspirational speeches are over. But now it's really the business end, one has to say, of this climate conference. And the stakes are incredibly high. Because at this point as we've been reporting, the globe is nowhere even close to cutting emissions to get to the proposed 1.5 degrees warming that was agreed at the Paris agreement in 2015.Here are I think are some of the three of the things that we really need to look out for in the statement, Max. One would be, does the world still commit to meeting that 1.5 degrees warming. Because at this stage we're nowhere even close, as I said. Is there going to be specific details on the loss and damage fund. That is where rich nations will pledge to give developing nations money to deal with the impact of climate change that they didn't cause. And finally, I think one issue -- and it's surprising in a way that this isn't already in these statements -- is will there be a full confirmation that the world needs to transition away from fossil fuels towards renewables. Surprising that's not in there yet. As you said, the U.N. Secretary-General who flew back into Sharm el- Sheikh in Egypt. He said it's crunch time and said that rich and developing nations need to work together. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: There has been clearly in the past times a breakdown in trust between north and south and between developed and emerging economies, but this is no time for finger pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction. I'm here to appeal to all parties to rise to this moment and to the greatest challenge that humanity is facing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Whether there can be concrete actions in those statements, well, that remains to be seen. That is what is needed not just on paper but in practice to avoid catastrophe -- Max.",
