There are multiple fatalities from a shooting there. According to the mayor, the shooter barricaded himself in Dollar General Store, the mayor told our affiliate, WJXT. We are awaiting a press conference from officials there in just a short time from now. We'll bring that to you when it happens. While we wait, I want to go to CNN's Isabel Rosales.

She is a state senator representing District 5, that is the Jacksonville area and she just told me right now over text that the shooter here is dead.So she confirmed that the shooter has -- is dead. We don't know if they've been killed. We don't know if that's from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We're working to get more details on that. She has been unable however, to confirm how many people are dead. She is being briefed right now by Sheriff T. K. Waters. And I want to show you now a tweet that she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. She put this: \"A tragic day in Jacksonville. I'm offering prayers to the families of the victims and I'm on my way to meet with the sheriff for answers.\" She's now there with the sheriff. \"This type of violence is unacceptable in our communities.\" So let me bring you back to what we do know, what is on the record. This is from Mayor Donna Deegan of Jacksonville saying that there's multiple fatalities. She told our affiliate station WJXT that the shooter barricaded himself inside of a Dollar General on Kings Road that is in the Grand Park area just west of the downtown area. It is not clear if these victims were shot inside or outside of the store. I want to now put on a quick soundbite from Councilwoman Ju'Coby Pittman. Here's what she said about what this shooting is doing to the community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JU'COBY PITTMAN I, COUNCILWOMAN, DISTRICT 10, FLORIDA: I am very, very angry right now. I'm emotional. You know, we've got kids in this community seeing all of this and this is unnecessary. You know, it's unjust that we can't -- we can't even walk on the sidewalks. We're not safe in any stores.

They are asking students stay in their dorms. And Jim, I've mentioned this before I'll mention it again that this date is especially crucial because five years ago to this day, Jacksonville experienced a mass shooting at the Jacksonville Landing less than three miles away. This was at a video game tournament where a shooter enter that area, killed two people and injured 10 others. So obviously, this community going through so much and especially for this to happen on the anniversary of a notable mass shooting there in the city of Jacksonville.

And then where did the shooting take place?[18:05:11 ] When you have a person who's identified at a historically Black college, Edward Waters, who is identified as suspicious, and then goes running into the Dollar Store and then starts shooting. We are just going to need some clarity on what that timeline was. Was he a student? Was he someone focused on the university? Or was this just a fluke of geography? So we just keep our minds open at this stage. But if it someone who had some ties to the school, the school activated its lockdown scenarios, which is exactly what you're supposed to do. No one has been in school that long, so this was probably the first or second week in Florida that they were in school, and this is the beginning of the academic year if this -- if the line of where the suspect was, was between a school and the Dollar Store.",

This is the one thing people need from law enforcement is how many people have perished during this shooting, because he is barricaded. You know, he is inside with Saturday shoppers.They also will have family members rushing there. So they're trying to unify people who were rushing there who knew that a mother and aunt or whoever or a father was shopping at the Dollar Store and then make sure that they're unified, and at that stage, then they'll have a sense of what the pool is, or of course examining bodies at this stage. And we don't know if it's two or if it's four or if it is more at this stage, but it is enough that that lots of folks are activated in the area, which includes both the university setting and then the commercial area around it and we will find out more about the details. We haven't had school shootings. It has been summer for a couple of months, but I do need to remind people, we've had no dearth of mass shootings in the United States this week alone.

Defendants seek to do that usually by looking to sever, but that's not something that a court has to grant, whereas a speedy trial motion like his in Georgia, they do. Of course, now Sidney Powell has done the same thing. So there may be two in the boat that he hoped would only have one. That's the first reason to separate himself out and tell his story first. The second is a bit of a gamble, that look, it's their burden. It is a big burden.

Thanks to both of you.Let's go to Jacksonville, Florida now, a press conference on that shooting that took place there. Let's listen in. SHERIFF T.K. WATERS, JACKSONVILLE DUVAL COUNTY: This afternoon, a little after 1 pm, an individual we have not yet officially identified, entered a Dollar Tree in the New Town area of Jacksonville outfitted with a tactical vest, armed with an AR-style rifle and a handgun. Then the shooter killed three people before turning the gun on himself, taking his own life. Other than the three individuals killed and the shooter himself, there are no additional people who suffered gunshot wounds. We are not identifying the deceased victims at this time, but I can tell you that there are two male victims and one female victim. All of the deceased victims are black. Multiple units from Jacksonville Sheriff's Office responded to this active shooter scene, as in members of Jacksonville Fire Rescue, our mayor and city leaders. We are still in the very early stages of this investigation, so there's a lot of information that we don't know at this time. I will share that - with you the information that I've been able to verify. The shooter was believed to have resided in Clay County with his parents. He was involved in a 2016 domestic call in Clay County with no arrest. In 2017, he did have a Baker Act. We know that at 11:39 AM, Sheriff Cook (ph) gave us information that he left Clay County, headed to Jacksonville. At 1:18 PM, he texted his father and told his father to check his computer. At 1:53 PM, the shooter's family members called the Clay County Sheriff's Office. By that time, he had already begun shooting in Jacksonville. The Clay County Sheriff's Office, who has been assisting our agency with this investigation, received information after the shooting that the shooter had authored several manifestos, one to his parents, one to the media and one to federal agents. Portions of these manifestos detail the shooter's disgusting ideology of hate. Plainly put, this shooting was racially motivated and he hated black people. He wanted to kill niggers. That's the one and only time I'll use that word. I want to be very clear that there's absolutely no evidence that the shooter is part of any large group. We know that he acted completely alone. If you take a look at the images on the screen, you'll be able to see what he utilized. The weapons that the shooter used today are a Glock and an AR-15-style rifle. This is a dark day in Jacksonville's history. Any loss of life is tragic, but the hate that motivated the shooter's killing spree adds an additional layer of heartbreak. There's no place for hate in our community and this is not Jacksonville. As a member of this Jacksonville community, I am sickened by this cowardly shooter's personal ideology of hate. Homicide detectives are actively investigating this tragedy and despite the fact that the shooter is dead, they will continue to investigate this until we have a complete understanding of what happened and even why he did it. Our Jacksonville community collectively cries tonight. To the victims and victims' families, our thoughts and prayers are with you now and will remain with you. Please know that in the face of this tragedy, this agency and our city stands with you. We stand united and resolved in our commitment to accountability. We stand united with each other. Those who have personally suffered loss and those who have been touched by this tragedy, we are with you. We stand united and resolved against all forms of hate. And at this time, I'll take any questions that I can.",

There it is on screen right now. As you can see, that weapon on the left side of the screen has what appears to be two swastikas on it, along with some other writing scrawled onto there. We haven't been able to figure that out as to what that message is, but authorities are also talking about manifestos and are saying that this was absolutely a hate crime, a racially motivated attack. The Sheriff at one point saying that this individual wanted to kill black people, just a terrifying situation unfolding in Jacksonville earlier this afternoon. If I'm not mistaken, I believe I have three people with me right now to talk about this: Isabel Rosales, our correspondent who's been following this; Juliette Kayyem, our Law Enforcement National Security Analyst; and Steve Moore, a law enforcement analyst for us here at CNN.

We weren't hearing a whole lot from officials and I think part of the reason why is that there is a - there are just deep levels of ugliness that they had to sort through before presenting this information to the public.

In this case, it may have been a historically black university. They will - these type of shooters will flee from any type of opposition, because it might keep them from achieving their goals. So in my opinion, I believe that it is likely that he went to the HBU in order to kill people there and when he was confronted by security, moved to a less secure target and he went to some place where he saw black people and attacked there. So it's very similar to cases I've worked for 20-25 years.",

He clearly has a performative goal here, right? He's doing this to be seen. He goes to the HBCU and absolutely wanted to terrorize that place if not it being the place - the site where he wanted his victims to be and then he gets identified and goes running down the street to the dollar store. So the fact that he's putting on the clothing at the HBCU, it's to terrify, it is - and the guns, and the manifestos, and the anniversary and the gear, it's all for show. And he's a young white male and so this is just familiar at this stage. And what's also familiar is now we've got the motive and now the means. They have access to guns, the AR-15, which just - should not - this is not political, this is absolutely just a rational statement here. These guns are unnecessary to be out in civilian life and most law enforcement organizations agree on that. And the reason why is because if he hadn't shot himself, the shooter today, if he had not shot himself, he could have very likely killed law enforcement.
