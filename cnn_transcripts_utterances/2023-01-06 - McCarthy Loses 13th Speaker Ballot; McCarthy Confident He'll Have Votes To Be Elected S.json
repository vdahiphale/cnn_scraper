Just how much closer McCarthy is to the Speaker's gavel at this moment than he was this morning. This was ballot number 11. Last night the number of holdouts was 20 strong, plus one present vote. Then there was ballot 13, and one more rebel, Andy Harris defected to the McCarthy camp. The number of eventually Kevin numbers now at 15 -- but six \"Never Kevin\" voters, Bob Good, Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Matt Rosendale, Eli Crane and Matt Gaetz. I want to go to CNN's Manu Raju.

He's like, he's a soft member of Congress, right. He's like, did I vow to my constituents that I wouldn't support Kevin. And I talked to Representative Zinke, a former Navy SEAL that runs a SEAL PAC, and he said, McCarthys betrayal and that his fellow SEALs, we supported him and we're talking to him.

I mean, we were sitting out here 24 hours ago, it was not clear if he was going to be able to get anywhere near the votes. We got here this morning and it seemed early on maybe the negotiations hadn't quite produced a deal.He defied expectations when the group of the Roy people started coming over. It's obviously that these negotiations were in good faith, and they did work, and that his personal engagement really mattered. So, I have to say even though a lot of people have taken a lot of shots at McCarthy from across the spectrum this week and have called into question his political acumen or his, you know, his ability to fill these shoes. He's come a long way in a short period of time, and he and his deputies deserve a lot of credit for figuring it out in a group of people who are not easily sold.",

One of the things that I'm hearing from some individuals like yourself, McCarthy supporters, people who support governing, is they're worried about what has been conceded. Some of the negotiations, obviously, seem reasonable, having 72 hours at the least between introducing a bill before voting on it. But there's some talk of freezing spending at fiscal year 2022 levels, which would actually bring down the defense budget significantly. A lot of members of the House Armed Services Committee are worried about that. Do you know all the concessions that have been made?",

And the rules that we've agreed to are exactly the House rules, as approved and passed by the House conference, with one exception, that was to add the motion to vacate the chair to one member. But let me remind you, that's been the rule in the House since 1910. Every Speaker has had that rule and the House rules except for Nancy Pelosi. So, that's the first group.Secondly is spending. Trying to get control of spending after this avalanche of fiscal stimulus coming from the pandemic and to the Biden administration. And yes, we want to try to curtail and reform spending and there are spending agreements in this package that would encourage more members to offer amendments on the floor to reduce spending. To have a budget resolution that has an aspirational goal for some departments of trying to go back to FY '22 which was considered sort of a baseline for conversation. And then finally, Jake, our participation in the committees, and leader McCarthy wants all of the standing committees of Congress to fully reflect all of the mixed view and viewpoints of the House Republican conference. So those were the three areas where we've reached agreement last night and you saw the movement with 15 members switching their votes in support of Kevin this afternoon.",

And I don't mean that in a derisive way. But he's saying this is a positive experience, we've learned how to govern. But a cynic might say you've learned how to govern, what does that mean, ten people take you hostage and you give them everything they want?",

I don't believe that the speakership, you know, has been permanently weakened in some way -- I read those reports. These are rules that a vast majority of the House Republicans prefer. This is a spending direction, spending control program that vast majority of House Republicans support. And so, this personnel issue of making sure all wings of the Republican Party are adequately represented on the committees, I think is where a lot of the emphasis was and I think that's what leader McCarthy has guided as a solution.But I believe that just as Speaker Pelosi had a very narrow margin in the last Congress, Kevin McCarthy will face the exact same thing this Congress, and it starts this week working together to build that consensus.",
