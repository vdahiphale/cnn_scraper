And this hour, evidence that it's really hard to close the Pandora's war chest once it's been cracked open, tonight, a unilateral U.S. strike on a Houthi radar facility. It is retaliation to retaliation after the Iranian-equipped rebel group targeted commercial vessels near the south of Yemen. Now, the Houthis did that hours after coalition fighter jets bombarded targets inside of Yemen, a signal that American patience with Houthi provocations had simply run thin. Now, the second consecutive day of strikes underlines the tense moment that we are in, in the Middle East, as protesters in Tehran used American, British and Israeli flags as kindling. It is a moment that some here at home fear may metastasize into something far greater and far more dangerous, a war without end. Now, today, the White House sought to assure the world that this is a response designed to stop exactly that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

ALEX PLITSAS, SENIOR NON-RESIDENT FELLOW ATLANTIC COUNCIL: It says a couple things. So, there was a missile launch a little earlier today. So, they clearly didn't get all of the Houthi capabilities they were looking to get in terms of demilitarizing the organization, And so additional strikes were required. So, there was an expectation that Houthis may retaliate again after the initial set of strikes. That did, in fact, happen and now the U.S. has conducted further missions.",

And what that's done is shut down commercial shipping lanes here that then go up through the Suez Canal and then empty into the Mediterranean for shipping.And so the actions the Houthis have taken have had a significant economic impact as well as attacks against U.S. forces and ships in the region here.

And I'd also note that the big eight of the Congress, the top four, the top two in each of the House and the Senate, and then the chairman and ranking member of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees were notified, which is appropriate.Now, it will be interesting to see if there's a follow-up action with where powers resolution notification to Congress here in the next 24 or so hours. That's supposed to take place within 48 hours of this kind of action. And I suspect that that will be forthcoming as well.

He's losing in every battleground state. His approval numbers are in the low 30s, historically low and there is no recovery from this. And instead of inspiring a competition with a number of next generation Democrats, for some reason, a handful of people at the Democratic Party believe that a coronation of an 81-year-old man, a good man, who's going to lose to Donald Trump is in the best interest of the country?
