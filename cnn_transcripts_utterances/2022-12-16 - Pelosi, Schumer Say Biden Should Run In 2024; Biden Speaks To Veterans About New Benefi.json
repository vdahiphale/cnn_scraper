I said Uncle Frank, you won this and I want to finish it. I don't want the damn thing. I'm serious. He said, I don't want it. I said what's the matter Uncle Frank, you earned it? He said, yes, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don't want it. It's like a generation, this generation. In Vietnam, excuse me, in Iraq. I was up in one of the points.

I was out there at the point. And it was I guess, about 150 feet, not straight down but a hill. And this young man climbed down the hill, put a guy on his shoulder and brought him back up and it shot on the way up. And he got there and I want to present it to him too.

You made a key points in your op-ed that the Republicans still want to keep it up there. The Republicans are sticking with Iowa. The Democrats considered a lost cause. Nobody organized the thousands of registered Latino voters in meatpacking towns like Storm Lake. Democrats are barely trying. The results show it.So you actually think not only is this a mistake going forward, but looking back, the Democrats could have actually celebrated the diversity that is there in Iowa, it's not the same as South Carolina.

You're here because you have a great piece today up on CNN.com. I just want to show the headline to it right here. It's, you know, black voter turnout was down in 2022. Democratic auditors are panicking about what it could mean for 2024. This is one of the reasons the Democrats and the President of the United States says put South Carolina first. We should pay more tribute to the backbone of the Democratic Party. But like everything in politics, there are tradeoffs no matter what you decide.EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Sure. And what's going on here in this story is talking to people not about the primary calendar that is relative what Biden's trying to reflect. But what they look at in these midterm results, and seeing that the Democratic Party has been having actually a lot of trouble getting black voters to turn out. Again, it's not that they're turning out to vote for Republicans, that's not really happening in mass numbers. But they're not showing up. And they didn't show up in the same proportions in the midterms this year as suburban voters, swing voters or white voters. And when people are looking ahead to 2024, what they're saying is, look, if there's not a Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, or candidates who are extremists to drive, the suburban voters toward Democrats and black voters aren't showing up, that is a formula for big, big trouble, and maybe losing the presidential election as well as Senate seats, House seats, governance races, all of it.",

So the President, his team, say more African American voters early in both South Carolina and Georgia and in Michigan, and you do get a little bit of South Carolina has rural pockets, Georgia has rural pockets, New Hampshire has rural pockets, so they say the Iowans are being parochial, but?",

So for example, a lot of Democrats are pointing to Pennsylvania right now is the place where Fetterman did well in rural counties. Shapiro did well in rural counties. And then we go to Georgia, and we're seeing, you know, what did Warnock do that work with black voters.

We are a failing nation.(END VIDEO CLIP) KING: One of the things he did successfully whether you agree or disagree with him, whether you want it to run next time or not, is the grievances in small town America where they feel left behind by globalization, by technology, by things like Amazon, where, you know, main stream America, there's not as much retail anymore. Donald Trump, whether you agree with how he did it, or whatever he successfully tapped into there. The field at Washington doesn't care about me anymore. Nobody in Washington understands me anymore. That is a challenge for the Democrats. We're talking about changing the calendar, that's a process question. But there's a voter piece of this. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: You can imagine when that when the calendar change was went forward and was proposed that, you know, the former president was probably just ready to seize on that moment. As I said, this is the latest step and appealing to grievances in rural communities. Also, I would say many white grievances as well that, you know, many communities that have felt disgruntled, as you said, and really kind of seizing on that anger. But one thing to note here, though, too, when it comes to this debate over kind of rural communities and appealing to a more diverse base, I was talking to a senior administration official who has been traveling around the country and really celebrating in trying to sell a lot of these legislative achievements. And he was saying that within the White House, you know, they want to they basically are reminded each day that rural communities are don't necessarily mean white communities. You can have diverse rural communities as well. And I think that's something that sometimes gets lost. You know, in these conversations as well.",

They need to train Ukraine forces to work to be able to operate it, work it, repair it, spare parts, maintenance, all of that, look for Ukraine forces to come out, go to Germany and get trained on it. All of that will take time. And at the same time, the U.S. is stepping up the overall training of Ukrainian forces in Germany. They're now working towards trying to be able to train some 500 troops a month, train them on more complex weapons, more complex battlefield strategy, get them to be able to shoot and move together and challenge the Russians even further in the coming weeks.
