He did though leave the meeting with a promise of unwavering support from allies, and moves meant to boost the country's military capability as the war grinds on. Zelenskyy called the summit a meaningful success for Ukraine, and said the two days of talks remove any doubts about whether Ukraine will be in NATO. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more.

And of course, when there is no more ammunition to give and accept the cluster bombs, I think we have to give those as well. Ukraine has said that they will not use them on those territories where you have civilians. They will just use them to defend themselves, and push Russia back to Russia. I mean, that is the aim that we all have, and that is why Ukraine is also very grateful for the cluster bombs the U.S. has given. Seeing Russia very, very up close and seeing how they function, their playbook has not changed. The way they occupy and delivered all of the atrocities they did in my country or Ukraine or Latvia, or Lithuania, Poland for that matter, this has not changed.

It is easy to underestimate just how difficult that can be, 31 now 32 different nations all leading to agree and sign off on what is something as huge and very complex. But that unity is in the face of the cracks that are now appearing in Russia. You had the Prigozhin mutiny. You have the defense minister yesterday, apparently firing one of the top generals in Ukraine -- Russian generals for speaking out about the way that the war is not being fought by Russia very well.

State media reports the Hwasong-18 Inter Continental Ballistic Missile flew for 74 minutes on Wednesday, before crashing down in the waters near Japan. The solid fuel ICBM has been called the North's most powerful nuclear weapon, but it is unclear if it could actually deliver a nuclear payload. State media says leader Kim Jong-Un personally guided the launch just days after his powerful sister issued some serios threats. CNN's Will Ripley explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A menacing milestone for North Korea's missile program. Pyongyang's latest ICBM launch, breaking its own record for the longest ever missile flight, a staggering 74 minutes, hurdling high above the earth at supersonic speed, hitting 6,000 kilometers of force in the sea. The massive missile's potential striking range the entire U.S. mainland and the most of the world. Pyongyang's most provocative launch in months, coinciding with this NATO summit in  Lithuania, quickly condemned by Japan as an unacceptable threat to regional stability. South Korea's military ready to overwhelmingly respond. The ICBM, a crown jewel in leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal, protecting the power, fortune, and future of the ruling Kim family. His young daughter, Kim Ju-ae often appearing alongside her dad, barely 10 years old, a rising star of a state propaganda campaign, carefully crafted by Kim's younger sister, the mastermind of the Kim family brand, the leader's loyal confidant, trusted adviser, and perhaps most powerful women in North Korea. CHUN SU-JIN, AUTHOR, NORTH KOREAN WOMEN IN POWER: DAUGHTERS OF THE SUN: She is the number two, that is for sure, but she is very smart lady, and she actually knows that her position is secure only when her big brother is secure. RIPLEY (voice-over):  Just five years, ago very few people knew of Kim Yo-Jong. She stepped on the South Korean soil, the first member of North Korea's ruling family to cross the DMZ. She carried a message of peace from Pyongyang. North Korean athletes and cheer squads had a warm welcome for 2018 Winter Olympics. She rose to fame as a fixture at her brother's side, standing silently behind Kim as he met with Former President Trump that a brief period of diplomacy feels like a distant memory. The silent sister now a loud voice of defiance, issuing a fiery statement on state media, often laced with crude language. This week, she threatened to shoot down U.S. spy planes accusing them without evidence of entering North Korean territory, warning in case of repeated illegal intrusions, the U.S. forces will experience a very critical flight. Past actions prove he is not all talk. In 2020, a dispute with South Korea ended with a bang. Kim ordered the demolition of a joint-liaison office at the border, turning diplomatic dreams into a pile of rubble. (on-camera): She ordered the demolition of a building partially because she was angry that South Korea wasn't doing enough to stop activists from sending propaganda leaflets in balloons to the north. She is accusing the U.S. and South Korea of having the most hostile and aggressive behavior, calling the South Korean president a fool and those two countries now strengthening their military alliance, which means there could be even stronger responses from North Korea, and the second most powerful person in North Korea, Kim Yo-Jong.

Shortly after, the wife of Huw Edwards, one of Britain's most famous and the BBC's highest paid journalist, made a statement on his behalf, confirming the accusations were made about him and asking for privacy, writing, \"I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental well-being and to protect our children. Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. He has suffered another serious episode, and is now receiving inpatient hospital care, where he will stay for the foreseeable future. Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published.\" Edwards has been open about mental health struggles in the past, saying at one point things got so bad he couldn't get out of bed. In the meantime, the BBC now says it will continue its internal investigation. Other less serious allegations have been made against Edwards. Police say they are aware but haven't received specific information, and that there is no police action on them at this time. Questions about the BBC's handling of the complaints will surely not fade from the front pages anytime soon, now neither will questions about the veracity of the original reporting in \"The Sun\" newspaper.
