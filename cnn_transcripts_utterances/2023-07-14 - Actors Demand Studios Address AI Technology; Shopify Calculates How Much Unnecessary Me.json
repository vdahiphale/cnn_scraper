This is just deep fake technology applied to the performance of actors in fictional settings like a film or television program.So the technology has evolved very rapidly in the last couple of years and it will only get better as these large models that we use to generate these images get to be more robust and more capable. SOLOMON:  I wonder, has the law also evolved to keep up with this type of technology?

It's expensive to make these productions and if you can save on your costs by employing some new technology you would obviously like to adopt that. So you can see the sort of push-pull here. The studios, on the one hand, are looking to create content at a cheaper and the actors are wanting to retain their opportunities for employment, even though this new technology is pressing on both fronts.",

Too much for Svitolina to handle. She won in straight sets. She used a mix of speed and spin, and power to become the first unseeded women's finalist at Wimbledon since Billie Jean King in 1963.

He spent just one season as the Wildcats coach. This comes just three days after football coach Pat Fitzgerald was dismissed because of a hazing scandal. Fitzgerald has maintained that he was unaware of the hazing. Northwestern confirmed to CNN that defensive coordinator David Braun is going to serve as the interim head coach in the meantime, and an official announcement on that is expected later today. And some of the world's top golfers getting ready for next week's British Open, the final Major of the year, by playing the Scottish Open. All eyes on Rory McIlroy after his stellar six-under 64 in the first round. He's just three strokes off the lead heading into Friday. And after his round, he was asked about the recent Saudi-backed proposal that came to light, which included both him and Tiger Woods taking ownership of LIV Golf teams. To that, he was quoted telling reporters, \"If LIV Golf was the place to play golf on Earth, I would retire. That's how I feel about it.\" He's been pretty consistent in that regard. And you can take Steph Curry out of the game but you can't take the game away from Steph Curry. Steph, playing in a celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe, could not resist that long shot over the gallery.

They're going to conduct experiments, including analyzing the chemistry of the lunar soil, measuring the temperature of lunar surface, and scanning the area for moonquakes. Now, on launch day, earlier today, we heard from India's prime minister who tweeted from Paris where he was just awarded France's highest honor.
