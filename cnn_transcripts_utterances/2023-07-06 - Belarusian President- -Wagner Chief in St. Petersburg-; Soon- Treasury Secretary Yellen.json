      "sentences": "Welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Christine Romans.We begin this morning with breaking news. The president of Belarus revealing where Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is right now. Alexander Lukashenko telling CNN's Matthew Chance at a news conference just a short time ago that the leader of the mercenary group is actually in St. Petersburg, Russia. Just two weeks ago, he was leading an armed insurrection against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meantime, Russian state media reporting that police have allegedly found passports, wigs, cash, gold and guns during a raid on Prigozhin's homes, stepping up an apparent propaganda campaign against Prigozhin. Let's bring in CNN's Nada Bashir. She joins us live from London. Nada, obviously, a lot to unpack here. The reason this is so noteworthy of course is because we thought Prigozhin was in exile in Belarus. He has not been seen from or heard from since the armed rebellion on June 23rd. What are you learning? What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "You're absolutely right, Rahel. There have been questions around his whereabouts. He hasn't been seen the failed insurrection just under two weeks.It was believed he had moved to Belarus as part of a deal struck with the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, but of course, as we have just learned in the last hour or so, according Lukashenko, who is speaking at a press conference in Minsk, Yevgeny Prigozhin is not in fact in Belarus, but is said to be in St. Petersburg in Russia. Now this comes as Russian state media has released video footage reportedly from Yevgeny Prigozhin, saying Petersburg resident showing a police raid in which stashes of gold, passports, cash, as well as weapons were found at this residence. The presenters heard in this video describing this as a scandalous. But as you noted there, it is important to remember that experts and human rights advocates alike, all of them point to the fact that the Kremlin has a long history of pattern of fabricating criminal cases against challengers of the Kremlin. Now, of course, Yevgeny Prigozhin has now for some time been a vocal critic of the Kremlin's approach when it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we have seen time and time again, Prigozhin releasing video footage and audio of himself at the frontline, sometimes graphic video showing what he describes to be the bodies of Russian-backed fighters, criticizing the Kremlin, and President Putin, quote, failing to adequately support and equipped Russian-backed fighters on the ground. Now in the past, this has secured those fighters with for their weapon shipments, but the insurrection, that failed rebellion out last month according to President Putin, put the Wagner chief and his fighters on his words on the path of treason. And at the time, there was a deal that shot the charges according to the current would be chalk if these fighters of Prigozhin would join the Russian defense ministry, now the law enforcement wings if they return home, or crucially if they move to buy the recess part of that deal. But, now, of course, we are learning from Lukashenko, that not only is Prigozhin said to be in St. Petersburg, not in Belarus. But he's also told CNN during that press conference, the Wagner fighters are believed to still be stationed at their regular camps. Of course, if Prigozhin is in fact in Belarus as is -- sorry in St. Petersburg as Lukashenko has now said in this press conference, it remains to be seen what sort of repercussions he will face at the hands of the Kremlin, or any for his vocal criticism. But, of course, at this video which has been released of the police raid at his residence -- Rahel.",

Well, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is due to arrive in Beijing at this hour. This video is Yellen leaving from Washington several hours ago. Yellen headed to China as the Biden administration works to strengthen ties, and deepen communication with China. The relationship between the two coming more tense lately.

Antony Blinken, U.S. secretary of state, was in Beijing just two weeks ago.Yellen is expected to receive a warm welcome, because of her economic pragmatism. You know, she wants to improve communications, and lower the temperature between the two largest economies in the world. Beijing sees her as a voice of reason in the Biden administration, which she's pushed to maintain economic ties with China. She's argued against tariffs and restrictions on investment in China, and while giving testimony before Congress back in April, she wants that decoupling from China would be disastrous. Her itinerary is yet to be made public, but we understand she plans to meet with the Chinese counterpart, and other high-ranking officials, which is not expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Now, this, Rahel, will not be a love fest. The treasury secretary has spoken out against China's human rights record and believes that American supply chains need to diversify away from China. Whilst she is in Beijing, she will try to convince the Chinese that the U.S. is not trying to harm or contain the Chinese economy, by blocking access to sensitive technology, such as a semiconductors in the name of national security. This is something the Chinese certainly are not buying. This, week the Chinese retaliated by announcing it would restrict the export of certain minerals, critical for the production of semiconductor chips, solar cells, and other tech panels. And, Rahel, we just heard from China's commerce ministry criticizing the U.S. restrictions on cheap exports to China, saying, quote, the U.S. approach not only infringes upon Chinese companies' legitimate rights, but also undermines interest of many countries and regions, and will hinder global technology exchange and trade cooperation. This will eventually backfire against the U.S. End of the day, Rahel, these economies are deeply intertwined. $700 billion in trade between China and the U.S. each year. Economically, they need each other.",

The affidavit was filed in last month's indictment of former President Trump, and his aide and co-defendant Walt Nauta.This is that prosecutors saw surveillance video from outside of a basement store, where documents were kept. The affidavit says that the video shows the boxes were moved out of the room to destinations unknown. After multiple delays meantime, Walt Nauta is expected to be arraigned this morning in a Miami federal court. And to the city of Philadelphia with the city there is suing to two suppliers of so-called ghost guns. So, these are privately made, untraceable fire arms, and often sold to people who cannot wear them legally. The city says, it wants to put the two companies, Polymer 80 and JSD Supply, out of business, and have them pay damages for the harm caused by ghost guns in Philadelphia. Officials say both guns found with the suspects in this week's mass shooting in Philadelphia were, in fact, ghost guns. More now from CNN's Danny Freeman.

That includes DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, Secret Service officials I'm told are also going to visitor logs as well as security camera footage.This all started on Sunday evening, when a light powdery substance was found inside a small dime-sized bag in one of the cabbies. These cabbies are used for visitors to come into the West Wing, that's where they drop their cellphones off. It's also used by White House officials before they go into a SCIF to view classified information. They also would drop their cellphones in these types of cabbies. Now, the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for her part certainly left the impression that it could be a visitor who's going on a West Wing tour, who left this bag of cocaine there. She talked about the fact that this is a highly traveled area, that this is where visitors are brought in when they go on at these West Wing tours. But when I asked her whether or not she could rule out that it was a White House official, she could not do that saying she wouldn't speculate on who is doing this. She did express confidence in the Secret Service's investigation. But nonetheless, that is federal law enforcement official telling me that they just don't know if they will actually be able to identify who brought this baggie in. That's in part because of the number of people who go through this West Wing entrance, and also because of how small that bag that was where the cocaine was might -- making it that much more difficult to identify fingerprints or potentially DNA there.
