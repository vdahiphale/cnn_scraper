Warnock launched a new ad that accuses Walker of hypocrisy and abortion, but he tends to shy away from those character questions at his campaign events.

What we have noticed, as you've mentioned, is that the argument that Warnock, his campaign making on the airwaves, these personal attacks that call up the many allegations against Walker, that is not what you're going to hear him stay -- say when he is speaking directly to voters.When he is asked about this, he sort of shifts the conversation back to policy concerns. And I think the big test is, is this going to work for him at a time when voters are craving authenticity? Will they ask well, why is Warnock so comfortable making one argument on TV and a different argument in person. That being said, if he does pivot his strategy, it would be sort of out of character. You know, he makes this argument that being a pastor is so sort of so intrinsic to his work in the Senate. He talks a lot about health care, health care the dominating theme that he lands on out on the campaign trail. When he's asked about the economy, he steers the conversation back to his work to lower the cost of insulin. Meanwhile, Walker spending a lot of time trying to tie Warnock to President Biden, blaming them both for the state of the economy. John.",

Reliably blue state where things look suddenly tougher for the Democrats, including the incumbent governor, the incumbent Kathy Hochul, facing Republican Lee Zeldin on the debate stage tonight.It is a big moment the rankings of several New York congressional races have also tilted in Republican favor in recent days for the same reasons. The governor's race is now viewed as more competitive voter anxiety over inflation and a constant Republican focus on crime. The New York Times headline racist suddenly too close for Democrats comfort. Zeldin has a real shot says the New York Post and from CNN Athena Jones crime concerns, take center stage.

Several recent polls have showed the race tightening in recent days.The Quinnipiac poll put the put Hochul just four points ahead. One from Siena College put their race at 11 points. So that's still a double digit lead but that lead has shrunk by about six points from September to October. And so Zeldin who is someone who had wanted to have multiple debates he's going to settle for this one so scheduled debate before Election Day and before early voting starts on Saturday. Zeldin believes he has a real chance here. He has been hitting Governor Hochul on crime and public safety. And this is an issue that we know resonates very much with voters with New York voters, the Quinnipiac poll -- the Quinnipiac poll, so the 28 percent of New York voters said crime and public safety was the most urgent issue. So Zeldin is doing something that is responding to the voters on the ground. He's also following in the footsteps of Republicans all across the country who have been trying to tie Democrats to crime and argue that they are soft on crime. We should note that New York has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2002. That was Governor George Pataki's reelection. He was first elected in 1994. And he was the first Republican governor in the state since 1975. So this is a very blue state. It's a big deal with the race is as close as it is. We'll have to see how he performed tonight.

The late senator's diary details what Senator Kennedy took as a promise from Judge Samuel Alito, to respect the precedent of the Roe v. Wade abortion rights ruling.The diary details conversations with Alito back when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 2005. When asked about abortion rights, Senator Kennedy records Alito as vowing to quote, adhere to precedent saying, quote, I believe in a right to privacy and calling the matter quote settled. Of course, fast forward 16 years it was Justice Alito, who wrote the decision erosive -- erasing Roe v Wade this summer and ending its guarantee to abortion rights, a federal guarantee. The revelation comes from this new book you see it right there \"Ted Kennedy: A Life.\" It includes never before seen excerpts from the senators own diary. The author John Farrell joins us now. John, it's great to see you. Let's continue first on this theme because it is so important in the present day consequences. We now live in the Dobbs America not the Roe v. Wade America. Abortion is state by state. Senator Kennedy on the Judiciary Committee such a player in the day. You wrote a piece about your book in the New York Times yesterday about Kennedy asking him because Alito had written in the Reagan administration a memo where he said I oppose Roe. [12:50:05] Judge Alito assured Mr. Kennedy he should not put too much stock in the memo. He had been seeking a promotion and wrote that he thought is what his bosses wanted to hear. I was a younger person, Judge Alito said. I've matured a lot. A, the consequences of this, but just B, what you learn going through this fascinating diary.",

So we're going to have them go up there and in a succession of Republican nominees went up there, and they all said things like, I will respect precedent, I honor what's happened before there's a judicial theory called starry decisis, which means that we don't go back and wreck 50-year old judicial decisions. And so when he was in this private conversation with Ted Kennedy, Judge Alito said things like I respect precedent, I believe I'm going to adhere to that. I'd have constitutional responsibilities. All things that sort of give the inclination that he would be at least a neutral person on something like Roe v. Wade. And of course, he was not. He wrote the decision that overturned it.",
