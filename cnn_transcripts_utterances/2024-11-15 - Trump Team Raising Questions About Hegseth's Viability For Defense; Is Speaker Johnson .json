New reporting into OUTFRONT at this hour. Plus, is Mike Johnson protecting Matt Gaetz? The speaker saying he doesn't want an ethics report on Trump's AG pick to see the light of day. Even Republicans crying foul. And the power of Ozempic. The weight loss drug may also protect against memory loss and help curb drinking and even help with knee pain. Is it a miracle cure? Dr. Sanjay Gupta shares what he learned from a long investigation. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, Trump's team stunned. CNN learning tonight that the president-elect's team has been caught off guard by a sexual assault allegation against Pete Hegseth, who Trump has tapped to be the next secretary of defense. According to sources, several members of Trump's team have now raised questions about the viability of Hegseth's nomination after learning that police investigated a quote alleged sexual assault involving the Fox News host back in October of 2017. What we know is that Hegseth was a speaker at a conference held by the California Federation of Republican Women when the alleged assault took place, according to photos posted on Facebook. Now, Hegseth has not been charged or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit filed in Monterey County since 2017, and his attorney denies any wrongdoing. But that is not stopping speculation in Trump's orbit this evening about whether Hegseth will ultimately pull his own nomination, fearing more damaging information may come out. Kristen Holmes is OUTFRONT live in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kristen, what are you learning? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Brianna. I mean, that is exactly what we've started to hear from these sources close to Trump's orbit within the transition team that everybody was surprised when these allegations came out. They were informed this week after Pete Hegseth had been chosen to be secretary of defense by Donald Trump about the sexual assault allegations. They had no idea. And part of that reasoning being because Hegseth nomination came together so quickly that there was little to no internal vetting for him. Now, the allegations caused so much surprise and unease among members of the transition team that it prompted a call with Susie Wiles, of course, is going to be Donald Trump's chief of staff to question Hegseth over these allegations and to ask him if there was anything else that they needed to be aware of before they moved forward. Now, it appears that Hegseth said no because I spoke to one source who said that despite the allegations, they are standing by his side that Donald Trump has been made aware, as has his team, as we know, and that they have decided to move forward at this point with the nomination. But they were clearly caught off guard. And that goes to show you part of what we have seen over the last week has been a number of these nominations coming together incredibly quickly, meaning essentially, that they're not getting the same level of vetting that they might have gotten if he had chosen someone from the original short list. So one of the things to watch, obviously is how exactly this plays out with the potential confirmation of Hegseth does he make it to the actual confirmation round, or is there something else that's out there? And that, of course, is, as you mentioned, what Trump's team fears.",

And it took place, this alleged assault took place about 90 minutes from where I'm standing here in the city of San Francisco in Monterey, California. What we have learned from the city of Monterey is that its police force did investigate that, quote, alleged sexual assault involving Pete Hegseth.They do not specifically in their news release, state that Hegseth is the alleged assailant, but it does go on to say these details that this occurred, this alleged incident occurred in the early morning hours of October 8th, 2017 at the Hyatt in Monterey, and that this was reported to local authorities to the police department in Monterey four days after this alleged incident occurred. [19:05:05] I want you to take a look at this picture from Facebook and this comes from the organization, the California Federation of Republican Women. You can see there that Hegseth is standing at a podium. Those pictures confirm that he was indeed a speaker at their conference at that hotel. Now, there is also in the news release that we got from the City of Monterey, an unnamed victim and it does cite injuries although it's not specific as to who was injured. And the injury is described as, quote, contusions to right thigh. We did learn from the city that they do not plan on releasing the full police report. We also did check with the county courts. His name Pete Hegseth, does not come up as a defendant in any criminal charges dating back from 2017 until today. As far as Hegseth's camp, his lawyer says that yes this allegation did exist but those charges did not. He was never charged and this is just an allegation that's out there, Brianna.",

This comes from the White House. You can see Hegseth sitting there. The woman in between, president Trump and Hegseth is his third wife. And at that point, that the woman who would become his third wife would become -- she -- she was pregnant and she would become his third wife. As far as how all of this is playing out, you heard Kristen there refer to the steadfast public support for him.

I mean, there are examples. In 1990 and in 1987 of reports being released post jurisdiction going away. And of course, in 2018 on two different occasions, there were public statements made characterizing the contents of those reports after jurisdiction had gone away from the ethics committee. Obviously, there is no rule saying that this can't go forward, but I'm not surprised that Mike Johnson is trying to keep his Republican members of that otherwise bipartisan committee from voting to release a document that I think is more important than any document that we've considered in recent history for both the American people and even globally. I would not be surprised if this document were to be released to the public -- to the public, if for no other reason than the Republicans on the committee thinking that this is really important, and knowing that Matt Gaetz should come nowhere close to being attorney general of the United States of America.",

Every time you eat, all sorts of hormones are released, like GLP-1. They are called post nutrient hormones. They travel here to the hypothalamus and the brain to tell you that you are full or satiated. They also travel over here to the pancreas to kick out more insulin to help absorb the energy you just consumed. And also over here, to your gut to slow down the emptying, allowing you to better digest your food. In so many ways, it seems like the perfect hormone, to help you stop eating as much.

These drugs have actually been around for some time, but 3 or 4 years ago, they just suddenly took off the largest or fastest growing drug class really in the world. But the second thing, and I mentioned this briefly in the clip you just showed, when you think about weight loss medications, you think about them speeding up your metabolism or working on your gut. This also works on the brain. It works on an area of the brain called the hypothalamus, an area that's responsible for your feelings of fullness, your feelings of what they call satiation. So it's interesting, some people have this constant food chatter, Erin, even when they're eating, they're already thinking about their next meal.
