Past statements they've made, past conduct of theirs, past -- There's a gag order in this case, where the president had been told, based on his misbehavior, that there are certain things he couldn't say in public. He alluded to there. All of that could maybe have come in. They would have spent more time at a hearing before Trump testified talking about all the things that could get into court that he'd said in the past, than he would have been on the stand for. And it would have been a disaster for him. He would have been eviscerated on cross-examination. Now, I recognize that defendants often want to clear their name. Jurors, in fact, will often say and come back with a question saying, why didn't the defendant take the stand? If I were on trial, I would want to take the stand to clear my name. And I get it.
