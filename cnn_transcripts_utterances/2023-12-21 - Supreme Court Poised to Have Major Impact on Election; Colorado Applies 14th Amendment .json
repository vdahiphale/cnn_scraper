      "sentences": "Good morning, and grab that coffee. Thanks for getting up early with us. I'm John Avlon in for Kasie Hunt.Now, the Supreme Court may end up being the final decision maker in the 2024 presidential race, at least regarding the fate of GOP front runner Donald Trump, which hangs in the balance. The Court is at the center of some major decisions, multiple, whether Trump's even eligible to be on the ballot. And if he's immune to being prosecuted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for actions he took his president. These issues stem from, of course, Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election on the basis of a lie, actions that he took that ultimately led to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Here to break down all things legal, couldn't ask for anyone better than Defense Attorney and former Federal Prosecutor Shan Wu. Shan, it's great to see you. And thanks for getting up early with us. You know, I what I want you to help decipher is all these dueling cases. We've got the Colorado ruling. Jackson's immunity request, all raising broader questions about the role of the Supreme Court in our elections. If you thought it was over in 2000, you got another thing coming. And you had a great piece yesterday in \"The Daily Beast\" saying the Supreme Court might be able to redeem itself here. So what -- what -- what's your thinking? Break it down for us?",

And the point about redeeming is, they traditionally as you know, have taken a very stingy view of their jurisdiction, they don't want to reach out when they don't have to, they don't want to rule more broadly when they don't have to.So what they could do here is as they face this whole -- whole bellwether test of their credibility going on right now, and these important cases, is to take a narrow view. So let's start with the Colorado one, for instance. Appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, very reluctant to overturn factual findings. They could really rely on the really extensive factual findings that the Colorado court used to say that Trump had engaged really an insurrection or given aid and comfort. And therefore should be barred from the Colorado ballot. They could really limit it to relying upon that, rather than having to delve into these major constitutional questions which are unlikely to ever -- to be repeated, is the President officer of the United States, common sense says, yes.

To that point, and your broader point about philosophic continuity, I was struck by a column by the Atlantic's Adam Serwer on the Colorado ruling specifically. And he said that the rulings written consciously, the Colorado ruling with an originalist interpretation, written for essentially the conservative justices on the Supreme Court who say they read law that way. First, do you agree with that assessment of the opinion? And how might that impact justices opinions if they are being philosophically consistent?",

However, when it comes to how the conservative group uses the texts, the textual reading originalism, they really just willed that for any purpose that they want. And I think that's where the problems going to be. Because ultimately, of course, if you're interpreting the text, and you say, I'm interpreting it with the original wisdom in mind, you still get to interpret it any way you want.So I don't know that that's necessarily going to sway them philosophically. Playing reading, I think it's an easy one for them. And if they're going to be intellectually honest about it, they can certainly say, hey, the originalist reading words mean, what they mean. I think a really interesting point here, John, about these counter arguments saying, not enough due process for Trump before he's removed. Also, the idea that you might have to have a criminal conviction. He wasn't charged with insurrection. I think Professor Tribe made a really good point on this recently, which is that the disqualification is not a sanction, it's not a punishment. And so arguably, you don't have to deal with these issues of, do you need the conviction? How much process was doing? It's simply a qualification, like age or where you're born?",

The best-case scenario is the D.C. One of those three cases, actually, I think the presidential immunity one is not likely to give Trump complete protection. I don't think that the Supreme Court is going to end up getting a huge swath of broad immunity to any president.However, the obstruction issue before them, which is, is very complex reading of what is the meaning of the word corruptly. Can the obstruction be these violent acts? Was Trump connected to those? That really could pose some hurdles for Smith's charges?
