Israel's warning amid more device explosions in Lebanon, killing 20 people and wounding hundreds more. Diddy denied. Sean Combs will remain in custody after his second bail attempt is rejected. Cutting with confidence, the Federal Reserve chopping rates by half a percent, saying they can support jobs and contain inflation. And a water wonder. The company that says it can recycle up to 99 percent of industrial water waste. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, a new era of war. That's the promise from Israel's defense minister. His comments follow two days of explosions across Lebanon targeting the militant group Hezbollah. Wednesday's detonations targeted walkie-talkies. It's the first time Israel appeared to tactically knowledge a role in the attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  I think the IDF has made excellent achievements together with the ISA and Mossad. The results of their work are impressive. We know how important it is at this time to carry out our activities in close cooperation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Today, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, the number of people killed in these walkie-talkie blasts has reached at least 20 with 450 injured. And certainly, what this is -- the effect this is having is to spread real fear and panic among the population here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over):  A funeral for those killed a day before is disrupted by another explosion. A wave of walkie-talkie blasts across Lebanon killed more than a dozen and injured hundreds Wednesday. Coming barely 24 hours after hundreds of pagers blew up across the country at food markets and shops killing at least 12 people, including two children and injuring around 2,800 others in what CNN sources say was an attack by Israel's Mossad and military against Hezbollah, unprecedented in its scale and nature.

Today, they look like James Bond, carrying out an attack in Lebanon, reaching hundreds of walkie-talkies on the heels of thousands of pagers the day before. So, this is no doubt kind of a new threshold of violence that is being brought by Israel and a breakthrough in terms of its ability to penetrate deep into Hezbollah's networks both in Lebanon, but also in Syria next door where some of these Hezbollah operatives are. So, this is no doubt a significant blow to Hezbollah and a success to Israel. The question is, what comes next? It makes very little strategic sense if Israel stops here. This has all the hallmarks of an operation that is a prelude for a broader campaign. A broader campaign that now the Israeli defense minister is kind of signaling and hinting might come to follow in the days and weeks ahead.",

It's very difficultfor a military organization like Hezbollah to carry any kind of coordinated offensive, let alone a defense, against an Israeli offensive if it cannot communicate it, if it is largely blinded by the fact that they now do not trust each other. They don't know where the moles are in the system. They don't really have an effective command and control structure anymore. But Hezbollah is also a very effective organization. One can expect it to recover pretty quickly. So, Israel will need to move fast. It wants to take advantage of this element of surprise. Obviously, this is not the only factor at play here. It is in the process of moving forces from the Gaza Strip in the south up to the north. There's also pressure coming from Washington. Washington is extremely here. U.S. officials very frustrated with their Israeli counterparts and somewhat embarrassing that President Biden's envoy was in Israel on Monday, and he had barely left Tel Aviv when Israel, in fact, carried out the first of these attacks. So, a great deal of frustration here by the Biden administration and the fact that Israel has decided to broaden its war in Lebanon.",

Mr. Hochstein has pretty much pre-negotiated a deal here between Hezbollah on one hand and Israel on the other that would see a new security arrangement in place in Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah would withdraw a certain number of kilometers from the border. Israel would withdraw and redeploy from some of the 13 points disputed along that border. But the problem and the challenge has been that Hezbollah and Iran, its patron, have refused to make good on that deal. Absent a ceasefire in Gaza that would bring relief to their ally, Hamas. And that is, of course, something that we all know is not in the off thing, the ceasefire in Gaza, the talks are completely deadlocked. So, the preconditioning that Iran and Hezbollah have put in place have essentially allowed this to escalate. And in the weeks -- in the days and weeks ahead, I think Hezbollah faces a very difficult choice. Will it accept to decouple the Lebanon front from the Gaza front, or will it risk sinking Lebanon and its military capabilities along with it in a devastating war with Israel?",

And when you hear about time in the federal system, you will hear sometimes in the state system, somebody will be sentenced to, let's say 15 years, but they'll be released on parole in three years, five years. That's not how it works in the federal system. In the United States federal system, whatever you're sentenced to, you will serve at least 85 percent of. The most you can get off is 15 percent for good time. So, if Sean Combs goes to trial and gets convicted, he will do at least 13 years or so, no matter what. So, the stakes are enormous here. And it didn't surprise me to hear Sean Combs' defense lawyer, say to Kaitlan last night that he expects to go to trial because I just don't see a middle ground here.

So, it won't happen before the new year, maybe at some point in 2025. Sean Combs will now be housed until his trial, however long that takes, at the Metropolitan Detention Center, the MDC, which is in Brooklyn. I have been in there many times talking to witnesses as a prosecutor. All prisons are hellacious. But boy, the MDC is among the worst of the worst. It is overpopulated, it is overcrowded, it is understaffed, it's hot, it's filthy. There have actually been federal judges who have reduced sentences because the person will have to serve it there, or who have given people bail because the conditions there are so brutal. So, that's the hard reality that Sean Combs now faces. I think it's likely he will be held in a special unit for inmates to protect them from other inmates.

Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them, several times. We've waited.

So, we're not expecting it to make landfall as a typhoon. That's the storm right here headed towards Shanghai. And then, here's the Storm 16 that still has about 18 hours in the water. It could get a name, but for now, it doesn't have one. It's kind of skirting the coast, kind of paralleling it there. Still a storm over Okinawa, that's where all the rainfall is right now. It will come around and kind of make a little hook around Shanghai and then put a lot of rainfall into South Korea. We don't usually say South Korea when it comes to tropical systems, but it certainly does happen. And there will be places there, especially Southern South Korea, that we'll see 250 millimeters, 10 inches of rainfall over the next two, maybe two and a half days. Now, we turn our attention to a place that has been very wet. And even though this is only a tropical depression, may it be good to name before it comes on shore. This is an area that has seen well in excess of 500 millimeters of rainfall already this month. And now, we have a storm system that's just going to spin around and make more rainfall in places that simply don't need it. And if this was the first storm of the month here, this would be no big deal, but the fact that the ground is so saturated, Julia, there's just no place for this to go other than down the hills and back into the valleys and then right through the streets as we saw with the last storm that rolled right through in the same places.",

The U.S. Justice Department is suing two corporations that owned and operated the contained ship that destroyed a bridge in Baltimore. It's seeking more than a hundred million dollars, claiming that their cost cutting and negligence in the ship's maintenance led to what it calls an entirely avoidable disaster. Harvey Weinstein has pleaded not guilty in New York to a new sexual offence charge. The former movie mogul attended the hearing after emergency heart surgery last week. Prosecutors want this new indictment added to Weinstein's retrial in New York on rape and sexual assault charges. And returning once more to our top story now, at least 32 people have died in Lebanon following two days of explosions. The attacks targeting pages and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah. The militant group has clashed with Israel repeatedly in recent months. On Wednesday, Israel's defense ministry appeared to acknowledge Israel's role in the latest wave of attacks. However, questions remain about exactly how Israel carried out the operation. Earlier, the Lebanese foreign minister told our Christiane Amanpour he fears a regional war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

RIPLEY (voice-over):  A Lebanese security source says militant group Hezbollah bought the pagers in recent months, using them, ironically, to prevent Israel and the U.S. from tracking their communications. Israel planted explosives next to each pagers' battery, along with a detonation switch. The New York Times reports, citing U.S. and other officials, thousands of beepers blew up Tuesday, all receiving the same message at the same time. The pagers have the name AR-924, made by Gold Apollo, a Taiwanese company that calls its product extremely robust and durable. 85 days of battery life. Fully charging in two and a half hours. A senior Taiwanese security official tells CNN Taiwan has no record of Gold Apollo pagers being shipped to Lebanon. Records do show Gold Apollo shipped about 260,000 pagers from Taiwan, mainly to the U.S. and Australia over the past two and a half years. CNN went to the company headquarters in New Taipei City. We saw investigators going in and out. We also talked to the CEO. He strongly denies making the explosive pagers bearing his company's name.

Evan, what can you tell us? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Julia, we knew that the FBI has previously said that the Iranian hackers had tried to target both the Biden campaign and the Trump campaign. In the case of the Trump campaign, we know that the -- they had managed to breach the campaign, obtained internal documents and then had sent them to news organizations in the United States. Now, what we know from this latest update from the FBI is that they also took some of the excerpts of those Trump campaign documents and sent them to people associated with what was then the Biden campaign. It appears that those people never opened the e-mails. We're told also by the Harris campaign, Kamala Harris' campaign has, of course, taken over a lot of the personnel from the Biden campaign. What they're saying is that the Iranian hackers appear to send this information to the personal e-mails of some of those campaign staffers and that they never opened and nobody appeared to know that they had received this information. Now, the reason -- you know, the reason for doing this, all of this, of course, according to the FBI and according to the U.S. intelligence services is that the Iranians are simply trying to sow discord ahead of the presidential election. They are trying to, of course, get information from the campaigns, they're trying to hack both of the campaigns. And the essential goal is to try to influence the U.S. election and, of course, to sow some of that chaos ahead of the presidential vote. Now, we also know that the FBI has been working on this case, and we expect in the coming days that we will hear about an indictment against people who were believed to be behind this hack and leak campaign. It's a tactic, of course, that you know, was used back in 2016 very successfully by the Russians, hacking the Democrats and the Clinton campaign just before the U.S. election then. Julia.",

I would say Gradiant's about the onlycompany in water that has differentiated technology yet is operating profitably at scale. You know, water has not seen much innovation in the last several decades, which is incredible because, you know, something as critical to our existence, to our planet, as water has not seen nearly enough innovation, you know, compared to, for example, software or telecommunications, A.I. So, we took a very, very new look, a very new fundamental look at how to solve water challenges, and in the process have developed this -- a number of technologies, a number of layers, and that has, in turn, had applications in adjacent application. So, one of this is lithium extraction. So, for us, we started with taking lithium brines and then concentrating them. So, these are dilute solutions of lithium. We concentrate them so that you can feasibly, you know, in an economically viable way, in an environmentally sustainable way, recover that lithium from that brine. So, for us it was really just the water project. We were taking water out from that solution, but as it turned out, what was left behind in the water, in this case, happened to be far more valuable in terms of dollar value and also energetic value than the water we recovered. So, the water is good, but what's left behind, which is the lithium, is far, far more valuable. So, we like to call ourselves an end-to-end solution provider. So, that wasn't enough for us. What we did is we went ahead and develop our own DLE technology. So, which first prepares that brine for the concentration part. Then we concentrate the brine, which is really just the water processing step and then we finally convert that lithium in the brine into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide. And we, therefore, bring this solution, which we call EC squared or extract concentrate convert, an end-to-end solution to produce lithium from brines.",
