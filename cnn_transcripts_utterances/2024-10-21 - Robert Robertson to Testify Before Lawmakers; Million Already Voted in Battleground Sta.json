      "sentences": "-- House Committee has subpoenaed Robert Robertson as they reconsider his murder conviction. It is still unclear whether he will testify in person or virtually today. Robertson was found guilty for the death of his two-year-old daughter more than twenty years ago. His attorneys say the shaken baby syndrome diagnosis, though, at the time was wrong, and that new evidence proves that.Joining me now, Texas State Representative Brian Harrison, who is on the committee holding today's hearing and also helped to get that subpoena to get Roberson to testify. It's good to have you with me this hour. So, I know there's been talk of security concerns. Do you know at this hour whether Robert Roberson will be testifying in person today? REP. BRIAN HARRISON (R-TX):  So, that is my hope. It's my expectation. You know, when I made the motion to issue the subpoena that if we hadn't done it, quite frankly, Robert would almost certainly be dead right now. And I got to say, I'm very proud of every member of my committee, the Republicans and the Democrats who voted to issue that subpoena. I'm appreciative of the Supreme Court in Texas, the all-Republican Supreme Court, by the way, that agreed with us that we absolutely had the lawful authority to issue that subpoena. My hope would be that subpoena would be honored as it was written and issued by that -- by our committee for him to be able to come and testify in person so that we can evaluate him as a witness and get to the bottom of a very concerning potential in this case where we may have a law in the State of Texas, a junk science law that might be disregarded and it's possible an innocent person might be put to death, and we can't have that.",

But as far as I understand from the discussions that have been had, is that we absolutely -- actually, it wouldn't be a very big challenge at all to bring him here to testify in person. And I think we need to. We're talking about somebody with a ninth- grade education who's autistic, who spent 20 years, almost all of it in solitary confinement, in a small cement cell who hasn't -- does not have familiarity with Zoom. And I think it would be unfair for the Committee to have to evaluate or try to evaluate his credibility as a witness by staring at a little box on a computer screen.And I say this, by the way, as a supporter, a long-time supporter of the death penalty, but I believe it's incumbent upon us that once we maintain the death penalty, that we should be the most vigilant in making sure that no innocent person is ever subjected to it.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's making sure that our laws are followed. The people write the laws in the State of Texas through their elected representatives. And we've got a law on the books that I firmly believe should have applied to Robert and given him a new trial because he was convicted on the basis of something called the Shaken Baby Theory Hypothesis, because there was no direct evidence of physical abuse of this child, so certain medical evidence or experts gave some types of testimony and a jury convicted him on that. But I firmly believe that in light of all the new evidence that I have been privy to that no jury has -- I think it's very unlikely that knowing what I know now that a jury would find him guilty today.And so, what might -- what I think needs to happen is that he needs a new trial and a new jury needs to re-examine the facts of this case so that all of the evidence that the original jury never saw can be heard as well as in light of the new understanding of shaken baby theory, which has been largely discredited. Most states just get -- push it out the side. And by the way, nobody in any state in the country has ever been executed on the basis of shaken baby theory. Look, I want Texas to lead the nation on just about everything, but executing potentially innocent people is not one of them.",

If we hadn't issued that subpoena, he'd be dead right now. So, arguably, he has got the most unique perspective in all of the United States of America on the way the criminal justice system in the State of Texas has handled his shaken baby syndrome case. And here's the thing, this is something -- from the people who know the facts, Republican, Democrat, pro-death penalty, anti-death penalty, whether you think he's innocent or whether you think he's guilty, if you understand the facts of this case, I think it's really clear the criminal justice system in the State of Texas has failed him in this manner and we have got to get this man a new trial so that all the evidence can be re-evaluated in light of what we understand now.",

Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  And what you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is -- it demeans the office.

On one hand, she's trying to hold on to some of the men, Democratic men, who might be, you know, interested in Donald Trump. Trump curious, as they say. And so, she's got to hold on to those voters and make sure that they show up. She's got to keep all of her base voters to come out.On the other hand, she's also talking to these moderate and independent women, Republican women, who are showing up and saying to them -- they showed up in 2022, they showed up in these abortion referendums around the country and saying to them, hey, I'm one of you. Remember what the stakes are here and come back and vote for me because that's the way that we get reproductive rights. We just saw the president today, President Biden today, the real president, right? We just saw that he's talking about having insurers cover birth control. This is one of the things that people in this country actually matter. It matters to real live people, men and women that we cover birth control by insurers. At the other hand, you've got Donald Trump who's saying he wants to go after enemies from within and like attacking Nancy Pelosi. And he may want to unleash the U.S. military. Those are the contrast that the Harris campaign want to keep live because they want people to understand the stakes of the election. HILL:  Well, speaking of those comments actually, Senator J. D. Vance just a short time ago was asked about Trump's rhetoric, including the comments, he has doubled down multiple times on these, calling his political opponents the enemy from within, specifically name checking Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff. Here's how Vance responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Well, Donald Trump is unfiltered. I think this is one of the reasons why the campaign has gone well is because he's not doing a basement campaign strategy. We've obviously got some very important enemies to focus on overseas, but if people are burning down our cities, then of course we have to have a police response to that very basic violation of our right of public security.",

But here's what Donald Trump just did. He just made it not about the past, he made it about the future. He said, if you reelect me, this is going to be how I govern. I'm going to go after people using this.And let me just say this as a caution to all the Republicans who are signing up for this, what makes anybody believe that he's only going to do this for Democrats? Donald Trump has already shown us that if a Republican crosses him, he will treat them just like any other enemy that he perceives that doesn't -- that he doesn't like. Because we saw it when he did that with Mike Pence. When Mike Pence was in the Capitol and they were saying, hey, Mike Pence, Donald Trump said so what? So, if you're a Republican and you think, oh, I have to be with Donald Trump all the time, or perhaps he's going to unleash the FBI, the IRS, or even the U.S. military against me if I cross him.",
