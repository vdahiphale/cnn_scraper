And as we can see, and we've seen this in the past with aid truckscoming into the Gaza Strip by land that there is such a severe humanitarian situation and famine and in some places or certainly the cusp of famine in some places that people are prepared to even board moving trucks to try to seize the food. And that's what we saw with several men seizing, you know, intercepting these trucks and seizing some of the aid that was on board. And the thing is that this pier has become even more important over the last couple of weeks because the Rafah crossing, which is where most of the aid was coming through from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, that's effectively been closed since Israel took control of that border crossing. So instead of seeing more and more aid going in as the U.S. administration certainly has been insisting must happen less aid has been getting in. So this floating pier couldn't come sooner enough. The target the U.S. is to bring in some 500 tons of aid every single day, Jessica.",

DEANA lot of good context. Elliott Gotkine, thanks so much for that update. We appreciate it. And joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut. He's also a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman thanks so much for making time this evening. I first want to ask you about that reporting that Elliott was just laying out about the Gazans intercepting aid from the floating pier. What's your reaction to that? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Well Jessica, thanks for having me and sadly, were going to see more and more scenes like that as the humanitarian situation which is already terrible inside of Gaza with, you know, malnutrition and starvation, fairly rampant. We're going to see more and more of that sort of thing. It will become increasingly difficult to deliver aid just because people will be so desperate. And of course, the more that that is true, the more at risk the United States and United States military is as it guard and manage this pier which frankly is just -- you know, I can't imagine a more tangible symbol of embarrassment that the United States, which over the many, many years has given in the neighborhood of $150 billion to Israel that we would have to build this pier, that we can't convince the Israelis and the prime minister in particular to open humanitarian corridors such that we have to build this absurd naval asset to get it in, is really problematic. So look, I hope that the pier works. It never should have been necessary, and I hope that the prime minister will take seriously for the first time the need to really open substantial humanitarian corridors and allow the food and the medicine and the things that the people of Gaza need into -- into Gaza.",

I absolutely believe to my core that Israel has a right to defend itself and to go after and to eliminate the architects and the people who executed the most the appalling terrorist attack that we have seen in a very long time on October 7.It is also true that the Israelis and the prime minister in particular should do this very differently than they have in the last seven months. This prime minister, who in my opinion, has not done nearly enough to protect civilians who has it not just not outlined an end game, which of course his own defense minister is demanding and which he rejected. He has rejected a two-state solution over and over and over again. So while he has in my opinion in the laudable goal of defending Israel, been practically out of control with respect to the humanitarian situation. He's dismissed any hope for the Palestinians that ultimately are going to need to be a solution here. He has turned a blind eye to some truly appalling violence on the part of settlers in the West Bank. And he has sort of saber-rattled with respect to, you know, going to war with Iran and other things that would conceivably have the effect of drawing the United States into a regional war. So my hope is and look, it's not American politicians job to get involved in Israeli domestic politics, but I hope that the prime minister will start listening to those people in his own party who are saying, you know, this is not good for the long-term strategic interests of Israel.",

There are Ukrainians dying on the battlefield today because the Chinese have supported the Russian economy. And I think that's unconscionable. By the way, they're not the only ones. I wish the Indians would not be so keen about purchasing at a deeply discounted price the oil of a murderous regime that is looking to completely rewrite the global order. You know, It is not inconceivable that China or India might someday be the subject of a territorial dispute. By the way, they have territorial disputes with each other. And so you know, it's a profoundly cynical game that Chinas playing because Russia has effectively become an oil supplying vassal to them and they need energy.

And of course, that's what they saw in that oversight hearing and frankly, you know, I understand that its good and funny content for Instagram and TikTok, but it's a serious and dangerous world and the world needs to know that the United States is being statesman-like and deliberate in the way we govern ourselves and the way we act in the world.",

And not trying to -- not interested mostly in narrow -- their own personal narrow and political interests. And that's the demand from Israeli society. [17:19:46] DEKEL-CHEN: And that all comes down to getting the hostages home. It is an absolute consensus in Israel that that should be the first priority. It's been clear to most Israelis for most of these last horrific seven months that our government, in all of its parts, has not prioritized the fate of the hostages enough. And I can't say for sure what this or that politician' statement -- how that could possibly benefit the fate of the hostages. We need action and not political squabbling.

What happened on October 7, was a catastrophic failure of leadership, and obviously military intelligence, but mostly leadership. And this very same government has, for the most part, refused to take any kind of real accountability for what has happened. And has been as hundreds of thousands, millions of Israelis in the street will say has been totally unresponsive to the demands to do more to get our hostages home. These people, both the 1,500 who were murdered by Hamas on October 7, and now, hundred and 28 remaining hostages, we hope most know that not all of them are alive, but most of them they cannot be abandoned again, after October 7.

And there was -- there was a summit during that campaign where a Mitt Romney aide said, well, we're not worried about what Romney said during the primaries. We can just do an Etch-A-Sketch and he'll be just fine for the general election. And we were at a Mitt Romney rally one day and Alice shows up. And she says, Jim, I'm here. Come outside. And Alice had a bag full of Etch-A- Sketches that she was handing out to the press. She had pulled over at a Toys-R-Us and bought a bunch of small Etch-A- Sketches to try to point across from the Sanatorium campaign that Mitt Romney can't get away with this. Anyway, that's the kind of sense of humor that Alice brought to the table. She was conservative but, you know, what -- for her, it wasn't about winning every debate, every argument. She sincerely held onto her beliefs. And that was one reason why I always enjoyed having her on with Maria Cardona because we can have these. And we did it for years on the weekend edition of NEWSROOM. You know, you can have these heart-to-heart conversations, you know, very strongly held views could be expressed, but done in a civil and professional manner. And I think that's what sets Alice apart from so many other political pundits, that she -- she really led with the heart. And one other thing that we should know about Alice is that she was a fellow up at Harvard, and invited me up there one time, invited a lot of CNNers up there. And this was -- politics was just a passion for her. It was her life. And it just flowed out of her. And just to echo what Dana and Laura was saying, absolutely. That's why we're all broken up over this, is because she was such a tremendously kind person and always, as Laura was saying, a few moments ago, always trying to lift you up. She always came on set with this big smile on her face and that -- that wonderful southern accent of hers. And any stress you had would just melt away when you're in her presents.

We were going to see each other this weekend. We thought maybe we were going to be on, because people always call us at the last minute if they need to. We were scheduled to be on, on Monday, with Jim. And we were going to do our podcast. We were going to do our podcast today.And I just can't believe that she's gone. But I want everyone to know what a special person she was, especially in this industry. As you know, today's politics can be so indecent and so dirty. And Alice was just such a loving, shining light that paints -- she came into a room and she would light it up and she was witty and smart and funny. And she would always tease me right before our segments when we went on, when, you know, sometimes you have to tell us, Jessica, OK, ladies, keep it tight -- (LAUGHTER)",
