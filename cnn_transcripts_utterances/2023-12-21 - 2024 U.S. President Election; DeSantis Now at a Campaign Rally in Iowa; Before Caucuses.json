Because as I said, you cut a deal on the border, perhaps you move forward with Ukraine and Israel aid, but the Liberals -- the members of the president's own party are concerned about the concessions that he is making to try to cut a deal for more restrictive immigration policies. Then you have folks on the right who are concerned that it is not going far enough when it comes to more immigration restrictions, particularly in the Republican-led house.So, you can see right there the challenges of getting any proposal through that could deal with that issue and also help Ukraine and Israel at a time of war, not to mention those key-ish deadlines that are coming up. That will be here fast to keep the government open, which is why you're hearing a lot of fears and concerns about what comes next in the new year. Omar.",

Hamas says, there will be no talks about releasing any of the hostages until the Israeli military operation in Gaza is over. Meanwhile, there are disturbing new warnings from U.S. intelligence agency. There's a flurry of new analysis showing that the credibility and influence of Hamas has grown since the brutal October 7th attacks on Israel. So, joining us with more on the growing influence of Hamas, Retired US Air Force Colonel and CNN Military Analyst Cedric Leighton. Always good to see you. So, for starters -- I mean, Hamas's influence globally has grown as our reporting has shown since Israel's war campaign has waned due in part to seeing images and videos, like these out of Gaza. This is out of Jabalya in Gaza in particular. So, this appears to be the aftermath of some sort of strike. There are bodies in the street there as well. How might some of these images change the global perspective or how might some of these images shift Israel's military tactics at all in the context of the global perception here?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF, PENTAGON, AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA: Yes, Omar, good morning. It's great to be with you. The built problem that the Israelis have is precisely what you're pointing out there, Omar. And that fact is this, you know, we're seeing almost daily, if not hourly, videos of this type. And what they show, of course, is the destruction that the IDF has brought about within Gaza. And what we're also seeing is in, perhaps, an unfiltered way, in some cases, the suffering of the civilian population there. That resonates with people all around the world. And from a practical strategic standpoint, you're looking at a situation where that influences people's perceptions. They tend to forget about what happened on October 7th and with the Hamas attack on the Israeli civilians, and so -- in Israel that killed about 1,200 or so people. That is, you know, now put on the wayside as horrible as that was, and then we take a look at what's happening now. So, the tactics that the Israelis are using as part of their strategy to confront Hamas, those tactics are appeared to be heavy handed, and they, of course, are costing a lot of lives.

You could smell those gases that the authorities here have been talking about. You don't want to be exposed to that for an extended period of time, you could also feel the heat because we were flying fairly low over that magma field. Now, what seismologists were saying, we had one actually with us on the flight that we were taking, is they say that this is an eruption that is -- was extremely furious at the beginning. We saw those images of those fountains of magma spewing into the air, but also seems to be dying down quickly. But one of the things that you mentioned is absolutely correct, is that the danger has not passed.
