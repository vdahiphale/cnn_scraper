And welcome to our viewers in the U.S. and around the world.We're going to begin with breaking news as tensions in the Middle East threaten to boil over. Israel today turning its firepower on targets in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen. The IDF saying it attacked a power station and a seaport. The Iran-backed group is behind recent rocket attacks on Israel and U.S. warship ships in the region. And this all comes as Hezbollah confirmed, another of its senior leaders was killed in Friday's massive Israeli strike on Beirut that killed the group's leader. Let's send it over now to Jim in Tel Aviv. Jim, walk us through what's happening and what these attacks on the Houthi targets tell us.",

I mean, we have seen several dozen rockets fired from southern Lebanon into northern Israel today, the majority of which we should say were intercepted, some of which fell in open areas.But it certainly is nothing like the kind of overwhelming retaliation that Israeli officials have long expected in the event of this kind of escalation in this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. And that speaks of course, to the extent to which the Israeli military has severely degraded Hezbollah's capabilities over the course of the last couple of weeks, as well as the extent to which that organization is really in disarray following the killing of so many of its senior leaders, including of course, on Friday night its leader Hassan Nasrallah. Now that doesn't mean that Hezbollah won't have the ability to regroup at some point. It doesn't mean that its arsenal of hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles has been totally destroyed. But it does mean that at least for the time being, we aren't seeing the kind of overwhelming retaliation that you might expect in a moment like this. And the Israeli military is certainly trying to take advantage of this moment of chaos and dysfunction within Hezbollah by continuing to carry out multiple airstrikes in southern Lebanon as well as in the southern suburbs of Beirut, known as the Dahiyeh, where we have seen Israeli strikes have gone after weapons depots, rocket launchers. But of course we are also seeing multiple casualties, including civilians being killed in some of these strikes as well. Tonight, we are also witnessing the Israeli military for the first time carrying out the second ever strikes in Yemen. We saw that they carried out strikes in the Yemeni port of al Hudaydah, a Houthi stronghold where the Israeli military says that they struck power plants and ports used to import oil and weapons into Yemen. The Houthis, of course, in recent weeks have fired three missiles towards Israel, including one this past week that was targeted at Tel Aviv. And so these strikes, according to the Israeli military, were in retaliation for those attacks by the Houthis, Jim.",

The Israelis, of course, are going to do what's necessary to protect themselves and the thousands of Israeli citizens that had to be evacuated from the north of Israel.We don't know how much is left. I think a few months ago, the estimate was that the Hezbollah had about 150,000 different types of missiles and rockets. And so, I don't know how many they have left? Certainly it will be very difficult to organize any sort of cohesive response by Hezbollah, given that nobody trusts anybody right now. Nobody trusts their communications equipment and they most likely are trying to scatter to avoid being hit. SCIUTTO: Yes. I mean, it's not clear who would issue the order for retaliatory strike. And how Hezbollah would effectively communicate that to the commanders on the ground, to the missile launch sites, et cetera. I want to ask you about Iran now, because of course, Iran has tremendous influence, might even take control over Hezbollah. Iran has given public signals that it's going to leave the retaliation to Hezbollah. Do you read Iran's position here and by the way, this wouldn't be entirely new because we've seen Iran hold back previously, for instance, after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh inside Tehran.

It's not a headline thing, but this is really impressive the way that they managed to keep their systems going and I think that Iran absolutely does not want to be on the receiving end of any of this.

Now, we heard earlier from Buncombe County officials who told us that there are ten confirmed fatalities here in this county. But just a little bit later, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said that the death toll across the state is 11. At this point, we don't know if that's including the ten that are reported here in Buncombe County. The other thing that caught our attention is that county officials said that they have received, imagine this, a thousand calls for missing people. The main problem here is that many of those people are probably doing ok, but there's a huge communications problem. A lot of cell phone towers are down. There's no communication, there's no way to tell your loved ones that you are ok. And that's something that officials are working on right now. Also in the city of Weaverville, both water and power completely out for the entire city. And there were 15 water rescues today. Earlier we went to a neighborhood here in Asheville where people are just getting together, making an effort to start clearing away the debris.

But, Jessica, this really gives you a sense of how bitter this duel has become. But don't forget when you hear the former president saying this and also rallies Democrats as well, every time he goes after Vice President Harris, particularly in personal ways and making front of her name that rallies Democrats as well. So it raises the question and here in the final month, is there anything that can move this razor thin race? Of course, said the ground game is essential part of his campaign. We see people signing up voters here in the crowd. There's a lot of activity going on but there is no doubt for the next five weeks or so.

So, that's a significant statement and this is the line that the White House and what house aides have been really treading carefully, certainly acknowledging that the death of the Hezbollah leader -- leader over the weekend was notable, a huge which blow for them. But while also temporarily in their responses in an ever return, wanting to push for de-escalation, push for a ceasefire, push for a diplomatic negotiations to continue, and to push towards an end to this conflict. That's something we saw from Biden's top national security advisor, John Kirby. This morning on the Sunday shows, acknowledging that the death of Hezbollah leader, he called him a known terrorist, a guy with American blood and Israeli blood on his hands. But we also saw Kirby similar to what we saw from President Biden just a few minutes ago, acknowledging and pushing for a ceasefire, pushing for de-escalation of this conflict that President Biden is heading back here to the White House, Jessica, where he certainly will keep -- be kept apprised of the rapidly evolving movements in the Middle East, Jessica.",

Obviously, it wasn't understood. And the Houthis and the Iranian masters continue.

I think maybe the Houthis perhaps are interpreting the gap between what has been said and declared and what eventually has been done as something that indicates what the real intentions of America are.

There were hardly on the threat map.

And what Israel needs to do is to create the conditions for that to happen.It either happens through a diplomatic deal, if Hezbollah will agree to one and say, okay, we implement 1701, we go back, we wont be south of the Litani, problem solved. And if that doesn't happen, then the other option would be think it will be necessary for the IDF to go in and clear certain areas at a tactical distance from where the border is.
