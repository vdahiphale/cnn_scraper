This crash happening around 6Now, crews are getting ready to move in and move some of these heavy machinery into place so they can start picking up the mess in. As we look from above, because when you look from above, that's where you can see how bad this derailment was. The good news here, just like you said, no hazardous materials on board, nothing spilling, so no environmental cleanup effort. But as you understand, in small communities like this one, they are concerned about moving through this area as we talk about derailment after derailment. Now, we're about 70 miles away from Birmingham, but nothing can pass up and down this train track as this is the way it is. We had to work our way back here, this is a one-lane road to get to this access to be able to even show you what is going on right now. Now, the crews have heavy machinery that they're going to bring in within the next few hours and start cleaning up this mess, because obviously, this is a lot of commerce that's being stopped right now because of this derailment. So many questions right now for -- especially towards the NTSB. How did this happen? What caused this derailment, especially in an area there's not a lot of traffic? So, that's something they're going to have to investigate and find out. About 30 cars we counted so far behind that area that had been toppled over, so they're going to take some time to clean up.",

      "sentences": "So, Jim, this has actually been pretty difficult for the U.S. to track with any real authority, because it is difficult, of course, to track the number of weapons that are being left on the battlefield and that Russia is seizing, and then of course it is difficult for the U.S. to track exactly how many of the weapons Russia is sending to Iran. But what we are told is that this has happened at least several time.The U.S. has been tracking multiple instances of this where the Russians have captured things like javelin anti-tank missiles and stinger anti-aircraft missiles. As well as their kind of NATO equivalents, right, because the NATO countries are also giving their, kind of, equivalents of that weaponry to Ukraine and sending them to Iran so that Iran can likely try to reverse engineer them. And this is the part of the growing defense partnership that we're seeing between Iran and Russia, something that has really intensified over the last year as Russia has sought Iran's help for its war in Ukraine. Now, we're seeing that Iran is seeking military equipment from Russia in return, and Russia is eager to provide this kind of western equipment to Iran because it want's that support from Tehran as it continues its invasion of Ukraine. Now, U.S. officials are not commenting on this directly to us. When we asked the defense official for a comment, they referred us to comments made by Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl, at a hearing earlier this month where he said that the U.S. is not seeing a significant amount of diversion of the U.S. provided weapons that are going to the Ukrainians. But that the diversion that they are seeing are those instances of the Russians capturing things on the battlefield. Now, we should note, this it is not a widespread or systemic issue. And the Ukrainians actually do tell the Pentagon every time they are forced to leave a U.S.-provided system on the battlefield either because they are overrun or because they have to quickly withdraw. So, the Pentagon has some idea of how much of that equipment is falling into Russian hands. They don't believe it is a very large number, however there are concerns, of course, that if Iran can reverse engineer some of this, it could pose a risk to the rest of the region. Jim, Erica.",

So, having this conversation with doctors about their patients' breast density can really help gauge their risk for breast cancer and what the screening process should look like for them.So, we know that the FDA is going to require mammogram facilities to report breast density information to those patients, this is to encourage having those conversations. And you see here on the screen, what we mean by dense breast tissue, we're talking about the proportion of tissue, fibroglandular tissue, in proportion to the fatty tissue in the breasts.
