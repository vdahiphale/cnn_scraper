Thank you. Election music. Now that we're just a scant 101 days before Inauguration Day, we're drilling down on where the 2024 race actually stands. Moments ago, Donald Trump wrapped up his rally in Aurora, Colorado, pushing fears of gangs taking over American cities such as Aurora. It's a campaign issue he believes is working. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is also trying to win votes out west. She's campaigning in Arizona today. Let's get straight to CNN's Eva McKend. Eva, it might seem to some as though Harris is more focused on media blitz, events targeted towards specific voter groups, rather than barnstorming rallies in swing states.",

That's far more border security than Donald Trump ever, ever spent on building his wall that he said Mexico is going to pay for.And in the intervening years that Donald Trump has played politics with this, matters have gotten worse in a lot of respects because there are transnational gangs not in Aurora but in in Central America and in other places that are making billions of dollars smuggling people to the border of the United States.
