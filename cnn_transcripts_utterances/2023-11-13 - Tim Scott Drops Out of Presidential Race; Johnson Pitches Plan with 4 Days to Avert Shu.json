He was the last candidate to meet the donor and polling thresholds to make last week -- week's debate, and that really spelled trouble. You know, the thought is by leaving the race now, people close to his campaign say that he can return to the Senate without a potentially embarrassing finish in Iowa. He preserves the possibility of a future political run and leaves without getting in the crosshairs of the former president. So that seems to be what -- what went into the calculation.",

And that is because there are already a number of conservatives who do not like the plan that Johnson unveiled on Saturday on a private conference call with his members. And that is because there are no spending cuts in either short-term spending bill. This would be basically a two-part staggered, short- term spending process. Something kind of unlike anything we've seen in Washington before. A lot of Democrats see it as kind of gimmicky. They argue that it overcomplicates something that could be much simpler. And yet, one notable thing over the weekend, where so many Democrats were holding back their fire, remaining sort of open to the idea, in part because there aren't spending cuts included. And that was a red line for many Democrats. So we're going to be keeping our eye on how House Democrats proceed over the next couple of days. The first test for Johnson is going to be passing what is known as a rule. This is a procedural step that dictates the rules of the House floor for any legislation that comes before that body. And it's really important, because typically, it's the majority party that gets the rule over the finish line. But it's very possible that conservatives could vote against that rule. And that would obviously be a major problem for Johnson, because then he either has to turn to Democrats to help with the rule or he has to try to pass this bill under a suspension of the rule, which means you need two-thirds majority. That's a larger threshold with Democrats he would need to pass this. So there's just a lot of remaining questions for how Johnson gets this over the finish line.",

It could happen at any time.Take, for instance, the town of Grindavik, which is currently evacuated. This is located in Southwestern Iceland, where this flurry of earthquakes caused the damage here that you see on the screen behind me. And that is from what people believe, the authorities and researchers believe, that is called a magma corridor that could be floating directly underneath the town of Grindavik. And that's causing some of the damage here and the flurry of activity. Of course, if we do get an eruption, there's concerns for the worldwide aviation industry, not just for Southwestern Iceland. So that's a broader scope than just this. But the thousands of earthquakes that have occurred since Friday, some of which have been noted offshore, there has been a brief lull in the past six to 12 hours. But what is concerning scientists and researchers is that the earthquake activity is very near the surface. A very shallow earthquake represents this magma corridor, magma intrusion, that is getting closer and closer to the surface of the earth. So concerns growing with the fact that this magma could spew out, causing the volcanic eruption. And we don't want to see that become explosive, because that volcanic ash does not mix well with jet engines and actually stalling, cause it to fall out of the sky.",
