Stacy, what did you think of what Trump had to say there? It sort of sounded to me like -- I covered him at the White House and he would be asked whether or not he was going to abide by a peaceful transfer of power and he said well, it depends on how the election goes. I mean, it was the kind of a response. I'll let you know what I think of the trial after the trial is over and what the jury did. STACY SCHNEIDER, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT (via Webex by Cisco):  Right. I mean, I think it's ironic here that Trump keeps calling it a political prosecution, yet he was shown a copy of the grand jury indictment, which are charges. There are 34 counts of falsifying business records. But the Manhattan D.A. in this case actually cited the evidence in the indictment. He referred to checks. He referred to check stubs, receipts, ledgers entered in the Trump corporation about this alleged business fraud. So how Trump is using his political prosecution mantra to distract from what's going on in Manhattan criminal court is not quite fitting together this time.",

The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, tried to address it and Republicans blocked those efforts. So, in some ways, Democrats say come on, let's have the conversation.

Yesterday's conversation zeroing in on U.S.- China relations and regional and global security issues, like Russia's war against Ukraine. America's rivalry with two superpower adversaries is the subject of a new book, \"New Cold Wars: China's Rise, Russia's Invasion, and America's Struggle to Defend the West.\" It was written by our next guest, the great CNN political and national security analyst and New York Times correspondent as well, David Sanger.
