All right, Katelyn, what do we know about the trajectory of these federal cases? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, at least in the general sense, these two federal criminal cases, they continue on. Donald Trump is still a defendant there and will be fighting them and the Justice Department will be pursuing them. \"The Washington Post\" reporting out last night is that Justice Department officials would plan to continue with those cases, even past Election Day if Donald Trump we're to be elected the president in November. But they very likely would stop once he took office either because Trump would want them to stop if he we're to be elected president or because the Justice Department has a policy that you can't be prosecuting a sitting president by its own department. That just isn't what the Justice Department has decided since the 1970s that they could do. So that policy would likely be in place for Trump. A lot is in the hands of the court system though, and a lot could happen, Brianna, between now and Election Day, obviously. Even with these cases, Donald Trump and his team, they have been trying to take that Supreme Court opinion from Monday about presidential immunity, they're going to be using it every way that they can. And already they've been able to push off his sentencing in the New York hush money case, where he was convicted by a jury, until September if that even survives. They are going to be arguing to the judge in the coming weeks that it should not. There was too much evidence from the White House that came into play at that trial proceeding -- Brianna?",

Thewinds have yet to get here, but it's only a matter of time before they do so. And the latest update from the U.S. National Weather Center says that Beryl is still a category four storm, packing winds -- maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour. And the good news here, Brianna, is that it's moving at about 80 miles an hour in a west-northwest direction. And that's good news because it means that it is not a stationary storm. Its -- it's authorities here are hoping that it'll move through very quickly and not dump a lot of rain. Because the potential for torrential rains is very high. That may cause flooding and mudslides. And so that's a big, big concern.

Thanks to the bravery of the Ukrainian forces and weapons deliver -- deliveries from the United States and our allies and partners, it is increasingly clear the Russian offensive around Kharkiv has been a failure. And as President Biden has been clear, we are coming committed to continuing to stand with Ukraine until they prevail against Russian aggression. So I want to share a bit of additional updates before -- for all of you before we start. I know some of some of you have been trying to confirm some of this information that I'm about to share. So I'll do it right now at the podium. The president has connected with Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer Representative Clyburn, former Speaker Pelosi and Senator Coons. Today, President Biden taped two black radio interviews that will air tomorrow morning. One is with Earl Ingram on Civic Media Network, which airs across Wisconsin, and one with Andrea Lawfolk (ph) Sanders on WURD's \"The Source\" in Philadelphia. And as Governor Walz of Minnesota announced today, the president will meet with more than 20 Democratic governors. Now, as you know, these governors are some of our closest partners when it comes to creating jobs, building new roads and building bridges, and so much more. And so the president certainly looks forward to meeting with them. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.",

And so and so we -- we are laying out and explaining exactly what happened. You heard from the president. You've heard from me. And it was, you know, indeed a -- a schedule where the present traveled six times zones forward to the G-Y in Italy, nine times zones back to L.A. and three time zones again to D.C. That's something that when the print puller on that day laid out for -- for all of you and those who reach the pool notes. And on top of that, he did have a cold. So it is an explanation. I don't think it is an addition. I don't think it's -- we certainly don't want to explain this away. But you all ask me for an explanation yesterday, the president gave that directly yesterday to his supporters. He wanted to make sure knowing that all of you would get that information as he's speaking to his supporters. (CROSSTALK) JEAN-PIERRE: Sure.",

And look, the president, obviously right after the bait. He visited four states in two-and-a-half days, gave a couple of remarks. He met with supporters, whether they were at the Waffle House in Atlanta or a watch party or North Carolina where there we're hundreds of supporters there and in Raleigh. And so he was busy dealing with -- dealing with his schedule and also speaking directly and engaging with his supporters and then spend time with his family. I think what's important is that he has done this outreach. He's having these conversations. It is important to him to do so. And the folks that I laid out that he spoke to or -- or some of them have been his colleagues, some of them has been elected officials that he's known for some time. Obviously, Leader Jeffries is a new relationship that he has. Someone that he obviously respects. And so it is -- I think it's important to note that they were strong conversations. That's something that the president told me and my team directly moments ago. He was -- he was walking around and we happen to see the president and he said they we're strong conversations.
