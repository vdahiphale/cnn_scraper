That will almost certainly be tense. A senior administration official says the president is angry and will voice his frustration over Israel's military killing of seven aid workers in Gaza this week. The founder of that organization, World Central Kitchen, Jose Andres is calling for an independent investigation and says the IDF systematically targeted his group's aid workers. The CNN analysis of videos of the aftermath shows the attacks appear to have been multiple precision strikes outside of the conflict zone. The entire convoy, two armored cars and another truck was struck. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That moment really prompting outrage from President Biden all the way down among his senior officials. But one big question going forward is whether this moment could potentially serve as a turning point in U.S. military support for Israel's operation in Gaza. Now, the president is expected to focus on the deaths of those seven workers in this call, but he's also expected to broaden things out a bit, talking about the need for protections for humanitarian aid workers. One U.S. official telling CNN that the Biden administration has already started conveying to the Israelis that they need to change the way they transmit information about where aid workers are stationed. The president also could potentially talk about those ongoing ceasefire negotiations to get hostages out of Gaza and more humanitarian aid in, as well as concerns about that potential Israeli operation into Rafah. Now, yesterday, ahead of this call, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant. A Pentagon spokesperson said that he expressed outrage, as well as stressed that this incident reinforces the concerns that the U.S. has about an operation into Rafah. The U.S. has said the Israelis need to do more to ensure that civilians are protected and evacuated if any operation is underway. But even as we have seen this heightened and sharpened rhetoric from the administration, using that word, outrage, what we have not seen is a shift in policy at this moment. There's been no indications that the U.S. is reconsidering their support of giving Israel military aid without conditions. In fact, our colleague, Natasha Bertrand, reported this morning that the U.S. recently authorized sending more bombs to Israel to add to their arsenal. So, there will be big questions for President Biden going forward, whether Israel will face any consequences from the U.S. in the wake of this devastating strike.",

They are under pressure now to look at every aspect of their targeting, to defend how they do it. But it is clear from this incident that one arm of the Israeli Defense Forces didn't know what the other was doing.One arm was communicating with that convoy on the ground, which was going through an area that Israel controlled. And those three vehicles, not only were they clearly marked, but they were a mile apart. And according to Andres, the first vehicle got hit, those people spilled out, took cover in the second vehicle, running for their lives between the two. That one came under fire. They took shelter in their third vehicle and then everyone was killed. You can only imagine the horror of that.",

Luckily, they were armored vehicles, no one was killed.But every morning, they give them the IDF GPS coordinates, how many vehicles, type of vehicles, what the vehicles are carrying, how many people are in these convoys, how many people at each of these locations, and yet, these location, these convoy have gotten hit. And 177 U.N. aid workers at last count have been killed and now the world is paying attention at last when it's foreign aid workers. Also, I think the IDF is on the back foot and trying to defend itself because World Central Kitchen has fed Israelis since October 7th, not just Palestinians. They're seen as apolitical.

He can't afford to lose votes over Israel. And when it comes right down to it, even if he lessens military aid, Netanyahu needs to keep prosecuting Hamas in order to keep his coalition together and not trigger new elections. So, Netanyahu is doing this for his political survival. If he gets aid lessened, he's just going to keep going full steam ahead.",

Of course, the information may change. It appears that those vehicles were taken out one after another. And as people were trying to flee from one vehicle to the next, they were getting taken out. They were getting hit.That suggests that the Israelis either were targeting something that they thought was a Hamas target, and they just kept going, or something worse.

The notification was acknowledged and, nonetheless, it was attacked, even though it was just filled with families, with children, et cetera.So, it makes you wonder why we never really see independent investigations. We never really see fulsome evidence that anything like this was justified. All we see is this repetition of attacks, this repetition of disregard for civilian infrastructures, generally speaking, not to mention all the harm that's coming to the wider population that are not working for humanitarian organizations or volunteering. So, either it's gross incompetence, which is repeated in terms of not following the norms of how you engage in a violent assault on a suspected target. Is it complete incompetence or is it willful disregard and sending a message that Gazans should not receive aid? Because that's the message we start to receive after all these months. ACOSTA:  Yes, and that raises a whole load of questions as well. I do want to ask you a little bit about how your organization, other organizations like yours try to de-conflict. Are you in contact with Israeli military contacts and say, okay, we are making a movement from this location over here to this location over there, please don't hit us, or we're going to be operating out of this shelter here, please don't hit us. Are those the kinds of conversations that occur? And do you know whether or not that message goes through when you try to send those messages out?",

You were just talking about the decision of the United States to continue to provide weapons that are attacking not only civilians, but also the humanitarian organizations.

There's one on the margins in the battleground states in 2020. I expect that that's going to be the case this November. But, currently, President Biden appears to have an advantage. Are Democrats somewhat not excited about what's going on in the Middle East? Of course, they are. Are people disgruntled? Of course, they are. But I think he's probably going to have an easier time turning out his folks than Republicans.

But you know what, I did want to throw one more thing up on screen for you, Karen, and that is this tweet from Ben Rhodes who worked for Barack Obama, deputy national security adviser, talking about President Biden's handling of the situation. He says, the U.S. government is still supplying 2,000-pound bombs and ammunition to support Israel's policy. Until there are substantive consequences, this outrage does nothing. Bibi obviously doesn't care what the U.S. says, it is about what the U.S. does.
