And for those who say the definition of cognitive dissonance here is oh, we're not going to toss him overboard because of one bad night. That one atrocious night was simply writ large, what could be seen for years and years that he is in serious decline? Nobody should be president when they're 85, or 86, including the ghost of Abraham Lincoln. But this guy is clearly in decline at this point.And part of the job, leaving aside whether he can do it for the next four years is winning the job. And as you just laid out, that seems to be nearly impossible at this point. When they say and many Democrats are still saying this, they lay out all the reasons why Donald Trump is loathsome and a threat to democracy and existential threat. And then they say that's why we have to get behind Joe Biden. No, that's exactly why Joe Biden must be ushered out. As I said, at that time, it was so obvious that at the Abbey Philip, last year on CNN, Biden had a chance to be seen by history as a statesman and a patriot. He spared the nation, a second Trump term, he could have gone out in a gracious fashion. Now, we can no longer indulge his delusions. It's a shame. It's a kind of a Shakespearean tragedy, perhaps with Him as King Lear and his wife as Lady Macbeth. But that's all secondary now. Precedent doesn't matter. Oh, he was the -- he is the incumbent. He won all the votes in the primary because he had no opposition. These are desperate times, and they call for measures that are appropriate to the circumstances.",

Here's what they found about what took place at the fundraiser.Some attendees said it was even worse at the smaller receptions before Biden took the stage greeting hundreds of supporters for grip and grin photos. The President stumbled over small talk and seemed frail. According to six attendees, for the high level donors there who were meeting the 81 year old Biden for the first time several said they found his decline shocking. It makes me wonder if there hadn't been the debate performance. Bob, if the debate had taken place in September, as was initially intended with the Commission on Presidential Debates, I don't know that we'd be even having this conversation because all the people that that fundraiser, Clooney included, weren't speaking until the debate. [09:10:40] COSTAS: Yes, and to me, and this is for the stick to sports crowd. This has been so overwhelmingly obvious for so long. You don't need a degree in public policy from Harvard to see it. And to say it if you're willing to say it any more than you need a degree from MIT to say two plus two is four. And it makes you wonder whether we've been gas lit by the Democrats, the Republicans major in gas lighting, everybody with Trump as their standard bearer, but this had to have been obvious to people surrounding the president and people who observed the president. Wouldn't it have been an act of patriotism, if that's not to overblown a word in this case, to lay that out before the American public? You know, look, Trump is a very vulnerable candidate against Hillary Clinton who clearly was qualified but had some baggage and may have run a bad campaign. She was hamstrung a bit about going after the personal flaws to be kind of Donald Trump for reasons we need not list here. And here we have Joe Biden, who cannot say as any other candidate could say, let's roll the tape on all of Trump's unhinged rallies where he seems to be a blistering buffoon. Because then all the Republicans do is turn it around on all the gaps and missteps and times when Biden seems to be wandering around in a fog, in sports. If your opponent has an obvious vulnerability, you, you devise a strategy to exploit that vulnerability. Hey, this guy is wide open for a left hook. But wait a minute, the guy can't -- our guy can't throw a left hook. That's where we are.",

He's a venture capitalist, founder of Tusk Strategies. His resume includes serving as the Deputy Governor of Illinois, as well as campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg. He was also communications director for Senator Chuck Schumer. He wrote recently for Substack, under the headline how Biden thinks. You said that all politicians are insecure and then put on the screen a part of what Bradley wrote, quote, \"Any successful argument means convincing him that there's more upside for him and dropping out, not that he should do what's right, because it's right.\" You have a three prong approach. The first deals with family considerations explain. BRADLEY TUSK, VENTURE CAPITALIST/POLITICAL STRATEGIES: Yeah, well, look, Hunter Biden was convicted of a federal crime. And I think most people would say, and I would certainly agree that had Joe Biden not been president, he wouldn't have ever been prosecuted for that. Joe Biden, as president has the ability to pardon his son. But if he's the candidate, it's way too controversial. And given the position he's already in, it would just be completely untenable. If he's not the candidate, and he's just finishing up his term, it's completely doable. And so a son of his who has struggled his entire life, all of a sudden, now facing as many as 18 months in prison, you can prevent that from happening. You can save him. You can save your family from all of this pain. And once you're not a candidate, it's easy to do.",

Everybody has ideas on Capitol Hill. But that doesn't mean that that's what Donald Trump is focused on.He is focused on getting our economy roaring again, getting inflation under control, actually expanding our energy infrastructure, having us be energy dominant here in the United States. And of course, having a much more peaceful world having these conflicts around the globe come to an end. That's his focus. Anybody can have their ideas.

He has people who may come and work in the administration, but that doesn't mean all of their ideas are going to get an opportunity to be acted on, to be moved and signed into law. That's not how this works. And so, yes, you might have people who might come in but Donald Trump is focused on the American people, which is why I said earlier, the GOP platform I am telling you right now, that's where you need to look towards in terms of what a Donald Trump agenda looks like as the 47th president.
