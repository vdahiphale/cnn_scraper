And the two Russians tried to hack U.S. intelligence and Defense Department employees, according to the indictment, as well as those at the State and Energy Department. That is an effort that started back in 2016 and wrapped up last year. Joining us now to discuss, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and CNN senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez. Evan, first to you. Walk us through this reporting. What did investigators find?",

The people in the intelligence community, people from DOD, Department of State, Department of Energy. So we know that that is a pretty large group. Interestingly, it is spearfishing. So these people were targeted specifically, right? Not just regular fishing, throughout thousands of emails, but actually generate fraudulent emails that are known to -- would appeal to or trick these specific people into entering their email credentials.",

But one of the things they count on is the fact that, weather in Russia, it is extremely terrible, and these guys try to go on vacation in warm places, and that's where the tried to grab them. It happens all of the time. They indict these guys and then they wait for them to make a misstep. And then they bring them in. In this case, one of the things, just real quickly I wanted to mention, is, you know, critical infrastructure, dealing with the election systems was one of the targets of this campaign. And so that is one of the big concerns, certainly going forward because we have an election coming up next year.",

This tells us that the FSB, their internal intelligence apparatus, is also involved in the same sort of aggressive, destructive cyberattacks. And so I think that the message the U.S. community takes away from this is that it's time to step up the game. There is no time more than an impending election that we need to be absolutely on the cutting edge of our cybersecurity.",

Very traumatized at this point.I want to go now to the White House, which is where John Kirby is taking some questions now about attacks on U.S. forces. ADM. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: That the obvious -- the obvious proof of that are the drones that are armed. And continue to provide Russian -- to help Russia out, create a manufacturing plant on Russian soil so they can build their own Iranian model drones, which are continuing to attack the people of Ukraine and Ukrainian infrastructure. That said -- and we have talked about this many times before -- Iran probably wants something out of this, too. And we have reason to believe that they want their hands on some sophisticated Russian military capabilities, attack helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, cruise and/or ballistic. I cannot sit here and tell you that we have seen actual evidence of the movement of those kinds of defense articles but there is, clearly, a growing relationship in the defense realm between these two countries. As I have also said, it is not only not good for the people of Ukraine, it is really not good for the people of the Middle East. If Iran can get their hands on additional military capability, some sophisticated military capability, only makes their destabilizing activity all the more worrisome.",
