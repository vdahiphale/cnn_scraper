The world's largest economy growing at an annualized 2.8 percent in the second quarter and that is considerably stronger than estimates. Of course, important to remember, too, this 2.8 percent is the initial estimate from the U.S. Commerce Department. It will be revised. It's still a very strong number there. So how is Wall Street feeling about this latest GDP report? As you can see about a third of a percent, a little bit more if you're looking at the Dow, there. Wednesday of course, this comes on the heels of Wednesday's sell off. CNN's Paula Newton tracking all of this for us here in New York.

      "sentences": "I don't mind telling you. I threw them all out. I'm sure a lot of economists around the world did aswell. Listen, this U.S. economy just will not quit. And that's at every level. It doesn't matter if you're talking about the consumer and what they're spending on. Because they're also spending on discretionary items. But also businesses. They really stocked up, built up those inventories, were spending on things like inventory but also spending on software, spending on equipment. This was an economy really in absolute balance right now. And why do I say that, Erica, it's because inflation is also under control. You know, you would have pulled so many people two years ago when we were still trying to figure out a way through -- out through the pandemic. And they would've said, can the U.S. economy do this, can they continue to grow robustly and still keep inflation under control? Well, it's happened, they've done it. And I think sometimes is you see the market hears sometimes that market is ahead on these kinds of things. That is really not such an extraordinary action. But there right now, worried more about earnings in fact and they'll get some of those earnings through the second quarter. Having said that, though, if you're looking at the U.S. consumer, if you're looking at U.S. businesses, as I said, absolutely robust and much more than expected. You're talking a doubling from that last from the first quarter. A few things to keep in mind here though, this also now puts the spotlight squarely on Jerome Powell and interest rates in the United States. I don't have to remind you, Erica, interest rates are as high as they've been in more than a generation. The housing market here in the United States still is the one I'd say really bleak spots for so many people that are looking to move or just trying to find affordable housing. It looks like next week, when the Fed chair meets with the Fed committee, that likely an interest rate cut is not in the cards. That was pretty much off the table already. But you have to think about what he might do in September. Does he believe this is an economy that can take an interest rate cut? Because again, they do not want inflation to come up anywhere near the 3 percent. It came in much lower than expectations the last month and they want to keep it that way, Erica.",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, President Biden has made clear that trying to find an end to this conflict in Gaza will be one ofthe key priorities he is facing heading into this final six months in office. And that is directly where he will turn his attention to today. He will host Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a meeting here at the White House, the first time the two men are meeting in person since Biden had traveled to Israel in the days after that October 7 attack by Hamas. And one key thing that they will be discussing in this conversation is the need to try to reach some type of agreement to end the conflict through a ceasefire and also return hostages back home to their families. President Biden has been quite optimistic about the prospects of negotiations resulting into a deal. Just a few days ago, he said that he does believe that they are on the verge of achieving one. But administration officials are also clear eyed heading into this meeting. Currently  senior administration officials say that they do not believe that Netanyahu is stalling or delaying a deal to end this conflict. But they did say if they do come to that conclusion, that they will ultimately make their views on that clear in the coming month. Now in addition to that one-on-one meeting Biden is set to have with Netanyahu, the two men together will be meeting with the families of the American hostages who are believed to be held in Gaza. There are currently five Americans believed to be alive and three others' families whose the remains of their loved ones are believed to be held in Gaza. So that will also be an important meeting this afternoon. Then the attention focuses to Netanyahu's meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris. For Harris, there are several key issues relating to this meeting, one watching how she will navigate Netanyahu and the conflict in Israel as she is now running for president. So far, she really has been, for the most part, in lockstep with President Biden in the administration's handling of this conflict. You have seen some differences in their language and the way that they talk about this conflict. For instance, back in March, she delivered a speech in Selma, Alabama, where she talked about the humanitarian impact that Palestinians are feeling on the ground there in Gaza as this war has endured now for quite some time. She will also have to advocate the angst within her own Democratic Party, something that President Biden was facing when he ran for president. There is still frustration among young voters, also Muslim American and Arab American voters, about the way that this administration has had handled this conflict. But it it'll be interesting to see how exactly Harris will chart her own course when it pertains to Netanyahu and to this conflict between Israel and Hamas as President Biden has insisted that he would love to find some type of end to this conflict before he leaves office.",

Although he made some references to efforts to bring the hostages home, most of his speech was really focused on Israel's ongoing military operations within Gaza. And he also downplayed the country's role in the humanitarian crisis there. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem; Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Well, it's certainly quite different than what we saw inside the Congress yesterday as the Israeliprime minister was giving that speech. And I think I can best distill it but by focusing on one line that the Israeli prime minister delivered, which was he said that, \"I will not rest until all their loved ones are home,\" referring to the hostages. And in that very chamber, the Israeli prime minister got a standing ovation from the mostly Republican audience that he was speaking to. The people who didn't stand up and applaud during that moment were the families of the hostages who were in attendance. And that's because so many of the families of these hostages feel like the Israeli prime minister is stalling. They feel like he is talking about bringing back hostages when he is actually the one who holds the keys to a potential agreement. And if you look at the overall content of the speech delivered by the Israeli prime minister last night, it was very clear that, while he did give a nod to a former hostage, Noa Argamani, who was in the audience, he did talk about bringing the hostages home. Overwhelmingly the tone of his speech, which came perhaps on the brink of what could be a potential ceasefire agreement, was overly -- overtly focusing on the notion of continuing to fight in Gaza until victory rather than preparing to reach a ceasefire agreement. There's no question that the Israeli prime minister got quite a bit of praise from his right-wing allies for the speech because of that very reason. But in Israel, the irony of this is that a lot of these lawmakers were standing up and applauding because they want to be viewed as pro Israel. But the irony is that if he gave that very same speech in Israel, it's very likely that you would have far fewer standing ovations and far less of the crowd actually standing up to applaud the prime minister. And that's because of the frustration. Not only do about 70 percent of Israelis think that Netanyahu should step down as prime minister but they are also frustrated because they feel like there is a deal that could be reached now. And for one reason or another, the Israeli prime minister has not yet taken that step. Now we do know that the Israeli prime minister is set to send his delegation to meet with the mediators once again. He wanted to wait until after his meeting with President Biden in order to do so. But we also know that that response I'm told is expected to include several of the Israeli prime minister's 11th hour demands that were not in the original framework that has been the basis for this agreement. And so it's a big, big open question as to whether or not Hamas will agree to those terms. But we could very much find out in the next week or so whether or not there was actually a ceasefire agreement that can be brokered -- Erica.",

She had that notable address in Selma, where she talked about the dire conditions in Gaza. So those are the types of issues that we expect her to address with the Israeli prime minister. But this does bookend a week where she has had a momentous start to this campaign, where they're trying to keep that momentum while also working on fine-tuning her own policies so that she is -- that there isn't a foot (ph) of daylight with the president.

But there are still questions being raised and criticism coming out from Muslim faith groups about this and questions as to whether or not there was a racial element to this police response. As of yet, we don't have any further information on that, Erica.",

Typhoon Gaemi in -- is making -- has made landfall now in Mainland China, this of course, after leaving a path of destruction in the Philippines and Taiwan.

In Manila, the capital, we've seen rescue teams at work in small boats in the street. We've seen families rescued with children wrapped in towels or ponchos. Video and images show people wading through chest-deep water. Some people are even clinging precariously to overhead power lines. Businesses are closed. School is not in session and flights have been canceled. One city in the north of Manila saw the evacuation of more than 55,000 people, including 16,000 families sheltering in evacuation centers. This according to a post by the government on the social media platform X. We should point out the typhoon itself didn't make landfall; rather the destruction is from its powerful outer bands. Taiwan also hit hard. What's interesting there, the mountains serve to deflect and recurve the storm. As a result, the East Coast saw more impact than expected with powerful storm surge, extreme winds and heavy rain. And here in China, any rain is of concern as we've seen a summer of intense flooding -- Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (WEATHER REPORT)",
