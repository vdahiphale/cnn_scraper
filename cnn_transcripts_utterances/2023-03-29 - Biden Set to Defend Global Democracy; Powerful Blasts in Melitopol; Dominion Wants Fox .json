A bit earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the summit, where he talked about those disagreements that have existed between the U.S. and Israel, but also said that he did not appear to be backing down from pursuing these judicial reforms, simply saying that he hopes that there is a way to strike a balance amidst all of the concerns playing out in Israel at this moment.This all comes as just yesterday President Biden revealed deep concern and expressed his own criticism of this proposal saying that he does not want Israel to go down this path, that he hopes the Israeli prime minister will walk away from pursuing these judicial reforms. It really reflects a very rare moment where the U.S. is weighing in on another country's domestic affairs, but especially when it comes to a key ally like Israel. So much of these conversations, so much of expressing concern about these reforms had been done behind the scenes until President Biden brought his own viewpoint out into the open just yesterday. [09:35:04] Now, the president is expected to speak in the coming hours at this democracy summit, a gathering of about 120 world leaders, where the administration is hoping they can put the strength of democracies on display. Of course, that has been a centerpiece of President Biden's foreign policy in his first two years in office, trying to argue that democracies need to remain strong at this time. So, in just a short while, we will hear from the president as this democracy summit plays out over the next two days.",

This happened Monday in Juarez, Mexico, near the El Paso border crossing. And we do want to warn you, this video is disturbing.CNN's Ed Lavandera has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This dramatic video captured what appears to be the beginning of the fire that spread through this Mexican migrant detention facility in Juarez late Monday night. You can see flames and smoke filling the detention area in a matter of seconds, migrants scrambling for their lives and several Mexican immigration officers walking away from the area while migrants were left locked in the cells. Eventually, thick smoke fills the area, making it impossible to see anything else. Outside, witnesses described hearing migrants screaming for help as fire spread through the detention center. Rescue workers responded, pulling people from the smoke and flames. This woman says there was smoke everywhere. Everyone was running for their lives. But all the men were left locked inside and the door to let them out was never open. At least 40 people died, 29 others were injured in the blaze. Mexico's president says the migrants started the fire when they found out they were being deported. The president says they protested by setting fire to mattresses inside the building where they were being detained. The video from inside the detention center doesn't clearly show how or who started the fire, but several mattresses can be seen on the ground by the steel jail bars. Mexico's National Migration Institute and attorney general are investigating the cause of the fire as many questions remain.",
