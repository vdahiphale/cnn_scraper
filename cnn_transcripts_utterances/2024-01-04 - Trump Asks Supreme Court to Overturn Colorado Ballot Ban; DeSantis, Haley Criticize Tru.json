It's Thursday, January 4, just after 5Donald Trump is asking the justices to overturn a historic Colorado ruling. Two weeks ago, the State Supreme Court ordered Trump's name removed from the primary ballot under the 14th Amendment insurrectionist clause. And today, the U.S. Supreme Court faces mounting pressure to settle the question of whether Trump is eligible to run or hold public office after being accused of inciting the attacks on the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. And tonight, both Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley hold back to back town halls on CNN. We're just 11 days from the Iowa caucuses. Here's what they have been saying about the Republican frontrunner. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Chaos follows him. And we can't have a country in disarray and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He is basically making a mockery of this whole process by not showing up and answering people's questions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're saying that the 14th Amendment doesn't mention the office of the presidency and they're saying that Congress, not the states, should decide eligibility for the ballot.

You know, in many ways, the Supreme Court could really get involved in ways that we have not seen since Bush v. Gore.And, you know, this is going to be important for them to decide on and many constitutional experts, legal experts, expect the Supreme Court will decide to weigh in, in some way here. But, of course, the question is, whether they just decide kind of what some of these matters, whether this actually applies to presidency or whether they will start to weigh in on whether or not the former president engaged in insurrection.",

He consistently argues the system is rigged against him. And he makes it about his supporters. He tells them that it means the system is out to get you.And when I've talked to Democrats, a lot will privately acknowledge that they are nervous about him being stripped off of these ballots even though obviously many Democratic supporters feel strongly about him not appearing on ballots. They'll say, if he doesn't, it just plays in to his hand and allows him to make this argument and makes it harder to argue that they actually are able to win the general election, that they won it fair and square.

The way that they are not is on these questions of January 6. Why is that they are not doing that? I mean, you know, Nikki Haley is one of those people who kind of went back and forth on this right after January 6, she was critical of President Trump.And then she sort of changed her tune or at least stopped singing that one and really hasn't since the way that we see right wing media outlets, when they refer to think gentleman of heroes, they are not talking about the police officers, they are talking about people who showed up in the mob at the Capitol. This in many ways is an argument that certainly in a general election with swing voters is what you would an argument that you need to make, but not in the primary. Why?",

To your point, Nikki Haley has previously made some comments more directly condemning what happened on January 6 and the former president's role in that. Maybe she's not been as aggressive on that front as we've seen at other times.But it is clear that they see it as a vulnerability, especially with certain Republican voters, especially Republican primary voters, who tend to be those that are more devote to the party, there is a larger percentage of the supporters looking to the general election. And it is clear that they feel like they have to navigate this carefully and they don't want to be seen as overly critical of the former president who is still popular with the Republican base, as we see in these primary polls, where he has a significant lead, you know, while also making sure that they are not overly defensive of him as well. So I think this is just another example of them trying to walk that line.",

The U.S. said they were not involved in the blast yesterday. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now from Abu Dhabi. Paula, we've seen no claim of responsibility here.

For example, there was Hamas leader who was assassinated in southern Beirut just one day before. They have blamed from Hezbollah and Hamas' point of view Israel for this as well, although Israel has not commented. So it really just adds to a destabilization that we have seen so far, and also, of course, the fact that there was such a heavy death toll, Kasie.",

Always good to see you. What do you make of this shift in -- the killing of this Hamas leader? In some ways, it is a return of how Israel often does business in the region, but it could signal a shift away from the broader more -- less targeted I guess you could say conflict in Gaza.

The U.S. saying, you know, no reason to believe that Israel was involved. But it is part of the conversation. And it how it is interpreted on the ground I think.We just have to see, does it stoke tensions and lead to wider conflict. You've got to ask the question does Iran really want to go into conflict with Israel because it would mean going into conflict with the U.S. So is how it plays out, but certainly there is -- I mean, there are many different instances, they are getting wider. Are they linked? We can't say that in any way. There is not evidence for that. But it's how it's interpreted by people who may respond in some way. And then, you know, adds to tensions as Paula was saying and the concern is that it could blow up out of that even though there might not be any firm evidence to say who was responsible for what, and U.S. official telling us, of course, that the blast had the hallmarks of a terrorist attack. So it could be completely unlinked to what is happening elsewhere in the Middle East. HUNT:  Right, just a situation where they are kind of using it as an excuse. And, Max, I know we talked about this yesterday, but this targeted assassination of the Hamas leader in Beirut, which Israelis are not officially saying anything about that one way or the other, but of course Israeli -- former Israeli officials have been opening congratulating the security services on pulling that off. What is the use of that, kind of a targeted tactic tell you about how things may be shifting in the Israel Gaza war?",

That didn't suggest that they will end the war this Gaza, it is just a different type of war that will go on for months we're told by the Israeli government.You know, those troops currently coming back into Israel perhaps to be retrained, to regroup in some way, will they be redeployed to northern Israel and the border with Lebanon. We'll have to wait to see there. Certainly, it wouldn't have done anything to calm tensions with Hezbollah. Will Hezbollah respond by increasing its attacks on northern Israel. We'll wait to see about that as well. Israel has more forces up there, it increases tensions. So this is what America -- the wider region is obviously concerned about, all of this spilling outside Israel and Gaza. And that's why the U.S. has got forces there as well to prevent that from happening. So if it escalates, it does inevitably draw the U.S. into it.",

It has dumped over a foot of now in California. That's for the higher elevations. And you can see that it will progress across the Four Corners region like mention, and that's going to bring accumulating snowfall to many of the ski resorts. Good news for them.Right here, you can see kind of the moisture settling in. But tracking the storm, what it's going to do? It's going to do move across the Gulf Coast, pick up moisture there and then eject off the east coast. Where it goes? That is the most important factor in determining who gets rain and who gets snow. We know how these games or these winter storms are a game of miles. And while the track is everything when it comes to the I-90 corridor where the majority of our population lives in the U.S. So what you are looking at is a comparison between the American GFS model and the European, we call that the euro model, and the American model is significantly weaker storm ejecting a little further south off the East Coast and that is going to bring the bulk of the precipitation away from the coastline. But the European is a stronger model in terms of this particular storm and it is a little further towards the north. And what we're doing, we're honing in on that as being the main model to pay attention to. But there are caveats here because the winds, we do believe will be coming off an easterly direction. So that's going to help warm the East Coast cities and that maybe means a rain/snow mix for New York, down to Philly, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., keeping snowfall totals down. But the snow will certainly fall the further inland you get. And so, we still have the chance there to beat the snow drought, but it's just not set in stone yet for those big cities.",
