A bomb blast rips through a political convention in Pakistan. Police say it was a suicide bomber. So far, as many as 40 people are dead and more than 100 injured.Joining us right now on the phone is CNN's Sophia Saifi in Islamabad. Sophia, what do we know?",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, we know that this attack took place during a convention of the JUIF, which is an Islamist party in Pakistan. It happened in the north of Pakistan, quite close to the Afghan border, actually. And this isn't something that has had a claim of responsibility yet. The police have told us that this was a suicide attack, that the suicide bomber had about 10 kilograms of explosives on him and he went quite close to the stage where he detonated his explosives.We do know that the death toll is now up to 44. The number of injured is about 123, with more than 17 people in critical condition. So, yes, it happened a couple of hours ago in the late afternoon here in Pakistan. It is leading up to election season. We're expecting general elections to take place in Pakistan towards the end of October. So there is this sense of high security when it comes to political conventions in the country. These are political party workers who are gathered in this area of the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. There has been an increase in militancy in the north of the country. There were about 80 people who died in the city of Peshawar back in January. There was an attack, similarly on the police back in February in the city of Karachi. The Pakistani government has often blamed the Afghan Taliban next door, enabling Afghanistan for being behind, for harboring these militants. We still don't have a claim of responsibility, so there is a heightened sense of security across the country and a sense of unease as to what was behind and who was behind this attack. Fredricka?",

There is, of course, a very important visit. By the Chinese vice premier to Pakistan. And there was already a public holiday that was announced in the capital city of Islamabad for Monday.

We know that U.S. authorities are aware of the abductions, of course, and they're working with Haitian authorities and U.S. intergovernmental agencies to try to get this resolved. But this happened on Thursday morning on the campus of El Roi. This is a Christian humanitarian group. The campus is near Port-au-Prince. This mother, Alix Dorsainvil, and her child taken from that location.We have a statement from El Roi. That is the community she worked for. \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering, as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" That's the statement from El Roi. This is a woman who was originally from New Hampshire, and, as you said, she moved to Haiti on the invitation of her husband to work for this organization. The U.S. State Department put out a statement saying, the U.S. Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. Citizens overseas. But, Fredricka, it's important to note the context of all of this. This kidnapping comes at a time when there has already been growing concerns about the deteriorating security situation in Haiti, gang violence, instability. Just last week, on Thursday, non-emergency personnel were ordered to depart the country. That was an order by the U.S. State Department saying you must leave immediately because of the deteriorating situation. Even before that announcement, people who were living and working in that embassy had to live, work, travel under severe restrictions because of concerns about security there. We know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been working and talking about this and saying that there has been a push to put in place an international or multinational force to try to help bring stability to Haiti. But this kidnapping comes really at a very scary, dangerous time there. Fred.",

Right now, behind the scenes, American personnel are at a lower level of presence on the ground in Haiti. So that's a bit of a hindrance. But there are contacts directly with the security services in Haiti.And so what's happening right now is that the State Department, through its bureau that handles international law as well as the Justice Department and others who have been engaged for many years in dealing with these kinds of scenarios, they're reaching out to their Haitian counterparts. Remember, about a year ago, we had roughly 20 missionaries kidnapped as well. And at that time, the Justice Department, the FBI got involved through diplomatic contacts, through the State Department orchestrating that, but to try to work with their counterparts in the security services in Haiti to find the missing Americans.

And that's a very delicate process.A year ago, it took some time, and then contact was made. Oftentimes these kinds of situations are ones where there's a ransom requested or required. A year ago, again, those detained, the missionaries, they escaped, they broke free. So that was a different scenario, roughly 20 people. But they're going to have to make contact and then start to engage and figure out exactly what happened. You know, chaos has been happening in Haitian politics as well. It's worth noting, a couple of years ago, the assassination of the President, that was organized in Florida by Haitian American. And so there's a state of real internal turmoil. So finding our allies there, the people with whom we work, the security services, and ensuring that they are getting the right information, that's the critical first step as it then gets into the State Department and the other agencies who work on this and how to address it.",

And when one goes overseas, they are inherently choosing to put themselves in communities that may have different modes of communication, different engagements.And in this case, the organizations, they have to be in touch with the State Department, they have to be in touch with the embassy. It's certain that they have that level of contact, but in many ways, that's as far as it goes. And then as more information comes out about the individuals and if they are kidnapped and where they are, then that will get elevated organizationally. But for now, it's trying to share what they can gather from their own sources as well. And it's quite likely they have a lot of contacts on the ground in communities who are able to help them as well understand what's happened. And then they should share that with the authorities, with the Haitian authorities, and with the State Department, so those officials can build out a better picture about the actual scenario of what's taken place.",

The same word. And it is skyscrapers. It's the business center. It's kind of like Putin's capitalist Wall Street for Putin's, so-called capitalism. And so hitting that is in line with what's been happening by the Ukrainian attacks, which is hitting places that are symbolic, that go to the heart of the system that Putin has and even remember. They hit the Kremlin, they hit some areas outside of Moscow where the rich people live, the elites. And this is all on purpose.

It took them about two hours to actually locate him. And they found them in San Jose, California, so nearby but in another city. And he was immediately arrested. Police say they do know each other.

Look, we've had contestant primaries with sitting presidents. You've never seen a sitting president half as weak a field of potential opponents, Marianne Williamson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he has now.

But that certainly may not stop some people from entering that primary. As you mentioned, Congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota has been quite vocal about the fact that he doesn't believe that President Biden should run for reelection in part due to his age. He's now toying around with the idea of possibly entering the race as a challenger to the president.Now, it's unclear whether Phillips actually take any of those steps to try and formally get into the race. But it does come as you take a look at the polls, where President Biden is vastly ahead of those that are currently challenging him in the field, like Robert F. Kennedy, and Marianne Williamson. And something that the president also has is the full backing of the Democratic National Committee. The committee and his campaign are working hand in hand in all of their efforts when it comes to advertisements, fundraising as well. And so far, we haven't seen any inkling or suggestion that there would be any Democratic primary debates. Now, this all comes though as there've been questions about the enthusiasm that President Biden will have in this race. When he entered the race it was only about half the Democrats who said that they did want him to run for reelection. The president and his team believe that he has an argument to make, believe as a case make especially as they've been pushing these Bidenomics messaging in recent wakes. They believe that the progress that's been made in the administration will ultimately counter some of the factions that people might have for instance about the president's age. So, we'll closely watching whether there are any challengers who might enter into the race. But the Biden team ultimately believes that they will win that primary, and then they have to face off in that general election against a Republican candidate. And there have been polls that have shown that there is some pessimism amongst Americans overall about the president's time in office, about his handling on issues including the economy. And so, these are headwinds of the president will be facing as he heads into 2024.",

It's nearly 90 degrees out here in Atlanta.The city of Atlanta, and other major cities across the U.S. have opened up cooling centers to blast AC, hand out water to help people beat the heat. Right now, I'm standing at the belt line. We know well in Atlanta. It's a 22-mile walkable, bike-able, scootering trail. And this is where folks congregate in Atlanta. We're seeing that despite the heat, folks are out here getting their steps in. And whether you're on the belt line, whether you're in Atlanta, or somewhere else, a good rule of thumb here to follow is to stay indoors during peak hours where the heat is the hottest. That's between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. I also want to show you something else. I borrow this infrared thermometer for my producer Chris Hue (ph). He uses to bake pizza. But right now, we're going to see how hot the pavement is baking up. Let's get down a bit here, I'm going to get a rating. So, it's 90 degrees outside. But this pavement is nearly 120 degrees. That's he blasting right back at you. And for folks walking their dogs, obviously, it's painful for their paws. So, probably a good idea to be careful of what time you are going outside. We spoke to several people here on the belt line as to how they're handling the heat, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This heat's not much for me, clearly, long sleeves in the summer like this. I will say for dogs and stuff we have, she's got booties, she got her water, and everything like that.

That streak is expected to end on Monday. And quick here, Fred, along with the good news, some bad news there is another heat wave coming according to the Weather Prediction Center. That's expected to be here early next week across the south and the gulf coast. Temperatures reaching as high as 150 degrees, Fred. So, we're not over.",
