In it, Erica Herman claims that the pair had an oral agreement that allowed her to live in a home that was owned by the trust for five more years with all expenses paid. She says that Woods broke that agreement and locked her out of the home and she's suing for more than $30 million. Woods was served with a second complaint on Monday, we are told, and in it Herman is trying to free herself from a non-disclosure agreement that she signed back in 2017. She's citing the Speak Out Act that became law in December '22 -- December 2022. That's the federal law that prohibits the enforceability of an NDA if cases of sexual assault or sexual harassment arise after someone has signed it. [07:35:07] So for more on this fascinating conversation I want to bring in Jeff Benedict who is the co-author of the biography \"Tiger Woods.\" And civil rights attorney and advocate Nancy Erika Smith who is best known for settling Gretchen Carlson's sexual harassment suit against Fox News and Roger Ailes.

And I think Tiger is someone who has transcended athletics for so long he's a worldwide figure. He's one of the most recognizable people on the planet and there's a level of sophistication around him that most athletes never get near. And I think that's part of what you're seeing here is that it's the wealth, the fame, the fortune that he's had not for a little while but for a long while, since he was really -- since he was a teenager.

And he's dragged her into arbitration, which is always secret.NDAs are what allowed Harvey Weinstein to abuse women for 30 years. NDAs allowed Roger Ailes to do it. They're usually used in an equal power relationship where somebody with power says to somebody without power your own life experience is now my property now. And the Speak Out Act was passed because it has allowed perpetrators of sexual harassment and sexual abuse to continue to have victim after victim after victim. So that's why the Speak Out Act passed. Unfortunately, it only applies to pre-dispute signing of an NDA which, in fact, she did in this case. Ms. Herman worked in his restaurant.",

He's one of the most recognizable people on the planet.So we quickly realized, like, right down to the housekeeper or the person who comes over to walk his and Elin's dogs is signing an NDA. It's partly because he's got sophisticated lawyers around him. Agents that most people don't have. They're the ones who produce these documents and ask people to sign them. It is a little bit different than Harvey Weinstein's situation where women are being asked to sign NDAs on the back end after a bad thing has happened and they enter into a settlement. Most of the time, in this case -- in Tiger's case, people are signing NDAs when they meet him or when they go into business with him, or they enter some kind of relationship with him. That's what happened here. I'm not saying it's a good or bad thing but it's a little different.
