      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Israel's parliament passed the firstpart of the government's sweeping judicial overhaul package into law. We are live on the streets of Jerusalem for you. Then out of control. Wildfires in Greece forced thousands to evacuate. We'll speak to a tourist stranded on the Island of Rhodes. Plus, the Kremlin continues its relentless attack on the city of Odesa. We go inside a cathedral Ukraine says was nearly destroyed by Russian missiles. But first this evening, protesters in Israel say they will not give up, vowing to only intensify the mass resistance after the first part of the government sweeping judicial overhaul package was voted into law today. Thousands of demonstrations, of demonstrators have been out on the streets, warning that Israel is becoming, quote, \"a dictatorship\". The bill removes a significant check on government power, weakening the Supreme Court's oversight of executive as well as legislative actions. Parliament passed the measure unanimously, but only because all opposition lawmakers walked out, as you can see there. Some of them shouting, shame. Israel's defense minister was among those voting in favor, despite threats from thousands of military reservists to stop volunteering for service if the bill is passed. And the vote happened just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu return to Knesset after having a pacemaker implanted. He addressed the nation just a short time ago, in the last 30 minutes or so, defending the overhaul as necessary for democracy and extending his hand to the opposition. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (voice-over):Today, we performed democratic need. We put a correction to the reasonableness clause. According to most people of Israel, this is the essence of democracy, to do what the majority wish. The coalition acted in any way to reach agreements with the opposition, and it's not taken for granted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you can imagine, the protesters here also have some pretty harsh words for Benjamin Netanyahu. I want to take you through the crowd that we're seeing here outside the Supreme Court. As you can see, they are still here in force, and they are still very loud. And they are also saying that they are going to remain here in the streets until what has happened today in Israeli parliament, in the Knesset is repealed. Now, one of the things that I've been asking people is whether or not they actually feel confident that they can change things. Because Benjamin Netanyahu obviously came out today and said, look, essentially, this is the will of the majority of the people. What he has pushed through today through the Israeli parliament. But a lot of them say that they are still very hopeful, and a lot of people that we speak to also say that they believe that this is really a historic moment for this nation and certainly for the democracy of this nation. And one of the interesting things that we've been seeing as we've been looking through the crowd is there's a lot of parents who are coming with their children. And there are parents who have been coming up to us and saying, look, my son or daughter has served in the military or will serve in the military. And of course, one of the things that has been so controversial is those reservists here, who are now saying that they are going to refuse to serve. Of course, the unity of the military is so important here for this country. And it's really one of the reasons also that people are coming out here and are saying that they need to make their voices heard. And certainly, from what we can see here from the folks that we're seeing, the folks that we've been speaking to, they say that they are nowhere near backing down. In fact, maybe we look down the street here, you can still see that there are still a lot of people who are coming and going, most people coming here. There was a bit of commotion because Hadas was talking about how there is obviously the danger of possible confrontations. There were a few police officers, also some horseback mounted police that tried to go through here. They were immediately received with a lot of boos and a lot of whistles. So, you can see, this is a very peaceful protest, I do have to say, but you can see, obviously, people here on the streets, very angry, vowing to stay out here and vowing to also, of course, block places like this one as the night continues and through the next couple of days as well.

Those words from the Greek Prime Minister earlier as his country battles major wildfires that have broken out on new fronts. This video shows one of the worst places happening on the island of Rhodes. The fire service said the situation is out of control. And this year is a devastating damage left behind as you can see there. Fires are burning right across the country as you can see on this map, stretching the Greek Fire Service to its limits, with temperatures set to rise again on Tuesday. Officials are scrambling to evacuate tens of thousands of tourists, and a number of airlines have already begun repatriation flights. CNN's Sam Kiley has this report now from the Greek Island of Leros. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's a regular visit of wildfire, and no one knows where or when it will strike. This is tourism in the 21st century. The latest maelstrom in southern Europe, Rhodes, an island of ancient ruins facing a modern apocalypse. Intense heat waves have turned forests into desiccated tinder yearning for a spark to roar into flames. And anything that fails to flee the inferno has little chance of survival. Greek authorities have evacuated tens of thousands from popular resorts at peak season. And the government says it's the largest such operation in the country's history.",

It's rare for theUkrainian side to claim responsibility for these kinds of brazen attacks. The Russian Defense Ministry says two drones were, quote, \"suppressed by electronic warfare means without causing injuries or serious damage.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had promised that Moscow would feel the retaliation for attacking the city of Odesa for several days. And as Ukraine vows to respond, it says Russian missiles have almost destroyed a historic cathedral in Odesa. Alex Marquardt shows us the damage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): President Zelenskyy had said that Russia would feel the retaliation for all the strikes that we've seen here in Odesa. And now, Ukraine's Defense Intelligence director claiming responsibility for that overnight drone strike in Moscow, which did do less damage, far less damage than we've seen here in Odesa for the past few days. We are in the Transfiguration Cathedral, church officials have asked us to put these helmets on because of all the work that's going on, all the debris that is falling from the roof. I want to show you this corner of the church, this is where there is the most destruction, this is where we are told, that the missile or rocket came plunging through the roof, going down at least two stories, that daylight, that sun coming through the roof and really brightening up this otherwise dark cathedral. Over here is the altar, you can see up there, those pillars now off to the side. That altar just leaning over, and really only staying upright because it's leaning up against the wall. And then, farther up, is the beautiful dome of this cathedral, all of its windows have been blown out. Below that, the frescoes have also been knocked down, we've seen large sections of the roof also coming down as these workers seek to clear it. They say that will take several weeks, but it could be months or years before this cathedral is fully repaired. The nave goes all the way back there, and in the corner, there was a fire. We're told that a shockwave started an electrical fire. Now, this church was destroyed in 1936 when Stalin was in power. It was rebuilt when Ukraine got independence, and now, of course, in a significant state of disrepair. It is attacks like these, on civilian infrastructure, on buildings that, frankly, have nothing to do with this conflict, that now has President Zelenskyy calling for more air defense support from western allies, for what he calls a full-fledged air shield for Ukraine.

They say this is not democracy in action. They feel that they're being marginalized. They say that they believe the Supreme Court of this country has a vital and important role in checking the power of those who are in power here in this country.

They're obviously trying to go forward and clear out the square right now. With a couple of dozen police officers, you can see how that goes, apparently trying to peep people up who have sat down on the streets and clear them away. But the protesters here have been pretty vocal about the fact that they want to stay around and right now, as you can see, they are screaming back at the police officers who are sort of trying to move in. Not a very large police force as you can see, also the cops not wearing riot gear, but certainly trying to get the protesters to move. Some of them, we can see right now pretty good in our shot right here, that some of them have actually rocked arms trying to prevent the police officers from carrying them away. They're obviously civil disobedience trying to lock on, trying to stop the cops from clearing this place out. We can see the police officers already trying to get people to move, trying to pick people up. Again, Isa, in the last sort of 40 minutes since we spoke at the top of your show, the situation certainly here has escalated considerably as now the police are moving in in force to try and get the protesters to disperse again the protesters saying they are going to have none of. You can see some scuffles are breaking out over there. I saw some pushing and shoving going on between the cops and between some of the protesters. A lot of anger here on the streets after what happened in the Knesset today. Among the folks, as you can see here, a lot of them saying that they believe that this is something that is detrimental to Israeli democracy, also of course detrimental to Israel's relations with the United States as well. Of course, the U.S. by far, Israel's most important ally, and there has already been criticism coming from the White House after the decisions that were made in the Knesset today, calling it unfortunate.

Definitely very difficult situation for him and that'sdefinitely also one of the reasons why he came out tonight and decided to address the nation, to do this address to the nation because he understands that there is so much anger on the streets here. Of course, he tried to justify himself. He tried to justify the decisions that his government has made, certainly this flurry again of laws for a judicial overhaul to get through. But as we can see here, a lot of people here aren't having it. And you're absolutely right, there are businesses who say that they are going on strike. There are people, there are organizations who are saying that they are going to on strike. The medical organizations say that they want to do a work stop. So, certainly, this is slowly ballooning into a big problem, not just for Benjamin Netanyahu, but for Israel as a state. And you can see this right now here all the streets of Jerusalem that some of these people who have been sitting down currently being dragged away by the police officers, just sitting there having a lot of trouble doing that. People obviously trying to defend themselves, trying to make sure that the cops can't pull them away. But certainly, some pretty ugly scenes. And I think you're absolutely right to point out that this is having a big ripple effect throughout Israeli business. We saw the stock market today here in Israel essentially tank, go down by a great deal. This confidence is obviously down. Someone's obviously right in front of us seems to have been injured here tended to by a police officer. But again, a big ripple effect on Israeli businesses on the society on a lot of societal organizations. And, of course, we also know, Isa, that there have already been challenges, or already an official challenge to this law to try and get the constitution, to get the supreme court itself to declare this law to be illegal. And so, this is something that we can see that many, many people here on the streets in society, but also in politics trying to prevent this, Isa.",

Fred, we'll give you a couple of minutes to regroup, but we'll come back to you in the next few minutes. But I want to get more exactly what the scenes we have been seeing in Israel in Jerusalem early with sworn Tel Aviv as well. Our next guest says Mr. Netanyahu has thrown Israel into crisis because of his \"obsession\" with his own political survival. Aaron David Miller served in the State Department as a Middle East negotiator. He's now a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Aaron, great to have you on the show. I'm not sure whether you were able to hear our Fred Pleitgen for us there in Jerusalem, situation in the ground escalating very quickly with these protesters. But this is, of course, only the first part of the government's package to kind of weaken the power of the courts. Just explain why this bill is such a dangerous shift for Israel.",

In one hand, I'd work for Republican Democratic administrations.American presidents don't like to fight and they have open breaches with Israeli prime ministers. It's annoying, it's distracting, it's messy, it's politically problematic. I think Mr. Biden is trying to find a way to navigate a line between embracing the prime minister. You saw the point counterpoint with president Herzog's visit to Washington and the fact that the prime minister got an open invitation, no date, no venue. On one hand, he's not going to embrace it, but on the other hand, he has no desire, it seems to me, to impose any cost or consequences. Not just on the issue of Israeli internal politics, but on what the Israeli government is doing in the West Bank, which is pursuing a set of annexationist policies in everything but name. So, again, I think it's going to be very difficult for Mr. Biden to continue to walk that line but I believe he will.",

These are the buoys that the U.S. and the state of Texas are now going to be apparently in a court battle over. The USDOJ is asking the state of Texas to remove these buoys and the state of Texas is digging in his heels, saying that it's not going to remove the buoys, that it's ready to take the United States to court. Now this is an international incident. The Rio Grande is the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. Mexico's top diplomat complained to Washington about these buoys because there are treaties that govern the flow of this water, the flow of this river, and Mexico is concerned that these buoys could be on Mexican soil. And they said that they're sending a team to verify that they're in fact in U.S. soil and not Mexican soil. But the latest, of course, is that the USDOJ gave the state of Texas a deadline today and the state of Texas decided to respond. Governor Greg Abbott responded with \"Mr. President, Texas is going to see you in court\" and so now that's what's next. We're waiting to see what that filing is going to look like, what the USDOJ is going to file against the state of Texas for the removal of these buoys. But, Isa, I have to leave you with this because this border battle is over something that is not even stopping illegal immigration. We've seen migrants cross this morning so there's a battle between the USDOJ in Texas over something that is not even effective to stop illegal immigration. Isa.",
