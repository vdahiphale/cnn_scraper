The Republican report blasts the Biden administration for pursuing the withdrawal no matter the cost. And it specifically tries to tie Vice President Kamala Harris to decisions made about the withdrawal.The report saying, in part, quote: the Biden-Harris administration misled and, in some instances, directly lied to the American people at every stage of the withdrawal from before the go-to-zero order until today.",

      "sentences": "Look, there are elements of truth of what actually happened in both of them. The fact is the debacle of the Afghan withdrawal started with policies under the Trump administration and then fell apart finally with Biden following through with the withdrawal. Nobody understood what Trump messaging to the Afghan security forces would do in terms of weakening their resolve and that what then happened under the Biden administration, Trump started shrinking the footprint.Then Biden started having a bunch of contractors, etc., pulling out such that the Afghan security forces were literally blinded. They lost their secure radios and had to communicate on cell phones that the Taliban could intercept. That's why so many of the Afghan troops started melting away, and no one anticipated there being no Afghan troops around Kabul to provide security while an orderly evacuation or departure was carried out. And that's, blame that on both sides.",

You need to do more. There's so much blame to go around, but it becomes this hot potato politically.",

They were quietly trying to lobby Trump not to withdraw and not to go so fast and saying the same things about Trump that they're now saying about Biden. Meanwhile, the Democrats were saying this, this withdrawal has to go faster.So, I mean, each side was surprised by what happened. And ultimately, the hard part is that many people in the world no longer trust the U.S. as an ally because of what they saw happen on the ground. And I hear that from European politicians, Asian politicians and diplomats, and just from ordinary people that I've talked to in the streets overseas. They're like, oh, how can we trust you, Afghanistan? It's the shorthand for the U.S. is a fickle ally.",

They have this area surrounded. We're talking about thousands of acres of terrain that they're focusing on right now.So no indication they know precisely where he is, but authorities just gave an update talking about some of the resources. They have resources in the air, including helicopters. They're using drones on the ground. They have teams, including canine units. There are officers that are literally slashing their way with machetes through this wooded area in order to try to find where this person is. But of course, there are two major challenges here. First, only the gunman knows how he wants this to actually end. Is this someone who is actually going to give up peacefully? Is this someone who wants to go out in some type of blaze of glory? We don't yet know. Obviously, law enforcement hopes that he will surrender, as they just indicated. But second, if you look at the original crime, this isn't someone who appeared to target someone specifically and then flee. This was indiscriminate firing upon a freeway, which is the softest of soft targets, if you think about it. What that means for law enforcement is this is someone who is clearly intent on causing mass loss of life. Could that include law enforcement officers who stumble upon him? They're waiting to see. But again, all hope is that this will actually end peacefully.",
