Yesterday, the chief of police said that investigators were still going through cell phone records. And they are no doubt still trying to learn more about what they're describing as an emotional disorder that the shooter was being treated for. \"The New York Times,\" this morning, is reporting that a college teacher at Nossi arts school, that's an art school here in Nashville, said that about six years ago the 28 year old was a student in her class. The teacher went on to describe essentially the 28-year-old as having had some sort of emotional breakdown in class. Now, part of the article reads, quote, Ms. Colomy, that's the college instructor, recalled that the student's difficult first day of class. It was the first - the student's first day at the college. And Ms. Colomy noticed that the student was beginning to cry in the front row. The student, Ms. Colomy said, was having difficulty creating a password for the online student portal. Now, the instructor goes on to tell \"The New York Times\" that in the time since the 28-year-old was a student in her classroom, the shooter apparently had posted on social media about grieving the death of a partner and that sometime after that had asked to be -- had asked to be identified rather with male pronouns.

Police did not want to confirm exactly whether she tried to stop the shooter. But they said that based on the location of Ms. Koonce's body, they do believe that some sort of encounter did take place as that shooting progress.We also know that 61-year-old Mike Hill, he is the custodian, we're told he was most likely the first one to die because he was at the front entrance of the building where the shooter first made entry. We're told he was inside of those two glass doors that were shot out. And they believe he was killed almost instantly.

We should also look for some of the things Congress is prepared to fund for states. And one of the big issues in this terrible shooting in Tennessee was the absence of red flag laws. There had been red flag laws proposed in the state legislature. They were -- they were knocked down. But that could have provided the kind of warning in this situation to prevent the shooter from being able to get a gun.

Again, the Safer Communities Act was a small step, but it was a meaningful step, especially in the area providing more funds for mental health and aimed at school students and others in the community.But without these other measures that President Biden, myself and others have called for, I fear that we're just going to - we're going to see this repeat itself over and over again. So, small steps hopefully can add up to bigger and faster steps, but it -- the public continue -- needs to really be engaged. You know, the student movement did help bring about some changes in the laws, both in Florida, after the terrible shootings in Parkland, and at the federal level. But we need folks not only to be outraged about what's happening, as we all should be, but really decide to make this a voting issue.",

They had provided certain directives to the bank. And then the question is, could they have taken more recourse earlier? But the reality is, we're still getting to the bottom of this. I hope there's going to be emerging, bipartisan consensus that at the very least we need to change our laws so that we can claw back any of the (INAUDIBLE) compensations, you know, from the chief executive officer, to top executives, that they -- where they cashed in just before the bank collapsed because of their own incompetence.

Thanks for being with us this morning. Sarah, let's start with you. We now know that Pence will be required to testify. This news is coming, as we noted, while he's in Iowa, not officially announced as a 2024 candidate just yet, but clearly his guys are looking -- are there and he is physically in Iowa, which tells us a lot. How critical will his testimony be? And what kind of an impact is this going to have on the 2024 race and how he might try to handle all of these issues at once? SARAH LONGWELL, PUBLISHER, \"THE BULWARK\": Yes, well, it would be very critical. And look, the reason that Mike Pence hasn't wanted to testify, and he's been fighting it so hard, is that he's under the impression that there is an appetite for Mike Pence to -- you know, a Mike Pence run in 2024. And he's wrong about that. You know, I talk to voters -- Trump voters, Republican voters every week in focus groups and there is very little appetite or interest in Mike Pence. In fact, he's kind of in the sour spot with voters where they either don't like him because they don't think he stood up for Donald Trump, or they think he was to sycophantic to Donald Trump. And so what Mike Pence, I think, really needs to do here is focused on what's best for the country, and that means going in, testifying, telling the truth and ultimately doing what he can to block Donald Trump from becoming president again in 2024.
