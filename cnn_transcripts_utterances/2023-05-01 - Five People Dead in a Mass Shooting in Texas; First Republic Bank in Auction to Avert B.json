The FDIC held an auction over the weekend trying to entice big banks to acquire this ailing regional bank, according to a person familiar with the matter.But we don't know yet the results of that action, nor which banks actually place bids to buy First Republic. Now, unlike Silicon Valley Bank, which imploded almost out of nowhere last month, First Republic Bank has been really teetering for weeks. Share prices down by 97 percent since early March, traded above $122 on March 1, now sitting below $4. And this is not some tiny community bank. It is the 12th largest commercial bank in the U.S. It was sitting on $233 billion of assets, as of the end of March. That means that, if the FDIC ends up seizing control of First Republic, this would be the second biggest bank failure in American history. Now, First Republic is based in San Francisco, it caters to wealthy clients. It has branches in Beverly Hills, and Palm Beach, Greenwich, Connecticut. It even has a branch right across the street from our offices here in Manhattan. The problem though is that two-thirds of its deposits were uninsured, as of the end of last year. And we know uninsured deposits, they fled banks after the Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month. First Republic says that 41 percent of its deposits left the bank in the first quarter alone. That translates to a staggering loss of $72 billion in deposits. And that's despite the influx -- the injection of $30 billion of deposits from big banks just last month. Now, the question is whether big banks are going to come to the rescue with an acquisition here, and whether U.S. officials can stop this banking crisis before it spreads elsewhere? Back to you.

The U.S. was among the first countries to evacuate its diplomats and their families out of Sudan. But it got a lot of criticism for essentially abandoning their citizens, that's how many private U.S. citizens in Sudan feels. But the argument from the State Department and the White House is that the U.S. doesn't typically evacuate its citizens out of situations where governments are collapsing. It did not do so in Yemen, in Syria, in or Libya, when those governments collapsed. And it made an exception in Afghanistan. But in this case of Sudan after criticism, after Western nations like the U.K., and Ireland, and Germany and France, even China, Japan, South Korea starting to evacuate those citizens, any African countries like Ghana, and Uganda, and Tanzania, the U.S. had to kind of walk back their statements and begin coordinating these people over ground to Port Sudan, and then into ships like this, and eventually back to the U.S., Rosemary.",

On the ground, the Ukrainians in Kyiv took shelter in the city's metro. Images showing people sleeping and others sitting while they wait for the \"All-Clear\", including some with small children. And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all the developments for us. She joins us now live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, Ukraine is set to launch its counteroffensive to Russia anytime now. What more are you learning about this, and how Moscow is preparing, as well as these latest strikes on Ukraine? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary. I think this round of pre-dawn attacks coming on top of Friday's barrage against Ukraine, which was the deadliest in months affecting civilians, shows that Russia is not an aggressor that respects battlefield frontlines. We continue to see this tactic of attrition against civilians. Ukrainian air defenses, which you see in action there will be heavily increased, thanks to western aid. They've now taken delivery of patriots, for example, still not enough. We still saw some missiles get through 25 injured in the Central Dnipropetrovsk region which is at least a hundred kilometers from the closest frontline there. So, you can see how Russia continuing to demonstrate while it's not making a huge amount of progress on those front lines, it still has the ability to inflict damage from the air. Now, Ukraine, as you say, says it is wrapping up preparations for its counteroffensive. For obvious reasons, it's not saying when or where that will start. It seems likely that it could be in the south. It's now taking delivery of a lot of the western tanks and army vehicles that have been promised so, preparing for that. Moscow, we know, we've seen satellite imagery that shows that it is fortifying those frontlines, its defensive positions, all the way to Crimea -- trenches, ditches, minefields, things like that. And all this coming as we're seeing more changes to its military command structure. Over the weekend, Moscow placing a deputy defense minister in-charge of logistics that's not exactly clear why, but that coming as we're seeing more criticism, more signs of in-fighting from the Head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin whose mercenaries remain active around Bakhmut saying that they are running so low on ammunition that they might even have to withdraw from that highly strategic city. All of that, not looking like a very cohesive front coming ahead of what may be a Ukrainian offensive. All of this, of course, making for a pivotal moment in this conflict. Rosemary.",

And in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, the Miami Heat rally for a 108 to 101, Game 1 victory over the Knicks in New York, and they will play Game 2 on Tuesday. Well, we are now just six days away from the coronation of King Charles III. The ceremony this Saturday will be Britain's first in seven decades. Of course, it will have all the pomp and pageantry that you would expect, as well as rituals dating back hundreds of years. But there will also be some notable differences compared to the coronation of his mother, Queen Elizabeth. CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster has a preview now from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Not since 1953 that we had a glimpse of this sacred moment, the crowning of a monarch. Queen Elizabeth, then just 27, thrust to the throne after her father's untimely death. Her coronation was designed to introduce the young queen to the world and give a morale boost to post-war Breton. Seventy years on, and amidst the cost of living crisis, King Charles' coronation will have many of the same traditions incorporated, albeit slightly toned down. Up to 2800 guests in Westminster Abby, CNN understands, versus the 8000 that gathered for the late Queen's.",

It's a sacred moment.FOSTER (voice-over): His wife, Camilla, will also be anointed and crowned. Charles' sons, William and Harry will be there, although Harry's wife, Meghan, will remain at home in California with their two young children. It remains to be seen what role Harry will play in proceedings now that he has stepped back from his senior role duties. Foster (on-camera): For many in Britain, the coronation is about more than just another public holiday. There will be street parties up and down the U.K., and thousands will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moment, to see for the first time newly- crowned King and Queen. Many more will line the streets for the coronation procession, just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago. The King and Queen will travel in this gilded carriage accompanied by a huge military procession. Night-time rehearsals spotted in the streets of London, as the capital gears up for a moment in history. Max Foster, CNN, London.",
