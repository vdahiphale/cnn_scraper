But the U.S. Justice Department has a much different view that puts the former president in serious legal jeopardy. They've indicted Trump on seven counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House. Trump attorney Jim Trussi says the charges fall under the Espionage Act and include conspiracy, obstruction of justice, destruction or falsification of records and false statements. Prosecutors previously claimed documents were likely concealed or removed from a Mar-a-Lago storage room as part of an effort to obstruct the FBI investigation. Trump says on social media he's been summoned to appear at the federal courthouse in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. Here he is.

Sources familiar with the indictment tell CNN.And this is really a stunning development in the classified documents case. It's the first time that a current or former president has faced federal charges. Now, Trump has been charged, we're told, with seven counts in the indictment, and one of those counts is a conspiracy charge, a source tells CNN. The special counsel has been investigating Donald Trump's handling of classified documents ever since some of these classified documents were found in his possession at his Mar-a-Lago Resort in Florida. Now, the former president wrote on Truth Social, Thursday evening that he's expected to appear at a federal courthouse in Miami at Tuesday at 3 pm. We also told that, you know, here at Bedminster, we're very nearby to where the president is, and he's huddling with some of his aides. He's feeling emboldened by this news. That is his first reaction to this. He's thinking that, you know, potentially this could have a political boost for his reelection campaign. But other advisors of his say that there are some concerns and reservations about how this could affect Donald Trump in the long term and affect his reelection campaign. Now, the special counsel, Jack Smith, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, seven months ago, to look into this case once they learned that there were still classified documents in Donald Trump's possession, but also once it was clear that Donald Trump was running for reelection again.

But they are creating a, I think, the unanimity of Republican leaders is creating a condition in which the message that's going out to Republican voters is that any concern about Trump's behavior, any sign of breaking from him is an act of disloyalty to the party. Even his other rivals in the '24 race are sending that basic message. And it makes it very hard, I think, for anyone in the party then to argue that they shouldn't nominate him, because I think many Republican voters will view picking anyone else as in essence giving in, surrendering to this weaponization of the Justice Department. Again, it's just another marker of the way in which they are lashing themselves to him preemptively before they know the facts and before they know what else may be coming from other indictments on other Investigations as well.",

I think it is going to be challenging for anyone near the center of the race to make the case that Trump is showing himself to be unfit, either to be the president, you know, on a moral ground or even that he could win a general election, given the chorus that's developing in the party. You probably saw that one prominent conservative tweeted tonight that all of the other Republicans should suspend their campaign and go down to Miami to demonstrate solidarity with Trump. I don't think they're gonna do that, but it shows you the environment in which they are operating, in which making the case to voters that they should move beyond Trump is somehow now seen as, you know, conceding to the Democrats, despite whatever doubts they may have about his ability to win a general election. And by the way, there is no there is no world in which this is beneficial to Trump in winning a general election. It may help him win a nomination, but the polling is very clear that outside the Republican Coalition, not surprisingly, multiple criminal indictments are not a calling card to assume executive power in the Oval Office.",

But 75 percent of independents said they wouldn't. 75 percent of people under 45. 75 percent of people of color and 81 percent of white college graduates said they would not want a second Trump term if he is convicted of a crime. And that is the conundrum that Republicans are in. You have to say that the way the party is reacting to this does in fact mean that it strengthens his ability to win the nomination.

So, there is debate in the scholarly legal community as to whether or not that would really bar any president from holding the office.We've had other presidents have tried it -- or candidates have tried it.

When I looked down, I noticed his feet swaying in the wind. HANCOCKS (voiceover): The police arrested the man in his 30's at Daegu airport after the plane landed safely. He told them that he felt suffocated and wanted to get off the plane quickly, adding he had been under a lot of stress after losing his job, according to police. LEE (through translator): From the moment he boarded the plane, he'd looked pale and gave off of a bad vibe. He appeared somewhat dark, constantly fidgeting, looking around at people, and acting strangely. HANCOCKS (voiceover): Asiana says it has stopped sealing certain emergency exit seats for safety reasons. An investigation is underway to find out how the door was able to be opened 700 feet on the ground. As soon as the wheels' down, Lee said the passenger appeared to try and jump from the fast-moving plane. LEE (through translator): I heard the sound of someone next to me undoing his seatbelt. I realized he was leaning towards the exit. The flight attendant then shouted asking for help so I just grabbed him. HANCOCKS (voiceover): Lee was helped by other passengers and flight attendants and is amused that he is being hailed as a hero. LEE (through translator): I'm enjoying it. I suddenly became a temporary celebrity. HANCOCKS (voiceover): Lee feels he's been given a second chance at life, and he is determined to enjoy it. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
