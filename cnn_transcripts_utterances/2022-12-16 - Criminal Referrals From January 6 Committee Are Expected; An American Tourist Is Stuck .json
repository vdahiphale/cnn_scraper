A source tells CNN that the committee is expected to ask the DOJ to pursue at least three criminal charges against former President Trump. They are conspiracy to defraud the federal government, obstruction of an official proceeding, and insurrection. So, we'll talk about what all of that means.Plus, tonight, American tourists are stranded in Machu Picchu because of violent protests breaking out across Peru. So, we are going to speak live to an American who is stuck there and has run out of her critical medication. She will tell us if there is a plan to get her out. And what does the term \"free speech\" mean to you? It has now become a weapon in a culture war. But what does it even mean? What does it mean online? What does it need on social media? Does Elon Musk get to decide, can we find some universal definition of it? Our super smart panel has some thoughts on all of that. But first, let's get to the new developments out of January 6 Committee. We have with us John Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. You have a long title there, John.",

So, there is that challenge that we wrestle with.The State Department does -- the consular affairs (ph) offices. Their interest is in protecting the safety, security, and the interest of the American citizens abroad. Now, there is interest typically about birth certificates, getting a passport, if you've been arrested. It is not a 22-year-old young man who seems of sound mind making decision to travel. Similar here in the United States, a missing person's report, police won't -- they don't necessarily share the same information unless they think there is something nefarious at stake.
