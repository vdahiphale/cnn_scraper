We understand that there is somewhere in excess of 280 Palestinian males under the age of 18, some of them as young as 14. Some of them are affiliated with the various factions of the Palestinians, Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Now, the remainder are women. But as I said, none of these people have been convicted of murder. So, they're basically teenagers who, many of them, have taken part in the sort of clashes that are ordinary for - ordinary - part of the ordinary daily life in the West Bank and also in east Jerusalem, both of which are under Israeli military occupation. And what you've had since 1967 is a low level uprising against that occupation. And it appears that most of the young men on this list are probably participants in this sort of thing. So, this - for the first -- it should be -- we understand it -- that the releases will begin tomorrow morning, Thursday morning, but as I said, the list is larger than is on the agreement because the Israelis are hoping that somehow this will be the beginning of a broader agreement from - the release of more of the captives in Gaza.",

Just walk us through how you see this playing out. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, good morning, Erica. There are going to be a lot of different factors here. But as Ben was pointing out, the fact that the Israelis have released more names than is actually called for in the agreement is actually a sign that these groups believes that there is perhaps a way forward in the negotiation - on the negotiation front. And if that happens, then we can perhaps see a longer pause in the fighting. Right now, you know, as the pictures from Gaza indicate, you know, this morning, we are seeing some fighting continuing. That fighting is really part of the positioning that occurs when these kinds of truce agreements go into effect because what each side is doing is they're moving themselves into positions of greater advantage or at least trying to do that. So you're seeing those movements, you're seeing that kind of activity on the part of both the Israelis and, to some extent, probably Hamas as well. Each side though is, I think, hoping for a bit of a breather in this particular case. And that breather is going to - they're going to try to take advantage of that breather as well.",

And the reason that becomes more likely with air defense improvements for Hezbollah, that will allow Hezbollah to act more or less with the impunity or with a greater degree of impunity against Israeli military installations and other Israeli targets. So, what I mean by that is this, if the air defenses are strengthened in -- for Hezbollah, they will be more likely to engage in activities and face less risk of being attacked by Israeli air assets.

      "sentences": "Well, four CEOs in four days. It's been the most surprising turn of events really, though I would say this morning perhaps the least surprising development of it all, that Sam Altman is now back as CEO. And that's because nearly the entire workforce of OpenAI had signed an open letter to the board saying if they didn't reinstate Sam Altman, they would move to Microsoft, where he had been given a new job, and that will leave really no OpenAI left.Now, we've had a tweet from Greg Brockman, who was also fired at the end of last week with Sam Altman. He's another co-founder. And I think you'll appreciate the photo that he has posted on X, saying, \"we are back.\" And you can see a crowd there of employees clearly very happy with the result they have. But Altman's going to return as CEO but not quite to the same OpenAI as we know it in a sense because the board, of course, had to change. One of the biggest changes is two board members have gone. One who actually oversaw his firing, Adam D'Angelo, will remain on there, which I think is quite interesting. One of the replacements is former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers as well. Who else is on the board? That remains to be seen. So, we're still waiting for that. What is very interesting is what all of this means, both for Sam Altman but also for Microsoft. As you mentioned there, one of the biggest investors in OpenAI offered Sam Altman and Greg Brockman a job, that was only yesterday, or Monday, I think, and also offered 700 plus employee as job if they wanted to leave OpenAI. This has strengthened that partnership at this stage and I think it's highly likely that Microsoft will have some sort of governance position at OpenAI. Whether that's a seat on the board, we'll have to wait and see. Guys.",
