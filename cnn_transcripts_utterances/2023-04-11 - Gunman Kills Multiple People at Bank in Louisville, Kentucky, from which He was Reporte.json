Law enforcement sources also telling CNN the gunman had recently been notified he was going to be fired from that bank. And then he left a note for his parents and a friend indicating he was going to open fire, what he was going to do.Then a heavily armed SWAT team served a search warrant at the shooter's home. Here is the video of the moment that they entered the house with their guns drawn. The interim police chief told us that she hopes that the items they recovered inside will help them learn more about the motive behind this shooting. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus is live in Louisville.

One thing we know, that shooter killed five of his colleagues here at this bank in downtown Louisville. Among the five deceased, the youngest was a 40-year-old father of two and the oldest was a 64-year-old.A source close to this investigation tells us the gunmen left a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he planned to carry out a shooting at the workplace. Now, it's unclear when or where that note was discovered. We do know the shooter, who was 25, started as an intern before becoming a full-time employee. As you mentioned, this shooter got information that he was going to be terminated. That could possibly help paint a clearer picture. But one thing that is clear, members of law enforcement responded within three minutes of that first 911 call. And when the interim chief addressed the officers, she thanked them for showing up. And she also said to them, and I'm paraphrasing here, if we don't do it, who will?

It's important to note that this didn't ask respondents, what do you think of gun control? It asked, how are guns impacting your lives now?Let's take a look at some of the data here and some of the overwhelming findings. You can see that over half of those who were surveyed said that they have been impacted by a gun related incident, either themselves personally or a family member. One in five, 20 percent of Americans surveyed, had a family member who was killed by a gun either by homicide, suicide, or accidentally. And that is as we get into the mindset of people in this country, 84 percent have actually taken at least one precaution to protect themselves or their families from gun violence. And as we look at communities of color and its impact, it's even more unsettling as you look at this survey data -- 31 percent of black adults and 22 percent of Hispanic adults have actually witnessed someone being shot, 34 percent of black adults have had family members killed by a gun. That number, Don, is twice of that of the white Americans who were surveyed. And again, getting into the psyche, the mindset of the public, one in five of black and Hispanic adults in America say that they live in fear of gun violence as a, quote, constant threat, just truly, truly unsettling figures in this new study, Don.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that, to the extent it's allowed by law, the physicians talk to their patients, talk to parents of their patients about gun safety, how guns are stored. And you can see from this new Kaiser Family study why that's so important. Take a look at this figure. A whopping 75 percent of gun owners who were surveyed said that they don't store their guns safely, that their storage practices actually run counter to common gun safety practices, such as keeping your firearm locked, keeping it unloaded.And I talked to one physician who said that every pediatrician that he knows has treated a firearm related injury, which is why it's so important that parents take gun safety very seriously. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SCOTT HADLAND, CHIEF OF ADOLESCENT MEDICINE, MASS GENERAL FOR CHILDREN:  Guns are the leading cause of death in children and adolescents in the United States. About a third of children in the U.S. live in a household that has a gun, so it's really important that pediatricians talk to families and make sure that they're storing their guns safely, having it kept safely locked away with the ammunition stored separately because in an instant a child can get ahold of a gun and have a life-threatening injury or lose their life altogether.

One of the things it does is put a waiting period on every under 21 buyer in this country, so that you can't have a situation like we had Uvalde, where a young person in crisis goes to a gun store, buys a gun, and uses it days later. That makes this country safer.But it also suggests that we have seen a paradigm shift in this country, that now Republicans see the anti-gun violence movement as being more powerful than the gun lobby.

And I think, to be more serious about things, while certainly, the Irish portion of this trip going to Ireland, going to County Louth, going to County Mayo. The deep familial connections, which the White House has produced a document that's about eight or nine pages long, that lays out just how many ways the President and his family is connected to Ireland.His first stop here in Northern Ireland is critical. It comes to the day after the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that unquestionably underscored the importance of us engagement, and diplomacy and peace talks. Unquestionably has led to a level of stability and peace that did not exist in the decades prior. And yet, still underscores, as you noted at the top and with those pictures you were seeing to what was happening in Derry, that there is still so much work to be done.

Because of that agreement, there's so much work to be done work that the U.S. can certainly help on the economic front.
