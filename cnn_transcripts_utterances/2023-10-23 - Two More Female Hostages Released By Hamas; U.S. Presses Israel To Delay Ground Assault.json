What does it mean for the other hostages and for Israel's potential ground assault? I'll talk two people who have reported extensively on Hamas's tactics, along with the niece of one of the hostages just freed hours ago.Plus, our dispatches from Gaza tonight. We'll hear from a doctor rushing for cover, as he was taping a message for OUTFRONT. The sound of strikes nearby deafening. And we'll speak to a woman -- a woman who miraculously escaped the music festival, only to take being taken hostage by Hamas. Have a gun put her head. You'll hear her incredible story of survival.

Two Israeli hostages are now making their way to a medical center in Israel, in Tel Aviv, after being held by Hamas for over two weeks. They are 79- year-old Nurit Cooper, and 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz. Both were taken from their homes in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nir Oz which is, of course, just near the Gaza border. Now both of their husbands were kidnapped with them, they were not released with their wives tonight. We do have some video of Lifshitz making her way to an ambulance. Her daughter releasing a statement that reads in part: Well, I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father. We also have new video of Cooper in a stretcher being treated by medics. Her husband, as I said is still being held by Hamas. And that is the reality, while these two women are free and that is something that is important and so wonderful for their families, there are still 218 civilians being held against their will, hostages in Gaza according to the IDF, ten Americans are still unaccounted for. And that is why according to sources, American officials are pressing Israel to delay its ground offensive, something that appears to have at least been successful over these past few days. Tonight, we are learning more about what that potential ground assault may look like. Here is the Israeli defense minister as he visited a navy base today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Keep preparing for our operation, it will come soon. We are preparing thoroughly for the next step, a multilateral operation in the air, ground and sea. Do your work, get ready. We will need you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is a reason for, and it is the unspeakable brutality that the world witnessed from Hamas. I warn, you what you are about to see is graphic. It is body cam video from Hamas militants, because so many of them were wearing GoPros, that's how they've been able to identify them by the unit in charge. You see one of the assailants firing into a car, the militants then inspected the car, to make sure that the people inside are dead. This is horrific, it's hard to comprehend. There is a lot worse out there that the documented, this is why Israel is rocking up of salt on Hamas and Gaza. According to the IDF so far just over the past, night they took out 320 military targets. That was one of the biggest airstrikes in recent days, and the targets they say they took out also happen, they say several commanders including a rocket division, this is, of course, in one of the most densely populated areas. There are few places for anybody who was an innocent civilians to hide. And earlier tonight, OUTFRONT spoke to Dr. Hatem Edhair. He works at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza, so he wanted to send us a voice, memo these dispatches we've been trying to gather for you. He did. And then in one of, them you're going to hear the reality of daily life in Gaza. Listen to this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DR.

International pressure, United States and other countries, whose nationals are being held by Hamas who are speaking to Israel about the importance of hostage releases. Is that kind of pressure going to have an impact?It certainly appears as if it is although Israel says that the U.S. is not putting pressure on it in that way. But it has been an interesting thing that the IDF actually had to put out a statement because the reports in local media here in Israel, they were stapling a prime minister, his leadership, IDF saying that's not true. Everyone is joined up. But I think that just gives you a sense of the pressures on the prime minister. The impact this drip, drip, drip of hostage releases and whatever is happening behind the scenes, whatever Hamas is talking about in terms of other releases. In terms of is that pulling the troops away from their positions and their armor that have been close to the jumping off points, close to Gaza -- no, they're still in position. And I think it is a matter of time, that seems to be the indication coming from the military commanders. It is a matter of time before that incursion happens. Is Hamas trying to put them off track?

And it is very far away pretty much from anyone who needs it.As we've been doing every night on OUTFRONT, we have another exclusive dispatch from the journalist, Ibrahim Dahman. He is inside Gaza. Ibrahim and his family as you know move from the north to the south they were hopeful that they would have finally be able to escape through Egypt. Those hopes though for now still hopes. Not yet successful. Ibrahim's wife and two young sons age 11 and seven evacuated northern Gaza when Israel told civilians to leave. They complied. They fled to the south and now, they wait and wait. Here's the update that Ibrahim shared with us today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IBRAHIM DAHMAN, CNN JOURNALIST (translated): Are we going to die today? That's what my son asks me since we fled Gaza City. Life in Khan Younis is difficult. We're staying with at least 150 other displaced families from the north, eating the bare minimum to survive. We spend our time watching airstrikes. And filling the water tank. It's like drinking toilet water. Our children drink toilet water. Because there's no electricity, my children can't see the horror online. And spend their time playing with other children. Over the weekend, we were told to go to the Rafah crossing. So we loaded our car to try and flee again. On the way, there was a lot of destruction. At the crossing, other families full of hope, were also trying to escape. But that hope quickly faded. We were told it's now closed. We were at the Rafah Crossing. We were hoping to enter the Egyptian side, but the crossing was closed. It's only opened for humanitarian aid. We make our way back, avoiding the chaos. Hoping that tomorrow, will be better than today. We hear airstrikes in the distance. Are you scared?",

BURNETT: \"The New York Times\", Colonel, just reporting tonight some new information, they're saying the Biden administration is concerned that Israel right now lacks achievable military objective in Gaza, and that they go on to report the Pentagon has specifically sent officers to help Israelis with the challenges of fighting in urban war, perhaps some with the experience in places like Mosul and Fallujah.
