The sort of famous picture with their thumbs up. And they -- instead of sort of taking the oxygen away from former President Trump, they gave him oxygen. And so it's a very, very big question.I don't think we know the answer yet, despite what Larry Hogan said. I mean, remember, the governor of Maryland has been very much against Trump and Trumpism, particularly election denialism, consistently across the board. And he has, as I mentioned, kind of been on an island in his party on that note.

The other way that the -- many people in the party are looking at it right now is independents who are critical, who did help him win in 2016, and more kind of - sort of what they call weak Republicans. Republicans who are registered that way but tend to kind of swing back and forth. And the answer is, when you look at the general elections, if Donald Trump were to get that far, it definitely could hurt the Republican Party.I think your -- the question that you're asking is really the question, especially as we look to tomorrow and this big announcement that the former president is teasing, whether he does actually go forward and announce that he is running for president. He does have a very strong, significant amount of support within the Republican Party. And if you look at the exit polls, it kind of bears that out. There is - even at the question of election denialism, there is that sort of 30 percent of the electorate, those who voted last week, who are with him on everything, if you just, again, look at it through the prism of was Joe Biden fairly and freely elected. And so that could help them in a Republican primary, but it could also destroy them in a national general election. So that is what the Republican Party is grappling with right now.",

As you noted, we're waiting for the president to come out and take questions here. But in that readout, the president spoke candidly and directly according to the readout about a series of issues, including human rights issues, including U.S. objections to what was framed as more aggressive behavior when it comes to Taiwan and in the Taiwan Strait specifically. But there were also areas laid out that I think are critical given the low state of affairs when it comes to this bilateral relationship, including the idea that both leaders decided that they - their senior officials would be empowered to open up lines of communication. That is something that's been largely frozen over the course of the first two years of Biden's time in office. Also detailing areas where they think they can work together. And perhaps notably at the bottom of the statement, the issue of Ukraine, why it doesn't frame President Xi's kind of reference point or where he stands on the overall issue of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They did say there was an agreement that nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear weapons should not be used in Ukraine. Implicit in that, obviously, is some of the threats we've seen from President Putin. So, we'll have to see how the president frames or if he's willing to characterize what President Xi's responses were to some of the direct objections raised by the U.S. or when it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the U.S. laying out a very detailed, to some degree, guys, path forward for a relationship that has been at a low point for several months, if not longer.",

And, MJ, a lot of those tough issues that Phil just noted there that Biden did bring up with President Xi is obviously notable, but it also seemed like so much of what the White House was trying to get out of this meeting was rally just having an open line of communication there, being able to have this face-to-face conversation that they have not had because Xi has not left China because of the pandemic. And so, what are White House officials telling you about just establishing essentially a line of communication there between the two leaders?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, just keep in mind, first of all, that the read-out that we just got that Phil just ticked through in detail, that, of course, largely conveys President Biden's side of the conversation. What we don't know at this moment is how President Xi responded to some of the more contentious parts of this conversation, for example, Taiwan. Human rights concerns that the U.S. side raised. Economic practices that the U.S. sees as unfair. So, we are going to have to see whether there ends up being a bit of a he- said/he-said situation after both sides have really come out with their sides of the story of how these conversations went down.But I think it is very important to remind everyone what U.S. officials, before this summit, said were the main goals going into this important meeting. They said, one, they want to make sure that the two leaders find areas of common practice and agreement. And, second, they said, as Kaitlan, as you noted, they want to make sure that they can establish open lines of communication going forward. It is pretty clear, even just based on the U.S. side of this summit, the read-out that we just talked about, that they probably did achieve both of those objectives. So, I think it is not - you know, wouldn't be surprising if we ended up hearing from President Biden and other U.S. officials that, broadly speaking, they did end up seeing this summit as a success. But I think, again, just really worth emphasizing, we are still waiting to get the Chinese side of things. And we'll see whether they are pretty frank about what areas of the conversations ended up being contentious. But, again, U.S. officials had said, going into this summit, they would rather have contentious conversations than no conversations at all.",
