We must keep going until we eliminate them as a governing system and as a military organization capable of launching attacks against the state of Israel. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan will meet with the families of Israeli-American hostages at the White House today. This comes as sources say international negotiators have agreed to a broad framework for a hostage release deal and a pause to the fighting in Gaza.

It is clear that a lot of work still remains to finalize this deal and get it across the finish line. But a source familiar with the discussions tells me that a broad framework was agreed to by those parties who were in Paris. That would include an initial phase of civilian Israeli hostages released by Hamas and other groups that would be accompanied by a six- week pause in the fighting. That pause could be extended if more of the hostages are released, including the IDF soldiers, both men and women, and the bodies of hostages who are still being held in the Gaza Strip. Now, Hamas would expect Palestinian prisoners to also be released from Israeli prisons, three Palestinian prisoners for every civilian hostage. That ratio could go up with the IDF soldiers. Now, I asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the deal that is being discussed. He called it a strong and compelling proposal and said that there is some real -- that there is real hope going forward. Take a listen.",

The situation is very active and very tense, he says, because the enemy has much more equipment and manpower. Basically, every day they try to storm the positions. A dead Russian soldier and a destroyed tank show just how close the Russians have come. It's a fight for survival and against the elements. The trench, cold, wet and soggy, the only heat coming from candles the soldiers cower around, gathering strength to face overwhelming Russian firepower. They shoot direct fire. Planes are flying. Basically, they have it all, he says. But probably the worst are tanks. When they fire, you don't even hear it. You hear an airplane when it comes over. With a tank, you're in God's hands.
