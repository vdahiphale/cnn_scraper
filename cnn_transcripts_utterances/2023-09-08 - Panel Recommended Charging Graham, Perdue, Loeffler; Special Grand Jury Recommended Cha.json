A report released just a short time ago shows that the special grand jury recommended charges for some of the former president's closest associates, but ultimately they were not charged.It includes some big names, including current South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, and former Georgia senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Graham was scrutinized for a phone call, you might remember, he made to Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, after the 2020 Election, a call that came before Trump's infamous find the votes call in early January of 2021. The special grand jury also recommended charges for a pro-Trump attorney, Cleta Mitchell and advisor, Boris Epshteyn, and his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn. All of them managed to dodge indictments from the district attorney. In all, the special grand jury recommended charges against 39 people, but District Attorney Fani Willis charged only 18 of them. We should note there was one defendant, Mike Roman, who was indicted, but was not in the report. Let's get you straight to Capitol Hill now and CNN's Melanie Zanona who has reaction from Sen. Graham. Melanie, what are you hearing about this?",

He said he was just doing his due diligence as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that he just had concerns about the mail-in voting process. And he also noted that he ultimately voted to certify the election results, including in Georgia.But as a reminder, there are conflicting accounts about what occurred on a phone call between Graham and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Raffensperger said that Graham essentially pressured him to toss out legal mail-in ballots and that it made him very uncomfortable. But Graham has denied that accusation. He told our Manu Raju back in 2020 that he was just calling to inquire about the mail-in voting process, about the signature verification system. And he also said that he wasn't even talking about the 2020 presidential election, that he was talking about a critical pair of Senate runoff races in Georgia that occurred in January 2021. But let's take a listen to what he told reporters in South Carolina earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): This is troubling for the country. We can't criminalize senators doing their job when they have a constitutional requirement to fulfill. It would be irresponsible for me, in my opinion, as chairman of the committee, not to try to find out what happened. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, when you have Jack Smith with one defendant and Fani Willis with 19, it's a little tough to use the word prosecutorial restraint. I would say it does show prosecutorial discipline. As somebody who's practiced criminal law for over three decades, prosecutors don't always indict everyone that a grand jury may feel evidence exists as to, they have to ask themselves multiple questions like which of these almost 40 are the strongest cases.If I charge a Lindsey Graham, will I get massive legal objections based on the Constitution for a sitting senator? If I charge another name that's gotten a lot of attention, a Cleta Mitchell, one of the alleged organizers of this conspiracy, according to this special grand jury. But was her conduct more aggressive lawyering or did it cross that line into criminality? Was she active on that infamous January 2nd Brad Raffensperger call? She didn't talk very much. So those kinds of considerations, I think, sound prosecutorial discipline. One last thing, Lindsey Graham complained. We just heard the sound that this was a criminalization of his duties. But it's just the opposite, Jim, because Fani Willis said, no, I'm not going to charge Lindsey Graham. So I think it speaks to her prudence.",

Those are not binding on the district attorney, but it is extraordinary to be able to see this kind of information, because now we know one of the data points that she was using when she made her decision to go ahead and move forward with indictments.So it's extraordinary to have this kind of access. CNN was one of the organizations that pushed to make this public. As we know, there were no objections among the jurors to releasing this and the judge said, look, now that the indictment is out, I am willing to release this. But some people may also argue that there's a reason that the grand jury process is secret, to protect people who may have been recommended for charges but not ultimately charged, and just to protect the process as a whole.",

I mean, that's the law there, whether it's going to be adapted to our new times is a question.One thing we also see in here, and this is very interesting, is the exact votes, right? How many jurors voted to indict and did not indict. What do we learn from that? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, one of the things that's interesting is that we see consistently at least one no vote on many of the names that we know were in the end charged, right? And I - we don't know whether it's the same member of the grand jury, it's the same juror that is objecting to pretty much all of them or whether that is - whether we had a mix and match of certain number of jurors who are unsure about particular people. For instance, certainly on Cleta Mitchell, on people like Lindsey Graham, you see big differences. There were 13 yes votes on Lindsey Graham, seven votes on no votes on Lindsey Graham. Cleta Mitchell, along with a lot of the other ones that were - that ended up being charged, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, you see 20 yes votes and one no vote. It's interesting also reading this list, right, going through - I focus on Cleta Mitchell because she was one of the people who early on signed on to the former president's efforts to try to overturn the election. There was also Boris Epshteyn who was instrumental in trying to design the fake elector scheme. And, of course, Mike Flynn, who also did not get charged and he was one of the ones who suggested using the military to try to go seize voting machines. These are all people who ended up not getting charged. I should note, we did hear from Mike Flynn's lawyer. He said that this is - he called this a witch hunt, a political witch hunt. Of course, Boris Epshteyn declined to comment, except to say that he wants to be called a lawyer for the former president, not just an advisor.",

And I want - I did get a chance to tour that command center just a few hours ago.But actually, before I get to that, I do want to bring you a bit of breaking news that CNN has just confirmed. I can tell you that the corrections officer who was on duty at the time of Cavalcante's escape, just a little bit - half a mile away from here, the Chester County Prison, that corrections officer was terminated yesterday afternoon. That confirmation coming from a Chester County government official. And just to rewind for a second to remind viewers, basically, the acting warden of the prison said that Cavalcante was able to crab walk up a part of the exercise yard, get up to the roof, jump over and through some razor wire and that was how he was able to escape. But the acting warden really pointed to the tower guard, a corrections officer, who did not report nor see, according to the warden, that escape as it happened. And they're saying that that's part of the reason why Cavalcante got about an hour's head start on authorities once he was able to leave the prison. So that news just coming into us. Now, back to the actual search itself. This area, this search area, I should say, has been expanding. We're now seeing north of 350 law enforcement officials - nearing 400 - on the ground, in the air, on horseback, trying to find Cavalcante. But during this tour of the command center that I attended a few hours ago, I asked Pennsylvania State Police why this show of force, which is the largest amount of law enforcement officers this search has seen yet, how come this didn't come sooner. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREEMAN (off camera): Why wasn't this amount of people deployed right away? LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:      The numbers, you will see them rise and fall. If this isn't successful, I may keep the same number, depending on what the information is. We had as many as we needed for the various operations that we had going on. It doesn't do us any good to bring all of those resources and pull them from other places, because they're not just sitting around with nothing to do. They've got policing functions elsewhere when they're not here and so there's a balance there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
