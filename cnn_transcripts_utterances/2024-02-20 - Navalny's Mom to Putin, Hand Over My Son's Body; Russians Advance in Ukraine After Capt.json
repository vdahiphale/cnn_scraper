Almost immediately afterwards, we had a very strong tweet from Alexei Navalny's widow pushing back, saying once again, hand us back Alexei Navalny's body, and then this, this very dramatic video. Now, what you're about to see is Alexei Navalny's 70-year-old mother, who is standing outside the notorious Polar Wolf colony, where he breathed his lost breast.

I haven't been able to see him for five days. They won't give me his body. They don't even tell me where he is. I'm addressing you, Vladimir Putin, the solution to the issue depends only on you. Let me finally see my son. I demand that Alexei's body be immediately handed over so that I can bury him humanely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're going to continue to make as much noise about this as they can and to continue to be a thorn in the side of Russian authorities. What we'd also heard yesterday was Yulia Navalnaya heading to Brussels and urging European lawmakers not to recognize the Russian election that's due next month at this stage that's highly expected to deliver Vladimir Putin the fifth term that he seeks.",

She's resisted this pressure campaign for weeks to drop out and this state of the race speech sort of gives her the opportunity to crystallize her mission going into the closing days here. Part of that strategy has also been confronting the former president, arguing Trump is just too distracted to engage the voters that Republicans will need in a general election. Let's listen.

And Ambassador John Bolton joins us now. Ambassador, thank you for being with us. You know, moments ago, we saw pictures of Alexei Navalny's mother outside the Siberian prison where Navalny died pleading for the release of the body of Alexei Navalny. What do you read in to the reluctance or failure of Russia to turn the body over? AMB. JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Well, quite likely they tried again with poison, maybe even using Novichok again, which didn't work the first time. And they're waiting for the evidence of the poisoning to dissipate. So, it's not subject to uncovering during an autopsy. Look, these are very cold blooded people. This doesn't bother them. And despite some demonstrations inside Russia, which have been quickly swept up by the police, I think Putin's domestic position with Navalny gone, with Prigozhin gone, with elections coming in a few weeks, he's sure to win.
