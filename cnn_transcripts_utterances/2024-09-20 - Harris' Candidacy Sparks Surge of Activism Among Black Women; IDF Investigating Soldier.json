This, we believe, happened in Qabatiyah, which is in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. We have these images from multiple different angles filmed by people, and it shows what appears to be Israeli soldiers throwing Palestinian bodies off a roof.Now, CNN cannot confirm that those Palestinians were, in fact, deceased. The bodies do appear motionless and lifeless, but we cannot confirm that. So what we see is, in one occasion, the soldiers pushing a body off the side of the building. The foot becomes entangled in cables before another soldier loosens it and the body falls to the ground. We see a second Palestinian body, the hands being picked up by one soldier, the feet by another. It is then swung before it is dropped over the side of the building. In a third case, we see a Palestinian body being pushed over the side of a building with the feet of an Israeli soldier. Now, Israel has responded to this. We've heard from the IDF. Their statement is as follows, quote: This is a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. The incident is under review. Now, it's suffice to say that under international law, this would not be acceptable. Militaries are required to treat enemy combatant bodies with respect. They're also required to hand them back to the families of that particular individual. Now, the Israeli military has a history of confiscating bodies. We understand from the governor of Jenin that four Palestinian bodies have been taken by the Israeli military and that there are three others that were killed on this one particular day -- this was yesterday. And the funerals of those three will be held later this Friday. So some disturbing video, disturbing information, which the Israeli military, Max, says they will be investigating.",
