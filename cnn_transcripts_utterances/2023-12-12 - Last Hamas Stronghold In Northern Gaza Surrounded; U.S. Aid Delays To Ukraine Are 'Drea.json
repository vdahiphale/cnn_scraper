One area is the Jabalya refugee camp, where residents said dozens of civilians were killed over the weekend. Since the fragile week long pause and the fighting ended, Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip and focused on the south in Khan Younis, the second largest city there where Israel believes senior Hamas leaders may be hiding. As Israel expands its operations the number of civilians killed and wounded grows. The entire house fell on my head and I was pulled from underneath the rubble, this woman said. We would have been better off dead with my children, rather than living in this grim reality. An urgent appeal was issued by the IDF this weekend for even more civilians to evacuate parts of Khan Younis, but it's unclear how many would have heard the orders. And it isn't a guarantee of safety or shelter, medicine, food and water, which are all in short supply.

He knows that Navalny is one of the more effective opposition leaders and that direct killing of him, could actually lead to some public backlash.

In fact Xi Jinping telling a local newspaper, he really wants to encourage opportunity on things such as connectivity, green energy as well as critical minerals.

Not only the waterways but some of the islands, some of the sandbars, some of the passageways.
