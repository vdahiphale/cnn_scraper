I'm Becky Anderson, welcome to \"Connect the World\" wherever you are watching, you are more than welcome. We will have a lot more on the Israeli Prime Minister's quote, direct call with U.S. President and his security cabinet meeting later today, as the world still braces for the response to Iran's missile barrage on Israel. We'll be live in Tel Aviv, Washington and Tehran a little later this hour, but we begin with breaking news out of the United States. Well, daylight in Florida, bringing us a good look at the destruction caused by Hurricane Milton, which has now exited Florida and is off the Atlantic Coast. You are looking at pictures from Clearwater in Central Florida, first responders there are conducting water rescues to ferry people out of their homes where they may be trapped and all over the area, authorities urging patients and warning residents to stay put, because the danger from flooding down trees and power lines is still not over, they say. The hurricane roared on shore in the Sarasota area, south of Tampa on Wednesday night, it was a Category III Storm. This is how it looked and sounded. Well, ferocious winds ripped the roof off Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, home of baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, which was supposed to house first responders, while the Tampa area was largely spared the worst of the feared storm surge. The City's Mayor says the biggest problem today is the flooding caused by unrelenting rain. And to the east of the hurricane's center, far from the evacuation zones, Milton spawned dozens of these tornadoes. This is video from Port St. Lucie, where multiple fatalities are now reported. Well, a few minutes ago, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gave this update on the storm, saying, as bad as the damage is, it could have been a whole lot worse. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): What we can say is the storm was significant, but thankfully, this was not the worst-case scenario. The storm did weaken before landfall, and the storm surge, as initially reported, has not been as significant overall as what was observed for Hurricane Helene. Right now, it looks like Sarasota County had the most significant storm surge, likely somewhere between 8 to 10 feet and remember, with Helene, we had 15 to 20 feet up in Taylor County (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The worst hit area four tornadoes appear to have been St. Lucie County in South Central Florida, which is on the Atlantic Coast. Multiple fatalities reported there. The County Sheriff described the impact to us earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEITH PEARSON, ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF: Our area is not used to seeing any kind of tornado activity. We had one tornado pop up. It actually struck our Sheriff's Office, taking out a 10,000 square foot red iron structure that was housing all of our emergency equipment in preparation for Hurricane Milton. Shortly after that, maybe 20 minutes later, all of our alarms have gone off. All the messages came out there. Our deputies reported at least visually seeing six tornadoes on the ground.

This comes after he had received a briefing last night from his Homeland Security Adviser and a FEMA Administrator right after Milton made impact in Florida. The President yesterday, also last night, spoke with the Mayors of Orlando as well as Sarasota to try to anticipate some of the needs that they might need in this recovery. It comes as the administration is trying to show that they have pre-positioned resources that they are ready to immediately respond in this response and recovery following Hurricane Milton. FEMA Administrator, Deanne Criswell was at the state's emergency operation centers this morning getting updates on what exactly the state will need. They have already mobilized Coast Guard and FEMA Search and Rescue Teams as well as Swift Water Rescue Teams. Images that you've seen throughout the day already of people being rescued from their homes at times. They also have deployed power teams with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to try to help with some of the power outages that are widespread in Florida. And then the administration is having pre- positioned, is ready to deploy about 20 million meals and 40 million liters of water. All of these resources they are hoping to get into those most devastated communities down in Florida. But even as they are dealing with this response and recovery, you have also heard warnings from President Biden himself around some of the misinformation that's been coming relating to the federal government's response. He was very blunt last night, saying that Former President Donald Trump is responsible for some of those false claims. And the White House has taken steps trying to rebut some of those false narratives, as they have warned that these -- this spate of misinformation will complicate officials on the ground's ability to get the resources that they need, the communities that need it most.",

And it made a note that the Iranian missiles fight on Israel weren't that precise. But he said they will have no idea what happened, or how it happened, what's happening to them. So, it's really painting a picture of some stealthy kind of mission. But even that doesn't give us clues into what the targets might be. We know that there was this direct phone conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday. And the Irish Prime Minister met with President Biden not long after, and he said, look, I can't share with you what the president said to me, but I can tell you that these were -- this was strongly put to the Israeli Prime Minister. President Biden has said he doesn't believe that it is correct and right to hit nuclear sites inside of Iran. He doesn't believe that the Iran's oil infrastructure should be hit. But of course, the Prime Minister here, Benjamin Netanyahu, really believes that Hezbollah in the north in Lebanon was a real arm of Iran's government, and that if he strikes very sensitive sites in Iran, then he would fill the full punishment from Hezbollah. And right now, he feels that Hezbollah is down, that their command and control is down, their leadership is down. They're not the force that they were. And I think the concern remains that he has not, as far as we know, told President Biden that he -- that the nuclear power sites are definitely off limits, or told him that anything is off limits. So, I think at the moment, the best information that we have is that this is going to be stealthy and surprising. And the question for the region after the strikes, whenever they come, would be, does this lead to escalation?

That's definitely something that is on people's minds. A lot of people here, though, seem pretty bold when they're talking about Israel. They do expect the Islamic Republic, as they put it, to stand up to Israel. But I also think you're absolutely right. It's very interesting to see some of the shuttle diplomacy, if you will, that's been going on by top officials of the Islamic Republic. It's not just the foreign minister, it's actually the speaker of parliament. Who's in the region traveling right now, the President of Iran, of course, traveling to Turkmenistan today, where tomorrow he's going to meet with Vladimir Putin. And then we do have the Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi which I think was a very important meeting yesterday with Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. The Iranians there saying that he tried to make clear to Mohammed bin Salman that it's important for countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia to improve their relations. The Iranians saying that that is something that is actually happening. Of course, what the Iranians are trying to do is drum up support for themselves and against Israel. It's unclear to what extent that is actually happening, but the Iranians at the same time, are also vowing a crushing response if the Israelis do attack Iranian territory. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): After Iran's massive missile strike targeting military installations inside Israel's territory, Iran is now bracing for what the Israelis say will be a strong response. On Tehran streets, some concern and a lot of defiance. Everyone's mind is busy thinking of what might happen, this man says. And if Israel makes a move, we will certainly respond to it. And this woman says, I am not concerned about war because I believe in my country and our leadership. I know if anything happens, nothing will threaten the Iranian nation. If there is a need to protect our soil and our land, like our fathers and brothers who participated in the eight-year war, we will go to war as well, this man says. And you will see the result of the jihad that has been ordered. If you want war, we are the masters of war, this poster in Revolution Square reads both in Farsi and in Hebrew.

And coming up, I'll speak with Kirsten Fontenrose, the President of Red Six International, whohas written an analysis piece for the Atlantic Council, in which she argues, and I quote, in the last three administrations, the U.S. strove to alter Iran's foreign policy using carrots, then sticks, then carrots again. What has not been tried is a long term, multi domain, bipartisan strategy for addressing Iran's goal to unseat the U.S. as the partner of choice for many important Arab states. Well, is that even possible in the current climate? I think it's a really important piece of analysis, and one well worth discussing, and we'll do that with her next hour. So do stay with us. For that well as the world waits for Israel's next move as regards Iran, the IDF has launched new strikes on Lebanon, striking what it says where Hezbollah weapons storage facilities in Beirut's southern suburbs, again. Lebanese officials say since Israel's campaign of airstrikes intensified this month. More than 1500 people have been killed and more than a million have been displaced. U.N. says a quarter of Lebanon is now under Israeli military displacement orders. Meanwhile, in Gaza, an Israeli air strike killed at least 28 people inside a shelter, which was in a school that's according to the Palestine Red Crescent.

We're in a neighborhood just to the south of downtown Fort Myers, where we believe, again, according to the folks out here, that one tornado hit this part of Lee County yesterday afternoon, you can see the roof of this house is gone. The folks inside there are taking a look at the damage, what's left of their home, the debris that covers their front yard is not even from this neighborhood. This sign here, this debris belongs to a business, and so it's probably not even from this area where we are. And then across the street is another house I'm going to walk over and show you some of the damage here. The owner of this house tells me he was on the roof just a few minutes ago, actually, and he told me that, yesterday they had put up all this plywood, all in an effort to better prepare for this storm. They knew it was going to rain, they knew there was going to be some wind, and they knew that they were probably going to be damaged. What he didn't think was that this tornado was going to hit and that much of the damage to his house was going to come from the fact that the roof, part of the roof, gave way, and so all of this water and all of this debris and everything that was kind of flying around out here yesterday made its way inside that house. He's in the process right now of trying to figure out exactly what they are going to do. Becky, one of the things that we've been reporting outside of the main area where this hurricane hits up in Sarasota County in the Tampa Bay area, is the fact that a lot of the damage and a lot of some of the deaths that we have seen took place elsewhere in the state of Florida, almost on the other side, on the east coast of Florida, in part because these tornadoes that hit. We know, two tornadoes hit one in Western Broward County, which is in the South Florida area, and another tornado hit near Lake Okeechobee, which is kind of in the central part of Florida. Those two tornadoes, again, hit that part of Florida.

I guess, to go for big rate cuts, and that is perhaps why these markets are slightly lower today. Let's get Matt Egan's analysis on here. He's here to break down the numbers for us.

A GasBuddy, as of last night at 07:00 p.m. Eastern Time, they're reporting that about one in four gas stations in Florida had no fuel. And this was much worse in some of the hardest hit areas around Tampa, more than half the gas stations did not have fuel. Sarasota, almost half, one in three in Fort Myers. Now that's a reflection of the fact that demand spiked, but this could become an issue as the region tries to clean up and tries to repair and check on everyone, and as people start to go back to their homes when it becomes safe to do that. Now we know that officials in Florida say that they are surging supplies of fuel to where it's needed. Some of the good news on that front is that Tampa may not have gotten hit quite as hard as people had feared. That is significant, because the Port of Tampa is actually where this whole state gets a lot of its gas from. So, it's too early to say just how much damage was done here. They're going to be doing assessments, but the hope is that maybe the Port of Tampa did not get hit as hard as it could have, and perhaps that allows it to open sooner, which would allow the state to bring in more gasoline and to get those gas stations back to where they need. So, the next few days will give us a clearer sense, Becky, for just how much damage was done, because we know this is just a major population center, a major commercial property center. Moody's estimates that $1.1 trillion of commercial properties were lying directly in the path of this storm. And we'll find out soon enough just how much damage those properties sustained, Becky.",

And more importantly, all of our emergency equipment and supplies that are stationed there are in good shape. So, we'll be able to rapidly push that equipment, those supplies. We also have a team in Lakeland, Florida strike team of a command crew and mobile feeding units. They are also fine. So that's really going to help us speed up our response efforts.",
