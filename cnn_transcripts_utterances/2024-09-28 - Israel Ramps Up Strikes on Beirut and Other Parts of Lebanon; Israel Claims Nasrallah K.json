As I mentioned, we have already seen a number of senior Hezbollah commanders and officials killed over the course of the crossfire that we have seen between Israel and Hezbollah since October 8, on that border with southern Lebanon and Israel.We have seen senior Hamas officials as well killed on Lebanese territory, assassinated by targeted strikes carried out by the Israeli military, though in cases Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement in these targeted assassinations. But again, this would be a huge development, the ramifications, the consequences could be very significant in terms of the reaction and the response we see more broadly in the region, particularly from Iran. Hassan Nasrallah of course, is the leader of Hezbollah, the secretary general. But he is also a hugely significant and symbolic figure for many in Lebanon, for many, of course, in the Shia community more broadly in the region; of course, in Iran as well. He has been a figurehead over the course of the last year in terms of Hezbollah's response to the war in Gaza. We've been hearing repeatedly from Hezbollah officials and namely, of course, Hassan Nasrallah, that their military actions, their targeting of Israeli territory, has come in direct response to Israel's attacks on Gaza. That this will not come to an end until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. But again, there have been those warning signs and alarm bells being sounded around the potential for the war in Gaza to escalate, to spill over more broadly in the region. That is what we are seeing now, the targeting of Lebanon, the targeting of senior officials. Now the Israeli military claiming to have killed Hassan Nasrallah. Again, we're still waiting to hear from Hezbollah on that. Just to really touch on what we're seeing on Lebanon on the ground as well, what we are seeing is the targeting, according to the Israeli military, of Hezbollah assets. But these are areas that are densely populated, filled with civilians. Particularly overnight and yesterday we saw the targeting and bombing of the Dahiyeh suburb in southern Beirut, an area which is crammed, filled with apartment blocks where families live. I mean, this is a very busy, very small city and what we've seen overnight is many trying to take shelter on the streets, essentially sleeping on the streets with their children because they fear that they will be targeted next. The Israeli military has been sending out evacuation orders very similar to what we've seen in Gaza, in fact, telling civilians that they are near what they claim to be Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, Hezbollah targets, that they need to move and get out to safety for their protection. But these warnings are coming with very little notice. And so it's very difficult for civilians to actually get to safety in time in southern Lebanon. Of course, what we've seen over the course of the last year is a huge movement of civilians. Many have been forced to flee their homes and evacuate, hundreds of thousands. And in fact, we've heard from the Lebanese health minister speaking to CNN earlier in the week, saying that he estimates between 400,000 to 500,000 Lebanese people have been now internally displaced as a result of Israel's targeting of Lebanese territory. And, of course, it's important to remember that this escalation has really come about as a result of Israeli action. Of course, we've seen that crossfire between both sides on Lebanon's southern border but this is taking things to a whole new level. And what we've been hearing from members of the international community, particularly from the United States, Israel's closest ally, is that they do not want to see an escalation. They've even called for a ceasefire. And so far that has been rejected by the Israeli government. This latest development, the apparent reported killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, according to the Israeli military, will have significant consequences. And we will, of course, be keeping an eye on the developments that follow and of course, waiting to hear from Hezbollah as well.",

And he essentially was peppered with questions with regards to why there hasn't been any progress on securing a ceasefire, particularly in Lebanon. We know, of course,  that emphasis has really been brought forward by the U.S. calling on Israel to secure or agree to a ceasefire in Lebanon. Again, we haven't seen any positive movement on calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. And there are fears that that could be the case in Lebanon as well. Of course what we have seen as well is the U.S. continuing to put forward funding for Israel. So there is a disconnect there. And the messaging that we are hearing and, of course, what we are seeing in terms of substantial action being taken by the Biden administration, just on Thursday, Israeli officials said that they secured another $8.7 billion in military aid from the United States. (INAUDIBLE) Pentagon on that. Of course that is a point of concern for many who have called not only for a ceasefire but, of course, for a shift in U.S. foreign policy when it comes to support for Israel. We've seen huge protests, of course, in Israel itself, many saying that they believe the government in Israel has not done enough to secure the release of hostages, to bring an end to the war in Gaza. So there is pressure coming on Israel from all sides. But as you said, Kim, we really haven't seen at substantial action being taken in terms of international community response to put pressure on Israel to agree to the ceasefire agreement. We know that Hezbollah has repeatedly said in Lebanon, their military actions targeting Israeli territory will come to an end when there is a ceasefire in Gaza. But at this stage, it feels as though that is a hopeless point at this point.",

Of course, this will be a significant development. And in fact, we've heard similar messaging in the past from Iranian officials following the killing of other most senior Hezbollah commanders as well as senior Hamas officials who have been killed. Of course, Ismail Haniyeh, Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed in February in Beirut actually. So  this will be a significant development. Hassan Nasrallah not only the secretary general of Hezbollah but also a significant symbolic figure for many in Lebanon, for many in the Shia community across the region. More broadly, certainly in Iran. And this will draw action from many in Iran, who will, of course, have been supportive of Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah as an organization. But of course, that remains to be seen. Of course, the situation in Lebanon is growing more dire. This will, of course, perhaps put more pressure on Iran to take further action. We have seen action taken in the past by Iran's proxies in the region. We have seen direct targeting of Israeli territory by Iran itself. But as the situation grows more desperate in Lebanon, that has certainly put pressure on Iran to take further action. We have seen the bombing of areas hat are densely populated with civilians overnight. This is a country that has already been through so, so much in recent years from a collapsing economy that has really pushed many in Lebanon into the brink of desperation, to, of course, the port blast in 2020. And now this. And, of course, we have seen that huge number of civilians killed already and warnings from officials across the globe, particularly international leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, that we cannot allow what we have seen in Gaza to be replicated in Lebanon. But of course, that is something we've heard from Israeli military officials in the past, saying that what is happening in Gaza can be, in their words, copy and pasted in Beirut. Those warnings have been coming in from months prior. And now what we are seeing in Beirut is what the Israeli military terms and claims to be a targeted bombing campaign, targeting Hezbollah assets, targeting Hezbollah officials, weapons, store facilities, et cetera. But again, these are areas that are densely populated, filled with civilians and families. Just as we have seen in Gaza, we're hearing those evacuation orders once again from the Israeli military with little time for civilians to actually get out to safety. And there are fears that this could only be the beginning, that we could continue to see this situation spiraling. That was certainly the warning from Lebanon's foreign minister, who has called on the international community to take action, to intervene, to prevent the situation in Lebanon from spiraling out of control. Not only the situation in Lebanon but more broadly in the region as well. Of course, important to underscore that the situation in Lebanon is deeply connected to Iran's proxies more broadly in the region. And there may well be a response from those proxies targeting Israel, as you heard from Nic Robertson just there. There may be some heightened concern in Israel around that as well. But again, this will be a significant shift with significant consequences, certainly.",

And that's why I'm saying that Hezbollah, what we need to think of it really, is a very institutionalized, both political and military organization. It's not a one man's show, even though Nasrallah is the beating heart of Hezbollah.He is just iconic for the party followers and supporters and the axis of resistance and the region. You have multiple leaders, even though I think most probably that Hashem Safieddine, his second in command, who is -- who comes from a similar social and political and ideological background, has similar also religious education and training. And he has, Nasrallah has been really preparing Hashem Safieddine for this particular role for the past few years. But again, we have to wait and see to hear from Hezbollah. The fact that we have not heard officially from Hezbollah for the past 12 hours tells me that Habi Adiwon (ph) survived in the four buildings that they were bombed by Israel. But regardless, I think what we really, what we have seen, what we are witnessing now, it's all-out war. As you know, for your viewers, we have been warning about this particular tipping point for the past 12 months. Finally, Israeli prime minister has his wish because, really, in a way, Netanyahu has declared war not only against Hamas but even against Hezbollah. And yesterday, from the podium at the United Nations, Nasrallah (sic) threatened Iran directly. He's saying there is no place in Iran that we cannot really reach. So in a way, despite the pleas by the Americans and the French and the British and the Europeans, Netanyahu has decided to really -- he wants to have total victory not only against Hamas but against Hezbollah. And probably he is gunning for Iran, he is hoping that Iran would retaliate. It gives them the justification to go after Iran's nuclear program as well.",

The Israeli prime minister and his government have decided to have all-out war. Hezbollah has no other choice. It's a matter of capabilities. It's a matter of capacity.Remember, Israel has been able to erode a great deal of Hezbollah's capabilities in the past couple of weeks. It has killed scores of its leaders. It has neutralized and injured thousands of its rank and file. I mean, in the past while, as Israel has been bombing nonstop, you have a major displacement crisis in Lebanon. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese on the run. So what you really have is now all-out war. And Hezbollah, I think is basically positioning itself for the long war. Look, and I'm not -- I'm trying to really be critical and informative. Israel will not be able to achieve its overarching aims in Lebanon by just bombing Lebanon. It cannot do it by air force. Even the Americans could not do it in Afghanistan and Iraq. They had to sound, they had to send boots on the ground. At the end of the day, regardless of how much damage Israel can and could do -- and it has done a lot of damage -- it has to launch a ground, basically invasion in order to really prevent Hezbollah from bombing its towns and cities. But we know very well that a ground war, Israel will -- basically if and when Israel's ground war happens, it basically will fall into Hezbollah's trap because Hezbollah wants Israel to attack militarily because that's the only way that Hezbollah could basically inflict damage. I mean, see its damage on Israel. But I expect the next few days and next few weeks, the next few months, you're going to have strategic escalation. Once Hezbollah really has basically -- is in charge of its capabilities, you're going to see hundreds, if not thousands, of long- term, precise missiles fired at Israeli towns and cities. So the war has not started from Hezbollah's point of view. Israel now is celebrating the damage that it has inflicted on Hezbollah. But remember, Israel has started this war. Israel can never, will never be able to finish this war on its own terms. And sadly and tragically, we have seen this before. Once you start a war, you don't really determine its conclusion. As we have -- I mean, whether you're talking about the American invasion of Afghanistan or Iraq or, in fact, now Israel's war in Gaza.",

You had this enormous port blast in 2020 that shattered much of downtown Beirut. In 2019, you had a failed protest movement to try to reform the system of government. To this day, there is no president right now. There hasn't been for more than a year. In Lebanon, the competing factions haven't been able to agree on one. Lebanon is a country that endured years of Israeli military occupation, of Syrian military occupation, one that ended in 2001, that it ended in 2005. And, of course, its own disastrous civil war that went on for some 15 years. And you can see the scars of all of these conflicts and crises just on the sides of buildings as you travel around the country. And every family has felt, every family in Lebanon has felt these crises and these traumas. And you see it in the diaspora of Lebanese people scattered around the world. And when they come home for their holidays to visit those relatives, who stay in their country -- and the violence of the last week-and-a-half I think has rekindled enormous trauma in enormous number of people. This is not the first time that the southern suburbs, that Israeli warplanes have bombed the southern suburbs of Beirut. They were devastated in the 2006 month-long war that Hezbollah fought against Israel. And now, once again, there are fears that Lebanon is in for yet another war with Israel, a country that has battled it many times in years past. So the discussions that people are having is, how to get out, how to take their children, their elderly relatives to safety. News of the claims, the purported claims, that Nasrallah may have been killed, are raising new rounds of discussions. While Hezbollah was hands down, is hands down the most powerful political and military faction in Lebanon, this is still a very polarized country that's divided by religious groups and by ideologies. Even its detractors would argue that Hezbollah had a certain level of discipline and reputation for less corruption than the many other political factions in that country. That said, it had many enemies. We've seen reports of people in opposition controlled parts of Syria celebrating the bombardment of Hezbollah targets overnight because Hezbollah participated in the atrocious civil war in neighboring Syria on the side of the governing Assad regime there, against a largely Sunni Arab uprising. All going to show that this is, this is a country in a movement with a very checkered history. And there are more questions than answers right now about what this will mean. In just a week, we have seen more Lebanese casualties in Israel's bombing campaign, in just a day, almost half the casualties that were witnessed in a month-long war in 2006. And I think many people are afraid that Israel is not done with bombing Lebanese cities, villages and towns.",

But they haven't pushed forward with policy.The Biden administration, along with France and a multitude of other countries, earlier in the week, engaged with the Israelis in order to get a ceasefire proposal on the table. They then announced a ceasefire proposal after having consulted the Israelis ahead of time. And then the Netanyahu government turned around after the ceasefire proposal was announced and said no. And promptly hours later then bombs. So then Beirut, destroying and leveling those six buildings, which also included the apparent assassination of Nasrallah. The Biden administration has not taken the steps in order to force a change in Israeli behavior, which means that the Israelis really have no reason to think that there would be consequence for escalation and for more reckless action. And I think that, as long as that is the case, we have to be extremely concerned. There are no checks or balances on this, even though there are tremendous amounts of leverage that the United States in particular could use in order to push forward a ceasefire, not only in Lebanon but also in Gaza. But as we've seen over the past 12 months, they've been unwilling to use that leverage. This is a deliberate choice. It's not because they've tried using all the tools in their arsenal. In terms of the Iranian response, again for Iran, Hezbollah is a huge card to play. And I think what you've seen over the past year is that the Iranians have been unwilling to escalate past a certain point. They've also been reckless but not quite to the same degree. And now they've seen Hezbollah take a massive hit in Lebanon just over the past week. And of course, with the assassination of Nasrallah, it's only increased the image of Hezbollah being a much weaker organization than it was otherwise portrayed to be. And I think that that creates a very difficult situation for the Iranian regime that has been relying on Hezbollah as that sort of ace in the hole.

And that is the frame of mind within which his killing is being viewed here in Israel. But make no mistake. This is an earth-shattering moment, whether you opposed and reviled Hassan Nasrallah or, like some in Lebanon, whether you supported him, because of the enormous geopolitical impact that his death is going to have. The question is, how will it impact things on the ground? There's no question that there is a real risk of things spiraling out of control in the wake of Hassan Nasrallah's death. But also clearly this is a moment where Hezbollah, what remains of its leadership, as well as Iran, which has funded and supported and closely coordinated with Hezbollah for years now. They are going to have to decide what happens next, who takes over the helm of Hezbollah. And how does his killing and the bombing that left many others dead in this Beirut strike as well, how will this, what will the response be from Hezbollah, from Iran, as well as from the other Iranian proxies in the region? And that much remains uncertain at this time. We have already seen that Hezbollah fired several rounds of rockets toward northern Israel in the wake of the Israeli military announcing Nasrallah's death. But certainly that is not the extent of the response that we are likely going to see from Hezbollah and perhaps also from Iran. So this certainly puts us a knife's edge in this region. And this is one of the most significant moments of this nearly year- long conflict that we have seen roiling the Middle East. The Israeli military has been touting this success, this morning, saying that they acted with precise intelligence, that they had been planning this strike for some time. And that ultimately they chose to carry it out at what they are describing at the right time. It seems quite clear that the Israeli military has been aware for a long time now of this central Hezbollah headquarters underneath this Dahiyeh suburb in Beirut in the Lebanese capital. And clearly this was a target of opportunity. They got the intelligence that Nasrallah was in this underground compound and they chose to carry out this strike, no less while the Israeli prime minister himself was actually out of Israel, traveling in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. There was a photo that the Israelis released of Netanyahu approving that strike while he was in New York. Again, an enormous moment in this conflict.

This will have significant regional ramifications. And all eyes will certainly be on Iran, of course, to hear the reaction from there. We've already heard from Iranian officials describing the targeting of Beirut in the past few days as a red line, as a significant escalation. Hassan Nasrallah, not only a key figure in Lebanon but of course, more broadly in the region, a crucial ally to Iran. So there will be an expected response from the Iranian regime. Of course, it remains to be seen this confirmation for Hezbollah and, of course, how this triggers any sort of reaction from Iran and its regional proxies, whether or not we do see a reaction in terms of military action from Iran and its proxies or whether perhaps there is restraint. But again, this is a huge blow, a significant escalation. This follows the killing of a number of senior Hezbollah officials and commanders as well as Hamas officials, including Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, including Hamas' deputy political leader Saleh al Arouri, who was assassinated in Beirut. This is a huge tipping point, a significant, significant escalation.",

This is a country which, just in the last few years, has gone through a number of crises and economic collapse, which just pushed many in the country to the point of desperation, the brink of desperation.We've seen the port blast in 2020. Again, significant ramifications for the civilian population across Beirut. And now this. And there have been fears for some time now of an all-out war with Israel. We've, of course, seen that crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah along Lebanon's southern border, which has already pushed around 100,000 people out of their homes, forced them to evacuate that region. Now we are seeing even more civilians being forced to evacuate across the country. The health minister Lebanon telling CNN, he estimates around 400,000 to 500,000 have now been internally displaced. And it is a desperate situation. Our colleagues were on the ground yesterday in Beirut, seeing families on the streets overnight, essentially escaping their apartments and homes for fear that they could then be struck. Next, we're hearing those evacuation orders from the Israeli military, telling civilians in specific pockets that they need to evacuate because they are close to, according to the Israeli military, Hezbollah targets. But what we are also hearing from many on the ground is that those warnings are not giving them enough time to gather their belongings together, their family members and, make it out to safety in time. So this is a hugely desperate and terrifying situation for many on the ground.",
