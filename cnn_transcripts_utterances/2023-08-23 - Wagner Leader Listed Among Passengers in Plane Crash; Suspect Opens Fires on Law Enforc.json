But he won't be at that debate alongside his rivals. Instead, he is hunkered down in New Jersey on the eve of his surrender on RICO charges in Georgia. So far, six of the former president's co- defendants have turned themselves in at the Fulton County Jail, part of that sweeping indictment on 2020 election interference in Georgia. And, today, one of the architects of the fake electors plot, Kenneth Chesebro, was booked. And Rudy Giuliani, the central figure in Trump's barrage of failed post-election lawsuits, is in Atlanta now, and he could be next. CNN's Paula Reid is outside of the courthouse for us. Paula, it's a little bit different than the other defendants so far. Giuliani is actually planning to work out his bond terms and surrender all in one day.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Brianna.A source tells me he wants to get this all done today before former President Trump comes to town tomorrow. Now, right now, we have learned that Giuliani is huddled with his team ahead of their scheduled meeting with the district attorney's office. Now, that meeting will happen in the courthouse right behind me, and they will work to hash out the terms of his release. Once that bond agreement is in place, then Giuliani can go to the Fulton County Sheriff's Office to surrender. And it's really remarkable, Brianna, to think about that process, which will involve fingerprinting and even a mug shot, considering the fact that Rudy Giuliani was at a time one of the most powerful law enforcement officials in this country, when he was serving, of course, as the U.S. attorney in New York, prosecuting many RICO cases. Now he is a criminal defendant in a RICO case down here in Georgia. Now, it's unclear if he has an attorney who's going to help him throughout this case. All he needs today is just someone with a Georgia license who can sign that bond agreement. We're told he has secured that person. But we know, because of his significant legal debt, he owes millions of dollars in legal fees to various legal entities that have helped him through his other legal problems. So, as of right now, Brianna, other lawyers who have worked with him, they're not willing to help him right now until they get paid. And he's had trouble retaining a new attorney. But I also want to point out something, Brianna. Today, when he came to Georgia, he didn't fly into he didn't fly into Hartsfield-Jackson. He didn't take Delta and ride the train from the gate to baggage claim. He flew private. He came in on a private jet. And it is unclear where he got the money to do that, unclear if it's his money or if someone provided that service for him, because just last week, his lawyers were in court claiming that he didn't have money to pay his legal bills. And that has also been an issue helping him get processed in this case, trying to find a lawyer who will help him. So, that's something we're definitely continuing to dig into today. Who has been willing to help him at least fly private down here to Georgia?",

So, logistically, it is just inherently a little more complicated for him. His lawyers were, of course, down here in Fulton County earlier this week, Brianna, to hash out the terms of his bond agreement. That is in place. So, now he will just go through the surrender process. And our colleagues Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene, we have learned that he's going to surrender in the evening. That is after rush hour traffic here in Atlanta. Anyone who's tried to drive down here in Atlanta traffic knows it's quite difficult to get around. So, to accommodate some of the logistics, this will happen later tomorrow. He will travel here from Bedminster, New Jersey. He is expected to surrender in the evening. And it's also expected, we're told, to be a pretty quick trip. It's not going to be an overnight. But watching that process, Brianna, we expect, because the district attorney has said all of the defendants in this case will be handled just like anyone else. That would mean fingerprints and a mug shot. In the other three criminal cases that he has faced, they have opted not to do a mug shot. As of now, we expect that he will have a mug shot taken. Those so far have been released publicly. But, again, that's our expectation. But that's something we're really watching, because this would be the first time that he would have a mug shot. Even though this is his fourth indictment, this would be the first time we see a photo like that of the former president, not only the first time in his legal issues, but the first time in the history of the United States.",

Ken Chesebro has been sort of described by the January 6 Committee and in this indictment from Fani Willis as the architect of the fake electors scheme. We obviously know that that happened in seven states, including Georgia, and it was a core part of this broader effort to overturn the election. Now, we expect a steady stream of more of these defendants to show up and turn themselves in at the Fulton County Jail throughout the day, ahead of Trump's expected arrival tomorrow. Obviously, Rudy Giuliani is the biggest name that we know of and anticipate showing up here today.

We had a federal judge in an earlier fight involving another lawyer, John Eastman, and Trump say that this alleged attempted overthrow of the 2020 election was a coup in search of a legal theory.

They're quoted saying -- quote -- \"An investigation has been launched into the crash of the Embraer Air aircraft, which occurred tonight in the Tver region.\" That's a region that's sort of north of Moscow, south of St. Petersburg. We, of course, know that Yevgeny Prigozhin has essentially his headquarters in St. Petersburg, even though large parts of his organization have moved to Belarus in the Tver region. \"According to the list of passengers, among them is the surname of Yevgeny Prigozhin,\" it says there. We're also hearing that possibly 10 people in total were on board that aircraft, that that aircraft is an Embraer Air 160, an aircraft like that owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin's company, by Yevgeny Prigozhin himself. So, possibly, this could be very big news, as the Russians are treating this very much as possibly Yevgeny Prigozhin being on that aircraft left, obviously, right now, his whereabouts very much unknown.

And there were many people who were wondering about Yevgeny Prigozhin's safety and whether or not there could be payback from Vladimir Putin or from the Russian Security Services.

Remember, Russian state media is not Yevgeny Prigozhin's friend, frankly, at the moment. He's the man who led that unsuccessful coup and then disappeared for a number of days. And it's fair to say he's a man who's good at hiding his whereabouts. The fact he's listed on this very rare aircraft -- you don't see many of them flying around, frankly, Russia, at all -- doesn't immediately suggest that he had to have been on the aircraft, though we are dealing with an extraordinary moment, potentially, which is the question that so many had asked. How does this man, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who appeared to have led that coup, and then changed his mind radically on the way to Moscow, how did he stay alive this long? Those who've even half upset Vladimir Putin as much in the past have met a grisly end, fallen from windows, some critics, some poisoned as well. Prigozhin essentially led an armed rebellion against the Kremlin head, yet lived and, as you said, Jim, was seen in Africa a matter of days ago. And so many Kremlin watchers were wondering, how precisely did he manage to survive? Was a deal cut? We know of the public deal arranged by a man who Putin had scorn for, frankly, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, that essentially appeared to have turned Wagner's troops around on the way to Moscow. But what happened to Prigozhin next was going to be an exceptionally difficult question to answer. We have heard from -- today from Russian officials the suggestion that one of the Russian generals who were thought to have been close to the Wagner head, Prigozhin, have suddenly been removed quietly from their post after suggestions they have been under house arrest for some time, General Surovikin. And so this fate potentially comes at a similar time as that. But it's important to point out to people we know little at this time. This is a moment, potentially, where people might suggest that Yevgeny Prigozhin now disappears for a while. We don't know. If he's been listed on that plane, does he emerge shortly and say to everybody, he's actually fine? Did he get back from Africa suddenly very quickly and find himself on this private jet? A lot of questions to be answered here, but it's important to point out these are state media channels, and the state agency Rosaviatsiya telling us that he's indeed on that private jet. That may not have happened by accident. We're still, I think, trying to work out what's really happened here, but if state messages are this clear, there may be a bid suggest that Prigozhin was indeed on that plane, the fate of which is now clear, Jim.",
