We've fought for peace together. And those bonds are incredibly strong. But look, we can't dwell on history is my view. We have an incredible history together -- our two countries -- but we've got to reimagine our relationship to make sure it's relevant to now. That it's dealing with the particular opportunities and challenges that we face today. And that's why the declaration that President Biden and I announced today -- that closer partnership between our two countries -- is so important. It's the first type of agreement like that that either of us have reached and it speaks to making sure that we are ready for the future, and that's what I'm excited about. Our values are enduring.
