For the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, the ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Russia's president over alleged war crimes. The court says Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for his scheme to illegally deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.The ICC has also issued a similar warrant for Russia's so-called commissioner for children's rights, who oversees the deportation effort. According to Ukraine and its allies, the scheme forces many Ukrainian children to undergo political reeducation and to be adopted by Russian families. Ukraine's president says at least 16,000 children have been removed from their country so far.

This isn't going to immediately end the violence that we're seeing in Ukraine or the war crimes allegedly being committed. However, the ICC's hope and belief is that this may act as a deterrent measure. Of course we also heard from the European Union's own foreign policy chief, acknowledging this is a significant and historic step. It is unprecedented, the first time we have seen a sitting head of state facing this kind of warrant. Josep Borrell also signaled this is only the beginning, this is a first step. And, of course, as we know from our teams on the ground, there are countless teams investigating Russia's aggression in Ukraine as it happens. So while the impact may not be immediate, this is an ongoing, long- term process.

Russia, though, is not either. And inside the administration, there really has been a rolling debate over how much support the U.S. should extend to the criminal court as it investigates war crimes by the Russians in Ukraine. In December, though, Congress did modify legislation that previously restricted an administration's ability to help the International Criminal Court, now providing a lot of authorities for the administration to do exactly that. But President Biden has yet to make a decision on what he will provide to the court.

So in some way, it might be a question of sending a message that people should not be engaging in this kind of behavior that is unlawful. Indeed, the prosecutor has called it a war crime. So that may be one reason. The other reason is that there may be -- the prosecutor may still be working on other allegations and investigations so that, in a couple of months' time or in a couple of weeks' time, we might be seeing something else. And the third factor might be as well the fact that there's so many alleged war crimes happening in Ukraine. I think the prosecutor general in Ukraine has something like 72,000 potential cases of war crimes. So it also may be an issue of coordination, where the International Criminal Court potentially takes on some of the allegations while other actors, Ukrainian domestic authorities, take on something else.

Riot police threw tear gas into crowds gathered at the Place de la Concorde as some protesters chanted for president Emmanuel Macron to resign.Friday night's skirmishes are the latest since he decided to push through the contested pension overhaul without a full parliamentary vote. Senior international correspondent Sam Kiley is in Paris with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Here in the Place de la Concorde, at the head of the Champs-Elysees, currently blocked by riot police, we're just outside the important building around which all of this has been focused, the National Assembly. And it was there on Thursday that Emmanuel Macron's prime minister decided to use his presidential fiat to drive through reforms to the economy here, which would mean the pensionable age would go from 62 to 64. Now that has ignited two days of demonstrations focused here on the Place de la Concorde but that have spread elsewhere in Paris. Earlier on in the evening, these monuments under reconstruction were very much the focus of the demonstrations; indeed, of the rioters. There were pitched battles backward and forward, as the police tried to not only contain the violence and prevent these monuments and other sites that are being restored from being damaged. Elsewhere, of course, there was a burning of cars and the previous day of rioting as the police managed to drive people away from this area. But they took the fight deeper into the city. Now the local police have said that so far about a dozen -- and that number is likely to be rising -- people have been arrested and about 4,000 people attended this rally. Rallies have also been conducted elsewhere in the country. There is a vote of no confidence scheduled for Monday against the government of Mr. Macron in the National Assembly. But even if that goes against him, it doesn't mean that he has to step down as president. He is elected independently of the National Assembly. And then on Thursday, the unions, both private and public sector unions, are expected to bring many, many millions, they hope, out on strike and possibly onto the streets of the entire country in protest against these economic reforms -- Sam Kiley, CNN, in Paris.

Voters in Africa's most populous nation are heading back to the polls today to elect new governors in 28 out of Nigeria's 36 states.

He said that would push it above a regulatory threshold and argued the bank didn't need it.Other investors didn't appear to agree. That day, Credit Suisse shares tanked, trading down 30 percent at one point. After the market closed, Switzerland's central bank said it could extend a line of liquidity if needed. And Credit Suisse quickly agreed, accepting a loan of up to $53.7 billion. A relief rally followed Thursday but the rally lost luster as the day wore on. And on Friday it went in reverse. Credit Suisse has closed the week down 26 percent despite the massive injection of money. It's already in the midst of a restructure but investors and clients are impatient. And if that continues, well, the bank may be forced to sell more of its units or be taken over altogether by a rival. The markets have closed for the weekend but talks about Credit Suisse's future are likely underway. And the market open on Monday could see more share price volatility for this embattled bank -- Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Meanwhile, the Biden family remains in the crosshairs of the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee; in part, because of the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop. CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPNDENT (voice-over): House Republicans stepping up their probe into Hunter Biden and other members of President Joe Biden's family, digging into overseas business dealings with the Chinese energy company, hoping to find evidence tying the payments to the president himself but have yet to prove any link. REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): There was a lot of money that transferred from China to the Bidens. And what we want to know is, what did China get in return?",

A transaction that was first publicized by Senate Republicans in 2020. Walker then transferred a third of those funds to various Biden family bank accounts, over a three month period. The new information uncovered by the House GOP, $35,000 in payments to Hallie Biden, Beau Biden's widow. $25,000 of which was linked to the Chinese energy company.

Today, Hunter Biden tried to take the offensive, countersuing a computer repairman who released information from his laptop, central to the GOP investigations against him. The filing accused the technician John Paul Mac Isaac of invasion of privacy, claiming he sent a hard drive containing data inside a stuffed animal, to his father in New Mexico and also a copy to a lawyer who worked with Trump's then-attorney, Rudy Giuliani, all in a bid to help Trump win in 2020.
