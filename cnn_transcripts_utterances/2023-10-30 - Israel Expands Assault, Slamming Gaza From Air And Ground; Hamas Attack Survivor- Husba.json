Israeli military officials say new troops and tanks are inside of Gaza now as the Israeli military hunts for Hamas, and what's believed to be more than 200 hostages in that underground tunnel system underneath Gaza.And in the sky, new strikes and new explosions as U.N. security officials prepare to meet amid urgent calls for a pause in the bombings so desperately needed food, water, fuel and medical supplies can get in to Gaza. Let's get right to CNN's Jeremy Diamond he is in Sderot about a mile from the Gaza border. Jeremy, you've been hearing the steady drumbeat of new strikes and explosions. What are you seeing at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. And in just the last few minutes, as you can see over my right shoulder that plume of smoke is the result of an explosion inside of Gaza. And this comes as Israeli forces have really been expanding their ground operations inside of Gaza over the last several days. And just today, the IDF spokesman vowing that Israel will continue to add troops as part of this ground offensive inside the Gaza Strip. We have been hearing throughout the day and seeing the sights and sounds of war as we've been hearing outgoing artillery fire from very near to our position where we're standing right now.Jets circling overhead. We've seen some drone activity as well. And we also saw earlier just an hour ago or so some smoke appearing to emerge from just across the northern border of Gaza, in southern Israel not exactly clear what that was from, but it appeared to be some kind of explosion on the Israeli side of that border with Gaza. We know that fighting has been ongoing between Israeli forces inside the Gaza Strip and Hamas militants. We have been hearing the thud of machine gunfire throughout the day. And it's also clear that Israeli forces are getting deeper inside the Gaza Strip. Initially, we saw the troops were entering Gaza from the northern entrance to Gaza, tanks rolling in. But what we're also learning is that troops are at least two miles into the Gaza Strip on the coastline with Gaza. But also we saw this new video of tanks, of one tank at least in the southern part of Gaza City, which is again not where we are right here, which is the northeastern corner of Gaza that you have behind my shoulder. And in this video you actually see a tank appearing to fire on a passenger vehicle. Now we don't know who was in that passenger vehicle and in response to an inquiry from CNN about that incident, Spokesman Major Nir Dinar said, how can you tell there aren't terrorists inside that car? He said Hamas has no Jeeps or tanks, they use civilian equipment for their military purposes, indicating very strongly there, that tank was firing at a military target and not at a civilian targets. CNN of course cannot independently verify who was inside that vehicle. But these are the kinds of images that we are going to start getting more of particularly as communications are starting to be restored inside the Gaza Strip. We're going to start getting more videos from Palestinian journalists who are inside Gaza but also from civilians using their cell phones showing what is happening to their city and their towns.",

You mentioned the U.N. Security Council, the emergency meeting called today by the UAE. We understand that they're seeking a binding resolution calling for humanitarian pause.Now you remember, of course, that there is a serious controversy a serious spat between the United Nations and Israel, so very unlikely that that would be followed, even if it did pass but the U.S. and Israel looking increasingly isolated on the world stage. Last week, the U.N. General Assembly voted for a non-binding resolution overwhelmingly calling for humanitarian truce, only 12 other countries stood alongside U.S., the U.S. and Israel against that vote. I know you're also playing images of the desperation on the ground there. These are the warehouses that belong to the U.N. people there, going inside breaking into those warehouses desperately taking just the basic survival. I mean, just soap, water, flour, anything they can to feed their families provide for their loved ones on the ground. The United Nations says we're seeing the breakdown of civil order after three weeks of near constant bombardment and siege. And with nowhere safe to go, the international community is saying there are grave violations of epic proportions taking place on the ground.",

Officials now say the terrorists kidnapped 239 people in the October 7th attacks. Every single one of those families still trying to clean to hope that they will see their loved ones again. And one of those families is the Lovey family. Now Moshe Lavi, he was on our show two weeks ago and detailed what happened when his brother-in-law, Omri, was kidnapped from his kibbutz Nahal Oz. Now, Moshe's sister, Lishay and her two young daughters they were there as well. They survived the attack but endured hours of terror, only to have, Omri, ripped away from them. We're seeing pictures of them here. He is still missing. I want to play for you some of what Moshe told us about what his sister endured. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: They were treated violently. The babies were woken up with guns pointed at their heads. And I'm sure that two-year-old Roni will be remembering this for the rest of her life. I have my first memory when I was two years old from falling down the staircase, and I'm sure this will be much more traumatic to her. They were -- later were grouped with another family, another two more families in a different house. When they entered, they went through the kibbutz, they saw bodies lying around. So, houses being burned with people inside. When they entered, they saw a teenaged girl lying dead, shot on the spot by Hamas terrorists. They saw a terrified family. The parents, the two siblings of that young lady terrified, hollow faces covered with blood. This was also live streamed on a Facebook off, I believe, one of the -- those who were held captive.

And now Daddy got lost and we need to find him, of course, but he got lost. And she understand that, I, her mother, I cry and I'm upset and I'm angry and she know that.
