It is 10 past 8there in France, prime time address, and it follows on, of course from that vote. Yesterday's vote of non-confidence -- no-confidence against his Prime Minister Michel Barnier. That happened roughly at this time yesterday, and what we heard from President Macron really trying to explain what happened, the political chaos that France is facing to the French people. And he said, \"the reason that Michel Barnier was toppled, the reason that France is where it's at because the extreme right, he says, and the extreme left allied together in an anti-Republican front. And he went on to explain why they did that, and he said, presidential election. That sense of chaos that they are creating is because they are eyeing up the next presidential election. And to try and bring it on, he said more quickly. But he made his position very clear. He said, \"I will fulfill my mandate to the end of my term\", and that, from what you heard there, it's 13 months, so, he's not going anywhere. But clearly, the message to the French people is that he will name a Prime Minister in the coming days, who that Prime Minister will be and how that will be received, of course, is the question given the divisions, the huge divisions in parliament in France. Let's get more from our correspondent. I want to bring in Jim Bittermann in Paris and Rym Momtaz who is the editor-in-chief of Carnegie Europe's Blog \"Strategic Europe\". And Jim, let me start with you. What stood out to you? I mean, addressing clearly the French people, trying to explain himself to the French people. Do you think the French people would buy that?",

I mean, I thinkthere was a sort of a professorial tour -- tone to it, a parental tone to it, which some people may approve of, but I think there may be some push- back on that. One of the things I think that stood out was that he made it clear that the 2024 budget, he's expecting the parliament to use this clause in the constitution to -- so that the parliament approves the 2024 budget. And he said he's going to be sending a bill to the parliament to do that, so that the 2024 budget will carry on. This will give at least some confidence to the financial markets and eliminate a little bit of the chaos, the political chaos that's here. And I think he wanted to be pretty reassuring. But at the same time, he was very critical of the people who brought the government down, being the extreme right and extreme left, and basically saying that he was going to make that clear to the French people that he -- you know, that he had named -- he had consulted before he named Michel Barnier as the Prime Minister with the various parties, and that he had thought that he had found a Prime Minister that was going to be acceptable to all. And that, of course, is going to be the problem now going forward to find someone new to replace Michel Barnier.",

I think you're right to start by bringing up what he did, what he triggered in June which was this dissolution of parliament, a new parliamentary elections. And actually, I think what was interesting about this speech is that at the top, he clearly came as close as Macron probably will get to basically recognizing that maybe that dissolution of parliament wasn't the best political move. I also thought it was interesting how clearly this is the clearest response from him on this issue, this request by the far-right and the far-left for him to resign, him saying very clearly he's staying here for the next 30 months. Now, who could help him stay in power for the next 30 months? Is the big question. Some people are putting a lot of money on him, finally building a center- left coalition --",

And, you know, everyone is to blame in this, whether it's the President's party or other parties and opposition parties. If Macron decides to try to give it a go with the center-left, they're going to butt-head over whether they can overturn his pension reform. He is very attached to his pension reform. He considers it as being super important to keep trying, to keep the country's finances on a recovery road, even though right now they're not really on a recovery road. And the left clearly wants to overturn his pension reform. So, that's going to be the first biggest obstacle for example, and let's see if both of them, Emmanuel Macron, his party on the one hand and the left, Greens on the other, can actually show how compromise can be built.",

You have a lot of buffering before it gets to the surface of the ocean, the ocean bottom. But when you have the earthquake very close to the bottom of the ocean, then you're going to move that land very quickly, a lot like we saw in Banda Aceh. So, this is a 7.0. It isn't the Banda Aceh quake, but this is a significant inundation tsunami warning for the people here of northern California and southern Oregon. We do know that there was shaking on land here, especially near Fort Bragg. Here's a -- that would be about -- there's Eureka there, but we get all the way down a little farther to the south. This is where we're actually seeing about 19,000 customers without power. So, not only did it shake in the ocean, but it did of course, shake on land. So, yes, we do have that yellow warning for damage, but so far the green warning for any fatalities. That's the good news. Which means probably less than ten and in many times just zero when you get through that green. Doesn't mean it's exactly because these things can change, because it is considered a strong earthquake. 7.0 is in a very strong category here and there are somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15 of these worldwide throughout the year. So, not a rare event, but one per month, maybe something like that. So, yes, we're going to get aftershocks and they could also cause small tsunamis at best. But this could get all the way down towards San Francisco, along this ring of fire. This is the Cascadia subduction zone. We expect and we always knew that there were potential for big earthquakes with tsunamis in this subduction zone. It's all a part of the ring of fire, all a part of the Pacific Ocean. The shaking also happening on land today, not just under the ocean, but that ocean movement causes the water movement causes the waves to move on shore.",

Now, investigators can turn around and they can actually see whether or not this is the person that they're looking for, or if it's somebody that they can rule out entirely. Now, this really sort of brings everything to a turning point because now they can actually redouble their efforts. And now, they're going to start getting even more tips than they've been getting before, because that's what's happened since the release of the photos. Detectives and investigators have just gotten even more tips from people saying that they have might have seen them or might have heard -- or might have seen this person. So, that's what these photos typically do in these situations. Now, as far as the investigation intensifying, what we're having -- what we're noticing now is that investigators were able to recover a water bottle that was left along the escape trail by the person who was believed to be the shooter. A fingerprint was recovered taken from that water bottle, but it was smudged. And the significance of the smudging means that it's not as easy to connect that to a possible fingerprint. But as we've said, this is all part of the investigative process because investigators are not only backtracking to see how the shooter got to that location, but they're also seeing the whereabouts as to where he left from there. So, they're really trying to build out every single piece of this to decide where he was going, where he went after, and through that, determine exactly who he is.",

SUSAN HOUGH, SEISMOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY:  So, this is one of the most active earthquake zones in California. The offshore of Cape Mendocino is where the San Andreas Fault ends and it transitions to what we call a triple junction where three tectonic plates come together. It's complicated. It produces a lot of moderately large earthquakes and now, we've had the most recent magnitude 7. If this one was offshore by a good 80 kilometers or so, it was south of the major population centers in Eureka and Arcata. So, that will help, that will focus the strongest shaking offshore instead of on land. The tsunami warnings -- and people should follow the appropriate tsunami warning centers. That zone does not generally produce earthquakes that are what we call tsunamigenic. You have tsunamis when the seafloor moves vertically, like with a big subduction zone and the C4 moves up or down. This earthquake had a lateral motion from everything we can see. And at magnitude 7, it's not generally, excuse me, the type of earthquake that we expect to generate a significant tsunami.",

Anybody that was driving would have felt it. It would disrupt your driving. It is possible to have a modest tsunami if there's undersea slumping, for example. You can get a local tsunami. So, I don't mean to suggest there's zero risk. You know, for an earthquake like this, the accounts are indicating damaging levels of shaking in some areas enough to damage chimneys, knock things off of shelves, that sort of thing. There's always a concern for aftershocks for something this large. And that region has at times produced sequences of events where you get, you know, maybe more than one moderately large earthquake. So, anytime you have earthquake activity, you need to be on your toes. That more activity becomes more statistically likely.",

It's possible that you might have -- well, we expect tohave aftershocks, you know, smaller events. People can expect to feel aftershocks. Yes, I'm not sure what -- why the cars are backed up like that. It's actually possible -- excuse me, it's possible that was road damage. And that could be disrupting traffic. So, I think the bigger risk, given what we've seen in the past, it wouldn't be a tsunami. It would be for damage from the 7. It was big enough to damage roads. And then, for subsequent earthquakes, you know, people in that region need to be aware that there is now a higher likelihood that they'll feel more shaking and it could be from additional strong events.",
