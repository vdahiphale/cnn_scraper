      "sentences": "It's actually kind of scary. University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, he told me the best way to get deflation would be a recession. And he said, \"this is extremely dangerous and feeds on itself. The Fed would be terrified. It's very hard to get out of a deflationary spiral.Now, deflation freaks out the Fed because it can really stall the economy in its tracks. I mean, think about it, if you knew you could buy something cheaper next month, then you would never buy it right now. And if that spreads throughout the economy, that would cause prices to go even further, which would delay people from buying things. It can really become a doom loop. So, what you really want is for the economy to grow into the current level of prices, meaning, paychecks would keep going up, prices kind of stay in check, and people are finally able to catch up. Now, the ironic part here is that some economists are raising questions about the Trump plan. Remember his economic agenda includes massive new tariffs. One report says that this would cost the average American family at least $1,700 a year. He's calling for a massive immigration crackdown. That could cause a shortage of workers, lift wages and prices. And he's argued that the president should have a say, some sort of way to influence Fed policy. Of course, there's a good reason that politicians don't get to say where mortgage rates go because they'd obviously like to keep everything low to please voters, even if rates needs to be high to get inflation down. So, the ironic part here is, there are some concerns that the Trump plan won't just solve inflation, that it could actually make matters worse. Kate.",

But abortion was handled excellently last night. The biggest mistake Democrats could have made is making it all abortion all the time. Instead they had these personal impact stories that are talking about the exceptions, rape, incest, life of the mother, protecting women's future fertility with that husband and wife. I thought that was a very powerful moment on an issue that Republicans essentially hid from at our convention. We were not talking about abortion because it is not a winning issue.
