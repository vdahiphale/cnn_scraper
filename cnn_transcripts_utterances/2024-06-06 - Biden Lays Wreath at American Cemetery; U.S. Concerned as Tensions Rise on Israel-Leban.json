There was one person that he didn't name Donald Trump, the former presidentwho he'll be running against ever so lightly, it's an almost undoubtedly so in the upcoming elections. And it was a reference to the isolationist path that Donald Trump appears to want to take and said that he wants to take the United States on one that would perhaps break ties with NATO that would not support Ukraine in its war against Russia. And President Biden made it very clear. He said that this is the isolationism didn't work 80 years ago, and it doesn't work today. So that was a message against -- for his political competitor in the upcoming U.S. elections there. But there was also this message for coming generations, I suppose, if you will, a message that was learned and paid for in blood by the veterans that he was meeting today. And that was that unchecked tyranny is paid for in the blood or with the blood of the young and the brave, that if you don't stand up to it today, then more people will die. And this is why -- you know the Veterans of D- Day landing their memories and recollections and what they represent to the world today was such an important core part of what President Biden wanted to say. Because it was very clearly that if we have to stand up to the likes of President Putin and other autocrats and dictators around the world, there is no easy way. Freedom is not free he said, and we heard that from other speakers today. So this was the sort of power and the substance two messages, one for his political opponent back home and one for his international adversaries, if you will, on the on the global stage for a peaceful, stable and democratic future that he champions.",

I believe, more than thousands of those, at least at least 1,500 belong to U.S. servicemen after the war. Servicemen and their families were asked if they would like the bodies to come home, and many chose to have them in turn, where they fell in. And it's to these fallen soldiers. On D-Day, and the days that followed, there were 12 weeks of better fighting just to take control of Normandy. It was not easy. The beaches were the beginning. But the death toll steadily mounted after that. And this is to whom President Biden is commemorating and visiting. And just think over the past 80 years of generations of families of the families of those fallen there, the families, and veterans who survived D- Day have come and walked a similar path and paid similar tributes.

The signs and signals are there for those people who will delve into their history books as King Charleshas and does and as President Biden has and does do they know this.

They'll understand that there was Nazi Germany, perhaps and the World War was fought and tens of millions of people died in it. But they perhaps won't understand and see the similarities as these two leaders do. Between events today, the President Putin's desire to take more territory because he feels it's within the ambit of the history of his own nation as he -- as he sees it. Hitler decided that he was going to take control of territory that he thought should fall under Nazi Germany's orbit of influence. And so it went, but similarities are there. So in speaking about tyranny, they're both trying to evoke that time in the past to give an understanding to the present generation. But there's a thing about humans, I suppose at a very simple level Max. That is we don't pass memories down through DNA. The lessons learned by these veterans 80 years ago, are not with their children in their DNA, they must be learned in schools and at ceremonies like this at commemorations like this. And this is what today is about and this is why we're hearing this sort of language because these are important lessons and understanding because the challenges that face Europe in the United States today could call upon them to have to dig deep into their reserves of the young and the brave as much as Ukraine does the day to put troops on the front line.",

Remember that the artificial ports, such an extraordinary feat of engineering and coordination between the allied armies took several weeks to be built. And of course, crucial to the success of those initial waves of men coming in to these beaches, like here on Gold Beach was the ability of allies to be able to resupply them. And perhaps you can see from this dock, what this speech looks like today to the point that Nic was making a moment ago about these events being made to speak to the young and remind them of what went on here. There's a lot of families out here today, a lot of people who've come either dressed in the fatigues of the time driving vehicles like this one or the jeep stuff on the land. And a lot of families who brought their children to show them more about what went on here 80 years ago. And I'm just going to take you for this ride now Max into the water to show you how extraordinary these vehicles are. We're getting to head in to -- the channel, these were the boats that are remarkably difficult to maintain, because going in and out of the water -- requires and imagine a great deal of maintenance and love and care. But it was insane 80 years ago, that allowed the allies in constant waves of resupply to drive into the water out of -- and dock with them with all the equipments that they needed. Look at that, here we are into the water - - on both side this dock Max it was five to six pounds of equipment carried over each time -- further and further of course as the days were on beyond D-Day further and further inland.

This would be the second time of course, in two weeks that we would have seen U.S. munitions being used in areas that are sheltering civilians. And as you mentioned, this was a U.N. run school that has thousands of civilians. Now according to the U.N. Agency for Palestine, refugees, some 6000 people at least were believed to be sheltering inside the school, but approximately 20,000 people overall have been sheltering on the grounds of this particular un premises. Now the Israeli military has said it was targeting Hamas infrastructure. It believes that was a Hamas center within the U.N. run school. But clearly this was an area that was densely populated. At least 45 people are killed in these overnight strikes. Our -- on the ground in Gaza reporting three missile strikes overnight, the U.N. agency saying they believe several strikes took place. And of course, as we know, the hospitals across the Gaza Strip are severely overrun. Medics on the ground say and health officials on the ground say they believe that death toll could continue to rise up. They are continuing to see casualties being brought in. And of course, this comes just the day after we saw another strike in Central Gaza targeting the -- region, again an area where thousands of civilians are sheltering. Important to underscore of course, what we have seen over the last few days and weeks is civilians who had been sheltering in the south, particularly in areas in and around the City of Rafah, where, of course, the Israeli military is intensifying its operations. We have seen civilians returning to Central Gaza in search of any kind of safety that they can find.

      "sentences": "Becky, really the backdrop is that inflation is finally easing. It's finally coming off the multi decade highsthat it's reached in the past few years. And of course, central banks around the world rapidly hiked interest rates to combat those rapid price rises that we saw in energy and food and many of the goods and services that we consume. There are signs now that are easing. I think many of us would feel -- still feeling the effects of those high prices. We may not be feeling like inflation is coming down, but certainly the pace of price rises is falling, is slowing. And so it looks now like we are heading into a period of rate cuts, Becky.",

Priscilla Alvarez joins us from Washington. And, you know, I know that you've been given some briefing on how powerful the speech would be.

Now this was a forceful address by President Biden against a very somber setting. And over the course of his remarks, he talked about the heroics of the soldiers that day. But then he went on to talk about democracy, and then it's not guaranteed and -- what this the sacrifice of those soldiers to get to where we are today, and in some ways, sort of passing the batons to the next generation, noting that this may be the last major milestone for the veterans that you see seated behind him and will democracy fade with them given the resurgence of autocracy. And so that was by part, a very important part of his remarks going into today. And he talked about the strength of alliances and noting that isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago, and it's not the answer now. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia, of course not present for this anniversary. But clearly, Max, just a very somber moment and when the President wanted to mark by noting the importance of democracy, we'll hear more about that exact issue and remarks tomorrow by President Biden.",
