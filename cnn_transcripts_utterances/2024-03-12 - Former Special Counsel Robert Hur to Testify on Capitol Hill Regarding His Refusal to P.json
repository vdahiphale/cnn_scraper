Former Special Counsel Robert Hur will soon be on the hot seat on Capitol Hill, defending not only his decision not to charge President Biden for his handling of classified documents, but also why he described the president as an elderly man with a poor memory who couldn't even remember his own son's death date. CNN is now getting a look at the transcripts of the conversationbetween Biden and Hur that left the special counsel with that impression. According to the transcripts, President Biden was telling a story that he framed that was between the times of 2017 and 2018. During it, he brought up his son, Beau, saying, quote, \"Remember, in this timeframe, my son is either deployed or is dying.\" He then went on to say, \"What month did Beau die?\" \"Oh, God,\" Biden responded, \"May 30th.\" That's when someone in the room interjected to say Beau died in 2015, not between 2017 and 18. CNN's Evan Perez has reviewed these transcripts. Evan, this is a really big moment because there's been a lot of talk, this has been a fodder for a lot of political fighting. You now have the actual words that were used. What else did you find in this report that related to Biden's memory?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, I think the big takeaway from the report is that the president repeatedly said that he didn't really handle a lot of these papers, that he left it to staff. He didn't know how things were packed and how things were moved from, for example, his vice presidential residence to a home he rented in Virginia to his home in Wilmington. Repeatedly, he said, I don't remember exactly how that how that got moved from one place to another.And I think obviously the special counsel, Rob Hur, points out the memory problems. But the big one, obviously, that that stuck out was the one that you just read, the interaction about Beau Biden. It's clear that the president remembered the date exactly, May 30th, that his son died. But someone in the room then suggests the dates. And I'll read you another part of the of the transcript where you could see that he has a foggy memory of where things happened. Rob Hur asks the president, \"But do you remember how these materials got into this box and how that box got into the garage?\" which was where one of these some of these documents were found. President Biden says, \"No, I don't remember how a beat-up box got into the garage.\" The tone that we get from the transcript, and to be fair, we don't have the audio from -- the audio recording from the interview, which lasted about five hours, over five hours, over two days last October, Sara. What we have is -- what I've read is simply just the transcript of it. And what comes across is an atmosphere where the president is joking with people in the room. There's laughter. It's generally a pretty genial atmosphere, a very cooperative atmosphere, which is, I think, why the White House and people around the president were so surprised by the words that came out in that 388-page report from Rob Hur.",

Well, this is a big part of this investigation, because it's not only the classified documents that were found in the garage and in different places, including his private office after he left the vice presidency, but it's also his handwritten notes. And those contain, according to the special counsel, according to the investigation, they do contain some very sensitive information.And so, I'll read you just one interaction from the second day of this interview in which Mark Krickhbaum, the deputy special counsel, says, \"OK, but I think it would be helpful for us to understand. And I think with respect to your notebooks that you wrote by hand, you view these as yours.\" President Biden says, \"Yes, they're mine.\" But Krickhbaum says, \"And you were authorized to have them?\" President Biden says, \"Every president before me has done the exact same thing.\" And I think that's going to be a big part of the discussion in today's hearings, Sara, because President Reagan took home notes when he left the presidency, he took notes that he took from while he was president. There was some controversy over that at the time. And President Biden is saying, everything that I took I was authorized to have and those are mine. Obviously, the National Archives and I think some people in the federal government believe that that shouldn't be the case, because if you bring, if you write notes while you're president, those belong to the archives and to the people of the United States.

We learned he is testifying today as a private citizen. And not only that, he has hired as a personal attorney someone who has represented prominent Republican figures before, including folks in Trump world. And CNN now has our hands on the opening statement he will deliver. It is about five pages or so long. In it, extensively he goes into why he leaned into President Biden's memory here to explain why he did not bring charges.Let's get right to CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. She has got much more on what we can expect from Robert her. And if he wanted to take the temperature down here, Paula, I have to say this opening statement, I'm not sure it's going to do that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And you know what, in speaking to sources close to him over the past year covering this investigation, I'm not sure he cares if he, quote, takes the temperature down here. He views himself as not being partisan, as being a special counsel who is independent. And he knows that folks on both sides of the aisle are unhappy with him.John, I actually just got off the phone with a source close to Hur who talked to me a little bit about how he's preparing for the big day. And as you noted, he has hired a lawyer who has worked with former President Trump and his allies. And I want to note, though, before he left the Justice Department last week, the Office of Legislative Affairs at the Justice Department actually helped him prepare for today. They did moot hearings, these are practice arguments. That is significant because it's just another example of how he has received a support from the Biden Justice Department. Now, once he left the Justice Department last week, he has continued to practice with his attorney and others for today's hearing, anticipating questions that he's going to get on both sides. They know that Republicans are probably going to hammer him on why he opted not to charge Biden. They will probably make some comparisons to the classified document prosecution of former President Trump. Hur is going to be ready for that. He also knows that Democrats are going to amplify these criticisms from the White House about comments he made about Biden's memory. But as we see in his opening statement, he defends that, saying, quote, he needed to show his work. Now, we also anticipate, according to the source, Hur emphasized that he did not find President Biden, quote, innocent. It's just that he did not think that he could win at trial. Now, as you just heard Evan Perez talking about some of this new information coming out about the interview from Biden, I asked the source about the timing for this new information, and they said, look, it's clear the White House is concerned that under questioning Hur could potentially release new, possibly damaging additional details about the president. They're trying to get out in front of that. But the source again noted that the tape of that interview has not been released. So this is notable. And I also want to emphasize that the source did that even though the White House is quite upset with Hur, a lot of Democrats are, it was the attorney general, the Biden handpicked attorney general Merrick Garland who oversaw this investigation and clearly did not object to the contents of this report.",

I'll read you some of it: \"Asked he kept papers that he was working on, Biden began a story framing the context as the 2017-2018 era. The president brought up his son, Beau, who he said had encouraged him to remain politically engaged. Remember, in this time frame, my son is either deployed or is dying, Biden said, according to the transcript. The president brought up his son's death, and he remembered the month and day. What month did Beau die? Oh, God, May 30th, several people in the room interjected to remind him that his son died in 2015.\" Now, Robert Hur also determined that there was not evidence enough to win a conviction on the documents question. That was the key of the investigation. No charges were recommended. Hur will address all of this when he testifies this morning before a house committee. In his opening statement, as CNN has obtained, he is expected to say this: \"The evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue.\" Also saying his task was to determine if the president willfully retained or disclose national defense information with the intent to do something the law forbids. Hur will add according to the opening statement: \"I could not make that determination without assessing the president's state of mind.\" Joining us now is Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He serves on the Senate Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees. He is also national co-chair for the Biden-Harris re-election campaign. Senator, thank you so much for being here. What is your reaction to what I've laid out there? CNN's reporting on the actual transcript of the president's interview with Hur, and also his commentary about Biden's memory that he will be bringing up in his opening statement this morning. SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Kate, look, I think what really matters here about this whole kerfuffle is that at the end of the day, former President Donald Trump is facing 40 felony counts in a federal action because of his mishandling of federal classified documents, while President Joe Biden has been cleared. All the back and forth about the commentary by the special counsel, I think at the end of the day has been put to rest by President Biden's forceful and compelling State of the Union address on Thursday, which makes it clear that the stray comments by a special counsel and a report really don't amount to much compared to the underlying reality that President Biden has deep respect for the classified document process, fully cooperated, and his predecessor did not.",

That is the last thing on earth I want to do. I want to see us get a hostage deal. I'm wearing this yellow ribbon today because later this morning, Kate, I'm meeting with a father of an American-Israeli hostage who is still being held beneath Gaza by Hamas. This crisis in Gaza could end tomorrow. If Hamas lay down their arms and release the hostages. But this is a war, a war between Israel and Hamas and President Biden is trying to balance showing deep concern for the civilians who are suffering and in many cases, now starving in Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu and the far right-wing elements of his government, ministers like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, who have made it very difficult to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.

In my meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he said, I understand that, and we are getting a plan from the army for how we will relocate civilians before that offensive. I think it's important to keep clear that distinction.
