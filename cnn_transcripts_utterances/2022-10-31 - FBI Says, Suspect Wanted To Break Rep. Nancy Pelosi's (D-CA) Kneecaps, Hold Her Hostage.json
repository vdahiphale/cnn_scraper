As you mentioned, we are also standing by any moment for a press conference from state officials on the charges we're expecting from them.This comes as we are learning new details about the violent incident that happened here early Friday morning at the residence behind me. Sources tell CNN that Mr. Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was struck twice in the head, resulting in a skull fracture. Medics had to cut his shirt off him and because he had injuries to his arms. We're also learning chilling new details from an FBI affidavit about what the motivation was allegedly in this case, including this suspect wanting to send a message to other members of Congress. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (voice over):  Paul Pelosi, still in intensive care following surgery after a violent attack at his home Friday that left him with a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and his hands. The suspect in the attack, 42-year-old David DePape, now charged with federal crimes, assault and attempted kidnapping, after he allegedly broke into the Pelosi's San Francisco home through a backdoor, went to the bedroom and confronted Pelosi, shouting, where's Nancy, according to law enforcement. According to the federal criminal complaint, DePape stated he was going to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and talk to her. If she were to tell DePape the truth, he would let her go. And if she lied, he was going to break her kneecaps. And he said he knew she would not tell the truth. DePape also later explained that by breaking the speaker's kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other members of Congress there were consequences to their actions. DePape also attempted to tie Paul Pelosi up before the assault. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott discredited conspiracy theories the two knew each other before the break-in.",

But now, we're seeing prosecutors move the ball forward and actually filing these charges. Two quick things I want to point out, Wolf, and that is, working in law enforcement previously, I've dealt with numerous victims, and it is just chilling to hear not only what Mr. Pelosi had to endure but also to stop and think about the composure and the wherewithal that he had to try to find a way out when dealing with someone who was apparently very violent, who talked about wanting to go after his wife, Mr. Pelosi trying to get access to the phone to call 911. I mean, just nothing short of impressive there, to have that kind of composure in this very scary moment. And then the second thing, Wolf, as we hear about these details, about him being struck on the head, our sources telling us at least twice, he suffered a skull fracture, to think that there are people out there right now that we've been reporting on that are making light of this, that are making fun of this, that are laughing about this spouse of an elected leader in the U.S. being violently assaulted and could have been killed had police not responded as quickly as they did, that is simply disgusting to think that we're now at this point where not only the political rhetoric is very heated but also we've seen today there are politicians out there, some of them running for office, who are making light and laughing about what happened here yesterday morning, Wolf.",

I think Josh, as a former FBI agent who specialized in kidnappings outside the United States, has dealt with a lot of victims who have to be thinking during the kidnapping process how do I get out of this.Paul Pelosi actually moved towards an elevator inside the residence, inside the house, because he knew the elevator contained a telephone that he could get in the elevator, close the door, put it on the move, hit the stop button, access the phone and call police. And when that didn't work, he was able to -- and this was right when the suspect took out the restraints, the zip ties to tie him up. He headed to the elevator, he got blocked. He headed to the bathroom, got into the bathroom and called 911. So, we learned, you know, his wits were about him. He was trying very hard to get out of this. And we also learned from the federal charges earlier today when the police came through the door and they were both holding on to the hammer, David DePape told the FBI in the interview, according to the complaint, that he knew he was getting arrested, he wasn't going to surrender and he wasn't getting to Nancy Pelosi.
