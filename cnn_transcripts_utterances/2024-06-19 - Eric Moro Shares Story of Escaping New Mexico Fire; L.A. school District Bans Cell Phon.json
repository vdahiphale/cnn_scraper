When you hear that there is a potential test to see if you are, you know, potentially going to have Alzheimer's or headed down that road, some people get really freaked out and say, no, no, no, I don't want to know. But - so, should they get this test? What - what can they do if they get this test. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, -- so, I think we're getting to the point now where these tests are going to become more widely available and more widely recommended. We're not quite there yet. The way I'd sort of frame it, Sara, is, we're probably where we were with heart disease 60 years ago. You know, there was a time when you thought, look, you're going to get heart disease or you're not. There's not much you can do about it. And I think most people agree this point that that's not the case. We're starting to get there with brain health. And as you heard Dr. Richard Isaacson, who - in the clip there say, well, just like you get your cholesterol or your PSA or other things checked, we may get to that point with brain disease as well, including Alzheimer's. I think two things have changed. One is, the tests have gotten better. And two is that there is something you can do about it. So, you can actually be proactive based on the testing. And that makes a big difference.",

We talked to patients who said, look, you're just like staring off into the abyss when you're given that diagnosis.There was this trial that was done by Dean Ornish. It was a small trial, just around 50 patients, where they basically said, OK, let's just look at people who have been given the diagnosis and have early cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and let's see what happens if you put them into a certain lifestyle group versus people who don't do anything different with their lifestyle. And we can show you what the - what the sort of plan was for these people, but it was a vegan diet. It was 30 minutes of moderate to brisk activity. Some mild strength training. You know, a support groups. Things like that. And they did this for 20 weeks. So, five months. Then they compare the two groups and they said, look, what do we find here? And what they found was that in the group that did not get the lifestyle changes, they had a very predictable decline. And in the group that did get the lifestyle changes, they either stayed the same, many of them stayed the same, which was important because you sort of stalled the decline, or, Sara, there were some people who got better.",
