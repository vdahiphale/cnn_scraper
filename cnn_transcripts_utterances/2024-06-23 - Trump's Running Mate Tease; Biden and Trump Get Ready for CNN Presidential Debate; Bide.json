SETH MOULTON (D-MA):  Joe Biden needs to come into this and just show Americans that he's in control, he's competent, he's a normal guy. And that's such a contrast to the convicted felon he's running against. This is not a time for zingers or zealotry. Biden just needs to show confidence, command of the facts and command of his really impressive record in contrast to Trump's criminal record. That's what Biden does well.

He has done this for President Obama. He did it for Hillary Clinton as well. And he is coming into this sort of with the frame of reference -- historical reference for how these debate preparations will go. The president also has, you know, senior members of his team who have been with him for a long time, people like Mike Donilon, Anita Dunn, the messaging gurus at the White House and campaign, he has policy advisers like Bruce Reed and Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, and then senior members from his campaign, Jen O'Malley Dillon, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Cedric Richmond, people who have been with the president for a while, but also some new faces Quentin Fulks, Michael Tyler, Rob Flaherty, trying to bring as much perspective to this debate preparation as they can. Now, ordinarily presidents when they're at Camp David like to get outside a little bit. The weather this weekend there was very hot. High of 98 degrees on Saturday.

And you see it on the screen there, growing in real-time. Tens of thousands of dollars every second. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation describes itself as a nonpartisan organization dedicated to addressing America's long-term fiscal challenges, and its website is one of several places where you can see the debt increase just like that. Meanwhile, it's becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the U.S. consumer. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior.

Although, you know, there's some other instances where travel is still up. So, people are still spending money, but they're using their money in different aspects. And that hurts the big purchases where the U.S. economy and consumer spending, two-thirds of where the GDP comes from, it hurts that degree. So, I think people are starting to feel that.

They'll also be discussing a point which became a little bit even more controversial this week when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized the United States for holding back on the supply of some weapons. Indeed, in an interview, saying that only, in his words, a trickle of U.S. aid had been getting through the U.S. to Israel. Yoav Gallant will be discussing that with the United States, whose response seems to have been that they don't really know what Netanyahu was talking about on that front. They'll also be discussing, as you say, the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, the militia backed by Iran in Lebanon.Now, things started heating up there the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th, with Hezbollah firing on Israel. There have been daily tit for tat strikes ever since then. You've seen tens of thousands of people in Northern Israel displaced and also, even more people displaced from their homes in Southern Lebanon. The situation, Israel says, cannot continue. And there's been certainly an escalation in the war of words as well with Yoav Gallant himself warning that Lebanon would, in his words, be effectively bombed back to the stone age if all-out war were to ensue. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, saying that nowhere in Israel would be safe in the event of all-out war. So, the U.S. very much trying to de-escalate tensions. Indeed, Amos Hochstein, the U.S. Special Envoy, was in both Israel and Lebanon this week to try to do so. But even this morning, we've seen an explosive laden drone coming from Lebanon over into Israel, which Israel failed to intercept. No casualties, but some damage done to a settlement, to an Israeli village in the northern part of the country. So, no sign of tensions de-escalating there. Indeed, U.N.

      "sentences": "Paul Whelan seemed incredibly disheartened and in disbelief at the fact that he has spent five and a half years now in Russian detention. He called it an incredible amount of time, noting that for high school, for example, for college, you're there for four years. So, five and a half years. This far surpasses the time you would spend for those major life events.And he is calling on the U.S. government to take decisive action to bring home both himself and detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has also been deemed wrongfully detained. He says he thinks the U.S. government is taking his case seriously, but he wants them to take it more seriously. And he told me some steps that he thinks could show that they are taking decisive action on his case. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have seen a number of Americans arrested in Russia in recent months. Now, the U.S. government, on their part, has put forward what they describe as a substantial and serious proposal to secure both Evan and Paul's release from Russia. To this point, the Russians have not accepted that proposal, and we don't even know if they are actually seriously considering it.Now, as this is going on, Paul remains in this remote labor colony out in Mordovia, Russia. That's about a day's drive from Moscow, and he describes the situation there as grim. He told me that conditions are very poor. This is how he described them to me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
