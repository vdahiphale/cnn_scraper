      "sentences": "I'm Julie Chatterley in New York its 9 o'clock Eastern Standard Time. And we've just learned the FederalAviation Administration or the FAA has lifted the ground stop that has crippled air travel for the last few hours. What does this mean? Well, it now means flights across the United States are slowly resuming following a major failure of a system at the FAA or the Federal Aviation Administration. All domestic departures were halted after the system called the new term failed. It provides pilots with safety information they need before takeoff. Just over half an hour ago, some flights left Atlanta and Newark airports to mitigate traffic congestion. Other airports across the country are expected to now follow. But a backlog of departing flights of course has left passengers stranded on planes and inside terminals. There have been more than 4000 delays and nearly 700 cancellations. We're also hearing that flights are still leaving Europe's main airports bound for the United States. President Biden has also been briefed at the White House Press Secretary saying there is no evidence of a cyber-attack, at least at this point. Richard Quest joins me now I think for some vital context, which had a huge relief that the FAA still now have this system up and running and the information is beginning to flow. It clearly could have been worse, but I think the fragility of the system and the ensuing impact on very evident too. RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Yes, and that's going to be the bit that needs to be looked at why did this NOTAM, system failed? NOTAM stands for Notice to Airmen, and it is basically every single pilot, before they get on the plane and head off, will receive the NOTAMs for that particular route. It can be anything from runway closures work being done on taxiways, issues with air traffic control on Route. They are constantly updated, not to read the NOTAMs or not to pay attention to them for your route is negligent indeed. So for a U.S. system where aviation is so vast, if the NOTAM system goes wrong, then Julia, the issue becomes ensuring you don't fall through the cracks. Is there something about the flight that you're about to take as a pilot that you need to know, a runway closure, Instrument Landing System not working this or that or the other change of frequencies, all of that sort of stuff is in the NOTAMs.",

Of course,they cleared the airspace as best they could, by grounding all flights to your point that simply weren't considered at this stage, safe to take off. What do you do in that situation then for pilots that are in the air? You go back to manual and you just feed them information that they're cleared to land.",

Now, if there was to be something on Route, that I'll be notified by that. So if a runway was suddenly out of action, or there was an air traffic control problem, they would have been notified on route that this was the situation. Yes, I think there's always an element of you know, would they have been following up NOTAMs on the way possibly, but not likely? I think the reality is if you're in the air, you're going to be told what the situation is, where you are, and where you need to be? And by the way, the NOTAM system, which of course, other countries have their own versions of. So in Britain, it'll be the CAA in France, it'll be the regulatory authority there. They will have been issuing NOTAMs for their airports, and their airspace. And the whole lot comes together, when a pilot is, when an airlines flight planning, puts the route together and gives all the documentation now, of course, in the digital handbook or the digital briefcase to the pilot.",

And yes, the major U.S. airlines have come under a bit of pressure to pre-market to meet today's travel uncertaintiesalready challenged, of course southwest, taking the biggest hit as you might imagine that set to fall just over 2 percent. Some other U.S. carriers as you can see on track for some minor losses here if we stay at this stage and it's up and running and stable once again. You'd expect some of that to filter out I think as the session progresses. In the meantime, here's a look at U.S. stocks poised for a smooth takeoff overall, with futures pointing to a fourth straight day of gains for tech, the European major solidly hired to and continuing. Their strong January runs the German DAX and the French CAC are up more than 7 percent so far, in 2023, easily outperforming that Wall Street rivals the U.K. Footsie in fact less than 2 percent away now from record highs. That said of course global markets caution; still a bounce JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon saying the odds of the Federal Reserve hiking rates to higher than expected 6 percent this year and now 50-50. So even odds they're concerned too, that earnings estimates have not yet come down fast enough to reflect the economic reality. We'll get profits from the U.S. financial giants out on Friday and of course, their views on the outlook too. In the meantime, the World Bank also warning this week that the global economy will see growth of fewer than 2 percent this year that's well below previous forecasts as we were discussing on the show yesterday. World Bank President David Malpass will join us later in the show to discuss the details of that report. In the meantime, let's move on and get it to Ukraine. An intense battle continues for the Eastern town of Soledar. The Russian Defense Ministry claiming its military has now blockaded the town from the north and the south. Scott McLean joins us now from Kyiv. Scott, a whole host of use here Ukraine saying they haven't taken controls the military group, the Wagner group saying that they had taken control.

First, how many people have died because so many troops on both sides have been killed? And second where precisely the front lines are at any given point, because there is such a large gray area in the town where fighting is taking place and where both sides are claiming that they're taking control. The Ukrainian says that the Russians have been able to replace their troops very quickly. This soldier says that the Ukrainians are also doing the same. In fact, the soldiers are coming in so quickly, that he hasn't even had time to memorize their call signs just yet. What I think is especially interesting is yesterday, we heard from the Ukrainian defense ministry saying, Look, we're not ruling out the possibility that we may have to withdraw or pull our troops back in the name of preserving life and limb. This soldier seems to think that, that will happen at some point. He's just wondering why the order to do that hasn't happened already, in order to make sure that these troops can live to fight another day and potentially retake.

And then very importantly, is this capital allocation that's been going on now, for many years, where the advanced economies are borrowing so much their governments are borrowing so much. That it leaves not much in terms of capital available for the rest of the world for the private sectors, and for the poor countries so one of the big things would be making good utilization of the government spending in the advanced economies in order to free up resources.",

So it's a leap, it says somewhat a leap of faith or a recognition that if countries get poor, if there's more poverty, that's going to cause refugees, which has a direct impact. It also takes away markets that wouldn't be available for the advanced economies. So understanding that, and then I think also finding practical ways out of the excess spending. One way that's talked about it at the highest levels in the multi-national meetings that I go to what people talk about the importance of. If you have subsidies for certain parts of your population, have them be targeted to the people that really need it, and have them be time bound don't have them go on year after year, but let them wind down when they're not needed anymore and that frees up resources for everybody else.",

So what I hear and I talked with someone just night before last there, which is physically there, and said, it looks as if people are responding well enough. You know, many, many people being infected with COVID, but then finding their way through it, and the health system so far, holding up, at least in most parts of the country. So if that's the case, and then the factories begin to re increase their output, there is the upside possibilities on their growth rate and China, you know, is the world's second biggest economy, not nearly as big as the U.S. but bigger than really any of the rest of the world and so their impact matters, both on the supply side, and on the demand side.

So what concerns me about that is now what they've done is they've put the responsibility back directly on the pilot and the dispatchers to find out if there are any abnormalities in the systems. And there are ways for them to find that out. The challenge is that it really delays that system. And they have to check on every flight 25 miles north and south on each side of their flight path to see if there's any abnormalities along that flight path and with the airports as well on either in. So there's a lot of information that they have to check and that's going to continue to cause delays.",

So you have facilities and equipment budgets, you have routine maintenance budgets, or ops budgets, and those two things have to work together. And so right now they have an interim FAA administrator. And that I think, is where the biggest problem is, is their leadership has changed so many times and has been so different. And they're interim, they're not actually appointed and stay for a long period of time, then these systems take three, four or five years to maintain, to develop and maintain. So without constant leadership across the board, that's where these systems falter, because they each one of these administrators has to have their kind of own way of getting it done. And then once they start doing that, and then they're replaced with someone else whenever there's an administration change or something like that. So I think there needs to be some drastic improvement in how the leadership is maintained in the FAA.

Just as an example a fertilizer system called \"Exact Shot\" it can cut the amount of chemicals used by more than 60 percent the companies say saving farmers millions and helping the environment too. The company, which is cutting costs by using 3D printed parts, displayed its wares at the consumer electronics show including an autonomous tractor. Much to discuss Jahmy J. Hindman is the Company's Chief Technology Officer and he joins us now. Jamie, fantastic to have you with us! I think you're proving that it's a myth actually, that Agriculture remains in the relative dark ages, at least relative perhaps to other industries. And that's essential because we have to feed more people and we have to be kinder to the planet? JAHMY J. HINDMAN, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER DEERE AND COMPANY: Absolutely Julia, it's great to be with you this morning. You're exactly right. We have a billion people on the planet today we're heading towards 10 billion and we have to feed all those people and do it with less an input, less land, less chemical, less fertilizer, and technology is really a key ingredient to the answer to that problem.",

Or has very little effect on the overall health of the plant and the starting of the plant.

And it does that while inspecting the ground with these camera rays that are across the room and using computer vision and machine learning to separate the weeds from the healthy plants. And then we only spray the weeds because that's the only place in the field that the chemical the herbicide is actually useful.

So this technology that we're talking about is really focused on reducing what is the overall largest portion of their costs and their business. And we do that intentionally, right? That's where it can make the most impact for them from a business perspective.

And I know you've said in the past, look, and electrification in this regard it doesn't really work.

And so it doesn't necessarily work in all applications. We did at CES unveiled an electric full battery electric excavator is an example of a place where it does certainly make good sense from an application perspective. But in some of those large agricultural machines that we've talked about, we do look at bio-fuels as a bridge strategy to maybe an electric future, perhaps as technology changes. But as it means to reduce carbon intensity of farming today and not just for new machines importantly, it's probably worthwhile to note that our current machines are capable of consuming fully renewable diesel. So we could have impact not just on new equipment that John Deere might sell, but on the complete install base as well. And if you look at that aggregated impact, it's really significant.
