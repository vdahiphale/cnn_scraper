But instead, an 11-year-old Daniela, and 8-year-old Sofia, are being remembered, with makeshift tombstones. They were murdered, this weekend, at a shopping mall, in another mass shooting. Their mother is said to be in critical condition. Their school principal described the girls, as \"Rays of sunshine,\" imploring parents, who still have their children, quote, \"Hug your kids, and tell them you love them.\" Also, today, a 6-year-old boy, left the ICU, and found out he is the only surviving member, of his family. He was simply shopping, with his parents. And now, he's an orphan. According to a GoFundMe page, he lost his mom, his dad, and his little brother, who was just 3-years- old. An Army veteran, who administered first aid, at the scene, described the horror he saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining me is CNN Contributor, Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer, at Trace, which focuses exclusively on gun violence; Stephen Gutowski, as Gun Safety Instructor, and Firearms Reporter, for Reload.com; CNN Senior Crime and Justice Correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz; and Chris Vanghele, former Police Chief, in Newtown, Connecticut, one of the first, to respond, to the 2012 massacre, at Sandy Hook Elementary School. And so, we're going to have a conversation, right now, about all of this, and starting with both of you, because you are on opposite sides, of the gun issue. But I'm sure you can each agree that what we saw, this mass shooting, all of the mass shootings are unacceptable. STEPHEN GUTOWSKI, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, GUN SAFETY INSTRUCTOR, FIREARMS REPORTER FOR THERELOAD.COM: Yes, absolutely.

You saw legislation, last year, to that end, I don't know that it is been structured well enough, to focus on the issue.

And, over the weekend, you saw a lot of images that were out there that were really very, very graphic. And it's got us thinking, here, about the idea of going back to Emmett Till, and Emmett Till's mother, intentionally wanting the photograph, of her son, very different time, very different issue. But the notion, of using an image, to try to change policy, and what happened there began to change policy. It was a very long road, but it began to change it.",

I think the only thing that can be gained, from really seeing that is that they are now going to be subject to that vicarious trauma. Nobody needs to see what we saw that day. If they don't believe that it happened, if they don't believe, what we saw, then that's going to be their issue. But I think people already have their minds made up, in terms of which side, they're going to fall on. And to get to Jennifer's point there? Most Americans did agree. After Sandy Hook happened, President Obama made it a priority, to have gun legislation. I really thought something was going to have a major shift. I mean, at no point, in American history, that I think there was a greater chance, for something, to pass, when you have parents, going, before the Senate, and speaking their heart, about their -- the children that they lost, and there was broad-based American support for it.

Some wanted to ban guns all together.And one of the photos that I did show was right off the State Police's website, in Connecticut, which is the picture of the weapon that the shooter used, sitting right in the middle of the floor, on a first grade classroom. And that's one of the images that always sticks with me, because it's such a discordant image. You're in a first grade classroom. The last thing that you should see is a weapon that's been used, lying on the floor, on the carpet.

I mean, that's congressional. But if he can go back and say, \"Look, I understand we have to pay the debts, from the past.

When you look at what the public believes, and to include responsible gun owners, they believe these things are straightforward, and simple, and things that we need to do, in order to protect our kids. The stat that doesn't get used enough, in these debates, is that half of our teenagers, in the United States of America, are afraid, of being shot at their school.

She played in tournaments, against Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff.And she wrote, on Instagram, \"I've been really struggling with my mental health and burnout since the summer of 2022. It's become unbearable being at tennis tournaments. At this point my priority is my mental well-being and taking a break for some time. I've worked as hard as I could to push through it. I will miss being out there, and I appreciate all the continuous support.\" Let's bring in former professional tennis player, Pam Shriver. Thank you so much, for joining me.

Amanda, I'm glad she's taking care of herself that she recognized she could not push through.Really, what's the toughest injury, for any athlete, which is when your mental health isn't as healthy as you need it to be. So, she follows in the footsteps of other high-profile players, like Andreescu and Osaka, recently. But Andre Agassi wrote about it, in his book a few decades ago, Mardy Fish, on the men's side.
