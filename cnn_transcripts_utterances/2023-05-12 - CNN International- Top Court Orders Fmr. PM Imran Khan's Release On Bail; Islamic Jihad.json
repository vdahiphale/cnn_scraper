      "sentences": "Well, it certainly is encouraging from the sense that you now have the nation's highest court, the Supreme Court, ruling in favor of the argument that Khan's party, the PTI Party, has been making all along that these corruption charges are politically motivated and that the military which is not having, in any way, a favorable relationship with the former Prime Minister's party that basically they've arrested all of the senior members of the PTI.So, it's not just Imran Khan, who is now out on bail. But, you have senior leaders, strings of senior PTI leaders arrested over the past few days, including, by the way, their spokeswoman Shireen Mazari, who actually appeared right here on CNN on Tuesday. And so, you have this party locked up. But, you have the Supreme Court saying, at least for now, this particular arrest of Imran Khan, extremely popular, more than even just a household name, but really an icon in Pakistan, from cricket player to politician, in the public eye since the 1970s, on a platform, ironically, of anti-corruption and rule of law. You now have him out temporarily. And he actually said, as you mentioned, he said he is 100 percent sure he'll be rearrested again. He said by -- also that he was allowed by the National Accountability Bureau, which is the anti-corruption agency, to talk to his wife, and he said that arrest warrants against her have been issued as well. So, they're really -- what people on the ground in Pakistan and what our excellent team on the ground there says essentially is there is a lot of belief here that what the military leaders are trying to do, Bianca, is to line things up so that the government that's currently in power, which has a favorable relationship with the military. And by the way, the military is the reason, frankly, why there haven't been countless coups basically ever since 1999. Prior to 1999, the government was overturned in dramatic fashion, so many different times in Pakistan. But then, in 1999, you've got the -- you've had the military taking a much stronger role, essentially the most powerful figure working alongside the government, but they don't like the government. Then they don't like the political party that Imran Khan was a part of, and that's why they're now arresting all of these senior leaders. They continue to block social media, which is that political party's main way to get messages out to supporters. And the growing fear now is that the people who are actually charged with keeping the peace, these are soldiers who have very hard into battle experience. They've been fighting the war on terror since 2001. You're talking about some people with 23 years of experience dealing with terrorists now being tasked to be on the streets to fight against civilians. So, it's something we have to watch very closely, Bianca.",

      "sentences": "Now, we're just a couple of kilometers away from the line that divides Gaza from Israel. What we saw were two volleys of rockets being fired out of Gaza, going high up in the sky. They were intercepted by, we assumed, Israel's Iron Dome system. There were well over a dozen rockets in all fired out of Gaza. So, we don't know of any damage caused by those barrages. But, what happens is afterwards is that the debris from those interceptions falls all over. In fact, here, I picked up this piece of shrapnel that fell to the ground, just one of many that rained down around us.Now, shortly after those two volleys of rockets, there was an Israeli airstrike in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, a fairly large explosion. In just in the last seven or eight minutes, there was another airstrike in the area behind me as well. We've also been hearing occasional interceptions of smaller rockets fired out of Gaza. But, certainly, this is a change from -- after midnight, Bianca, there was actually a period of about 13 hours where there was very little, if any, fire coming in or going into Gaza, but that seems to have stopped. We know that the Egyptians are trying to mediate a ceasefire, but until now, their efforts don't seem to have resulted in anything. Bianca.",

Thank you so much.Now, to the major shift in U.S. immigration policy, a pandemic-era expulsion rule called Title 42 has expired. The American Homeland Security Chief says it does not mean getting into the country will be easier, and warns migrants not to believe what he called lies told by smugglers. With the end of Title 42, thousands of migrants, many of them seeking asylum, have made their way to the U.S.-Mexican border. And our Nick Valencia joins us now from Brownsville, Texas, which is near the Mexican border. Nick, are migrant facilities any more crowded today than yesterday before Title 42 expired?",

Title 42 ending on Thursday at 11And you're seeing people here on the streets because that's where they're waking up. These migrant facilities are just at capacity, and they have been for the last about two weeks. Between 800 and 1,000 migrants per day, that's what they're seeing, and their facilities are really just overrun, which is why people are taken to the streets to sleep here. Many of these migrants we've been speaking through throughout the week have journeyed for some upwards of 20 days. I spoke to one individual who said it took him two months to get here. And some are hanging around this area, waiting for others that they crossed with, that they were separated from, to come off potentially from those immigration buses. We know that the city of Brownsville is working hand in hand with buses and airlines to try to get migrants on to their next destination. They will be helping some migrants do just that. There is a handful of cities in the United States that groups of migrants have requested to go to, and the city is going to help them get there, places like Brooklyn and Denver, Dallas and Houston, Miami, the list is a short one. But, it's not just an impact here along the borders is what I'm trying to say. This is going to be an impact for the entire nation. What remains to be seen is, U.S. President Biden has said that this is going to be a chaotic situation. It appears at this time, though, the chaos will be over time. And what remains to be seen is whether or not these migrant facilities and the services here of cities on the border will be able to handle that chaos that is to come. Bianca.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, it wasn't that long ago that they were worried that the Ukrainians might be surrounded in Bakhmut and may have to pull out at some point. Now, it seems like the opposite, concern is true for the Russians that maybe the Ukrainians that are trying to surround them, forcing them to either surrender or to pull back.And so, as you mentioned, we are starting to see some signs of that. The Ukrainians are not giving a whole lot of detail as to where precisely they are. But, the deputy defense minister did say that they managed to move up two kilometers along the flanks of the city, within just the past week alone, which is monumental considering that over the past few months of really hard fighting with massive losses in this city, they've been fighting over a few meters, a few hundred meters a day, perhaps where the front line is moving just ever so slightly. And now, all of a sudden we're talking about two kilometers. It's a long time. You have Yevgeny Prigozhin, as you mentioned, complaining about a lack of ammunition. You also have him complaining about the Russian forces that are protecting the flanks of the city while the Wagner fighters, that he represents, seem to be in the center of the city. And now, you have the Russian Ministry of Defense, which last night put out a very unusual statement, saying that, look, things are under control in Bakhmut, now they're acknowledging that, yes, in fact, their forces have actually moved back a substantial distance in the northern part of the city, which confirms what the Ukrainians are saying. They say that it's moving to a more favorable position. Obviously, Yevgeny Prigozhin is putting it very differently, saying that this is called fleeing, not regrouping. He has actually invited the Minister of Defense, the Russian Minister of Defense to come and see for himself the situation in Bakhmut, because it seems quite dire for the Russians at this moment. And all before, the Ukrainians are even acknowledging that any kind of official counter offensive has even begun.",
