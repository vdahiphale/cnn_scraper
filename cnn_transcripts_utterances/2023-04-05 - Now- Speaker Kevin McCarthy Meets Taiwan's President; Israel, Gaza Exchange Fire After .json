      "sentences": "This is a huge political moment for Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-Wen to be meeting with the second U.S. House speaker in less than a year. It was Nancy Pelosi in August. And now Kevin McCarthy in California in this, what's being described as an informal visit.But if you look at these pictures, obviously, President Tsai is getting face-to-face meetings with the decision makers in Washington, who further add to her argument that the Taiwan democratically elected government, elected by the 24 million people living on this island democracy, is legitimate. Despite the claims by China's Communist rulers for more than 70 years that actually the government is not legitimate and that the CCP, the Communist Party, should be controlling Taiwan. And China says will inevitably do so, one way or another, whether it's through political means or military force. And so there is so much at stake for Taiwan. Especially because they only have 13 formal diplomatic allies left because China has essentially iced them out on a global stage. But this relationship with the United States, and, of course, coming at a time that both Democrats and Republicans can really unite on the issue of Taiwan because they also unite on the issue of, you know, being just kind of repulsed by a lot of things that China is doing. From, you know, befriending Vladimir Putin, potentially, you know, concern providing lethal weapons to his war, to regular military intimidation of Taiwan, not to mention human rights abuses. And so Taiwan and the United States grow closer. China grows angrier. But there is a lot to lose for China if they actually do the same thing they did last year when Nancy Pelosi visited with these huge military drills and firing missiles over Taiwan. They could further alienate the West, which is something that Xi Jinping really can't afford to do right now. Especially considering the fact that he has the president of France and the president of the E.U. Commission in Beijing, preparing for meetings. They would be overshadowed, of course, by any Chinese military activity. So we need to watch very closely. We can never really predict, Abby, what China's next move will be.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby, it's been an intense period for some time. And there has been expectation that these tensions would flare up, especially right now that Ramadan is overlapping with the first night of Passover, which begins tonight.What happened overnight is that these Israeli police say hundreds of young people barricaded, they say, themselves into the mosque. It's not unusual for Muslims to stay in the mosque overnight, especially during Ramadan. But the belief is that many of them wanted to stay in the mosque overnight because there were calls by Jewish extremists to go up to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, holy to both religions, and there was fears of sort of confrontations there. But what police said is after they tried to go in and get the people to leave the mosque, they decided to enter the mosque itself. And as we can see from this video, they entered with quite a bang. They entered with the riot shields up. They were met with fireworks fired at them. They fired back with stun grenades and rubber bullets. They say that stones were also thrown at them. But we know from the Palestinian Red Crescent there was something like two dozen people were injured. At least three of them were taken to hospital. Israeli police say two of their officers were injured. And stunningly, more than 350 Palestinians were arrested. Now rockets were fired from Gaza in response to this unrest. Since then, it's been relatively calm. But there's definitely a lot of tension in the air -- Abby?",

They were unsuccessful. And police say he died at the scene. Now Martin's family just spoke out in the last hour at a press conference here in D.C. And his mother essentially says that she wants the officers identified, prosecuted and ultimately fired. And she spoke very emotionally about her son in the pain that this has, of course, caused her. None of the officers involved have been identified by either police agency. And the Park Police also would not confirm, Abby, the status of the officer who shot this man. And the NPD is conducting an investigation. And as you said, today, the FBI and Justice Department today opened a civil rights investigation. So lots more to learn here -- Abby?",

And 11,000 of those deaths happened just this year alone, and it's only April.But new research now suggests that shootings aren't just becoming more common, but they are also becoming more deadly. CNN's chief correspondent -- chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joins us now. Sanjay, thank you for joining us on this. What did these researchers uncover in this new study? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, let me give you some context for those numbers as well. You know, we talk a lot about drug overdoses and opioid overdoses over the last couple of decades. You know, there's been about a million deaths due to drug overdoses as well, something that, you know, we hear about a lot. Similar numbers, as you as you just mentioned, since 1990 with these firearm deaths. What these researchers are trying to figure out was a pretty basic question. Are these -- are these types of injuries becoming more lethal? And the backdrop is, Abby, that medical care has improved significantly, response has improved significantly. But, in fact, when you compare the likelihood of someone tragically dying on scene, at the scene of where they -- where they were actually shot, the numbers have actually gone up. In 1999, it was around 52 percent. And now 57 percent. Now, you know, it's about a 9 percent increase. It may not seem like a lot but, again, the backdrop is well so much medical care has improved, the likelihood of someone not even making it to the hospital has also increased during that time. There are other factors, Abby, to be clear. You know, more of these shootings happening in rural settings where it may take longer for EMS to arrive there, get someone to a hospital. But as you can see from that number and other numbers, these trends are going in the wrong direction. PHILLIP: Yes, it is really disturbing. But what about the type of gun? Does that matter when it comes to lethality?",
