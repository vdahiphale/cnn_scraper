The World Health Organization has determined that one of the commonly used artificial sweeteners, aspartame, should be put in what it describes as the, quote, possibly carcinogenic to humans category. Aspartame is, of course, found in many products ranging from sugar-free gum to diet sodas. A can of diet soda can typically have about 100 milligrams of aspartame - there we go, can of diet soda - of aspartame. And under the WHO guidelines, someone weighing 184 pounds could safely drink up to 33 cans of diet soda a day before breaking the safety threshold.Sounds like a bad idea.",

And so aspartame, of course, we know, very common sweetener used in thousands of different products from diet sodas, like the 33 you just saw on the screen, things like table top sweeteners, breakfast cereal, chewing gum, even, you know, medicines like cough drops or chewable vitamins. This is in a lot of different things.And so the WHO took a look at this. This has been a decades' long sort of project that scientists have been looking at. And that Dr. Francesco Branca, the director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety at the WHO said about this review is that, quote, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been describe that need to be investigated by more and better studies. And so they are saying they want to see more studies of whether there is a potential cancer risk here, but they are not changing any of their guidelines based on this. And essentially they're putting it in the third of four categories of potential cancer risk. Other things in this category include things like aloe vera, occupational exposure to dry cleaning, gasoline engine exhaust and traditional Asian pickled vegetables. And so, you know, with the limit, they are actually -- a second group came out and said, we're not changing the limit of what we're saying is the safe level to aspartame to consume per day. And under those calculations that you did, it amounts to about 33 cans based on what the industry tells us is the amount of aspartame in those cans.",
