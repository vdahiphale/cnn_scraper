Jim Acosta is off.And we start this morning with three words everyone was waiting to hear, they're finally home. Former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal Reporter Evan Gershkovich, and Russian-American Journalist Alsu Kurmasheva are now back on U.S. soil, arriving to a hero's welcome overnight. Take a look. Their long nightmare finally over as they hugged their families for the first time since being freed. President Biden and Vice President Harris also on hand to welcome them home. The historic prisoner swap was the largest since the Cold War, involving 24 detainees and 7 countries. Biden posted this photo showing the trio on their way home. Earlier this morning, they touched down in Texas for medical evaluations with their families in tow. But even with the gravity of the last 24 hours still sinking in, Gershkovich was quick to point out that the nightmare is far from over for other detainees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVAN GERSHKOVICH, WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER FREED AFTER 16 MONTHS IN RUSSIAN PRISON:  It was great to get on that bus today and see a lot of, you know, not just Americans and Germans, but Russian political prisoners. But I just spent a month in prison in Yekaterinburg where there's a hole. You know, basically everybody I sat with is a political prisoner and nobody knows them publicly. They have, you know, various political beliefs. So, they're not all connected with Navalny supporters, which I think, you know, everybody knows about them (INAUDIBLE). Today was a really touching moment to see all of them, but it would be -- you know, I think to see if we could potentially do something about them as well, I'd like to talk, you know, talk to people about that in the next weeks and months.

All these women are inspiring and becoming the must-see show of these games. Now let's go to the pool. Australia continue their dominance in the pool by winning the 200-meter freestyle relay. But with the USA's silver medal, Katie Ledecky is now the most decorated female American Olympian swimmer of all time, 13 of them in all. That would be a heavy duffel bag.

We believe that infects that case, and that's fatal to this case. We're going to be moving to dismiss on that ground.Second, in the Fisher case, the Supreme Court set rules around the use of this federal statute, 1512(c)(2), obstruction of a government function. That's a January 6th case, but two of the charges in this case fall under that same federal statute. We believe that Fisher requires a dismissal of both of those two charges.

The Supreme Court was very clear that immune evidence can't be used even in cases involving non-immune conduct. So, in all, we believe that this case has been struck a fatal blow by the Supreme Court and that there's simply no way to disentangle immune from non-immune based on how the case has proceeded thus far.That's a less reported aspect of the Supreme Court's opinion than its overall ruling on what acts are immune but evidentiary exclusion, we believe, is going to be one of the key issues litigated in the coming weeks.",
