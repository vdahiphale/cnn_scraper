Also today, the American college student who went missing in France is found safe in Spain. What happened? We're on it. And we're following a crisis at the Southern border, as Texas struggles to content contain an unprecedented influx of migrants. Officials are warning the surge in crossings could mean big bucks for some very bad people behind the scenes. We will explain. Plus, rack up the frequent flyer miles, you reap the rewards, right? And you might be wrong. We begin with the latest on his viral triple threat that slamming the U.S. And CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen has the latest for us. Let's start with COVID, Elizabeth. We have new findings showing these updated boosters are really effective. But that doesn't seem to be convincing people to get the shot.",

      "sentences": "Ana, it certainly isn't.And I have to say that, even with this new data, I don't know that these numbers are going to go up much more. So let's -- there was lots of data that was put into these two studies that the CDC just releasing this hour. Let's take a look at one of the most important numbers. What they found is that when elderly people got this bivalent booster -- that's the one that's been available since September -- it was 73 percent more effective, this bivalent booster, compared to folks their age who received just the regular two vaccines -- I mean -- I'm sorry -- the regular vaccine, so not the new one, just the regular vaccines two months earlier, or more than two months earlier. So, in other words, they were better off getting this bivalent, which is only been available since September, than relying on essentially their vaccinations that happened months earlier. So, certainly, especially for the elderly, this bivalent booster does seem to be doing some good. Now let's take a look at what you said about how this doesn't seem to be convincing people. If we take a look at CDC numbers, about 35 percent of people who are elderly have gotten it. But when you look at younger numbers, it's 16 percent, it's 15 percent, it's 14 percent. It is just so much less in use. Those folks really do not seem to want to be taking it. And the Kaiser Family Foundation just put out some interesting information about the new bivalent. And they found, I guess not surprisingly, that a lot of it depends on your political affiliation, since vaccines have become so politicized. When they asked -- the folks at Kaiser looked at people who said that they don't think they need this new COVID booster, 64 percent of Republicans said they don't think they need it, and 26 percent of Democrats said that they don't think they need it. The Republican one, I have to say, Ana, didn't surprise me much. The Democrat one, that kind of did. I was surprised it was so high. Democrats were really quite enthusiastic about COVID vaccination, so to see them meh about this one really does, I think, tell you something.",

      "sentences": "It's interesting.So, the CDC comes out with new flu numbers every Friday, so we have been working hard to see what those say. For the first time this season, we're actually seeing a drop in flu numbers, that flu numbers went down 10 percent when you look at last week compared to the week before, but -- and I'm going to say a huge but here -- not going to celebrate, not going to say maybe flu has peaked and it's coming down. The reason why is, it could go right back up next week and the week after. You just never no. One week of a drop does not mean that things are on their way down. And flu has really been not just early this year, but really particularly tough. If we take a look at the flu season so far, there have been at least 150,000 hospitalizations, at least 9,300 deaths. And it's really -- it's been particularly hard on the elderly, which is always true. It's also been a tough year for children. So, get yourself vaccinated, get your children vaccinated. It's not too late. We are still in the middle of a very tough flu season -- Ana. CABRERA:  Important information. Thank you so much, Elizabeth Cohen. Brittney Griner is off to Arizona. She left a medical military facility in Texas just a couple of hours ago. These are some of the newly released photos from when she first arrived here on American soil one week ago. The WNBA star says the last 10 months in Russian detention have been a battle at every turn. She also wants to make one thing clear. She says she intends to play with the Phoenix Mercury this season. CNN's Kylie Atwood has more now. Kylie, Griner put out a rather long post today on social media expressing a lot of gratitude. What else?",

Now to Ukraine. Russia launching dozens and dozens of missiles this morning, leaving more civilians dead and many others without water, heat or train service. The White House condemned the strikes, which obliterated more of Ukraine's critical infrastructure. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is tracking this. Nick, this sounds like a multifaceted attack, different types of missiles launched from various locations targeting several regions. What more are you learning?",

They do appear to be getting reports from different parts of the country suggesting that electricity is being restored, but the second largest city, Kharkiv, significantly hit. And you're seeing their pictures of people sheltering in the metro stations of Kyiv, dual use now, frankly, places that get you to work, but also keep you safe when there's bombing. In fact, one of the younger citizens of Kyiv there found in the metro station said how she'd simply been walking her way to work, saw a rocket in the sky, and sort of, to some degree, shrugged, went underground to wait for that wave of strikes to pass. Important to note, though, that Ukrainian officials are suggesting some of the planes possibly involved in this wave of strikes may have been sent over the skies of Belarus. Now, that's to Ukraine's north, another neighbor that has been intermittently dragged in to this war by Moscow. And there are persistent reports now from senior Ukrainian military officials to suggest that they fear that maybe Belarus could be used to launch another attack on the capital, Kyiv, in the months ahead. Important to point out Kyiv often plays the information game here with warnings, but it's also fair to point out that, in Belarus, we have seen an intermittent Russian military presence there clearly designed to keep Ukraine on edge, worry if another invasion is coming from the north, reduce the forces they have to send to other front lines in the south and east. But, today, yet again infrastructure hit in the bitterness of winter -- Ana.",

Now, this is different than the Title 42 pandemic policy that we have been talking about this week, which allows authorities to expel migrants quickly and is set to expire in just five days. Let's dig deeper into Title 42 lifting now, because, as the U.S. braces for a surge, it's turning out an influx of people is just the tip of the iceberg. U.S. law enforcement officials warn a spike in border crossings will mean big bucks for Mexican drug cartels that have now taken over the human trafficking business. We're talking about billions of dollars. And it's not just the cartels cashing in. Federal officials say Chinese money laundering groups will too. Let's discuss with CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analysts, John Miller. John, we're really talking billions of dollars? How does this work?",

Then you had to hire a coyote who could guide you through routes when there was more protection on the border.These days, if you don't have a cartel, you're going to get stopped by the cartel before you're stopped by Border Patrol. They're going to want to see that colored yellow or green or blue bracelet that says you have paid the cartel and that they're guiding you through. So that means, for a single person that could be $1,500. For a family, that could be $10,000. Let's say the average is $3,000., So if 170,000 people are crossing now per month, and then, when Title 42 expires, if that goes to 200,000, you could be talking about $7.2 billion a year that they're going to be charging as a toll for an illegal crossing.

The United Nations even weighing in on this a short time ago, calling the move a dangerous precedent. CNN's Oliver Darcy is following this for us.

I think this really raises a lot of key questions about the future of the media on Twitter. Are newsrooms going to stand for Elon Musk hastily banning the reporters and then misleading about it? Or are they going to do something? CNN has said in its statement that it's basically awaiting communication from Twitter. They have reached out to Twitter. They're curious to hear back. And then they will reevaluate its position moving forward. And I think, also, advertisers are probably curious about what's going on. So you have major companies, like Apple, Amazon. They spend money on Twitter. Do they want to be associated with a company that is now in the business of censoring the press? And, finally, I'd say that news organizations are also among some of the top advertisers on Twitter. And now we're hearing from Puck, a smaller news organization, a digital upstart, but they're pausing advertising on Twitter. And I'm curious to know whether other companies that advertise, like \"The Wall Street Journal\" -- I opened up my phone a second ago and I got served a \"Wall Street Journal\" ad -- are they also going to decide to take their ad dollars and move it somewhere else, given that they are news organizations?
