Not even a month since the deal to avoid a catastrophic U.S. default, the House and Senate are careening toward another standoff over spending. This one raises the specter of a government shutdown.Let's take you now live to Capitol Hill with CNN congressional correspondent, Lauren Fox. So, Lauren, another day, another crisis.

      "sentences": "Well, if you remember, just a couple of weeks ago, there was an agreement between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden setting top-line spending numbers that were supposed to govern how the operations process, how funding the government was going to work in the fall.But he got a lot of heat and a lot of pushback from members in the right flank of his conference who argued they wanted to write their legislation, their spending bills at a lower level. So on Monday night, there was an announcement from the House Appropriations chairwoman, Kay Granger, that they would markup all of their bills in the House of Representatives at this lower level that reflects spending from fiscal year 2022. Meanwhile, Senators will write their bills to the levels that were agreed in the debt ceiling negotiations, which is more than $100 billion apart. At some point, they have to come together because government runs out of funding October 1st but that just sets the stage for a major clash between not just Republicans and Democrats but between the House and the Senate. I talked to a number of Senate Republican who were absolutely shocked that this was the state of where things were going. In fact, Mitt Romney a Republican told me, quote, \"I think\" -- excuse me, Senator Lisa Murkowski said, \"I think it certainly makes things much, much more complicated.\" Mitt Romney told me, quote, \"The House likes to do things for messaging purposes. They infrequently reach the Senate floor, but when they do, they have to pass with Republican and Democrats.\" Even some moderate Republican, who serve on the Appropriations Committee, they are warning their colleagues that this is setting them up for a collision course with the Senate. And that likely, whatever they pass in the House, if they can get a united Republican conference with a slim majority supporting all 12 appropriations bills, the bills that come back from the Senate will look very different. What this means for the American public is a very, very messy fall (ph) and a lot of questions on if the government will be funded by October 1st.",

It could turbocharge fraud, what it means to jobs. A lot of really important questions here. And there's a lot of debate and it is divided among business leaders and academics and lawmakers over how to address A.I. Some worry that there's going to be overregulation from Washington that stifles innovation and lets other countries like China get a leg up from the A.I. arms race. But we are hearing from some A.I. companies themselves pleading with Congress to regulate. Sam Altman, who is the founder of ChatGPT, he recently said to Congress that, quote, \"regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risk of increasingly powerful models.\" So the stakes here are clearly grave, Brianna.

Now, some of the officials, including some of his fellow Republicans in the Senate, say that holding up the promotions have become a national security problem. Here is what Tuberville said a moment ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): My hold will remain in place. I will keep my hold until the Pentagon follows the law, and Congress changes the law. These jobs are being done as we speak. They are not empty.

He says that anyone who says that this is affecting readiness is wrong. ADM. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: Well, we obviously have a different opinion there. The fact is, when you hold up this many flag and general officers, admirals and generals, what you are doing is to freeze certain commands and you free certain organizations the way they are. And you stop having the ability of some of these admirals and generals to move on. And if some of them end up retiring, then their replacements are in acting capacities. And they may not have all of the right authorities they need to execute the duties of those jobs. Not to mention the immense disruption this will have to military families. Here is -- summertime is our biggest move time. It is the time that we try to get families settled before the fall, before school. They are not allowed to move or buy new Houses or get settled before school. It's immensely disruptive to military families. And whether you are a general, an admiral, a soldier or a sailor, your family and your family's ability to accommodate the military life is a big factor for you to stay in the service and to want to keep serving the country. This is a ridiculous hold that is having an enormous effect already four months in. And if he keeps doing it, it is going to have an even more dramatic effect going forward.",

So the talent pool gets smaller, and a lot of the very qualified talent that we need in the upper echelons of the military are no longer available to us. Not to mention that sometimes, in some jobs, when you have to put somebody in there in an acting capacity because the officer who is waiting to promote out now decides to leave the service. Now that acting officer may not have all of the authorities that he or she needs to do the job because they are in an acting capacity. That is one aspect of readiness. As I said, don't shake off -- and I know that you don't, Brianna, because you're a military spouse, too.

And so it is possible we will not have it confirmed if this hold persists and confirm the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And somebody might say, well, why does that matter? Well, it matters because the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the senior most military officer in the land. And he is the direct military adviser to the president of the United States and to the secretary of defense. He is not in the command. He's an adviser, but a key adviser, pulling in all of the advice and counsel of all of the other senior generals and admirals across the services.
