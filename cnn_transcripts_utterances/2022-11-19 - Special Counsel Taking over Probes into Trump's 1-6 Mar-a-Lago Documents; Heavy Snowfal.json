He already has prosecutors, FBI agents, working well into both of these cases, January 6 and Mar-a- Lago, and then we know from previous Special Counsel, there will be a behind the scenes confidential commissioning of him from the Attorney General, exactly what crimes he is going to be investigating was laid out in the Mueller investigation, and then we expect that to happen hereto, those would be confidential. And then he looks at the facts, right, they continue to pursue facts as a prosecutor does. He will be getting more grand jury activity, more testimony, more documents, talking to those agents and the prosecutors that are working on this on the line level. And then finally, the big thing that he's going to have to do is make major policy decisions, the likes of which we have never had before questions like, do you indict the former President of the United States, a current candidate?

So, that part of the interest is, as you suggest, that all of this has to be completed, if it is going to last within a couple years. I do think as Katelyn suggested, one of the two cases that are now under Smith's purview, the Mar-a-Lago is quite far along, which by the way, is very different for a Special Counsel investigation. They normally come in at the beginning, bring their own team into place, et cetera.

You have somebody making a judgment who has no political connection to Biden, whatsoever. It is ironic that Trump takes this as an outrage and that many House Republicans are assailing it.

It's GOP 3.2, that's an error of less than two points and more than that, I think surprising to some folks because everyone was like, oh, the polls underestimated Democrats. No, if anything they slightly underestimated Republicans. But in historical context, a two point error is absolutely fantastic.
