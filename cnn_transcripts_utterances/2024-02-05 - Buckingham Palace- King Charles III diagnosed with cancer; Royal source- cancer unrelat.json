It says it was discovered during the King's recent treatment for an enlarged prostate. The palace says it is not, in fact, though, prostate cancer, although it did not specify which type of cancer he has. The King, meantime, is postponing his public engagements, all of them. Buckingham Palace says he came forward to prevent speculation and raise cancer awareness. We want to go straight to our Nada Bashir who's been following all of this from London. You know, safe to say, shocking news and disquieting news after for so many, not just there in Britain, but around the world. You know, bring us right up to date about what the palace is saying, but crucially not saying as well.",

He was, of course, discharged just last week from hospital after undergoing procedure and treatment for what is now said to have been a nine enlarged prostate, according to a royal source. This is now not being treated as prostate cancer. But as we understand it, according to Buckingham Palace, it was during that procedure that doctors noted concerns other areas and identified a form of cancer. But crucially, there are no details from Buckingham Palace with regards to specifically what kind of cancer King Charles III has been diagnosed with nor what stage of cancer he has been diagnosed with. This has, of course, raised some concern. As we understand, he will be now taking a step back from public-facing duties as he undergoes treatment for cancer. However, according to Buckingham Palace, he is still expected to carry on with state business and paperwork as usual. This will be, of course, carried out in private. No public-facing engagements expected to take placed, but we may well see other senior members over the royal family, namely the Prince of Wales, Prince William, taking up further responsibility, perhaps stepping up. Although important to note that in this statement from Buckingham Palace, they have noted that those public-facing engagements have been postponed, that King Charles is hoping to return to those engagements as soon as possible. But in this statement, of course, they have said that King Charles III is in good spirits. He says -- they say he remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible, adding that he is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible, thanks to his recent hospital procedure -- Paula.",

Again, no details as to the form of cancer nor the stage of cancer at this stage, but he is undergoing treatment. That has commenced today. And of course, as we've heard from Buckingham Palace, they have said that King Charles III is hopeful that he can return to those public-facing duties as soon as possible. Now, of course, there has been reaction from the British government. We have heard from the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. He took to X, formerly known as Twitter, posting that he wishes his Majesty a full and speedy recovery, that he has no doubt that he will be back to full strength in no time. I know the whole country will be wishing him well. We also heard from the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer, saying that on behalf of the opposition Labour Party, I wish his Majesty all the very best for his recovery. We look forward to seeing him back to full health swiftly. Of course, we have also heard from the US President Joe Biden. He spoke to reporters just a little earlier. He did say that he was concerned about the health conditions being faced by King Charles III. He said he had just heard about his diagnosis. This was said in Las Vegas when he was asked by reporters about this development. He has said that he is expecting to speak to King Charles III very soon. But again, this is a person, the King Charles III, a monarch who is not only a significant figure here in the United Kingdom, but somebody who has a long history of close relations with many in the international community.",

And, to me, this highlights just how important it is for all of us to have regular screening and primary care physician visits. What likely happened here is King Charles went in for screening. It was found that he had an enlarged prostate, probably because of symptoms. As many older men know, as you get older, you sometimes have trouble urinating or you have frequent urination. You have to wake up in the middle of the night. Those are all things that can be either benign prostate enlargement or can be symptoms of something more serious. King Charles then appropriately went on and got further testing to evaluate whether it was something to not worry about, which is what the prostate has ended up being, or if it were cancer. And somehow in that process, it sounds like they found another cancer. Now, of course, we don't know what kind of cancer he has been diagnosed with, but we suspect that it's probably something urologic. So bladder or something else related to the reproductive system or that kind of lower portion of your body. You know, we're all waiting to hear exactly what diagnosis he got. The last part is, once a cancer has been diagnosed, you have to figure out has it spread. And so, part of my suspicion is that he had a biopsy or some other screening test a month ago, and since then has likely been having some other testing to try to figure out how advanced the cancer is, which then helps his team to decide what the most appropriate next step is in treatment.",

It destigmatizes the diagnosis and treatment, which matters so much. I mean, it wasn't so long ago that doctors and family members would hide the diagnosis of cancer from their patients because it was thought to be a horrible word or a reflection on someone's lifestyle. We know now that, of course, lifestyle like smoking can increase your risk of cancer, but there are also random genetic mutations and just bad luck. So the first part is by talking about it; he destigmatizes it. The second part is by being honest, he can hopefully encourage more people to go and get screened. We know that, unfortunately, rates of screening for cancer have dropped precipitously across the United States and the globe, partly due to COVID-related health, partly because everybody's lives are crazy right now as we come out of COVID, but those screenings help us to catch cancer early and thereby help us to prevent progression and literally save lives.

And we've also made great strides in terms of the types of treatment we can offer and in terms of life expectancy. We have precision chemo now that goes directly after the genetic mutation that causes cancer. We have ways to combine chemo and surgery and radiation to try to decrease the side effects of treatment and to prolong life.

There's now speculation that other royals will now step up to fill his place. Prince William has also temporarily stepped away from his engagements to support his wife as she recovers from abdominal surgery. Prince Henry's office, meantime, says he has spoken with his father about the diagnosis and will travel to the UK to see the king in the coming days. Max Foster is with us now from London and again closely you follow these events, Max, I'm wondering what sticks out to you. I mean, I can tell you, I was surprised to hear that he had already been in London receiving treatment. And that it's obviously something that treatment must start right away. It's at least as serious as that. MAX FOSTER, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\":   Yes, so he's not in hospital, he is at home at Clarence House just down the road from here, and he's been treated as an outpatient, which would suggest he would be possibly taking visits to hospital, but he has got a team of specialists, I'm told in addition to the palace medical team and in addition to his own private doctor as well. So he couldn't be having better treatment. We are not being told obviously the precise condition that he's got, what sort of cancer it is. So we're then looking at, you know, what we can glean from the information that I've been told. There is the fact that he's at home. The fact that I've been told that he's going to continue with his weekly audiences with the Prime Minister. He's going to be able to carry out those key constitutional duties like signing new laws and appointing ministers. So those key jobs he will be able to do, he just won't be appearing in public with his, you know, very busy schedule of arrangements around all those charities. I know that you've reported on as well. You know how busy he actually is. I think it must be driving him crazy to be stuck at home, but that's the situation he's found himself in because the doctors are saying you can't carry on with your public duties. And I think he will be out of action for some time even if he improves rapidly because we're expecting him to be out of action for a few weeks anyway because of his procedure relating to his enlarged prostate. And, you know, he's now got this added complication. So I think that, you know, the face of the monarchy is going to change right now. And we are going to have to see -- well, we are going to see more of Queen Camilla and Prince William as they step up to ultimately do what their job is, which is represent the monarchy. And if the king isn't around, they're frankly going to have to do it.",

And we have the Princess of Wales currently out of action and recuperating at Windsor because she had an operation. Prince William was also out of action because he was supporting her, but he's now having to step up again. And Queen Camilla, you know, she's in her 70s. She hasn't got as busy a schedule as the others, but she's now going to have to step up as well. So a lot of pressure on the remaining members of the royal family. And it is the senior royals that people want to see. It is Camilla, Kate, the King and William. So whilst Prince Edward and Princess Anne are also working royals, they don't have the same heft. So it does really fall on William now and Camilla to step up and really push the monarchy forward. They -- the monarchy represents continuity. If politics is chaotic, they are the stability. That is their job. They have to be seen, you know, they have to be seen to be believed. That's what the Queen Elizabeth used to always say. And that's going to be really front of the palace's mind right now and also members of the royal family whilst making sure they're in constant contact with the king. I know that Harry's in touch with the king. Harry's going to fly over and see him. And Prince William is in regular contact with the king as well.

He was expecting to spend a lot of time in the public eye to establish himself and step into those enormous shoes, which were Queen Elizabeth's, of course.

I want to talk to you about three very different areas in terms of royal duties and how they'll be affected. So firstly, let's think about Britain here. How concerned is the country at this hour?

And I think people are just very shocked because the King went into hospital for a very routine operation in large prostate. It's very routine. It's a routine. Many men experience this condition. And, of course, we saw him coming out of hospital. We saw him in Sandringham. He looked in great spirits. Camilla, when she was asked about his health on Thursday, said he was doing his best. It seemed to me he was in good form. We expected to see him back on his feet doing engagements in a couple of weeks. But the actual -- what we've been told is very different during his routine treatment. The doctors did find evidence of cancer, not prostate cancer, but a different cancer. And he is having this treatment for it, which may be quite serious, difficult treatment. We don't know what it is, but the outpatient treatments. And so therefore, we aren't going to see the King at all, I don't think. It maybe we won't see him until after Easter, which is the prognosis we have for not seeing Catherine, Princess of Wales.

And I think the big point is that it's very hard to keep secrets in this modern social media 24-hour age. There are lots of people who have all kinds of information. And I do actually think that Charles, perhaps maybe six months or in a year in the future, will tell us what form of cancer he has been suffering from, perhaps through the medium of the charity that works with the sufferers of the condition.

I think that's really important. But you're right that this family has gone through so much. But the King is a hard worker, he loves what he does. He stays up very late, I'm being told, writing all these statements. And so, this will be incredibly hard for him. But the message is very clear, indeed. That nothing changes here, constitutionally, at least.",

We're told that Prince Harry has spoken with his father and will soon head back to the U.K. to visit with him. A source close to Prince William, who was heir to the throne says he's in regular contact with the King. Emily Nash is a CNN royal commentator and the role editor at Hello Magazine. Thanks for being with us on what is clearly a shocking few hours here for Britain and beyond. Can you give us a sense of how you believe the royal family has handled this so far?

But we saw him just yesterday appearing in fairly good health outside the church at Sandringham. So, it's right to avoid speculation to get this message out there just for the avoidance of doubt, I suppose. And I'm sure like any other family, they're going to be rallying around him, as you say, Prince Harry flying in to spend some time with his father, which, you know, was not at the top of anyone's cards for 2024, given the difficult state of their relationship in the past couple of years.",

But what's interesting is that Buckingham Palace isn't calling any of the councilors of state in, you know, to put in a shift at the moment. So, these are other members of the family who can deputize for the King, if he's overseas or incapacitated in any way. There's no need to do that. So, it seems that they're confident that the King can continue with his constitutional duties behind the scenes attending to his official paperwork and his red boxes, we just won't see him out and about, you know, pressing the flesh, spending time with people in the way that he usually does until he's recovered.",
