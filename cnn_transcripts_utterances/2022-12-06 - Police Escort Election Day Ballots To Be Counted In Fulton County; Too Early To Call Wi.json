Democrats telling me that, they were looking at places, like DeKalb County, but important to keep in mind that much of Metro Atlanta area is still outstanding.But listen, this is an area where the campaign really invested, in terms of time. Senator Warnock spent a great deal of time, in the Metro Atlanta region, really speaking to base voters. On his last day, on the campaign trail, that's where he was, speaking to Black voters, speaking to college students, speaking to union workers, in Metro Atlanta. So, it seems to be paying off for now that that energized the base, and they are coming out, in a big way. But he also campaigned in heavily red areas as well. So, if he can run up the numbers, in those areas, as well as a solidify support, in these blue areas, I think is what the campaign is looking for, tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Keep an eye on it, because it'll change, as we speak. That's the magic of Election Night votes coming in. But we mentioned the seesaw, last time you were here. Herschel Walker had a modest lead. Now, Senator Warnock has a modest lead. But again, you make a key point. Keep an eye on that.Still a long way to go. Estimated around 73 percent, so, we got a quarter a little more of that votes still to count. But as you watch the rest of the map fill in, this is what they're doing in the campaign war rooms. They're saying, \"OK, why did Senator Warnock pull ahead?\" He pulled in because Cobb County made a large report, mostly early voting. But you see now the numbers there. But that's still at 56 percent. Why does Cobb County matter? 100,000 votes, right now, right now, as we're still counting in the runoff. Let's just go back one month ago, 176,000 votes. This is a place where Senator Warnock, had a big advantage, a month ago. And you watch it play out. So, then you come across here, we're still waiting on Fulton County, in the runoff here. We're at about 55 percent, right now. He's at 82 percent. So, if you stay around 80 percent, and you've got 40-plus percent of the vote to come in, a lot more votes for the Democrat to be had here. The other big change that happened, Jake, was DeKalb County, which was at about 5 percent, estimated vote, when you were here, last time. As you see, they reported a large installment. That's them counting their early votes, their early mail-in ballots, and you see Senator Warnock is 92 percent, when you round that up now. 92 percent, now. A month ago, 84 percent. This is a big predominantly Democratic county. So, they're only at 45 percent, and that he made a huge jump. So, if you're in the Walker campaign headquarters, you say, number one, still a ton of votes to come in, in this Metropolitan Atlanta area, and the suburbs around it, and it is blue. And you know, you're likely, even if you narrow the gap, with Election Day votes, you know, it's likely they're going to be more Democrats here. The other problem is you just pick them, as you go through here. Coffee County, 95 percent of the vote in, in these rural areas, where there's not a ton of votes, but Walker just needs to run it up, like that, but 95 percent in, 99 percent in, 85 percent in, 99 percent in. So, you'll find some that are still in the 60s. But if you're looking at where the live outstanding votes are, in a lot of rural Georgia, where the Republicans run it up, you'll see when you look at it this perspective, on the live outstanding votes, much tinier circles, right? That means a smaller piece of votes out there. Most of your votes are out here. And again, there are some Republican exurbs up here, north of Atlanta, a little southwest of Atlanta here. But predominantly, the votes are out in traditionally-blue areas. Now, Republicans said they would surprise us today, in the Election Day votes. That's what's still being counted, in these areas. So, the math is there. The color tells you, if you're in the -- if you're in the Warnock campaign, the color tells you, yes, you might have a bit of a seesaw still, 18,500 votes, when you round that. But the map is filling in, in a way, swing county here, swing county, here, that are still blue. In the Warnock campaign, you're saying \"OK, looks better now than it did 15 minutes ago. Let's hope it stays this way.\" But we got a lot of counting to do.",

And as that happens, the Republicans do better, in the Election Day vote. And in these red counties, they do much better. The question is, are there enough of them?But just to use Gwinnett, as an example, Herschel Walker is getting 33 percent or 34 percent, if you want to round that up, right now. But, a month ago, he had 39 percent, which tells you we're still waiting to count Election Day votes. To your point, Republicans do better in the Election Day vote. But if he gets 39 percent, again, tonight, that may not be enough. Because if you look in the governor's race, Brian Kemp gets 44 percent, you know? So, he loses the county, but he's much more competitive. And you see that all around Metro Atlanta. You see it in Fulton County. You see it in DeKalb. You see it, everywhere you go. You see it in Cobb over here. You see it in Fayette. You see it in Douglas. You see it in Clayton. On all those counties, Brian Kemp lost, but ran competitively, and then, Brian Kemp wins all this. So, that's Herschel Walker's problem, right now, is, is he, as we get more, as we move away? This is early vote, right? Can Herschel Walker move in Cobb County, up from 35 percent, closer, as we get through it, right here? Because, look at that, 1,600 votes, right now, 50-50, as you look at the races, more votes come in. So again, disproportionately, the votes are still out here.

Herschel Walker, in the Election Day vote counted so far, most of it, in these red rural counties, he's running it up. And that's what he needed to do. He's running it up. He's running -- if he keeps that percentage, he's the next senator from Georgia. The question is does he keep that percentage as we get in the Election Day vote counts here? Because, what we're getting in Atlanta and the suburbs around it so far, is just the early vote. And again, we're going to come back to this, because it's a helpful tool, for us, in the live outstanding vote. In the votes still to be counted, that's why I have that circled, right? Again, we don't know how Herschel Walker did, in predominantly Democratic areas, Atlanta, and the suburbs, around it, Cobb County, Gwinnett County, DeKalb County, Douglas County, Fayette County, and all around in here. There's more as you go through, Clayton County. We don't know how he did today. But he has to keep a big lead, in the Election Day turnout.

So, we're talking about memory cards, other information, they have to include, with those ballots, for them to then be able to process, and upload it, into the system, here. Now look, here in Fulton County, I was told by an election official that a conservative estimate for the number of ballots that are still outstanding is roughly more than 75,000. Now, that includes these Election Day in-person votes, but also many of those absentee ballots. Remember, they had 14,000 that came in before Election Day. And then, look, our cameras caught them bringing in Election Day absentee ballots that were dropped off at one of those three different locations that they could do that today. All of those absentee ballots in Fulton County have to be delivered already by now, is by 7 PM, today.

The DeKalb County, what I'm really happy about is our large urban counties got their act together, this time, and really uploaded a lot of stuff, early. DeKalb is one of our slower ones. And they've been uploading a lot of stuff in the last half hour or so. But most of the Fulton's in. We got a chunk of Cobb that's still out. That Metro, the giant donut hole, for the Metro -- of the entire state is right there. The four largest most populous counties, which kind of can swing the vote, one way or the other, by themselves, are really coming in pretty quick. But it's so close. Those counties that have 10,000 votes, 4,000 votes, and they're going to go 80 percent for Walker? They're going to keep on coming in. Now, one of the interesting things about this is, if you like the geography of Fulton County, which is the largest county, they had to bring in their vote cards. It's 90 miles long, and people have to drive, from the top, and the bottom, all the way to that central location, at English street warehouse, to get those things uploaded. So, there's going to be time involved, in those things. We had a car accident with one car carrying one of the cards. They had been the Jaws of Life out that both of the poll workers are OK. They turned down medical attention, to the hospital, but they were able to retrieve that vote card and get into the Lowndes County, Valdosta headquarters. I mean, this is the kind of stuff that happens on Elections Day, because you have thousands of people out there doing their jobs.",

Some, in a sense of disbelief, but others, we've talked to, said, \"Look, they always expected this would be fairly close.\" You'll remember, a month ago, in November, Raphael Warnock only defeated Herschel Walker by some 37,000 votes. So, this was a very close race. But the strategists that I'm speaking with, inside the Warnock operation, are perhaps not as optimistic, as some of the supporters, watching these numbers come in, because they are looking ahead, at other numbers that have not yet come in. And a lot of those numbers that have not yet come in, as John King has been reporting, all evening, are in the Metro Atlanta area, where there is good reason to believe that Raphael Warnock has a good base of support. So, there is a sense, at least among some advisers that Herschel Walker perhaps has hit his high watermark. One adviser tells me the next few hours could be tough. But the reality is this is still a very, very close race. So, we're going to have to be patient. Many supporters here are having a few drinks, watching these results come in, and frankly, enjoying this very tough race, because a lot of Democrats believed that Senator Warnock would have simply walked away with this. That has not been the case here, tonight. So, there's no doubt, the Walker advisers say, they still see a path to victory, but their optimism does not exactly spell out what that is, or go beyond that, Anderson.",

But certainly, it was a nail-biter. And it's going to play out that way. I sit here as a Republican, as a conservative, as a lifelong conservative, just thinking \"What could have been? What could have been, if the quality of the candidate, like Mitch McConnell pointed to, several months ago, was better?\" We wouldn't even be in a runoff, right now. We would be an eight-point winner, in the general election, just like Brian Kemp.",

Still remarkably close, 50.3 percent to 49.7 percent.So, what just happened? You hear everyone talking about. We're waiting on the Metro Atlanta area. Well, the closest piece, the most central piece of the Metro Atlanta area, is Fulton County, which is Atlanta, and the suburbs, to the north, and the south. Again, runs about 90 miles total. We just got a large installment of votes here. And that's what you see, Senator Warnock, right now, running -- still staying above 80 percent, a nearly 82 percent, in Fulton County. This is the challenge, is, as the rest of the votes play out. We know that right now, we're at about 87 percent count statewide. We know that the bulk of the outstanding votes are in this, I think, the Georgians call it the donut hole, right there, Atlanta, around the -- Atlanta and the suburbs, around it. And we're waiting to see. Herschel Walker's challenge was can he run it up on the Election Day vote? He did that in some of these rural areas, not by the big math, I think he needed to do it by. The challenge now is as they count the votes, in these remaining, the most populous counties, in the state? Most of them are right up here, Anderson. So, we're looking. Again, we just got Fulton County. But we still have a third of the vote out, right? Raphael Warnock, right now, is getting nearly 82 percent, in Fulton County. If he stays above 75 percent, well he's going to be reelected, because so many votes are still outstanding here. You move over to Cobb County, there. We're still at 68 percent. So, you have Scott with you. You got Lieutenant Governor Duncan with you. The Lieutenant Governor knows the math here very well. Gwinnett County, about 75 percent, Raphael Warnock running at 64 percent. Again, here's how he's doing so far tonight. You go back a month ago, he was at 58 percent. So, at the moment, Senator Warnock is over-performing his performance, a month ago, in Atlanta, and the suburbs, around it. We're not done counting the Election Day votes yet. That is Herschel Walker's comeback plan. But you see all that deep blue up there, right now. You see an 18,491 vote lead. The seesaw has swung back, to the Democrats, as the votes, in Metro Atlanta, begin to get counted, more of the Election Day votes.",

You always wait for the final turnout numbers, as they count the -- it's possible that number swings a little bit, as you find out what the final turnout is. But our team's very smart at this. So, we have it at about 67 percent. That could be, maybe it's 66 percent. Maybe it's 68 percent. But again, right now, right now, Senator Warnock is getting 82 percent, in Atlanta, Fulton County, in the suburbs. Again, Atlanta is here, right? It stretches up to the suburbs, beginning at the exurbs here, when you get to the top of Fulton County. But let's just go back, 82 percent, now, if you round that up, 73 percent, 74 percent, if you round that up. This is the -- Lieutenant Governor Duncan is making this point, and I think Scott is making the same point. Scott's right. Joe Biden is not terribly popular, in Georgia, right now, however, nor is Donald Trump, in the sense, if you go back to the governor's race, Governor Kemp lost Fulton County. But he got 31 percent, right? You say \"Oh, 31 percent? He got shellacked!\" He did get shellacked. But the question is what are the margins? Look what happened to Herschel Walker, was only 25 percent. That matters. The margins in a big populous county like that matter. And so, you can fast forward to where we are, right now. Herschel Walker, at the moment, is getting 19 percent of the vote, in Fulton County. A Republican is not going to win Fulton County. But a Republican cannot be below 20 percent, in Fulton County, and expect to win a statewide election, because so many people live there. That's just simple math. And we'll see if it holds up, as we get the final installment of the vote. But if you look at Herschel Walker, right now, at 19 percent, in Fulton County?",
