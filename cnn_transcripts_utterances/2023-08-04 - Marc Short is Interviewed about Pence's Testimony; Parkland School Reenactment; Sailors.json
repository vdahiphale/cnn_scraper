He is noted in the indictment as one of the people who cast doubt on Trump's claims of voter fraud, saying, quote, \"it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy, s-word, beamed down from the mothership.\"Boris Epshteyn has also been with Trump since 2016. He's a lawyer and was the communications director for Trump's first inaugural committee in 2022 - sorry, inaugural committee. In 2022, he admitted that it was part of the effort to find fake electors. He has testified before the Georgia special grand jury and was interviewed by the special counsel. Susie Wiles is a big time Florida political operator who helped get Ron DeSantis elected but is now seen as Trump's top political strategist. A source tells CNN, she is the senior campaign official that Trump allegedly showed a classified map to at his New Jersey golf club. She has spoken to federal investigators several times. Chris LaCivita is a long-time Republican operative best known for his role in the Swift Boat veteran group that attacked John Kerry back in 2004. He also started a super PAC to support Trump in 2020. Finally, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Chung. He was the director, for the record, director of communications for the Ultimate Fighting Championship before he joined the Trump campaign in 2016.

He played a big role in the criminal case that is being built against his former boss, as we are now seeing in that indictment from his five- hour testimony to his own notes taken, those contemporaneous notes. The 45-page indictment laid out Pence's efforts to stand up to Trump's scheme to keep his seat in the Oval Office. Joining me right now is Marc Short. He's a former chief of staff toMike Pence. He also, Marc himself, testified before the grand jury, which ended up handing down this indictment to Donald Trump. Marc, thanks so much for being here. Let me start with this. Donald Trump's first utterance after being arraigned yesterday was this, this is a persecution of a political opponent. Is that how you see this indictment?",

This after prosecutors successfully argued during his trial that Peterson took cover outside of the 1200 building because he thought that there was more -- there was more than one gunman at the school and that he did not know where the shooting was taking place. Now, earlier this morning nine members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, they toured the 1200 building. They got a look at the three floors here at Marjory Stoneman Douglas where the 17 students and staff members were killed and 17 others were wounded in the school shooting. We're told that that tour just wrapped up a few minutes ago. Now, some of the family members were in Washington, D.C. last week lobbying some of these very same lawmakers on a school safety piece of legislation.

Now, in the first case that was unsealed yesterday against one of the sailors, Jinchao Wei, who was a machinist at Navel Base San Diego, essentially an engineer there. They say that he provided a Chinese intelligence officer with dozens of military manuals that could be useful to the officer to learn about U.S. Navy ships, including the USS Essex, on which Wei worked. He also provided them with details and photos of the layouts of these ships, as well as the weapons systems on them, according to prosecutors. And in exchange he received thousands of dollars over the course of February 2022 until the present day. Now, in the second case, another U.S. Navy Sailor is accused of providing a Chinese intelligence officer with information about U.S. military movements and exercises in the Indo Pacific and for receiving about $15,000 for that information from this officer. He also allegedly provided photos an information of a U.S. radar system on a U.S. military base in Okinawa, Japan.
