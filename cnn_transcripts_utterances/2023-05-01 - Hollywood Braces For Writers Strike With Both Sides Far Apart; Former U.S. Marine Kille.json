He said the undersigned justices today reaffirm and restate foundational ethics principles and practices to which they subscribe and carrying out their responsibilities as members of the Supreme Court of the United States.This statement aims to provide new clarity to the bar and to the public on how the justices addressed certain recurring issues and also seeks to dispel some common misconceptions. And then the statement went on to describe which rules the justices do follow, but also how they really can't disclose everything because of security concerns. So, regardless of the explanations here, there are many now in Congress who are just questioning if these justices have enough of an ethics code. Especially, Sara, with these recent revelations you know that Justice Thomas, for example, accepted luxury trips, even did that property deal with a Republican Megadonor, and never really disclosed these details. So, a lot is coming out, and a lot of criticisms as well.",

He said he didn't exactly have enough proof.But what Justice Alito indicated is that he believes it was someone who did not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, which, of course, is ultimately what happened. And he also threw very cold water on this theory that maybe it was someone from the conservative side who leaked it. Because the theory goes that if it was a conservative, maybe they were trying to lock in the five-four vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. And here was Justice Alito's very telling angry response to that. He said that's infuriating to me. Look, this made us targets of assassination. Would I do that to myself with the five of us have done that to ourselves? It's quite implausible. So, really pushing back on this idea, Sarah. And interestingly enough, he also said that the leak really did lead to quite a pervasive atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, which he says has mostly been dispelled but still a tough time for the justices to.",

      "sentences": "So, at midnight tonight, production on most television shows could be shut down if a deal is not reached by that deadline. 98 percent of writers for TV, movies, and streaming shows voted to strike if no deal is reached. As of this moment, the two sides seem pretty far apart.CNN's Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy is with us now. Oliver, what are the sticking points here? OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER (on camera): Hey, John. Yes, Hollywood is really holding its breath because this would be a major disruption to the workflow if this strike does go through if a deal is not hashed out in the next few hours. Some of the major sticking points actually relate to how TV consumption has changed over the years with the streaming era. And so, writers are saying that you know shows on streaming services like Netflix, usually, they're shorter, they not last 20 Episode seasons anymore, there may be about 10 episodes. And so, that results in less writers getting hired for the shows and less work being available. And it also has to do with the residual fee. So, back in the day, you would have a show, let's say like Lost, House, and those shows would be re-aired on broadcast networks or on cable networks for some time. And they would earn these residual fees as a result. And they're saying those residual fees that kept them going between jobs, they're not as common anymore and that's something that they want to see addressed in a deal. And so, there are some sticking points as it relates to how consumption has changed since these two sides first hashed out a contract many years ago. This would be the first stoppage of work in really 15 years -- major stoppage of work in Hollywood. And what you would see, John, is first impacted would be the late-night comedy shows. I would expect that those would immediately start playing reruns in the days and weeks ahead. But if this deal is not hashed out and this drags on for some time, shows that we were set to premiere in the fall could also be pushed back. So, a lot hangs in the balance in the next few hours, John.",

Ukrainian officials say that there were 18 Russian missiles fired here. 15 of them were taken down.I mean, we heard the sirens here in Kyiv last night. Some people took to the metro station to take shelter, but a lot of people just carried on their lives as normal because the air defenses in Kyiv over the past few days have been pretty much a hundred percent successful. They've taken down all the incoming missiles. So, when Russia says it hits its targets, that's just not true. Are they saying that the intended target was all that -- were all those civilians, the houses, the schools that Ukrainian officials say that they hit in the south of Ukraine, those 34 civilians, five of them children? Is that what the Russians are saying that that was the intended target? So, Russia seeming to have zero credibility where they are being a more credible force is in Bakhmut. And this video show that. That was -- that was a really close strike to that -- where that camera was positioned with the Ukrainian forces. And looked at -- just looked at other videos from Bakhmut today and you can see the soldiers are so close to each other, one of them that the Ukrainians are literally looking at an apartment window and almost right down below them, that's the Russian forces.

And his testimony is expected to take most of the days, so he has his guitar behind him because he is trying to prove his point that the chords in Thinking Out Loud are not similar and not an exact replica of you know Marvin Gaye's, Let's Get It On. I just want to remind everyone exactly what we are talking about here because we have heard from musicologists who have taken the stand talking about the melody, the rhythm of the song but take a listen for yourself a little bit of each song.

I screamed out to him hey, so what do you have to say to your fans who have been supporting you during this trial? And he simply just turned and looked at me and he said, thank you. You know, Sara, this is a very high-profile situation. Ed Sheeran, he has previously won a copyright infringement suit last year with a different song. He has settled on another one. It is common for celebrities, especially high-profile artists to find themselves in the courtroom. And Taylor Swift and others have been sued before and some have been successful, some not. Some do settlements right before. And clearly, both sides are really standing their ground with their own conviction and It's going to be up to this jury. One of the things that they're talking about today, I just want to tell you quickly, is the performance that Ed did in Zurich, Switzerland in 2014, where he plays Thinking Out Loud, then switches over to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On. And that is something that will be interesting to hear from Townsend's side of them cross-examine him on that performance and why did he play both of those songs, Sara.",
