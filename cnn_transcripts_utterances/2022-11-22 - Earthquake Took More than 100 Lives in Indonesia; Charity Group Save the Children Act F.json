At least 103 people have been killed, but authorities fear that number will rise.Video from the region shows homes and buildings destroyed. Piles of bricks and metal strewn on the streets. Survivors described a huge tremor followed by dozens of aftershocks. The quake triggered landslides, which are making it difficult to access rural areas. The government is putting up tents and shelters for more than 7,000 people forced from their homes. Indonesia's location on the so-called Ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean makes it prone to earthquakes. This one was a 5.6 magnitude, a 2004 quake of Sumatra killed more than a quarter million people in the region. And CNN's Anna Coren is following developments for us. So, she is live now this hour from Hong Kong. So, Anna, what more are you learning about the ongoing search and rescue efforts with this? ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Rosemary, crews are certainly out there going through the rubble trying to find any survivors from yesterday's earthquake. It hit at 1.20 in the afternoon, local time. It lasted for all of 30 seconds. It was a magnitude 5.6, which isn't big, but it was shallow, only 10 kilometers deep, which is why we saw this, this violence on the surface. The destruction it hit Cianjur, which is in West Java Province. It's about 75 kilometers southeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta, which is where tremors were also felt. But in Cianjur which is, you know, a regional city, these buildings are made of concrete. They just simply collapsed. Hundreds of them collapsed. Thousands of them have been damaged. And you mentioned that death toll, it stands at more than a hundred. Authorities fear that could rise. And we should have the latest numbers in the coming hours from officials on the scene. A makeshift hospital was set outside the hospital fearing that it would also collapse. And there are images of countless survivors being brought in on stretches to be treated. Most of the injuries being head trauma and fractures. But there are countless still missing including the child of this mother you are about to hear from. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator):  I have seven children and one of them hasn't been found. The children were downstairs and I was upstairs getting laundry. Everything collapsed beneath me and I was crushed beneath this child. One of my kids is still missing. My house is flattened. Good God, two of my kids survived. I dug them up and this one, two others I brought here and one is still missing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On Sunday night, the host Qatar were well beaten by Ecuador and then England thrashed Iran six-two. It was a dream start for Gareth Southgate's men who went to the semifinals in Russia four years ago, and England assumed complete control at the Khalifa International Stadium.Nineteen-year-old Jude Bellingham's first international goal was memorable and there were redeeming goals for Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford who missed penalties in the European Championship final last year, and both were racially abused for it. But this game will be remembered for other reasons. England's players all took a knee before the game, a gesture to promote inclusivity. The significance of such an act cannot be underestimated in Qatar where human and civil rights are often denied. And Iran's players also made headlines by not singing the national anthem that was widely interpreted as supporting the demonstrators who've been protesting against the Iranian government, many of whom have paid for it with their lives. England's win now sets up a mouthwatering clash against the United States of America in group B on Friday. That's the day after Thanksgiving. The USA are back in the World Cup for the first time in eight years, playing against a Wales team that hasn't played in the tournament since 1958. Team Wales gave the Americans a deserved first half lead, but they had to settle for a draw as the Welsh megastar Gareth Bale leveled the score with a late penalty. One-all is how it finished. Monday's other games saw the African champion Senegal lose to the Netherlands, but the game was also heading for a draw until a couple of late goals from the Dutch Cody Gakpo and Davy Klaassen on target there. So, we're now looking ahead to an action-packed Tuesday where four games will be jammed in from Group C and D. The defending champions France will be playing Australia whilst Argentina will be taking on Saudi Arabia, meaning the legendary Leonel Messi will be taking center stage in what is his fifth and quite possibly final World Cup.

And it, this letter complained that the troops were taking heavy losses, some 300 men either killed or injured, and that 50 percent of their equipment had been lost and what was described as an incomprehensible battle. Now, the reason that this letter was sent is because the troops felt that the senior management or the senior leadership of the military wasn't really getting the message directly from the front lines that things were not going well, that losses were high, and so that is why they sent it to a regional governor hoping to get his attention. Now, officially, the Kremlin or the ministry of defense came out and really downplayed any of all of the claims that were made in that letter, downplayed the scale of the losses here, but just one more example of this mismatch between what the Kremlin is saying about how things are going and what the reality is on the ground.",

And although these case numbers are very low compared to global standards, China has been holding tight to its zero COVID policy. This policy of mass testing, snap, lockdowns, and border controls, which has disrupted both lives and livelihoods. And that policy is testing residents across the country. In Beijing's most populous district, Chaoyang, which is home to nearly three and a half million people, officials have urged residents there, including students and workers to stay home.

The pressure on Beijing has further increased.\" Also in the north, Shijiazhuang is undergoing five days of mass testing as the city urges its residents not to leave unless necessary. Our shopping centers, entertainment venues are closed. Dine-in services and in-class learning suspended and the tough measures there come just days after the city relaxed COVID restrictions according to state media. In Guangzhou, the Bayun district is under lockdown until Friday. Now the district is home to the Guangzhou/Bayun in international airport. And on WeChat local health authorities said this. Quote, \" the risk of social transmission of the epidemic in Bayun district has continued to increase and the prevention and control situation is grim.\" Last week, scores of angry residents in another Guangzhou district took to the streets to protest China's tough anti-pandemic policy. Chongqing, China's biggest city with a population of over 30 million is also battling an outbreak. Last week, the city government announced that residents are not allowed to leave the city unless necessary. As winter is coming, COVID-19 cases across China are set to rise. The state-run People's Daily warns that the pandemic may worsen writing in an editorial this. Quote, \"the situation of pandemic control is severe. We must maintain confidence that we will win, resolutely overcome issues such as insufficient understanding and insufficient preparation.\" Unquote. Now earlier this month, Chinese authorities eased parts of its pandemic policy. And Goldman Sachs says China could start to reopen the April, June quarter of next year. But experts are warning that a full reopening requires higher vaccination rates, a change in messaging and broader access to medical care. And given the rise in cases nationwide, it'll be even harder for China to unwind its nearly three-year long zero COVID policy. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.",

Hundreds quit last week after refusing Elon Musk's demand to work extremely hardcore. And now, Eric Zuckerman, the head of U.S. News partnerships at Twitter, said he's leaving the company as well. And in Europe, Damien Viel, the head of Twitter France, announced his departure from the company simply tweeting, it's over.French regulators are expressing deep concern over the layoffs and whether the remaining staff can do enough to keep the platform afloat. And a small team of Twitter Africa employees who lost their jobs in Ghana are fighting the company over severance terms and accusing Elon Musk of discrimination. CNN's Larry Madowo has more on that.",

They claim they only received a severance pay offer after CNN reported on their plight, and this letter claims that it was arrived at after negotiation with the employees.But they tell CNN that they have never negotiated anything with Twitter. In fact, they don't even have a way to contact anyone on Twitter because their e-mails keep bouncing back. They've rejected that severance pay offer. Hired a lawyer and sent a demand letter to Twitter asking it to comply with Ghanaian employment law. They have also petitioned the chief labor officer in Ghana's employment ministry asking it to compel Twitter to do the right thing. Here's a portion of their notice to that office. It is clear that Twitter, Inc. under Mr. Elon Musk is either deliberately or recklessly flouting the laws of Ghana is operating in bad faith and in a manner that seeks to silence and intimidate former employees into accepting any terms unilaterally thrown at them. Without pressure from high authorities, they're clearly not willing to provide a fair or just package in order to minimize the hardship of this takeover in resulting in loss of jobs on their workforce in Africa. Some of these employees were hired from other countries and moved into Ghana, and they say they need reputation fees. They want three months severance for all the team and other relevant benefits. And so far, CNN has contacted Twitter for comment and has not heard back. Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi.",

That's about 65,000 kilometers and further out than any spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever gone before. Well, for more on the Artemis mission, I spoke earlier with Daniel Dumbacher.
