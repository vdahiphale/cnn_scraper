Those tensions are very real and very present, as you say, on thoseprotests that were on the streets of Tel Aviv yesterday, in support of the government, taking some of the protesters taking a very anti-U.S. position, or at least anti-President Biden. And perhaps that's reflective of some of the comments we've heard coming from some of Prime Minister Netanyahu's hard, right cabinet members. The National Security Minister, Mr. Ben-Gvir saying that Israel is an independent country, not a star on America's flag. There is definite pushback among the government supporters that the United States is not being at the Prime Minister's friend, this present time. But those tensions of which you're speaking about internally, they're doused a little bit at the moment, because there are talks going on between Netanyahu and opposition leaders to try to find a compromise around the judicial reforms. Faith in that is not high and that's why people expect tensions to build and out of that, again, in the Old City of Jerusalem today, a lot of Palestinians going to worship at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, very heavy Israeli security there, perhaps a sign that the tensions that have been playing out between Israelis and Palestinians earlier this year are at the moment on an even keel. But I think it underlines a broader sense that those tensions are very real, that there has not been a way found around them. So the fact you had the confluence of these three big religious festivals around the same time heightens concerns of potential spark for violence. But it is internally in Israel that some of those deeper divisions are throwing up some of the darker elements and that's a real concern here. We saw just a couple of days ago, how a Palestinian taxi driver was attacked by right wing pro-government supporters.

Now a grand jury in New York indicted Donald Trump and what sources that he says, are more than 30 counts of business fraud, tied to a hush money case out of the 2016 election involving adult film star seeing here, Stormy Daniels. Trump is expected to appear in court in Manhattan on Tuesday. Now he responded to the news of this indictment on social media calling it I quote him here, an attack on our country the likes of which we have never seen before. Donald Trump's Former Vice President Mike Pence calls the indictment and outrage. He spoke exclusively with CNN's Wolf Blitzer after the news broke on Thursday. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think the unprecedented indictment of a Former President of the United States on a campaign finance issue is an outrage. And it appears to millions of Americans be nothing more than a political prosecution that's driven by a prosecutor who literally ran for office on the pledge to indict the Former President. The message that this sends to the wider world is a terrible message about the American justice system. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So Becky, we've not seen the actual indictment yet. That's important to know. It's filed under seal as we say,meaning it's confidentially being held by the court. Typically, it would be unsealed at the time of the arraignment, the first appearance in court, which is scheduled for this Tuesday. That's what we're reporting. Now, that said, what we do know is that there's upwards of 30 counts in this indictment that doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. You can't equate numerosity with seriousness, but based on the reporting and based on the Grand Jury witnesses who we know of it looks like this is focused around the hush money payments that Donald Trump and his companies made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Now important to know, paying hush money knowing about hush money payments is not a crime. The crux of the crime here appears to be the falsification of business records within the Trump Organization. The theory is that the money that they paid for Stormy Daniels was falsely booked as Attorney's fees. If prosecutors charged that and if they can prove it, that's a misdemeanor that's lower than a felony. That means the maximum in prison is one year, but realistically, no one gets any prison time for that kind of misdemeanor. However, and we just heard some of the Republican lawmakers allude to this. If prosecutors can prove that records were falsified in order to commit some second crime, and here that would arguably be a campaign finance violation. Then it gets upgraded to a felony, which is more serious. We're looking at a four year max, although again, the judge has discretion to sentence to anywhere from no time in prison up to that four-year max. So that seems to be reasonably what we expect to be in the indictment. But again, we could be in for a surprise as well.",

Well, now he's back with a new comedy special on YouTube. I caught up with Maz earlier this month at the Four Seasons in Dubai for what was a wide ranging discussion about his tour around this region and his support for the Iranian protest --. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAZ JOBRANI, IRANIAN-AMERICAN COMEDIAN: Started coming to the region in 2007 with the axis of evil comedy tour. Back then, when we would show up the promoters would say my friend, you can talk about whatever you want, but no sex, no religion, no politics, maybe like all right, well, then hello, goodbye. Or shall I say Salam Alaikum, Alaikum Salam. Now I realized, first of all, when they say politics, and I think around the region, they mean no local politics. The good news is I don't know a lot about a lot of countries because I live in America. And we don't know. I mean, you talk to the average American when the Iran protests happened, I tell the American hey, and there are protests in Iran. They go Saddam Hussein is back. I go, that's the wrong country.

Then all of a sudden my social media changed and it was supporting the people of Iran trying to amplify the voice of the people of Iran as the protests were happening. However, I continued to do my shows, live shows. A 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, she is walking down the street her hair was out of her hijab a little bit. The morality police showed up arrested her killed her in the process. But then the people of Iran did not stand for it. So this protest is started 3 months ago. And it's been led by the women of Iran who've been at the forefront. It's amazing, it's Inspirational. And the reason I continue to do that was number one, I felt like I had a platform, because the other thing you realize is not everybody's aware. So I said, listen, this is my chance to let the others that aren't part of our community know what's going on. Secondly, it was a therapy session for my community, because we were all focused 24/7 on videos of brutality against the Iranian people. And so of course, when you watch that, this is causing deep, deep trauma to the viewer as well. And so when we came together, it was a therapy session. And it was an opportunity for me to say, let's keep fighting. Let's stay together. Let's support the women of Iran, the people of Iran as they go through this. The people of Iran are not fighting just for women. They're not just fighting for the people of Iran. They're fighting for democracy all over the world. What we can do is keep their voice going keep re-tweeting, keep re-posting, and attend rallies in support of the people of Iran all over the world.
