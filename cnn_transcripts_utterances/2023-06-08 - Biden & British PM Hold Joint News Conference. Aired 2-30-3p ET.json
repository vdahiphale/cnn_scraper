With -- you spoke about your unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. So much of that depends on funding from the U.S. Congress. And now with the counteroffensive under way, when do you expect to return to Congress and ask for new funding? And how much do you expect you will need?

We've done everything we could collectively. But individually in the United States, to make them ready, support that -- will continue, and an evolving situation that we're very optimistic. In talks with Ukraine and the Ukrainians and particularly with Zelenskyy and our allies and partners on commitments to Ukraine, long- term security, long-term security to deter future aggression after this war ends is the goal. And we're advancing this goal by providing the support Ukraine needs now on the battlefield, and helping them strengthen their military over the long term. The fact of the matter is that I believe we will have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes. And I believe that we're going to -- that support will be real even though you hear some voices today on Capitol Hill about whether or not we should continue to support Ukraine and for how long we should support them. The fact of the matter is I ask people to picture what would happen if we were not supporting Ukraine, do we think Russia would stop in Kyiv, do you think that's all that would be happening? I think not. And I think the vast majority of my colleagues, even the critics, think that would not be the case, as well. There's much more to say about Ukraine, but I hope that answers your direct question.",

Realizing that an event -- a glaring invasion with no pretext of anything other than conquering land occurring in the 21st century is a danger not only in Europe but everywhere in the world.

Laura Barron-Lopez with the \"PBS News Hour.\" All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led states are passing laws, passing anti-LGBTQ, anti-transgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California. And also recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving, not just their state but the country. Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore? Prime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that A.I. has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K. -- what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from A.I.-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors? And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by A.I. leaders about the potential threat, that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale so far to deal with climate change, another existential threat?",

First of all, maybe quietly when we finish you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them, let them know that the president and this administration has their back. And I mean that.Look, as president, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LGBTQ Americans and advance LGBTQ are the around the globe. But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and I would argue prejudiced people who are engaged in all that we see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear. And it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly just unjustified and ugly. It's wrong for that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors. These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel, it's callous. Not somebody else's kids, they're all our kids. They're the kids -- our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country. And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of initiatives we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do that at the front of the South Lawn. We're having Pride Day. We're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires. Number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety. Dedicate resources for federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses. [14:40:58] Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations. A new coordinator to protect LGBTQ students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn, and may violent their civil rights at the same time. We're also engaging in mental health and other support. More mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids. New efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness. Congress has to pass -- I'm not giving up on this, just like they told me we couldn't get the Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass, must pass the Equality Act and send it to my desk. LGBTQ Americans, especially children, you're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected.",

      "sentences": "Laura, on your question, it's clear that A.I. can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And as one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point eloquently yesterday.I think it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against. President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan, in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be. Here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently. We've done the same in Downing Street, just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively as we have been discussing that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect. And you talk about climate change, you know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technology of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today, that we need to bring that same spirit of urgency to the opportunities that A.I. poses because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue. I'm delighted that Joe and I and others will be doing that with all great haste. And I think a couple of questions on our end. Could I call on the BBC?",

And we've launched negotiations on critical materials and an agreement to deal with the climate crisis.For example, there is no reason why Great Britain will not play a major role in not only critical materials but in investing in the United States of America, in all of our initiatives relating to the need for critical materials including battery technology and a whole range of things, number one. Number two, cooperating on data and A.I. It is a limitless capacity and possibility. But we have to do it with great care, not relative to one another, but relative to the issue. Because when I convened the leaders in A.I. about -- I think there were 13 here in the United States, the very architects of this A.I., they're also very concerned about it getting out of hand. And we've got to make sure we're all on the same page. And we're looking to Great Britain to lead that effort this fall and put together a proposal, a group of nations to deal with, how do we deal with this? And not only has the potential to -- to cure cancer and many other things that are just beyond our comprehension, but it's the potential to do great damage if it's not controlled. And so we're looking for -- I'll overstate it. We're looking for watermarks on everything that has to do with produced by A.I. so we know from whence it comes. But there's a lot we have to do. We're also addressing the national security risk posed by certain types of outbound investments. I had a discussion with Xi Jinping in China, why was I think transferring certain technological capabilities. And I said very simply because you're using them for weapons of mass destruction and intelligence intervention. I said we'd work out something on that, we'd have a very different relationship. So what we're trying to do is figure out how together we can make sure that we have -- let me back up and say it this way. I don't think ever in the history of the U.N. endeavor has there been as fundamental potential technological change as is presented by artificial intelligence. It is staggering. It is staggering. You have some of these leaders in the industry talking about how they're concerned whether a machine will begin to think for itself, not need to be programmed. I mean, it's just -- I know it sounds like science fiction, but it is close to science fiction, some of the things. Enormous potential. And we're looking to Great Britain to help lead that effort, to figure out a way through this so we're at full, total cooperation. Because there's no one -- no country we have greater faith in being able to negotiate this, not negotiate with individuals, negotiate our way through this than the prime minister.

Is today's agreement a recognition in light of Covid, the great threat of China, Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the era of unfettered globalization is over? If so, the U.S. thinks that requires a much more interventionalist industrial policy to respond to that. Why do you think that approach is wrong for the U.K.? And, Mr. President, what do you say to those abroad who say that your new Washington consensus is simply a fancy way of saying America First? And in light of the warm words just now about U.K.-U.S. defense collaboration, particularly in Ukraine, do you think it's time for the first British NATO secretary-general in two decades?",

I didn't realize I had Bidenomics going. The bottom line is this. That the fundamental change is taking place in terms of international trade. Nobody in, at least -- very few people in the United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what supply chain meant or they were talking about supply chain. When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles is because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic. We realized that -- I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth. And I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners, as well, that although we were going to generate a, for example, an A.I. capacity here -- excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as we are and benefiting in a similar way. The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that -- globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle- down economics, where -- if the trickle-down economics resulted in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations. In making sure that we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product -- sent the work to those -- to that neighbor or those neighbors rather than cheapest labor and they sent back their products. I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity here in the United States. We're attracting capacity to build here in the United States, to send product overseas. Not the reverse. And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. As a matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it, as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things. So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials, battery technologies, the share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us. So it is increasing trade. But right now, it looks like it is -- because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it look like it's only the United States. It's not. It's a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth.",

At the G-7, it was originally called \"Build Back Better World.\" But we're talking about there's a new PPI -- anyway, an industrialpolicy that we're all signed onto to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country because the reverse true. If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have to -- be able to build infrastructure -- you know, the Canadian -- excuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road initiative. Well the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a dead- end confiscation program. Not going far. What we're doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7, is providing opportunities. For example, Angola should be in a position very soon to have the largest -- the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. Benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they've never been before. We're talking about building -- and I have my team putting together with other countries, as well, to build a railroad from the Pacific Ocean -- the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. Our Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries. So there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity because we all benefit from it. And one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequential single-most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewer, not less together. And so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can. Thank you. (CROSSTALK)",
