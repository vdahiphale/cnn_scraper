Because remember, this trial is about damages. Trump's utility as a witness is very limited. And the judge wanted him to stick to the script that he and Habba agreed to and for the most part, they did.Let's go through the three questions that Habba asked him while he was on the stand. First, she asked Trump, \"Do you stand by your testimony in the deposition?\" The deposition that he gave in this case. He replied, \"100 percent, yes.\" Then she asked, \"Did you deny the allegation because Ms. Carroll made an accusation.\" Trump responded, \"That's exactly right. Yes, I did. She said something that I considered a false accusation, totally false.\" But then Judge Kaplan, cut in, he wanted them to stick to the plan. He cut Trump off saying that everything that he said after yes, I did is stricken. Because remember, they're not litigating here what is true and what is false in terms of what happened in that department store, that was litigated last summer. So here, Habba's final question was, \"Did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll in your statements?\" Trump said, \"No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.\" Then Trump stepped off the -- he actually he was -- then he was cross examined. But what's interesting here is it's been days and days of will he or won't he, Jake, and he did. But he only answered questions for three minutes.",

Jean Carroll's accusation of rape in that department store in the 1990s was litigated, along with questions about defamation and damages before jury, Trump didn't attend a single minute of that case. So that's what E. Carroll's lawyer is getting at, that he never attended the trial where a lot of these key issues in this case where a jury found him liable for sexual abuse were litigated.But now of course, in the heat of the 2024 campaign season, he's attended much of this case and then opting to take the stand when he really doesn't have much to offer in terms of damages.",

Paula Reid, thank you so much.Meanwhile, prison time for another former Trump adviser who defied a congressional subpoena. First, it was Steve Bannon, now today, Peter Navarro, who was sentenced to four months in prison for defying the subpoena from the House Select Committee investigating January 6.

So, a little bit less of a fine than Steve Bannon got for doing the same thing. But the same amount of jail time for defying the subpoena, not turning over documents, not sitting for testimony before the House Select Committee. And Judge Amit Mehta over at the federal court in D.C., he said, you know, Peter Navarro, you were happy to talk about what you were doing after the 2020 election, publicly you were writing about it in your book.And though you're a good guy, and he brought his lawyer shoes when he needed him and he was helping with coronavirus pandemic in the White House, he should have known and he shouldn't have been saying this was a political prosecution, even to the judge today in court. Judge Mehta says specifically to Peter Navarro as he's heading down that sentence, \"You want me to believe this is a political prosecution when the evidence is completely to the contrary. You are not a victim. You are not the object of a political prosecution. These are the circumstances of your own making.\" So the judge making quite clear there, Jake, today the consequences of not responding to a House subpoena in any meaningful way. Even if you're a White House adviser is jail time.",

It's within the sentencing guidelines range.And the fine in particular, you know, unless it's some sort of corporate crime, or there's some sort of reason that a monetary fine makes a lot of sense as part of the punishment, most felonies and most misdemeanors in federal court actually get the bare minimum fine, which is really called a special assessment, they don't get any true fine at all. So, I wasn't surprised to see where the sentence add up. And I think that the prosecutors are probably pleased with four months. I mean, it's not a lot of time, but it is a misdemeanor. And Peter Navarro, assuming that he doesn't get this overturned or drag it out until former President Trump is president again and gets a pardon, he will go to prison for this.

That's the first lady of New Jersey the wife of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. She's a former Goldman Sachs Analyst who has never been elected to public office before, and around whom the Democratic machine in New Jersey is rallying versus three term congressman, Andy Kim. He's the son of Korean immigrants, a Rhodes Scholar and diplomat and a member of Obama's National Security Council, whose district includes counties that Trump carried twice.Now, you might remember Congressman Kim from this viral photo of him cleaning the floors of the Capitol after the January 6 insurrection. To Congressman Kim and his supporters, the Democratic Party's commitment to democracy in New Jersey at least, looks a bit shaky unless you think machine politics exemplified the best of democracy. The questions that Kim supporters ask, what is it about the first lady of New Jersey that prompted a bunch of Democratic county chairs from the most populous counties in the state to support her? Surely it couldn't have anything to do with fears of reprisals from the governor or his government, right? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLLEEN O'DEA, SENIOR WRITER, NEW JERSEY SPOTLIGHT NEWS: I think it's all because of Governor Murphy. The party bosses, I think we'd like to stay on his good side.

A staffer with the New Jersey State Democratic party reached out and told these college kids that their future job prospects and their ability to attend the Democratic National Convention could be in jeopardy because they picked Congressman Kim. The party staffer later told \"The New York Times\" that they didn't mean to threaten the students and Murphy's campaign later distance itself from the threat saying that the staffer did not work on their behalf.The Murphy campaign tells CNN, quote, \"Tammy is laser focused on listening to New Jersey voters and traveling the state to earn their support. Long before running for office, Tammy has worked to strengthen the Democratic Party in New Jersey to advance issues critical to working families,\" unquote. Congressman Andy Kim joins us now. Congressman, it's good to see you. So, yesterday you got the endorsement from your former Democratic colleague, Congressman Tom Malinowski and the first lady criticized him, noting that he had been investigated and fined by the House Ethics Committee for improper stock disclosures during his time in the House. And I'm wondering what your reaction to that was? REP. ANDY KIM (D-NJ), SENATE CANDIDATE: Yes, thanks, Jake. Thanks for shining a light on this. And you're absolutely right. You know, the first lady attacked former Congressman Tom Malinowski yesterday when he endorsed me. You saw and talked about what happened to the College Democrats in New Jersey threatened and pressured when they were considering endorsing me. I mean, it's a pattern now and it's a pattern of pressure and intimidation from the first lady, from the state Democratic Party against -- you know what I keep telling them, you don't have to threaten and pressure every single person that endorses me. That's not what it needs to be. But the problem is, it's not just about those people, you know, they're trying to send a signal to anyone who might be considering endorsing me, and trying to tell them not to, brush them off by showing, you know, the example what they make to those. And I just find that to be kind of the politics that people can't stand here in New Jersey and frankly, around the country, especially on the heels of this scandal with Menendez. People in New Jersey are tired of this kind of soprano state tactics. And, you know, honestly, it kind of resembles a lot of what President Trump's been doing in terms of telling donors not to donate to Nikki Haley, that kind of pressure, that kind of tactic is just got to move beyond that and just ended now.",
