The House Rules Committee on Tuesday approved a rule for the bill despite opposition from two hardline conservatives on the panel. So, essentially this will clear the way for a floor vote. But they still need to pass the actual underlying bill and there has been opposition from both the far-left and the far- right. So, party leaders have been working furiously behind the scenes to try to sell this deal, to try to whip this deal.House Democrats will huddle on Wednesday morning with their party leadership and the White House officials. And Republicans huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday evening. Where we're told that Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a forceful sales pitch for this deal. He touted a number of victories in the bill. And some conservatives did get up and express their concerns with what they view as a watered-down bill that gave way too many concessions to the Democrats. But despite the conservative opposition, Kevin McCarthy is expressing confidence that they'll be able to get this over the finish line. Take a listen. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: I've talked to many about whether they're for or against the bill. I'm not sure what in the bill people are concerned about. Everybody has an opportunity.

The have talked about the U.S.-South Korea military drills as being hostile in nature and this is what they say for the past year and a half. They have been having so many missile launches and so much testing that has been happening --something South Korea and the U.S. reject. But what we saw today is that this did fail. It failed in the second stage according to Pyongyang. And it is interesting that they were quite so quick to admit failure. That is not something that North Korea is well known for. But they say that they will try again very soon. Now there has been some political fallout here in South Korea as well. As there was an air raid siren about 6:30 this morning followed by an emergency alert telling residents to evacuate when they were in no danger. About 20 minutes later they admitted that was a mistake. And it has shaken and eroded some trust in the emergency alert system here.
