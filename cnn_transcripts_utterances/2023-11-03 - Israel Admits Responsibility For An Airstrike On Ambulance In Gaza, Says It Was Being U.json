The Israeli Defense Forces saying that they -- this claiming that this ambulance was being used by Hamas and saying that several Hamas operatives were killed in this strike, Wolf, but the reports on the ground, obviously those images are just absolutely difficult to see. Fifteen people were killed in this strike, 50 others were wounded according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which of course is controlled by Hamas. Israel also says in its claim of responsibility that Hamas has been known to use ambulances to transport Hamas militants as well as weaponry. But Wolf, there are questions about the legitimacy of this target, particularly as a spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Health says that this ambulance was part of a convoy carrying wounded individuals, were heading to that Rafah crossing in order to leave Gaza and head into Egypt.And what's more, Wolf, they also say that they notified the International Red Cross of this convoy movement before it left. The Red Cross, Wolf, tonight is confirming that it did receive notification about this convoy before this convoy left and that it received a request to accompany that convoy before it left. Now, meanwhile, Wolf, the Israeli Defense Forces are continuing to carry out their ground operation inside of Gaza as well. Israeli military officials say that they have encircled Gaza City and we know that they have been moving towards Gaza City on several fronts from the north, as well as from the south. But what's clear is that there is still very much ongoing fighting in the northern part of Gaza. Hamas, for its part, Wolf, is continuing to fire rockets against Israeli towns and cities, targeting those cities indiscriminately without looking at whether they are civilian or military targets. In fact, Wolf, earlier today a rocket landed about 100 meters from where a number of journalists were posted on a hill in Sderot overlooking the Gaza Strip. I want to show you the moment that this rocket landed not far from my team's position. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we saw Prime Minister Netanyahu after that meeting with Secretary Blinken rejecting that call, essentially, saying that they are not going to consider any pauses unless hostages in Gaza can get out. We of course, know that those negotiations and those talks have been ongoing but we've not seen a big breakthrough so far.

So he extended the gag order, saying that attorneys are now prohibited from speaking either in the court or outside of the court about any communications that the judge has had with any members of his staff.And the judge saying that one reason that he's doing this is because they have received hundreds of threats through e-mails, calls, voicemails, letters to his chamber, saying that that outweighs any first amendment rights that they may have to raise these issues. And the Trump's attorneys have already made the record in this case forward.

And he said, yours -- don't worry your sister with -- is with Allah. She's safe now. She's with Allah.Tzachi, all this time cannot talk. He's shocked. He's not functioning because he saw his kid dead. And he was just holding his head and crying. And I was looking at him. And, you know, when you have this impression of nothing behind it, it was like that. Tzachi is one of the strongest men I know. Every time that something happens, he's the one that holds the situation. It was painful to see him like that. And then they said, OK, you and you, and they were pointing at Tzachi and Domri (ph). He said you and you get up. You're coming with us. And they cuffed his hand with white stripes and barefooted also, I think. And they said, OK, you're coming with us, and they took them. They were in front of the back door. They asked whose car is it? And Tzachi said, this is my car. To us, they said, OK, stay on the ground, or you will be killed. We'll shoot you or you'll be dead. So we stayed, we told our husbands, Leisha (ph) and me, we said, we love you. Don't do anything stupid. Don't be a hero. Just do what they say, please. And the kid started yelling, don't take him, don't take him. And they said, no, no, it's OK. He'll be back. He'll be back. They promised the kids he'll be back. We couldn't do anything. And it was until I think 5:30 in the afternoon that we heard people talking around us, you know, and we just looked outside, peeked outside, Leisha (ph) picked outside and said they're -- there's somebody is walking around the house. They said (Speaking in Foreign Language) which is IDF, IDF. There are actually our saviors. They took us out of the house, actually. But the kids didn't want to go. They said please, I don't want anybody else to be dead in this house. I don't want anybody else getting murdered. The kids didn't want to go. It took me 20 minutes outside the kibbutz just to breathe because I couldn't breathe all the way. I held Shashar on me and Yael and we went out like this. Sorry.",
