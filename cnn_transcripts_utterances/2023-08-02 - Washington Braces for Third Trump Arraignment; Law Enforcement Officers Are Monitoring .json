We will look ahead to tomorrow's court appearance with former Trump National Security adviser, John Bolton.Later Trump's trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, what we know about her history with the former president and the sentences she has already given other January 6 defendants. And in Ukraine, a remarkable rescue. A Ukrainian soldier saved with the help of a drone which delivered medical supplies and water. Good evening. Tomorrow, the former president of the United States will make his second appearance in a federal court as an alleged felon, the first was in Miami in the documents case. Until Donald Trump in the 234 years since George Washington was inaugurated, no holder of the office has had to do that even once, but tomorrow afternoon at four, if the schedule holds, the 44th president since George Washington will enter a federal courthouse in Washington just a short walk from the Capitol. He will be asked by a federal magistrate, not the trial judge, to plead to four counts detailed in a 45-page indictment connected to his attempt to overturn the election that he lost, an effort that Special Counsel Jack Smith said yesterday was \"fueled by lies\" and criminal or not, there were plenty of those lies. The indictment identifies 21 separate lies the former president told, lies about non-existent voter fraud, about ballot dumps that did not happen, lies the former Vice President Pence had the power, which he did not, to reject Biden electoral votes. Today, with defenders suggesting his former boss was merely seeking a pause in the certification process, not the reversal of it, now candidate Pence said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But once he's inside the courthouse tomorrow, Anderson, he is effectively under arrest. He'll be processed like any other defendant, though we do not expect that he will have a mug shot taken. This issue came up in the Manhattan first appearance and the Florida initial appearance. Mug shots are for when a suspect goes on the limb. He is of course, one of the most recognizable faces in the world, so they have not been taking mug shots of him. Now during this hearing, he will not be appearing before Judge Chutkan, who will handle the eventual case and trial. This will just be before a magistrate judge. It is a procedural hearing, it should be over pretty quickly. He'll hear the charges that have been filed against him.

It occurred to me that Donald Trump is not going to have a zero rap sheet, he is actually going to have two other pending charges on that rap sheet which is sadly a first in our history. But other than that, it will be a largely formalistic procedure. He will enter a plea, it will be not guilty.

Trump, if he were innocent, if he were really innocent, he would be saying I want trial tomorrow. I want the stain removed from my reputation. That's obviously not his strategy. We all know what his strategy is. But I think the prosecutors, really now at this point need to work out what the best schedule is going to be and I think, frankly, the Georgia and New York prosecutors should defer to the federal prosecutors, and if need be, move their trials after the election.
