Are we talking about some kind of limited incursion? We have talked -- we've heard Israel's leaders talk a lot about the need to stomp out Hamas completely, but there is a reality on the ground given that this enclave has been held by Hamas for 17 years, it is densely populated. You're talking potentially about very nasty urban house-to-house street to street guerrilla warfare, which will make this a very tough fight.

Since then, this bitterly divided House Republican Conference has tried to figure out a way forward. Steve Scalise was nominated by his conference yesterday, but he didn't have enough votes to become elected speaker by the full House. He could only afford to lose four Republican votes in the full House. More than a dozen, maybe up to two dozen Republicans indicated that they were probably going to vote against him. All day long, Steve Scalise had been trying to convince those holdouts to flip, to come his way. He failed in that effort, and just moments ago, he came out of this conference meeting and urged those members to put their personal agendas aside and get behind one candidate for the good of the party. But Anderson, it is uncertain whether the Republicans can do just that. There are some talk of other candidates running in this race. Jim Jordan who Scalise defeated for the Republican nomination for speaker is one person seen as possibly running here, but there could be others as well. Just moments ago, also former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did not rule out himself running again or being considered as a candidate for the speakership. So all raising huge questions about how Republicans could move forward in this key moment when so much is riding on the house, and whether they can take other actions or other Plan B actions, maybe even prop up the interim speaker of the House, Patrick McHenry who doesn't have any power, but there's talk of giving him new power to move legislation because Republicans really are desperate to try to figure out a way out of a crisis of their own making. So Anderson at the moment, Republicans still huddling behind closed doors trying to figure out what's next. Will there be a new leadership election? Will there be a new candidate here? But a huge, huge concern for many Republicans about how to move forward with this House, which can't do anything yet until they figure out who their speaker is and whether that speaker can actually get the votes to be elected -- Anderson.",

And CNN's Open-Source Investigator, Paul Murphy, has spent the last few days pouring through years of social media video, satellite imagery, and the results and the findings are shocking.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice-over): Propaganda videos put out by Hamas reveal chilling details about the years of preparations that went into Saturday's bloody attacks right under Israel's nose. Analyzing metadata from the videos, a CNN investigation can reveal the presence of at least six training sites inside Gaza. One just 720 meters from the most heavily fortified and patrolled part of Israel's border. In that camp, Hamas recreated an Israeli compound, with elements of the nearby border crossing, including an insignia of the Erez battalion. The videos show they even practiced taking prisoners and zip tying their hands at the camp. Satellite imagery indicates the camp was constructed within the last year and a half. At two other locations in the southern part of Gaza, Hamas trained for their audacious paraglider assault, rehearsing takeoffs and landings. At all six sites, two years of satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows no indication of offensive Israeli military action. The imagery instead shows that in the last two years, some camps even expanded into surrounding farmland. And that there was activity in the last several months at the camps. The stunning revelations raise questions as to how Hamas was able to train so openly, so close to the border, for so long, and why Israeli officials were unable to pick up on and prevent the October 7th attack.

The assumption may be that they were aware of it, that they perhaps didn't understand or misinterpreted the intelligence, didn't see it as a direct threat. Again, that's speculative. We don't know. What we do know is that there will be, at some point, a deep dive investigation into this by the Israelis, and the Israeli people will want to know who should be held accountable.",

Thank you.I want to talk about something we mentioned earlier, the ISIS flags that the Israeli Defense Ministry says were found with bodies of gunmen at one kibbutz. For that, we want to bring in Joby Warrick, a national security reporter for The Washington Post, author of a remarkable book, \"Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS\". Joby, when you see this flag and the fact that the Israeli's defense minister made the statement, quote, Hamas is ISIS, which you're hearing a lot now from Israeli officials and soldiers, what do you see as that comparison? JOBY WARRICK, AUTHOR, \"BLACK FLAGS: THE RISE OF ISIS\": Well, Hamas and ISIS are different, so let's just put that down. They're -- they have very different histories. They have, you know, they sometimes are at odds with each other. They don't particularly like each other and their allegiances. So they fought back and forth quite a bit. However, they've become similar, in some ways. Their ideology is fairly similar. Now their tactics are very ISIS like. And that's from Hamas' point of view, the brutality, the symbolism, the things that we see Hamas doing that evokes ISIS. They like that because that terrifies people. It horrifies people in the same way that ISIS like gloried in those horrible videos that we saw them put out. But also from Israel's point of view, though, the comparison with ISIS is very useful because we all agreed about what to do with ISIS. Everybody opposed ISIS. 86 countries, you know, signed up to fight ISIS. The solution was to destroy this, you know, ISIS completely. And so you can see why it's -- you know, the Israelis are making a big deal about the fact that there are these comparisons, including flags, that are being -- that are turning up among the bodies of these fighters.",

And so they may be objecting a little bit too late, but I do think that that comparison is extremely harmful for them.And because, to repeat, ISIS was so brutal and so terrible that everybody in the world wanted to see that organization destroyed.
