But we're into the second day of a targeted strike that has some 13,000 UAW members walking the picket lines in three U.S. cities.They are getting some reinforcements from Washington. The acting Labor Secretary, along with a top White House adviser, went to Detroit Friday to help sides reach a deal. President Biden says auto companies should go further to make a deal. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Auto companies have seen record profits, including the last few years, because of the extraordinary skill and sacrifices of UAW workers. Those record profits have not been shared fairly, in my view, with those workers. The bottom line is that auto workers help create America's middle class. They deserve a contract that sustains them in the middle class. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's the first time there's been a union strike all three at the same time.Ford and GM are offering a 20 percent pay raise over the term of a potential new contract. Stellantis has offered a 17.5 percent increase. The UAW wants an immediate 20 percent raise and four subsequent raises of 5 percent each. There's a lot at stake, according to one analysis. A 10-day strike could cost the U.S. economy over $5 billion. There's already been some fallout. GM says its Fairfax, Kansas, assembly line, would soon run out of parts. Ford told about 600 workers on a truck line in Michigan not to report to work Friday because the paint department there is on strike. The UAW president says 80 percent of the union's demands have been left off proposals from the automakers. Ford's CEO says the union's wage demands would put his company out of business.

They are asking for Trump basically to be limited from making statements regarding the identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses and statements about any party, witness, attorney, court personnel or potential jurors that are disparaging, inflammatory or intimidating. That's the focus on what they are trying to do. One of the things that the judge is going to have to keep in mind is the fact that a defendant has a right to speak. And judges are often reluctant to try to limit some of that, because they could create problems for an appeal. And we also have the unusual situation where the defendant is running for president. Part of his the platform is his sort of beef with what happened in 2020. That's really what he's litigating as part of his campaign. So it's not clear what the judge is going to do. It is true she has already warned him about some of his comments and statements and anything that could intimidate witnesses. But you can bet what she's going to do, if she tries to limit it, is going to start small and see what Donald Trump does to try to abide by those.

Derna's gone, you won't see it again. They've gotten some help since. International support has been slowly trickling in but nowhere near enough to deal with a disaster on this scale. It's mostly Libyans here, volunteers from every corner of this bitterly divided country, foes who fought each other for years, united in grief, doing what they can to mend the wounds of this broken city. Most are here to try and give the dead a dignified end. It's not the time to lay blame for what happened, many say. But the dams had not been maintained for decades, residents say. Had they been, Derna and its people may still be standing. Nearly a week on, emotions here still so raw. Tarek and his family climbed on top of the water tanks on their roof. They all survived but most of his neighbors did not. There are 12 to 15 homes on our street. We lost 33 people, he tells us. He then starts to name the dead. Entire families gone.
