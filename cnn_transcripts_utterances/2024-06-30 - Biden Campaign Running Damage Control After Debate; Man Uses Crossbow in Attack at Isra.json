But there's no getting away from the calls for him to end his campaign, and those calls just got a bit louder. Sources tell CNN that the family gathering isn't aimed at making a decision on that.The White House says this was a long-planned family event expected to include a photo shoot. Still, we're told the topic of just how badly the debate went is expected to come up, and these are the people who, more than anyone, hold significant influence over such decisions. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spent part of Saturday trying to reassure donors that he is still the best candidate for the Democratic Party. At a fundraiser Saturday, Biden told those gathered that he'll fight harder despite new calls for him to exit the presidential race. The largest newspaper here in the battleground state of Georgia is the latest to call for Biden to drop out. Have a look. \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's\" editorial board wrote, \"If he displays the courage and dignity that have defined his political career, he might follow in the footsteps of the nation's first president and welcome his retirement secure in the knowledge that he again served his country with honor.\" CNN's Arlette Saenz has more on the President's latest efforts to put the debate behind him.

The President spent Saturday with the First Lady, attending three fundraisers in the Hamptons and New Jersey. At each of those events, he acknowledged his poor debate performance, but tried to assure donors that his candidacy remains on track.It comes as Biden's advisers have fielded phone calls from anxious Democrats and donors concerned about the state of the race and what it could mean to keep Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket after that debate performance. Sources tell CNN that Democrats are conducting polling and research over the weekend and early into next week to try to gauge the exact impact that debate will have on this re-election bid. They said they're not just looking at Biden's re-election bid, but also how House and Senate Democrats who are in competitive races could be affected as well. Now, the Biden campaign so far has doubled down on the fact that President Biden is remaining in the 2024 race. They say that he intends to debate Donald Trump in September. And a memo from the Biden Campaign's Chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said that they believe that this will be a very close race, but do believe that their team will put in the work to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in November. Now, President Biden is going to spend Saturday at Camp David with the First Lady and other members of their family, all at a time when many questions are swirling about what could come next for Biden in this campaign.

He ran for president in 2020, saying that he'd be a bridge to the future.When he selected Kamala Harris four years ago as his Vice-Presidential nominee, many people thought that, in effect, he was going to prepare her to be his successor. But from the start of his presidency, doubts emerged about her ability to connect with the electorate, perceptions of her competence and so on. Some fair, some not so fair. And I think Joe Biden, in effect, decided at some point during his presidency that Kamala Harris would not be a strong candidate against Donald Trump. And that's -- that determination really, I think, meant that he had to run for re-election because Biden couldn't say, I'm not going to run for re-election, but I also don't have confidence in my vice president to succeed me as the nominee. And that is, I think, still his problem right now, because I think that probably the biggest barrier to him pulling back is his lack of confidence in Kamala Harris.

I want them to listen to the speeches. Perhaps we'll have some CNN debates in the next few weeks between potential candidates and my delegates can listen to those debates.The problem with that is that Kamala Harris will have a strong following within the party, maybe not enough to win the nomination. And her supporters will feel -- will feel to a certain extent rightly aggrieved that the person who selected her to be the next in line for the presidency right now doesn't feel comfortable saying that I think she should be the next president in January of next year. And then the risk for the Democrats becomes depressed turnout in November. And this is an all-hands-on deck election. The Democrats need everyone, all of their supporters to turn out. They don't have the luxury of key constituencies staying home or having lethargic turnout in November. And that, I think, is the risk of a messy nomination contest.",

Several Caribbean nations, including Barbados and Grenada, are bracing for impact as Beryl, the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic season, is expected to move across the Windward Islands late Sunday night, is now located north of French Guiana and is getting stronger. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts Beryl could bring life- threatening winds and storm surge as a major hurricane. Record warm ocean temperatures are to blame for the unseasonably early tropical system, and experts warn Beryl is just the first of what could be more than a dozen hurricanes to come during this hyperactive Atlantic season. Warmer waters aren't the only breeding ground for more tropical systems and hurricanes. It can also lead to deadlier storms through a process called rapid intensification.

Now, Pezeshkian is someone who wants better relations, he says, with countries here in the region, but also better relations with the West as well. And the supreme leader of this country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he had warned voters not to trust candidates that want better relations with the U.S. too much. He never maimed Pezeshkian. However, there were some who believed that he meant Pezeshkian with that. Saeed Jalili, for his part, came in second in the first round of voting.

We saw that with Hassan Rouhani when he was the president and came in with a very strong mandate to try to improve relations with the West and particularly with the U.S. And that led to the nuclear deal in 2015. I think the problem for Pezeshkian if he were to win the election is that he's unlikely to be a sort of powerful, influential president by himself. He doesn't come in with a strong base of support from within the political establishment in Iran, although he's picked up the backing of people like Mohammad Javad Zarif, the former Iranian Foreign Minister. He has picked up their backing during the election, but he's not someone who prior to a month ago was a very influential figure in Iranian politics. He would also be coming in probably with a fairly small mandate in terms of voter turnout and how many people voted for him.

Experts warn Beryl is just the first of what could be more than a dozen hurricanes to come during this hyperactive Atlantic season. We're learning more about how three sweeping U.S. Supreme Court decisions just days ago could affect the future of the United States. Now, one ruling guts the power of federal agencies to approve regulations that could have major effects on the environment, public health, and the workplace. In another ruling, the high court said federal prosecutors improperly charged hundreds of January 6th defendants with obstruction. The decision could force prosecutors to reopen at least some of those cases. And the conservative court voted in favor of an Oregon town that tickets its homeless residents for sleeping outside. The decision rejects the argument the law violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. And joining us now from Washington, D.C., is Jesse Rabinowitz.

Half of Americans pay more than they can afford in rent. And nearly one in four worry about becoming homeless.Instead of focusing on solutions to homelessness, like housing and services, the Supreme Court just made it easier to throw people in jail for sleeping outside. That will make homelessness worse. We need to use this moment in time to call on our elected officials, from President Biden all the way down to local elected officials, to focus on the true solutions to homelessness, which is why we're calling on the president and Congress to invest $356 billion in the next year as a down payment towards solving homelessness and ensuring that everybody has a safe place to sleep.",

I'm glad you brought up Los Angeles. Their recent point in time count shows a 10% decrease in homelessness.So that shows that even when they were under the ruling that said you couldn't throw people in jail, they were able to reduce homelessness significantly, which is praiseworthy. That shows that cities don't need to be able to throw people in jail to solve homelessness. They need to focus on the true solution to homelessness, which is housing and services. Anything else is politicians deflecting blame for their failure to do what is needed to solve homelessness.",
