Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater icon Judith Jamison passed away yesterday in New York after what is being called a brief illness. She was 81.But those of us who knew her, admired her, and for so many others who were even more fortunate to have been taught, led and embraced by the former Alvin Ailey dance director, her indelible inspiration continues to endure. Prior to being Alvin Ailey director for nearly two decades and handpicked by her predecessor and group namesake to lead the company, Judith Jamison was an unforgettable dance star and standout. We are so blessed to have had Jamison join me on this show a couple of times over the years including shortly after she hand selected her successor, Robert Battle as artistic director.

Meantime, Trump is hunkered down at his Florida resort, focusing on top positions and priorities for a second term. And as we await to hear his key administration picks, Trump is sending out a clear message that he is emphasizing loyalty in his new hires. The president-elect is now ruling out two former Cabinet officials who criticized him in the past, and in a statement on Truth Social, Trump said he would not be inviting former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley nor former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to be a part of his new administration. The president-elect is now preparing for an Oval Office meeting this week with President Joe Biden, a political tradition that didn't happen four years ago when Trump was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election. We've got a team of correspondents covering these developments. Sunlen Serfaty is at the White House for us, but let's begin with Alayna Treene near Trump's Florida home. Alayna, Trump is posting on Truth Social what he is really thinking and feeling.",

It is unclear from my conversations, they would not share more details on what was the hold up with that agreement, but we are told that is the reason that he has not received some of these crucial briefings. And I would remind you as well, Fred, that ethics has always kind of been a top issue in mind when it comes to the former President Donald Trump. We know that he has a lot of business deals. He has foreign business ties. A lot of those came under intense scrutiny in his first administration. Of course, he also has Truth Social and other things that could potentially be seen as conflicts of interest.

They got through, they had been playing a game, they won on penalties.And so they were up against Inter Miami, who dominated the regular season and actually set a points record in the process. This game was amazing. That was Lionel Messi scoring the kind of goal we never see him score, a header to equalize against Atlanta to make it two-two. But in the end, Atlanta United had just enough. This was the goal that won this game for them, sending them into the Eastern Conference semifinals. But when you think about, you know, everything is different in the postseason. In the regular season, Inter Miami finished 34 points ahead of Atlanta United making this the biggest mismatch ever in MLS postseason history, and the underdogs came through.

China is known as the world's factory.I want to show you video from a government tour CNN went on last fall. We traveled to a port city of Dalian where we saw a massive factory complex. Across the country, these developments are large and they can adapt to change quickly. So in the case of a fashion company like Steve Madden, they can shift pretty fast to the latest fashion trends and styles which can shift season to season. I remember going to China about ten years ago and visited a cashmere factory. It was very efficient and high tech back then. Then the other factor at play is workforce. Labor here in the world's second largest economy isn't expensive. As far as the threat of tariffs, the government has been asked about it. A government spokesperson wouldn't answer a hypothetical, but broadly speaking said there would be no winner in a trade war and it is not good for the world. Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing.
