Then, Russia shoots down drones over Moscow, as Putin takes to the international stage for the first time since the insurrection. And France, quieter after days of riots, but what's next? I'll ask the country's finance minister about the ingrained inequality angering protesters. But first tonight, a new round of violence in the Middle East is spilling onto Israeli territory. Authorities say, at least, eight people have been injured in Tel Aviv in what they're calling a terror attack. Surveillance footage captures a moment the attack happened. To the far left, you see a driver ram a truck into a busy sidewalk, barely missing a scooter in a bike lane. Well, as this dust settles, customers at a cafe begin to flee. So, that, right there. That's when the assailant exits a vehicle and begins stabbing and chasing people. Part of the attack is blurred, as you can see there. One of the victims injured and alive, limps away and the attacker runs off after other people. Well, police say an armed civilian ended the rampage by shooting and killing the assailant. This image shows the person in a motorcycle helmet pointing a gun at the person on the ground. This, as Hamas claims responsibility for the attack. The Palestinian militant say the assault is a response to this. Israeli forces launching a major operation we've been telling you about in the West Bank centered on Jenin in extensively-populated refugee camp. Palestinian officials say, at least, ten people have been killed there. For the very latest, let's go to CNN's Hadas Gold, who's live for us in this hour in Jerusalem. And Hadas, what more do we know about Tel Aviv, and in particular, about this incident in Tel Aviv, in particular about the attacker here?",

And as Hadas mentioned there,that operation, the Jenin operation has continued today, and it seemed like Hadas was saying, will continue. And we want to bring you up to speed really on what exactly what we know right now. The Israelis have used aircraft, as well as ground forces, and what's said to be their largest West Bank operation in decades. Now, the military says, they are targeting groups like Hamas, as well as Islamic Jihad, and they've destroyed labs as well as explosives. They've also said earlier, no known combatants had been killed and the injured have been able to receive assistance. But the Palestinian Red Crescent had said on Monday, its crews were blocked from reaching the Jenin camp. On that same day, Medecins Sans Frontieres, MSF, condemned what it claims is a denial of medical access. Israel, meanwhile, has denied access is being blocked. We'll stay on this story for you as soon as there are more developments, of course. We will bring you up to date. Now, Russia is claiming it shot down five Ukrainian drones near Moscow and called it a terrorist attack, while Ukraine did not respond to allegations that it was behind the action. Drones have become an everyday weapon in the attempt to control territory. The casualties of shelling by drone or rockets are mostly innocent civilians. Dozens of people, including 12 children, were injured earlier today in the Kharkiv region. Our Ben Wedeman takes a look at this painful war of attrition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A tiny plume of smoke rises above Moscow, as blood seeps into Ukrainian soil near an apartment block. Two people were killed by Russian shelling in the southern city of Kherson Tuesday. Dozens of civilians also injured in an attack in the Kharkiv region, with medics wrapping bandages around the heads of those wounded. Wow \"I was lying on the sofa\", says this woman. \"There was an explosion. The balcony was blown off. Everything was blown apart.\" The relentless targeting of Ukrainian civilian structures by Russia comes as the Kremlin says, it intercepted five drones near civilian buildings in Moscow.",

And then, their troops started to move up, reached, I believe, just about 250 kilometers away from Moscow. And when we saw that Yevgeny Prigozhin actually left the headquarters of the southern military district in Rostov- on-Don, there seemed to be a very appreciative crowd for him, people were cheering him on, taking selfies with Prigozhin.

Emmanuel Macron hosted more than 200 mayors of cities and towns affected by these riots. Just a short-while ago, among them, a mayor whose home was attacked this weekend while his family, of course, as we've told you was asleep. And people started to gather last week after the shooting of a seven-year-old boy of North African descent. But these protests against police violence and systemic racism quickly turned into riots, with one minister saying that some of those arrested were as young as 12 years old. Well, the government's main focus right now is to restore order. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire joins me now live from Paris. Minister, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us here on the show. I think it's fair to say that, you know, we've all seen some truly remarkable violence in the past week.

At least three people were killed and eight others were injured overnight in Texas. In the meantime, in Philadelphia, five people were killed after a gunman opened fire in one neighborhood. When officers arrested the suspect, he was armed with an AR-15 style rifle, a handgun and wearing a bulletproof vest stocked with ammunition. Meanwhile, police in Baltimore are still searching for multiple suspects in a deadly mass shooting in a block party on Saturday night. Two people were killed, if you remember, 28 were injured. Joining me now from Ft. Worth, Texas, is Ed Lavandera, CNN senior national correspondent. Ed, it's good to see you. Look, police are saying that this was a community celebration that ended with gunfire. What more can you tell us? What are you hearing from neighbors?",

Horses going, by old vintage cars going by as well. And then this is the very spot where that shooting happened. Over my shoulder here, you might see a woman sitting there in a lawn chair surrounded by friends. She is the mother of one of the victims who was killed here last night. He was 18, a manager at a local fast food restaurant and was planning to join the U.S. Air Force. So this is the extreme of what these families and residents here are dealing with. This shooting erupted around midnight the night before the July 4th festivities. And there were hundreds of people gathered out here last night, celebrating in a chaotic way. There were fireworks going off and people were spinning out their cars in the middle of the road. And that is when the gunfire erupted. Police have not made any arrests but there were 11 people wounded. Three of them were killed. So the magnitude of this is really striking. But investigators say they have not been able to make any arrests yet. Witnesses believe there were multiple people firing their weapons. We have not heard that from official investigators here at this point. But it speaks to the chaotic moments that unfolded here as people were running for their lives from this scene. But there were three people who were not able to get away. They were killed in that gunfire last night; eight others being treated in local hospitals. And that is where we are right now, a day that is supposed to be a national day of celebration. And looking over my shoulder here, you can hear the poor mother of this 18 year victim, who is crying helplessly about what she's experiencing and what her family's enduring here today.",
