      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the Supreme Court rewrites a significant section of American life. Again, the justices say affirmative action is wrong. The conservative majority's ruling will change how college admissions decisions are made everywhere.Plus, personal and appointed. The two black justices on the bench use their opinions to litigate a fight over the role of race in American society. And the ruling is making waves already on the 2024 campaign trail. President Trump calls it a great day for America. President Biden is set to speak in minutes from the White House I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, the Supreme Court on does decades of law and precedent. The justices today ruled to get affirmative action and it will scramble how colleges pick and choose who gets into their schools. It will also likely for students, especially black and brown students to rethink where they even apply for college. I want to go straight to CNN's Jessica Schneider in Washington. So, Jessica, this is a major, major ruling.",

      "sentences": "It is Dana. And at this point, right now colleges and universities are likely scouring this lengthy decision, because they have to restructure their admissions policies. This Supreme Court is saying, they can no longer rely on race, nor can they specifically factor race into an admissions decision. But at the same time, the justices are saying that they're not prohibiting applicants from discussing their race and essays or otherwise, and discussing how their race affected or impacted their lives. So, the takeaway is this. Students won't be able to check a box indicating their race. They can make admissions officials aware, however, of their race in a broader context.Now, in justice Jackson's dissent, she is saying that this distinction is really without a difference. She says it's like putting lipstick on a pig. And she and the other two liberal justices really lashed out against this decision saying, that it will have a devastating impact. Justice Sonia Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench, and she said this in part. She said, the result of today's decision is that a person's skin color may play a role in assessing individualized suspicion, but it cannot play a role in assessing that person's individualized contributions to a diverse learning environment. That indefensible reading of the constitution is not grounded in law and subverts the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. But the majority here, a six-three decision led by Chief Justice John Roberts. It does tick through the reasons why they say Harvard and UNC's admission policies weren't narrowly tailored, and they violated the equal protection clause of the constitution. So Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority saying, that the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual, not on the basis of race. Many universities have for too long done just the opposite. And in doing so, they have concluded wrongly that the touchstone of an individual's identity is not challenged bested, skills built, or lessons learned, but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice. So, Dana, as I said, this decision could really lead to uncertainty at schools nationwide about how they can best structure their admissions policies going forward. One thing though, for certain, gone will be students checking a box indicating their race because universities can no longer factor race directly into the decision whether to admit, those students can talk about it in their individual essays.

Justice Jackson's -- this is Clarence Thomas speaking, Justice Jackson's race-infused world view falls flat at each step, individuals are the sum of their unique experiences, challenges and accomplishments. What matters is not the barriers they face, but how they choose to confront them. And their race is not to blame for everything good or bad that happens in our lives. This is Justice Jackson.Justice Thomas ignites too many more straw men to list, or fully extinguish here. The takeaway is that those who demand that no one think about race, a classic pink-elephant paradox, refuses to see much less solve for the elephant in the room, the race-linked disparities that continue to impede achievement of our great nation's full potential.",

You can imagine the fireworks that were actually happening. And you don't rarely -- you usually have a majority or a concurring opinion, I guess, as Thomas that would spend more than what 10 pages going after the dissenting opinion of another justice. That's what happened here.And what you have here is the conversation that's not limited to inside of the courtroom. This discussion has never been simply about the specific question before the court. It has been infused with political conversations. It's been infused with ideological conversations that are happening. It has been about the role of race in America more broadly. Thomas has a part of his concurrence about the idea of 17-year-olds today paying for the sins of past years, obviously a nod to a conversation about critical race theory and beyond. But the fundamental question they were trying to ask here was, can you use race to course correct, the disparate treatment that racism had created over the course of our history? That was the fundamental notion of what they're being asked about affirmative action. It's been chipped away for years and years and years, circumscribing variety of ways. But ultimately, the majority decided that race can only be solved by ignoring what is so evident in every aspect of our lives. But sending a payload that were so eloquent in the confrontation of this disingenuous discussion that suggests that we can, on the one hand, tell universities how to deal with the subjective process of applications, and then never give the criteria supposedly to do so. And how are you as an admissions office to read this opinion?",

It matters in terms of discrimination, right out, outright, but then she's also had some lines that she has said from the bench.

I think that as we hear from President Biden at the bottom of the hour, of course, he was strongly opposed to this. He's talked about it very eloquently.Look, I mean, this is every Republican candidate to a person has come out in support of what the Supreme Court did, of course, I thought interesting, the comments from former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama issuing separate statements on this, both of whom benefit from affirmative action programs. I remember back on the campaign trail back in '07. When he was asked as a candidate, if his children should benefit from affirmative action programs. And he said, no, probably not.

Let us be clear and not be deceived, it's an attack on black people. The question of what you do with the vicious legacy of white supremacy which Supreme Courts justified slavery for almost 80 years that justified, ugly Jim and Jane Crow?But another 100 years of neo-slavery, in the 60s, we had to raise the question, what are you going to do about these precious human beings. You enslaved in Jim Crow for so long. And the response was first reparations, we'll try to repair some of that with affirmative action, then it shifted to diversity, and said, no, we just have a number of different people. Now they say, let's be indifferent to race after nearly 100 years of slavery and your constitution, justifying it for 100 years of Jim Crow and your constitution justifying it. The Supreme Court has rarely been a friend to justice when it comes to black people. Now, what are you going to do with this? How are we going to come to terms with this? This is my question to brother, Edward Blum. He's a conservative Jewish brother. Thank God, we got a lot of Jewish critics of Blum and white critics and Asian critics of it, but he pits the Asians against the black foot. He says now, let's get some hate, works him, the whites didn't work. Let's get some Asians to pit them against black folk and assure that lo and behold, we can have policies that result in ensure that these black folk don't gang assets. This is a deeper issue that has to do with how do you come to terms with the humanity of black people in a nation shaped by white supremacy? That's what we're talking about.

I was blessed to read the preface for his memoir.He was the leader of the admission process. He brought in another brilliant brother named David Evans, together a white Mormon and a black brother from Tennessee with a Princeton degree reshaped Harvard for 50 years because before that affirmative action was white. We know the great book by Ira katznelson, affirmative action has been white for 180 years and people didn't say a mumbling word. And then, all of a sudden, you get affirmative action tilted toward black folk, and civilization is coming to an end. We've got to be vigilant about our rights, vigilant about liberty, please, we see the hypocrisy. We see the discrepancy between your words and your actions.

We shall produce our love warriors and our freedom fighters and our joy shares and wounded healers. That's the legacy of Frederick Douglass. That's the legacy Martin King and Fannie Lou Hamer.
