Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD.Coming up this hour, CNN is on the ground in Derna as the natural disaster in Libya develops into a health crisis. No deals signed, but Kim Jong-un's Russia trip isn't over yet. A historic auto workers strike kicks off in the United States. And a David versus Goliath Rugby World Cup match-up of Namibia versus New Zealand. Well, new details are emerging today about the horrific flooding in Derna, Libya. One survivor, who found shelter with his mother in the fourth floor building -- in the fourth floor of a building says they heard screams from the windows as the raging water carried away cars and people. Thousands of people were killed when the two dams burst during a torrential rainstorm. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and her team have made it to Derna and she described the devastation they witnessed a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And it really feels like you are walking through a war zone. Like massive bombs had gone off here. And this is what people here would tell you. You know, you've got several cities along that Libyan coast that were impacted by Storm Daniel, by the flooding over the weekend. But nothing like this. What people are describing here as this catastrophe. What happened in Derna, of course, as you know, is those two dams that burst, and you have the floodwaters that swept through the whole of the city. Washing out entire buildings, neighborhoods, homes, infrastructure, families, and brought it all down here to the sea, to the Mediterranean. What we see here is people's lives in there. You see homes. You see door frames, windows, furniture, clothes, cars, everything. And they are still, right now, searching for dead bodies. Bodies that are still washing up on the shore six days after this tragedy happened. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are in Derna and they have been from day one doing assessment together with the help of authorities. We are also working with the health authorities to get the latest numbers on the dead and the missing. So, so far, up until yesterday, 3,958 bodies were recovered and also documented and buried. There is also about 9,000 people that are still missing, and as the risk to teams are continuing their operations, I'm really happy to announce yesterday 58 survivors were uncovered alive.

There is no evidence to back that up, unlessthere is any type of communicable diseases like cholera or Ebola or something. The bodies do not carry those kinds of diseases. We don't have any reports of those kind of problems so the problem is more an environmental problem. We know also that the contamination of the water will come from the survivors, who do not have access to proper water and sanitation, or to proper food. So we are expecting, if nothing is done correctly, would have a surge in waterborne and foodborne diseases. We have seen also that the disruption in health system in the provision of primary health care specifically for children. The immunization program, if it's not operating optimally within a few days, we might also start to see a resurgence of some children diseases. So overall, we are trying now to restore functionality of all the primary healthcare and hospitals. And, you know, many hospitals have gone out of order because of structural damage, because of the lack of human resources or medicine. Tomorrow, we are bringing a full chapter from (INAUDIBLE) in Dubai with 150 cubic meters of medical equipment and medicine that will restore functionality of the hospitals. We are also increasing our surveillance, and our early warning systems for epidemic prone diseases. So working alongside the health authorities to increase the capacity to detect, confirm, and respond to any disease -- epidemic prone diseases. If we have today to look at the priorities, safe burial of the bodies, that's safe and not only safe, but safe and dignified, because it can be very also a mental health proportion for the families. The sick is also provided health care to the survivors and to the affected communities as close as possible to their dwellings. We need also to account for some people who have chronic diseases who do not have access today. So we are bringing kits of chronic diseases and not communicable diseases so we are able to restore their provision of those health services. So a lot of work ahead to get medical teams on the ground, to restore functionality of primary health care, and also specialized care and also to ensure that there is no epidemic and no communicable diseases that served in the area.",

The charges include allegedly lying on a form while buying a gun in 2018. Lying to a federally licensed gun dealer. And he has also accused of illegally possessing the gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 25 years in prison, and up to $750,000 in fines. His attorney vows to fight the charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: This charge brought today violates the agreement the government made with Hunter Biden.
