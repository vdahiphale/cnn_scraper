We've had so much violence in the south in the past because of the rhetoric of governors and politicians across the area and there is a direct correlation. I've been saying that for many, many years. There is a direct correlation sometimes between the rhetoric of our public officials and the rise of hate crimes. They feel like they can get away with it.
