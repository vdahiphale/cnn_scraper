Prior to that, were targeting U.S. troops on a daily basis, even killing three U.S. troops in a base in Jordan and Syria. That has been as a result of pressure by the United States on these militias, but also by Iran. Now, the Iranians have sent a message to the U.S. through the Swiss, it appears the Iran's are holding the U.S. responsible for what Israel has done, just as much as Israel, or the U.S., holds Iran responsible for what the Iraqi militias do. The message appears to have been or may have been  that this truce is now over. And we may see an increase, a resumption of attacks by Iraqi militias and Syrian militias against U.S. troops. And that would mean that the Israeli attack on Iran actually has put a target on the backs of American troops in the Middle East.",

Targeting of hospitals, assassinations of patients inside hospitals, forced famine, an attack on consulates or embassies. Even during times of war, the rule is you do not attack or bombing the embassies of other countries, even the country that  you may be at war with. All of these norms and laws have been broken by Israel over the course of the last six months. It's gotten to the point in which it doesn't appear to be an accident. It appears to be a systematic effort to essentially undo the norms and laws around war or, at a minimum, put Israel above them. Create a new normal in which Israel is not held to the same laws of war that exists for  everyone else.",

It certainly seems to be trying to create a reality in which it is not held to international law, but it is, and it doesn't matter who it is fighting in those type of circumstances. In regards to what the U.S. response should have been, it's very clear that these escalations by the Iraqi militias, who are supported by Iran no doubt, are coming as a response to what is happening in Gaza.The demand of these militias, the demands of the Houthis, has been a ceasefire in Gaza. During the six days in November, in which there was a ceasefire in Gaza, there were zero attacks by these Iraqi militias and a significant drop of the activities of the Houthis as well. So, if we actually put U.S. interests first and try to make sure that U.S. troops are protected, a much more effective way of protecting the troops would have been to actually get a ceasefire in Gaza rather than escalating as the U.S. did. Now, that short-term escalation has had an effect, at least up until now, in which the attacks by the Iraqi and Syrian militias dropped, not those by the Houthis, however. But that may now have ended as a result of Israel targeting the Iranian constant in Damascus.",

This, of course, is a meeting that was rescheduled after last week, an in-person meeting was set to take place but was abruptly canceled after the Israeli delegation decided not to make that trip to Washington. The U.S., for its part, has tried to convince their Israeli counterparts to try something else that is different than a major ground incursion into Rafah, which, of course, the Israeli government has continued to warn it would move ahead with. We are told that this meeting that took place, again, virtually, it lasted some two and a half hours. U.S. officials saying that it was productive.But what I'm also told by a U.S. official is that the Biden administration, even after this lengthy meeting, has yet to see operational plans that get into the details of how exactly such a military operation into Rafah would be executed and, importantly, whether there is a plan to evacuate and get out of harm's way. The more than one million civilians that are supposed to be currently in Rafah sheltering there since the October 7th attacks. Now, the lack of such a plan is so important to keep an eye on because President Biden himself has made very clear that without such a plan to protect the civilians in the area, it would be akin to a crossing of a so-called red line if Israel were to go ahead with such a ground incursion into Rafah without such a plan. Now, we are told. From the U.S.'s side, that senior officials like Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Brett McGurk, those were some of the officials that were involved and participated in this meeting. We are also told by U.S. officials that the plan is for these discussions and these conversations to continue in the coming days, including the rescheduling of an in-person meeting in the coming days.

I think Israelis after the horrifying events of October 7th, have come to the conclusion that, from their perspective, the Palestinians really do not want a two-state solution. They want a one- state solution, which is the destruction of Israel. That may or may not be accurate, but that is the way in which at least two-thirds of Israelis view the conflict right now and thus are not prepared to give consent to their government to negotiate a two-state solution.",

It's actually two streams of protests coming together, the families of the hostages, as well as those who are generally opponents of Netanyahu, who have come together over the course of the last couple of days and will continue their protests. But at the same time, overall, the Israeli public does support a move into Rafah. They have concluded that it's impossible for them to live next door to Hamas. The prospect of yet another October 7th attack is too much, and that there are parts of Israel that have been rendered uninhabitable by Hamas due to the October 7th attacks, and Israelis don't want to live that way. So that, once again, while the government remains unpopular, the aims of the government in this war remain broadly supported by the Israeli public.",

Now, Trump and his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, were fined for fraudulently inflating the value of his assets to obtain better loan rates. The bond was originally $464 million. But a court lowered it last month. Now, posting bond means that New York's Attorney General cannot try and seize Trump properties to cover the judgment. At least until the state appeals court hears that case. Now, that's scheduled to happen in September. Now, meantime, the judge in Trump's hush money trial has expanded the gag order against the former president. It will now prevent Trump from discussing the judge's family and the Manhattan District Attorneys family. Over the weekend, Trump attacked the judge's daughter in social media posts.Judge Owan Merchan says Trump's rhetoric is, quote, a direct attack on the rule of law. And it could make those involved in the case afraid for their safety and the safety of their loved ones. Now, one former federal judge tells CNN that verbal attacks like Trump's are unusual in most court cases. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIRA SCHEINDLIN, RETIRED U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE: It's pretty rare. It happens in some cases that are high profile that the judge will be attacked. I was attacked. Other judges have been attacked with rhetoric. But never my family members. And those, the people who did those attacks were not the kind of people who had followers who might be violent. And that's what's so troubling here is that Trump's followers, when he incites them, have acted. This has actually happened. It happened on January 6th. It happened with an FBI office. It happened with threats to Judge Chutkin. So we know that his followers are capable of taking his words and then acting violently. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If there were any doubts about this man's ability to win, they were put to bed last night. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul from the secular opposition, CHP Party, was reelected by a comfortable 11-point margin, a gap few polls could have predicted. \"Hello, Istanbul,\" he says. \"Sixteen million Istanbulites have won. Congratulations. There are no losers in this election.\" But Imamoglu's win is a huge blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's religious Conservative Act Party, which not only failed to win back Istanbul but even lost Erdogan's home district. Imamoglu is widely seen as one of the few, perhaps the only opposition figures strong enough to beat Erdogan in a presidential race. [00:35:12] Originally from the Black Sea city of Trabzon, Imamoglu moved to Istanbul for university, then worked with his family's construction company. Two decades later in 2014, he was leading a small district of Istanbul. Then five years later in 2019, won the race for city mayor by a razor-thin margin after a court overturned the results and ordered another vote. Imamoglu won the second time around by an even wider gap. He later faced charges of insulting public officials stemming from the aftermath of the bitterly contested race. He's been convicted and sentenced to more than two years' jail time on the charges that many believe are politically motivated. Erdogan has denied any link.
