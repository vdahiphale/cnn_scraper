I knew my conversation was on video and my motive was not to put the deputy in an uncomfortable position.

Waves can also follow along the same paths, but then add themselves together. Smaller waves coming in and then all of a sudden you get a big wave when they all get aligned. This could - also could happen when you have wind coming in this direction and the waves get bigger. Think about what happens in a hurricane. Now, hurricanes don't have usually rogue waves, but they can. And especially if another wave comes this direction and adds to that big wave. And that's exactly what happened here. The cannonball -- I think the - the - the talking about that with one side and the other side and all of a sudden the splash is bigger in the middle, that's exactly how rogue waves happen.

And I would imagine, given that they're involving journalists, we understand, as well as historians in this documentary, that the media coverage will be dissected.Don, as you mentioned, you know, there's been so much discussion about whether or not Harry and Meghan were hounded out of the country because of the racists or derogatory coverage in some of the newspapers. Now, a lot of journalists would deny that. I think \"The Press Gazette\" did a survey of British journalists and about 50 percent said that they detected racist undertones or, you know, more obvious remarks towards the duchess of Sussex in - in the press. So, it will be interesting to see how big of a part that plays in the documentary. But - but in - ingeitavibly (ph) there was so much support for them, too. Like, Don, you were at the wedding. Max, you were at the wedding. I was there on dress watch, which was a bit of a weird choice for me given I'm a bit of a tomboy. I like cage fighting. But, you know, there was so much support, an outpouring of love as well. So, like, there's, obviously, different shades of reality to - to this, and discussion. And there was absolutely support and love for the couple, but obviously extremely difficult and damaging elements too.",

His family and young kids were at home when this happened. The manager, Gareth Southgate, said he spent a lot of time talking to Raheem to - to kind of help him out, but in the end he - he said he just wanted to go home because he's shaken and concerned about the well-being of his kids.There is talk that maybe he can return to the tournament, maybe play or be a part of the next game. But at this point he's out of here. He's back to England. The good news is, the team managed to win without him, but, you know, the team, obviously, really concerned about him and his family.",
