In Philadelphia, a section of northbound I-95 collapsed after a tanker truck caught fire underneath the highway. We're expecting a press conference at any minute and we'll bring that to you live in just moments from now.But first, we begin the hour looking ahead to an historic arraignment in Miami. Former president and current candidate Donald Trump is preparing to face federal charges in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. CNN has learned he will head into the Miami area tomorrow. He reportedly plans to huddle his lawyers at his golf resort there and discuss a new Florida-based legal team ahead of his Tuesday court date. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now from Miami. Katelyn, what more are you learning?",

The judge will take a look at what his conditions will be if he has any restrictions on travel or what he might be able to say, things like that, and he will be told exactly what he is charged with, that historic indictment against the former president that in great detail. The Justice Department says they have evidence for these 37 charges against Donald Trump, both for his -- believing he obstructed investigation and also that there are 31 national security, national defense, classified documents that he kept at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida outside of the protections of the federal government and willfully knew that they were not where they should have supposed to be after he had left the presidency. And really, the reaction already is there has been some pretty strong condemnation of what Donald Trump did after the presidency. Bill Barr, his own attorney general, someone who had gone to bat for Trump many times before, Jim, said just today on Fox News that the government acted responsibly and Trump was acting recklessly.

So, I'm not -- I'm not surprised that he's doing it.He's just never understood the difference between what you do in the press room versus what you do in the courtroom, and those things -- that's a line that is blurry to him. But if he had listened to his lawyers if they're telling him not to talk, not to give a speech, I think that's a great advice.

In addition to road closures, we expect delays of trash collection and SEPTA bus routes in the area. We are not aware of any injuries or fatalities at this time, but we understand the situation remains fluid. I am grateful for our first responders for the dangers, life-saving work that they do to keep residents and visitors safe. This is really where team work and quick thinking come into play and I want to thank the Philadelphia Fire Department, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Office of Emergency Management and other city, state and local partners for your continued response to this incident including Pennsylvania State Police and PEMA. I also want to thank Governor Shapiro for being here with us for his support. Coordination between state and city agencies has been and will continue to be essential to our emergency response efforts. Additionally, repairing the damage caused by this incident in a timely manner will require strong coordinated effort between city, state, and federal agencies. And again, I want to thank -- I had the opportunity this morning to speak with Secretary Buttigieg who is closely monitoring the situation and we can appreciate the federal government's offer to support recovery and reconstruction. I also received calls from Senator Casey and Congressman Boyle on this issue. We will continue to provide updates to residents and visitors as they become available.

We will continue that effort over the next 24 hours, through the night to make sure that we have the collapsed section removed as speedily as possible, and then advance efforts with respect to the replacement and repair going forward. It is our goal to be as quick in our response and our remediation of the challenges as we can, and as was mentioned, there's a website that will direct folks to information on detours and I encourage folks to look at those opportunities and information. The challenges will be real when it comes to traffic movements in the city as a result of this incident, but we're committed to our partners with the Philadelphia Police Department and others. I'm confident that we will get past this in a way that recognizes the challenges before us.

You know, it is unfortunate that the way that he passed, you know, my family and I are unable to mourn in peace.You know, the whole ordeal was petrifying. You know, I received the text message from my husband and my initial response -- I mean, it threw me for a loop. I just was confused as to what was happening. However, I acted fast and I called the police. The first dispatcher that I spoke to, I gave her all the details. When I let her know the exact location that he was at because my husband was able to share his location with me through his telephone, she stated that that is Colorado Springs' jurisdiction so I had to be transferred to the Colorado Spring Police Department. The second dispatcher was made aware. It was in a call transfer. She reiterated everything, so she heard all of the information twice. You know, I gave them a description of the man that was in the car. I jumped into my psychotherapist mode where I was observant. And so, I zoomed in on the picture and gave them details of the man and what looked to be to me that he was a homeless man. And I stated to the dispatcher that I believed my husband may be being held hostage. There was no sense of urgency in her voice to me. So, I acted and I jumped in my car and I drove to him. That drive was about 45 minutes. So, the entire drive was just terrifying to me because I didn't know, you know, what I was going to find. And when I arrived to the parking lot, I immediately saw his car and I parked right next to it. I jumped right out of the car, leaving my car running. And when I got out of the car and I can see through his windshield, I immediately fell to my knees because I could see that he was slumped over. And I started screaming that the police didn't come. Something inside of me told me to get up and to open his door. While I was screaming, there were a lot of bystanders that were beginning to crowd us. And I apologize, my uncle was there as well. But the bystanders were crowding around us and everyone was looking inside of the car. We could see that the man was in there as well with the gun in his lap. So, everyone was afraid to open the door. But something inside of me allowed me to do that. You know, I pulled enough strength to do that. The fear went away because I wanted to make sure that my husband was alive or to see if he was alive. So, I did check his pulse. I checked on his neck and I couldn't feel anything. I checked on his wrist and I still couldn't feel anything. So, my uncle, Sean Bradford, who was also on the scene, assisted me in taking my husband out of the car so that we could perform CPR. And I mean, it was such a horrific scene. When I opened the door, there was a pool of blood, of course. And he -- my uncle pulled him out of the car, laid him flat, and that is when we began to do the chest compressions to try to resuscitate him. By the time I arrived to the parking lot where he was at, all of this took about an hour, a little bit over an hour. Between me calling the police and by the time I arrived, it had been an hour. It was a little after 2:00 and there were no police there. And, you know -- ACOSTA: And you tried to call -- you tried to call 911. What was their response like when you were on the phone? Did they just not take this seriously? Is that what you're saying here?",

They only responded to a secondary call report of two males had been shot. So, the initial call that she made, there was never any response. They're not giving too much information at this time. We have performed an open records (ph) request in order to get the 911 call, the radio traffic communication, as well as the office's availability at that time. I can't think of any situation, maybe an active shooter situation that could take precedence of a hostage. Their job is to preserve life. They failed.
