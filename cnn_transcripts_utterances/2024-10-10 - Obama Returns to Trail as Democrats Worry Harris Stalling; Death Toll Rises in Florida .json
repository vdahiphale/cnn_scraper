Let's get right to what America is talking about. Barack Obama is back on the campaign trail and he's making the case against Donald Trump. But before his guest feature in Pennsylvania, Obama made a surprise visit to Kamala Harris' campaign headquarters in Pittsburgh. It was there that he got candid, maybe a little too candid if you are in the vice president's inner circle tonight. He warned that Harris is underperforming him with black voters, and he had a message specifically for black men. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But to be down 11 points compared to President Biden, that is a problem.But this other issue I want to bring up is a problem too. Why are black men being lectured to? Why are black men being belittled in ways that no other voting group? Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong. And some of the black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way. And even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it. So, unless president Barack Obama is going to go out and lecture every other group of men from other identity groups, my message for Democrats is don't bring it here to black men who, by and large, don't vote much differently from black women. And as a politician, we should be trying to get all voters to vote. And, hopefully, there are a few good men out there who do care about the stripping away of some of women's bodily autonomy. But this is wrong for President Obama. It is a wrong course for the Harris-Walz campaign to lay at the feet of black men when they have their reasons.

That Quinnipiac poll showing the vice president down in Michigan and Wisconsin sent alarm bells throughout every Democrat office in the country. But I want to say this, the blue wall is cracking and black men are just one part of a broader puzzle that she hasn't been able to reach. Now, to her credit, she hasn't been running for very long. This campaign's new. This is a new experiment of replacing somebody late in the cycle. So, okay, we'll give her that. However, she's struggling with union voters. The two of the biggest unions ever didn't endorse her. She's struggling with Muslim-Americans in Michigan. According to care zone numbers, she's struggling with Hispanics in California.

So, we send them to their room if they're old enough, you know, they get some type of punishment. We need to send Trump to his room and not to the White House on this. Now, there's a difference between opinion and fact. Now, what he could have said is that people feel as though they're not getting enough help. But to say that they're not getting help at all is a lie. And also, he needs to check his Republican colleagues because when the Congress passed to give more money to FEMA to the tune of $20 billion, which they got last time, Republicans in Congress provided zero votes. So, President Trump could have said, Brian, your point was like, yes, we got to wait till January. He could have called up his posse and said, I need you all to get some votes to help get people some relief. But he wants to lie. Some things he just can't lie. This is very clear.
