      "sentences": "The southern border is bracing for a surge in migrants next week after a federal appeals court has cleared the way for the Biden administration to end what's known as Title 42. Title 42 is a controversial Trump-era policy that was put in place during the pandemic under the guise of protecting public health. It allowed the government to expel asylum seekers faster. Now some Republican-led states seeking to keep Title 42 in place are signaling they could appeal to the Supreme Court before the policy is set to expire on Wednesday. Officials in El Paso say that Border Patrol is apprehending as many as 2,500 people every single day and that number is expected to double if Title 42 is lifted.With us this morning, an official from El Paso, Texas, the deputy city manager Mario D'Agostino. Mario, thank you for sharing part of your Saturday with us. You were quoted -- of course. you were quoted as saying that the city's infrastructure already can't keep up with the number of migrants entering your city. What happens if Title 42 is lifted? MARIO D'AGOSTINO, EL PASO DEPUTY CITY MANAGER: Title 42, we don't know what the true numbers will be. We know that the number of returns right now under Title 42 in the El Paso sector isn't that high even. It's a few hundred per day. So you can imagine they won't be turned away because there won't be Title 42 in place. And then we have a large population of Venezuelans, as we saw back in September-October timeframe when we had that surge here locally in El Paso. So we know there's still a large section of them still in Mexico right here in out neighboring city of Ciudad Juarez. And so, as Title 42 goes away, how is that going to add to it? What we have seen in the past seven days is an increase upwards of about 2,500 per day. I think our seven-day rolling average is just over 2,400 right now. And those are apprehensions per day. On the other side of it, you are looking at about 1,400 per day of releases. While 1,200 of those might pass through NGOs and other processing facilities, there is a couple of hundred to a few hundred a day that are being actually released in the streets. And so we are already seeing that in the community. So it is concerning with Title 42, and on the 21st.",

You are going to hear from both directions. What we do know is there is a large group of people already in our downtown area, and a lot of them, we're offering to get off the streets, we're getting facilities for them to help with their transportation, and a lot of them are choosing to stay. And they are choosing to stay because we have that portion of the community that is that compassionate part of El Paso, and they are out there, and they are taking them everything from food to clothes to you name it. And so they are actually feeling comfortable being on the street. And for us, it's about making sure we can connect them, we can get them to the destination that their choosing to go, get them somewhere safe, out of the elements, make sure they are not in harm's way and no one else is in harm's way, and just keep that flow going. That's the difficulty we have here, is, as you know, we have those caring and compassionate people, El Pasoans, and then we have some that are saying, why do we have to fund this? Why do we have to carry this burden? And so we understand that. We're working our best, we're working with the federal government. We did get some emails this week talking about giving us some advanced funding going into the next quarter so we can stand up operations a little bit further. We've talked about our reimbursements for previous dollars we spent this year. This year I believe we spent $9.5 million in migrant relief. And so as a community, that's a lot of money. And so we're making sure that we are submitting our reimbursements through the federal government.",

There is not enough shelter space here in El Paso. There is not enough transportation out of El Paso. And it's not just -- I'm speaking El Paso. That's where I'm at. It's any of these border communities that are going to see this influx in the next few days. And so with that we ask to look at other ways to control entry, and just meaning how can we -- if you take it from an asylum seeker to maybe a refugee status, can we offer the same thing we did like when we set up the Afghan village when they passed through? Can it be a more orderly passage, where people have a chance to come in, get a work permit, and then go to work and be productive and take care of themselves. Is there options like that? When the Customs and Border Patrol decompresses, as they call it, their facility holding about 5,000 people a day now, and it's well over their capacity, but that's what they are seeing coming through. And so when they decompress, they decompress along the border to other border communities. Everyone's feeling this burden now. We need to look at how can we decompress to other areas. If you're going to allow them to pass through, take them where there is larger transportation hubs, where people can connect and get to their destination a lot quicker instead of leaving all the strain along the border region.",

So that's number one. Number two, we could all do a COVID test. You were just saying they are now going to be available freely once against from the federal government. Sign up for those.
