There is a protest in Tel Aviv. That is for the judicial overhaul. These protesters are saying this reform, as they're calling it is sorely needed. But for many of these protesters here in Jerusalem today, they are terrified of what this legislation could mean for the independence of the Israeli judiciary and for what it could mean for the power of the Israeli government because the legislation being debated right now in the Israeli parliament, would strip the ability of the Israeli Supreme Court to declare government actions unreasonable saying that they just wouldn't be able to say that a government action should not be able to take place. Now, the coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they want to take that ability away. And this is just one part of this massive judicial overhaul package that the Israeli government is trying to push through that would completely reshape the Israeli judiciary. And that's why you have these protesters that have been out for six months now on the streets, but their protests are really ramped up in recent days because this legislation is now officially on the table. If this legislation passes will be the first part of this overhaul package that will finally and officially pass and could potentially turn into law. The protests here in Jerusalem have been ongoing for days they even marched from Tel Aviv into Jerusalem. And then they actually also set up a tent city in one of the largest parks in Jerusalem where they say that they will camp out until for as long as necessary until this legislation is off the table. But the governing coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu are showing no signs of backing down saying that the vote will take place this despite the pleas not only from these protesters, but pressure from the US. The Israeli President Isaac Hertzog just returning from the United States and going actually straight to the hospital, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hospitalized because he's being fitted with a pacemaker. All of this happening of course, at the same time, in the middle of the night, on Saturday night. The Prime Minister's Office announcing that Benjamin Netanyahu was being fitted with a pacemaker for a heart problem. But that doesn't stop politics here. And the Israeli President driving straight to the hospital to have an emergency meeting with the Prime Minister to try and convince him to slow down the legislation to come to some sort of compromise. But all signs are pointing that this vote will take place on Monday, and it could be the beginning of the complete reshaping of the Israeli judiciary. This of course, also happening while thousands of Israeli military reservists are threatening not to serve if this legislation passes that could have major implications for Israel's military readiness, a lot happening in politics and as of right now, all at the same time.

Good morning.What message are voters in Spain sending with this result? AITOR HERNANDEZ-MORALES, IBERIAN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO: It is really remarkable turnaround. What we're seeing here is an unbelievable comeback for Sanchez who is basically, everyone had accepted that he would be out, that he would be leaving the head of government in Spain by the end of this year. But instead what we are finding is a situation where the Spanish public has come out and said pretty clearly that one, they want to continue this new era for Spain which is one of a more fractious parliament, one where they demand that deals be made between parties of many different colors of ideologies. But more importantly, they seem to have come up clearly against having a right-wing government with far right members. And that, as your correspondent was explaining before is why we're looking at a parliament where it's virtually impossible for the center right Popular Party, the party that won the most votes to be able to form a government. Basically, its one option would've been with the far right Vox party. But because they don't reach that governing majority and because the rest of the parties in the parliament refused to support a government with far-right members, they're basically out of options.",

But what are the challenges ahead and opportunities potentially for the two largest parties to maybe work together and generate unity?HERNANDEZ-MORALES: That's virtually impossible. Spain has no history of forming grand coalitions. And I don't expect that that will be changing any time soon. The country is extremely polarized right now. We're talking about levels that are very similar to the U.S. So it would be inconceivable for the Popular Party and the Socialists to come to some sort of agreement that would facilitate government in that way. What is more likely is that Sanchez will form a left wing coalition government with the left wing Sumar Party and then seek support from smaller regional parties in the parliament to govern. Now, it's a bit of a risk against time. The parliament reconvenes on August 17th, by August 21st Sanchez will have to meet with the Spanish king and make a bid to be the next prime minister. And in order to do that he will have to prove that he has enough support to at least take that bid to the parliament. In the parliament he will have to get more yes than no votes. And it's a key to remember here that MPs in the Spanish parliament can abstain. So he has a shot but he's going to probably need outright support from some Basque (ph) and Catalan separatist groups. And most importantly, he's going to have to convince one Catalan group to abstain. That group is led by a former Catalan politician who had to flee the country after the 2017 independence referendum. So Sanchez will have to move quickly and be extremely diplomatic if he wants to continue being prime minister in the longer term.",

It's -- as we mentioned before -- impossible for the Popular Party to form any government that we can think of. So right now Pedro Sanchez is at least (INAUDIBLE) key to remain as caretaker prime minister whilst Spain tries to form a new government. Realistically speaking if he fails at that mission Spain would go to new elections at the end of this year beginning of 2024. And in the meanwhile, he remains in his position. If he can manage to gather enough support and win the second investiture vote in the parliament, which would take place at some point in September, Sanchez is looking at another four years in office.

Vox is explicitly Euro skeptic party and one of the things that it had said was that it would seek to challenge the privacy of the E.U.'s courts which right now has the final say over Spanish law.

And despite the heat, fans are turning out to support their favorite teams. The league's first ever championship final is set for this coming Sunday. Joining me now, Justin Geale is the tournament director for Major League Cricket. So good to have you with us Justin. How is it going so far? America's new Cricket League underway, did you get off to a good start? Are people coming to watch the games. Can you tell us how much interest games are attracting right now?",

I married an American last year, so I have a bit of practice.We're the second largest sport in the world, and obviously to America's the largest sporting media market in the world. So we think the synergy is there. It is an exciting game and I love baseball, don't get me wrong. But I think it's a lot more high scoring and it's sort of 360 baseball, 120 pitches in a game. There is probably maybe 20, 25 home run equivalence in the game. So I think the American sports consumer is a very sophisticated one, and it takes a little time to explain the nuance, but once they get in, we think they're really going to love it.",

And the global numbers are phenomenal, which is great. But honestly, we want to grow the game here in America, that is why we are playing in American time slot.
