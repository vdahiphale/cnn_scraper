      "sentences": "Oral arguments are now over in the landmark Supreme Court case surrounding transgender rights.And it appears the court's conservative justices, the majority, are ready to endorse the Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. A decision is expected by July, when the session of the court ends. But today, history was made as the first openly transgender lawyer argued before the high court. Chase Strangio, who is an attorney for the ACLU, told the justices that Tennessee's law, quote, \"Took away the only treatment that relieved years of suffering for each of the adolescent plaintiffs.\" There are three plaintiffs here, as well as a doctor. And we're joined now by the first openly transgender female legislator in Montana, State Representative Zoe Zephyr. Zoe, I know that you have been outside of the court. You have been monitoring the arguments as they were going on. What really stood out to you? STATE REP. ZOE ZEPHYR (D-MO): You know what stood out to me is the solicitor general's simple argument that this is sex discrimination. You have a type of care, from puberty blockers to hormone replacement therapy, that the Tennessee bill says, if you are cisgender, you can have this medication. If you are transgender, that's when they're going to pull your access to that medication. To me, that was very plainly sex discrimination.",

You look at bills like in Montana, where they tried to write trans people out of code entirely from birth certificates to wedding certificates to death certificates. So for me, when I hear the court saying, well, this isn't actually about this or it's just this type of narrow policy, I think that fails to see the open hostility that trans people in this country are facing day to day.",

You just ban the medical care that allows them to live fulfilling lives. And again, when they talk about, you know, encouraging someone of that sex, we know that in states, from a study in nature, human behavior, in states that have banned this care, we've seen an increase in suicidality up to 73 percent. They are not protecting these children. And courts across the country, including in my state of Montana, noted that these policies are crafted with, quote, \"open animus towards transgender people.\"",

It makes it more likely that we will see the negative outcomes, from ostracization to suicide, depression, et cetera. But I also want to push back a little bit and say that, you know, this decision or Tennessee's law, there is nothing that they could craft in policy that would make trans people vanish. We will -- we have been here since, you know, the early 1900s and before, and we will continue to be here, regardless of the policies that they push against us.",

So you can see how he approaches Thompson from the back before then, where we freeze the video, he fires those shots at Thompson. What you do not see from these five seconds, and I can tell you, is that we also see someone sort of running the opposite direction. So that is something, of course, that police are going to be looking into in this video, breaking it down frame by frame by frame to kind of figure out who might have witnessed this, witnesses. They, of course, are going to want to talk to anyone who might have witnessed this. Again, it happens at the really front step of this entrance of this hotel. So there's possible some security there as well. And then of course, follow the path of that gunman. As we already have learned, he flees from the scene, going down a dark -- a back alley behind a theater that's across the street from the hotel where we are, and then hops on a bike where they basically lose his trail in Central Park. So again, we know that police are offering a $10,000 reward for any information that's going to help find this suspected gunman, but that manhunt is underway after this brazen shooting in midtown Manhattan -- guys?",

      "sentences": "Well, indications is this looks like a professional hit job. You look at all the characteristics that we've seen, from essentially lying in wait for the CEO to walk by.We can see on that video that we obtained there that he essentially is behind a Suburban, the shooter. And as the CEO walks past, you see him then step out, the gun comes up on target and he begins to fire. There is a level of sophistication that we can tell from the shooter from that video, as well. And that is because, as he's firing -- we know that he used a suppressor on that gun. That's to muffle the sound. That is something that someone would use, obviously, if they don't want to draw attention to a particular shooting. And you see him, you know. racking the slide of that gun, which typically happens on its own with a semiautomatic .9-millimeter-style gun. But when you have that suppressor there at the end, if you don't have perhaps the proper parts or it's not properly lubricated, that gun won't cycle. And so you see him essentially racking the slide for every round that he fires. And also, at one point, and this is what the police had indicated as well before we obtained this video, that the gun had malfunctioned at one point. And you actually see him doing a clearing drill on that gun. And this is something that those of us who worked in law enforcement practice on over and over, where you essentially have these so-called immediate-action drills where they practice for a round not to fire, either, you know, it could get dislodged, there could be a double feed of ammunition. But in this case, the shooter quickly racks the slide, gets it back up on target, continues to fire, and then finally he makes his way of escape. So he not only came there, obviously, very stealthy, but he still has not been found. Reports are that he fled on an E-bike, E bicycle, which, obviously, within the city of New York, a place where you have tons of license plates -- license plate readers that a vehicle could perhaps be picked up on. Instead, this person chose to use a bicycle, which is -- obviously provides a more agile means of -- of escape there. And so again, a lot of characteristics here that show this is someone who clearly was operating with some level of sophistication. Of course, now the big question comes down to motivation. That's work that's going on behind the scenes right now as well by authorities.",
