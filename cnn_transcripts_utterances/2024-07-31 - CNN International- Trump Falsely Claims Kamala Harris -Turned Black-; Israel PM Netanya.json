Former President Donald Trump, current GOP nominee for president, just wrapped up live questions at the National Association of Black Journalists Conference in Chicago. It got off to a contentious start to say the least. Trump denigrated the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, questioning whether she is Black -- you heard that right. And in just the very first question-and-answer accused the moderator, one of the moderators, ABC News reporter Rachel Scott, of being very rude and fake news after she asked him about his long history of perceived racist attacks on political rivals.

She went to Howard University, historically Black college, is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, a Black sorority. She campaigned as a Black woman. She's repeatedly said that she's proud to be a Black woman.And so, Donald Trump saying that it's -- who is he to even make that accusation, and it comes on the heels of his attacks on two -- at least two of the Black women who were on the stage today, consistent with his attacks on Abby Philip and April Ryan and Yamiche Alcindor and Don Lemon and other -- other Black journalists, who he has repeatedly criticized. So, you know, my initial impression, Jim, was I didn't think that the NABJ should allow him this platform to be there to spew lies in his information, but now I've seen it.

During the primaries, you usually trying to get your base in line. And then when you get to the general election, tried to appeal to a broader group of people. So you can get independent voters to vote for you.Trump seems to be doing the exact opposite. He seems to be doubling down. He and J.D. Vance, he doesn't seem to be distancing himself from the remarks that J.D. Vance said. You know, his comments about childless cat ladies was horrible and offensive, and even when he was asked about that at NABJ today, Trump didn't really answer the question. He just talked about how Vance respects families, but that wasn't really what Vance was saying when he was saying that there are people who don't have children should have fewer votes than people who do have children. I mean that's -- that's an un-American thing to say. Even Republicans have said that it's un-American. So, I'm surprise that Trump didn't use this opportunity to respond to though distance himself from himself from that. But part of it is, I think this goes back to what you're asking to Larry earlier. Part of the reason why Trump chose to come, I think, is not because he went to appeal to Black voters because instead he wanted to appeal to white suburban voters. He wanted to show to them, I think that because he could go to a Black audience, that means he's not racist and therefore they can feel comfortable voting for him. So I think there's always an underlying strategy in what he's doing, I just think it's a simplistic strategies based on these sort of -- these racist ideas about what will make people vote for them and Black people aren't going to vote for you, Donald Trump, just because you sell gold sneakers or because you happen to have a criminal record?",

In the last two hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has delivered crushing blows to its enemies in the last few days, but did not mention the death of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Hamas says Haniyeh who was in Iran for the new president's inauguration was killed by a rocket in the room where he was staying. The group was quick to blame Israel, calling the killing a Zionist strike. Iran is already promising a harsh response to the assassination on Iranian soil. Flying a red flag of revenge above Iran's holy city of Qom. Israel is yet to confirm or deny any involvement in that assassination, which is par for the course. But did confirm it was behind the drone strike that killed Hezbollah's most senior military commander. This one in Beirut, Lebanon, just hours earlier. That strike Israel said was in retaliation for Saturday's deadly rocket attack in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children. Netanyahu says Israel is ready for any response from Lebanon.

Of course, we've now had the strike. So, what does Hezbollah do? IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first and foremost, they need to bury this senior official, Fu'ad Shukr, whose body was just confirmed discovered in the rubble of this building that was hit by the Israeli airstrike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Dahieh, yesterday evening. It was just announced just in the last few hours. His funeral is scheduled for tomorrow. We're expecting to hear from the leader of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, at that time and maybe we'll learn more about what Hezbollah plans to do in the aftermath. Today, there were funerals for some of the civilians killed by the Israeli airstrike. Among them, a 10-year-old boy, a six-year- old sister, who were killed in at least two women were also killed in that strike that sheared off the side of a five story building. Then there are the bigger concerns about what Iran may do after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which Iran is vowing retribution, vowing vengeance as well. And that is linked to militant groups like Hezbollah here these are close allies that worked closely together, militias in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen, as well, who have all taken pot shots at Israel in the past. So everybody here is, is on edge, knew that Israel was going to -- was vowing retaliation for the death of those 12 children in the occupied Golan Heights over the weekend, saw the response here in Beirut, also purportedly an Israeli attack in Tehran. And now, the question is, how will this so-called axis of resistance respond? And there is an enormous concern here in cities like Beirut that have seen the -- that are still scarred by the civil war, have experienced enormous economic downturn. And, of course, of the past couple of years and still remember the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel and have been watching the border conflict that has gone on for months now, Jim, wondering how this axis of resistance will respond to these two assassinations in Beirut and Tehran that took place just within hours of each other, Jim.",

They're mass murders. And that being said, of course, this is very destabilizing for all of us and not only just in terms of the fate of our hostages who remain in there, still 115 Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. But also what it means for our country as a whole. Iran, as we've seen, will not hesitate if it believes that it's the right thing to do, to shoot a hundreds of missiles simultaneously or drones towards Israel, towards civilian targets.

What did he tell you then? And do you believe he's doing everything he can to get your son home?DEKEL-CHEN:  Well, I'll put it this way. First of all, the meeting -- we had two meetings with him. The second one was in the White House with President Biden right across the table and at that time, the prime minister committed to us the families again, to the United States, and that no less important, and the commitment that this is going to get done, and it's going to get done quickly with no more obstacles from Israel's part being thrown up in terms of completing this three-stage deal that would rescue the people of Gaza, millions of people who've been suffering since October 7th in this horrible conflict that was set off by Hamas's massacre of nearly 1,500 people. So, there's that. There's his commitment to overall not to speed up the cycles of negotiation and so, we want to believe that his heart is in it. And I guess the proof will be in the pudding. We've been waiting almost 300 days now well loved ones to come home. They are dying in captivity in the meantime, both from Hamas executions and from friendly fire unfortunately. And if nothing else, these assassinations that have taken place, whomever committed them, whoever directed them shows that there really is no time to waste because our region is powder keg. And if we diffuse it by way of a ceasefire and a hostage exchange, it's not just the hostage families that are going to be suffering here.

Aaron David Miller, I want to ask you the same question I asked Jonathan Dekel-Chen, do you believe that Netanyahu is putting his personal politics above making a deal and that the strike -- these strikes I should say in Beirut and Tehran, that within hours of each other demonstrate that. AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR:  First of all, Jim, thanks for having me. It's great to be here with Nic. So, look, the organizing principle of Benjamin Netanyahu's world is staying power. On trial for bribery, fraud, breach of trust in a Jerusalem district court three years running, I think he's obligated to justify in December. If he loses power, there are only two options for him -- out of the prime ministry. Number one, a possible conviction. There's plenty of precedent for that. Ehud Olmert was charged with even one of the charges that's directed at a prime minister and he served I think anywhere from 14 to 16 months in prison, or cutting a plea deal that will drive him out of power. So, yeah, I think the prime minister's definition of success and victory, is this probably -- these are the priorities.

      "sentences": "Well, it's somewhat surreal, Jim, I have to say because the Israeli government has not told people to change their daily lives in any way, shape, or form.We arrived at the airport this afternoon. It was crowded. It was bustling. People were not even specifically fixated or focused on this issue. But when you scratch beneath the surface a little bit and engage in more substantive conversations, there is clearly a degree of trepidation as to what these two major assassinations portend in terms of what shape they will take in terms of a retaliation. I spoke to one reservist, Major Brigadier General Assaf Orion. He talked about a very strong expectation of a forceful response from Hezbollah and he emphasized the difference in weaponry that you're talking about with Hezbollah as compared to Hamas, for example, the precision and of those weapons, the range of those weapons. He talked about a potential attack on Tel Aviv, on Ben-Gurion airport, on Haifa. And even the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his statement earlier underscore that there are threats from Beirut, that the Israeli people must remain patient. What he didn't talk about though, Jim, was the sort of elephant if you in the room, if you will, which is the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh, as you mentioned, which is a huge deal because it took place on Iranian soil the day of the new president's inauguration. As you mentioned, Iran has already made it abundantly clear that they will be looking to exact a harsh punishment, its revenge for that attack. What that will look like, what the timeline is for that remains to be seen, and whether those external actors such as the U.S. who are deeply involved can in a sort of last-ditch flurry of diplomatic work, tried to pull everybody back from the brink, remains to be seen. I think overall, there's a sense that nobody regionally believes are very few people believe that there is anything to be gained from an all-out regional war. But once you reach this point, all it takes is one miscalculation, one thing going not quite according to plan. And before you know it, you have crossed the Rubicon. And this very much feels like the moment where we are once again and in a more dramatic way than we have been at any stage, I would say during this conflict in danger of reaching that tipping point.",

And so, it is now going to be an incredibly difficult piece of diplomacy to try to bring people back from the brink, put them down at the negotiating table, and hammer out some kind of a deal without a sense yet as to what the real term fallout will be from this latest significant and provocative escalation, Jim.",

France spent 1.4 billion euros to clean the water for the competition, but recent water quality test showed a spike in E. coli levels, and overall poor water quality, not good. As a result, training sessions were canceled. The men's triathlon postponed.However, it did go ahead today, along with the women's event after the river was retested and deemed safe enough for competition. French President Emmanuel Macron praised the cleanup effort, writing on X: We have achieved in just four years what was impossible 100 years ago, the Seine is swimmable. CNN's Coy Wire has been following the Olympics for, us over in Paris. Coy, first, tell us where you are because it's a really cool place to be. COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  This is, Jim, is incredible. Welcome to Palais Brongniart, the official Team USA house for these 2024 Paris Olympics. It's the former original French stock exchange built in 1808. But for the first time ever, Jim, they have allowed fans to join in where the Olympians and former Olympians can go to celebrate Team USA. Incredible energy here as they have just witnessed, one of the most dominant swimmers the world has ever seen, 27-year-old Katie Ledecky winning another Olympic gold in the 1,500-meter free, Jim. The world and Olympic record holder hasn't lost a race in this event in more than 14 years, and she extends her streak here at these Paris Olympics. She's now tied with Jenny Thompson, with an eighth career Olympic gold, further cementing her legacy as the greatest female swimmer of all time in his party time in Paris. Now, earlier, Jim, as you were mentioning, the Olympic triathlon, finally happened after three straight days of cancellation, and postponement of practice and competition due to the unsafe water levels in the River Seine, hometown France's Cassandre Beaugrand took gold for the women and Great Britain's Alex Yee took the men's gold. He commented, Jim, on performing on the biggest stage of his sport despite the uncertainty. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
