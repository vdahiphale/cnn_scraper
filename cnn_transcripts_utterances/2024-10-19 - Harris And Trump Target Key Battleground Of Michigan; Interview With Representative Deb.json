I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.And with 17 days to go until election day, more than 11 million Americans have already cast their ballots with people turning out in record numbers in several key battleground states. Today two additional swing states open their polls, Nevada and Detroit in Michigan. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been spending time in Michigan, both hoping to pick up the state's critical 15 electoral votes. Harris is appealing to working class voters in Detroit, telling them earlier today that Trump makes what she calls big promises, but that he fails to deliver, that he's one of the biggest losers of manufacturing jobs in American history. While Trump was in Detroit last night, he told a rally that Detroit's, quote, \"real comeback\" won't start unless he's reelected. More than one million people have already lined up to vote early in Georgia. That is turnout that is absolutely smashing records. And that's where Vice President Harris is headed right now to a rally in Atlanta, where music superstar Usher is expected to join her on stage. Our Eva McKend is joining us now. Eva, what can we expect to hear from Harris tonight?",

You have to remember, Jess, there are split ticket voters in Georgia. There are Republicans in Georgia that just have no appetite for supporting Donald Trump. Take a listen. OK, it appears we don't have that soundbite but the vice president earlier today in Detroit, she said that the former president is exhibiting behavior that illustrates that he is unstable, unhinged, and unprepared to meet this moment. But listen, Jess, when I speak to Democrats here in this state, my sources here, they say that this moment, at this point in time in the campaign, it is all about boosting energy. So that's why you're going to have Usher up on this page tonight. In addition, though, they've had other surrogates out on the campaign trail in Georgia as well with an event focused on black male turnout and also an event with black women talking about black maternal health and reproductive rights -- Jess.",

In fact, and his most, his first event on the grounds, he repeated a lot of the election lies going back to 2020, some of them floating dangerously close to the accusations about Dominion voting machines that have gotten several news agencies into a lot of trouble and multimillion dollar defamation lawsuits.But the potential impact for Elon Musk financial investment is what could ultimately make the difference. His super PAC has so far put in $100 million into this race, including $60 million on the ground game alone. That's in canvassing, get-out-the-vote operation. Now, some Republicans are skeptical that Elon Musk has enough experience in this realm to make a difference.

But no one inside, you know, Benjamin Netanyahu's house was injured.The Israeli prime minister and his wife were not there apparently at the time. But as you might imagine, it's provoked a furious reaction from the Israeli prime minister who called it an assassination attempt. He said he would not be deterred and that Israel would not be deterred from continuing what he called his war of revival in Lebanon and elsewhere. He blamed the perpetrators of the drone attack on agents of Iran inside Lebanon, the Shia Hezbollah militia. And so that was who he pointed the finger of blame at understandably.

And, by the way, the United States, which is the main party here thatcan put a bridging proposal on the table, still hasn't done it. I know that U.S. officials are thinking about it. They're still hesitating. Secretary of State Blinken will be in the region on Tuesday. He'll go to Israel. He'll go to Egypt. He'll go to Qatar.

She's had Liz Cheney out on the trail for her. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has not been making this public according -- of this slice of voters who are very important. They're the kind of voters that vote in the suburbs. They're the kind of voters that are voting in the outskirts of Detroit and Pennsylvania -- in Philadelphia and places where this race could be won. And the fact that Nikki Haley has not really appeared for Donald Trump's since the RNC convention several months ago, is a clear sign that the Trump campaign has not been making the public overtures to these voters that Kamala Harris has been doing. And that could be determinative in this case. So I'm not surprised that now, in this final stage of the race where it's incredibly close, Trump is looking for votes anywhere he can get them, that he would be willing to speak with Haley and appear with her, even though they've had this bitter rivalry over the past several months. It's clear that he's trying to supercharge his campaign with the kind of votes that he has not been catering to so far. And it could be an important moment. But it may be too little too late, in part, because Kamala Harris has been courting these voters for several weeks. She's had Liz Cheney and other Republicans speaking out on her behalf.

She said that she was not going to continue her campaign and those voters still said that they would not vote for Trump, who, at that point, was the only real viable candidate in the Republican primary. So these are people who are not just going to fall in line behind Trump because he's a Republican. They have already said that they are willing to look at other options, that they want to send a protest signal with their vote for Nikki Haley after she had dropped out. And those are the kinds of voters that Kamala Harris and her campaign are hoping will power her to victory. And so the fact that Trump has not really been catering to these voters in a public way over the past several months is an opening for the Kamala Harris campaign. Now some of these voters do not like parts of Kamala Harris' record. They do not like the Biden administration's actions over the past four years. And so it's not going to be an easy vote for them to vote for Kamala Harris for a number of them. But the fact that Liz Cheney and a number of other Republicans have come out to support of Kamala Harris and giving some of these voters a permission slip to vote for a Democrat, in some cases, for the first time. Now, what Nikki Haley could be doing by appearing alongside Trump in this final stage of the race is giving her permission slip to other people who are saying, I don't like Trump, I don't like his personality, but I support Nikki Haley. And if she's with him, if she has been able to put bury the hatchet and say that he's the kind of person that could be in the Oval Office again, then I also could consider that.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, this is pretty unique because you have a bipartisan group of state legislatures, Republicans and Democrats, who are calling this conviction into question.And what the hearing is largely based on as a 2013 law in Texas that says that, hey, if you're conviction was predicated upon medical and forensic testimony that has since been discredited, you should have a new avenue of appeal. Now, they call this the Junk Science Law, and I think most people, pretty much universally in medical community, would say baby -- shaken baby syndrome is not junk science. That's not what the legislature is saying. They're saying that there have been significant improvement in terms of not misdiagnosing it. Could there have been at the time that this occurred, his trial back in 2003, a misdiagnosis? The baby was sickly, the baby was prescribed medications that are not now prescribed to babies. Could that have impaired her lungs such that it led to the swollen brain? Could things have happened in the emergency room that led to the bleeding? So there'll be a lot of focus on alternatives theories with respect to how she actually died, which would point away from the father being responsible. And, ultimately, the legislature is seeking by subpoenaing him to point all this out and to have the public -- it get into the sphere of the public and, in essence, do justice to determine whether it was him who killed his daughter or were there alternative explanations for the death. DEAN: Yes, and within a matter of days, last week, several mass last- minute appeals by Roberson's team were denied, including by the U.S. Supreme Court. So where do we go from here in terms of legal options?",

Yes, the death penalty is appropriate penalty in Texas. Having said that, there are really issues of whether or not his deathand being put to death are appropriate and just under the circumstances. I think the more eyeballs that get to look on this and the more people that say, hey, wait a minute, was there a misdiagnosis here? Is there an innocent explanation because of the two-year old dying? Did the fact that she fell off the bed and hit her head have something to do with it? Did the fact that she was prescribed medications that are no longer prescribed have something to do with it? Did the fact that he had autism, such that his demeanor, an effect, right, when he was getting our help, they we're saying, the medical professionals, he seemed like he didn't care. No, he had an issue and a problem. I think ultimately, the more people that see this in the more outcry there is, politicians by nature are prone to look and examine public opinion. We've seen that before very briefly in connection with the Menendez case, right? That's something that's going on now. You remember they were sentenced to the death and the killing of both of their parents. Right now, that's being re-examined. Why do I bring that up? Because of the public pressure that's brought to bear. Because people saying, hey, maybe what they did was justified under the circumstances and at least, if not justified, it could be reexamined. And so, in essence, I think the more eyes that look at this, the more people that see this as unfair and inappropriate, should be reexamined, I think the better off it is for the person now who sits on death row. So, yes, I think public opinion will have a lot to do with it. And that, I think, is what the legislature is looking to do in having this hearing convened on Monday.",

Patrick, what is the latest? Any idea on how long this will continue? PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I wish I knew. We hear about pockets of neighborhoods, not full neighborhoods, pockets of neighborhoods where energy is briefly restored, they lose it. And so that is the concern is that even when officials we're able to get a small areas online, they're not able to maintain those areas because there simply is just not enough ability to generate power on this island at this point. So the majority of 10 million Cuban now going into day two are offline, don't have power, and are increasingly frustrated. We went by several bakeries in the city, the only places we could really find that we're selling bread and food. And people were calm until people came out from these government-run bakeries and said the bread was all gone. And some people got very upset because they'd been in line for an hour or two, understandably, were mad that they we're not able to get bread. So as this crisis goes on longer and longer, this is really the issue, is that it becomes a domino effect that sort of brings to light, you know, the generator here acting up, being apart part of the story unfortunately. But as I was saying, as this goes on, longer and longer, peoples food starts to spoil, you cannot get water in your house if there are no pumps bring it to your house. And so this is already gone on too long. But as we go into perhaps day three or longer, you wonder how people are going to be able to feed themselves or be able to have water. And it just becomes more and more complicated. People have kept calm up until now. The government has told them, asked him to keep calm, but that can only last for so long. Obviously, people need that power as soon as possible, and it's worrying to see, in hotels, in hospitals, at the airport, power disruptions there as some of the generators beginning to run out of fuel.",
