The people of America have waited four years for common sense, strength, and leadership. They'll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before. That's from the president-elect.At the same time around that, there was a note from 11 of the House Republicans who voted for Speaker Johnson with reservations, and I know they have reservations because they wrote it down in the letter and tweeted it out to the world, saying we did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker's track record over the past 15 months and talking about the changes they would like to see. Sum up what we saw today, former Speaker McHenry. Do you think that this is a good sign of smooth sailing to come or fasten your seatbelts? PATRICK MCHENRY, (R) FORMER SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: Mostly a positive sign. This is a more reconciled Republican Party than where we were two years ago on opening day, with those historic number of votes that we had. First time in 100 years we had multiple votes for the speakership. We had one vote today. It was messy. It was choppy. It was newsworthy. We have Republicans that are different than the list that voted either skip the vote or voted against Speaker Johnson initially, saying that they have additional terms and conditions they want on the reconciliation plan, on the tax extension plan. It's going to be choppy waters ahead. It's going to be a really interesting Congress to watch and a very difficult Congress to successfully legislate in, but one where I think at the end of the day, Republicans still can get things done and pass President Trump's agenda.",

And now, thankfully, the Republicans can get down to business.A quick note on Johnson. This is a good dude. He's a good man. He's an honest man. He's an earnest person. I've always found him to be one of the people that's in politics for the right reasons. His rise to the speakership was unlikely, as you know, Patrick, but he earned it this time. He did a good job after having this job thrust upon him. He did a good job with it in a really challenging political environment. And then he comes out today and he ultimately wins on the first ballot. It's going to be a hard job. There are going to be days where I'm sure he's going to regret his life's choices. But I'm glad he's the speaker, because when you think about all the people you've ever had in politics, I think Johnson's one of the best. And one of the people that you can always say is doing it for the right reasons.",

I'm Boris Sanchez in Washington and we are following breaking news.House Speaker Mike Johnson will get to keep his job after clinching enough votes in a dramatic first round vote. Johnson was originally on track to come up short of the votes needed to secure his gavel and he could only afford to lose one Republican vote. Three voted against him, including Congressman Thomas Massey of Kentucky as he previously had vowed. Congressman Ralph Norman and Keith Self flipped at the last minute to help Johnson get across the finish line with 218 votes.

      "sentences": "Yes, it was a drama- packed afternoon as it was uncertain for some time exactly how Mike Johnson would get over the finish line given the opposition that he had and the narrowness of this Republican majority. Remember, he could only afford to lose one Republican vote given how tight things are in the United States House. He lost that one Thomas Massey of Kentucky several days ago who said he would absolutely not vote for Mike Johnson.Several other Republicans simply would not vote. Five of them initially held out and said that they didn't cast their vote initially. Ultimately, they did vote for Mike Johnson. They put out a letter criticizing his handling of the last Congress, although they decided to vote for him in support of, they said, advancing the Trump agenda. And then two Republicans ultimately flipped, Keith Self and Ralph Norman. They actually voted for different candidates on the floor of the House, but they ultimately voted after closed-door negotiations, discussions with the Speaker of the House, a discussion with Donald Trump himself, who called those two members. I just caught up with Keith Self, one of the two Republicans who initially voted against Mike Johnson. He told me that there was a commitment by the Speaker to include members of the hard right House Freedom Caucus as part of a negotiation of a bill to advance the Trump agenda. There's going to be a big bill this Congress to try to advance key aspects of the Trump agenda. Johnson said that they would be part of that negotiating team. Now, that's going to be a big question, how they deal with that in the weeks ahead. But for now, Johnson has a job. I do want to bring in one person who was on the floor here. That's Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. Mr. Burchett, Mr. Burchett, if I can grab you. We're live on, you know, he's busy talking to other of our colleagues. But thanks for talking to me. You were involved in a lot of these discussions on the floor of the House. What was that like? It seemed pretty tense at times. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): It did. But, you know, I've been through this before, and there wasn't any reason to get in anybody's face. I saw a member that had passed or voted the other way, and some people were getting in their face. And that always, to me, just, you're going to push somebody further away. And so --",

Hard to believe that it's been almost a year since that dramatic door plug blowout, not only one of the most significant U.S. airline incidents of the last decade, but it kicked off major scrutiny of Boeing's quality control. And in a new blog post, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration insists that will not stop.Mike Whitaker will resign as FAA administrator on inauguration day, only 15 months into a five-year term. But Whitaker says Boeing's turnaround is not over. Even after the FAA did a massive audit of Boeing's production line and flooded Boeing's rented Washington plant with inspectors, the same factory where that brand new 737 Max 9 was delivered to Alaska Airlines without the four critical bolts that held the door plug in place. Whitaker says this: This is not a one-year project. What's needed is a fundamental cultural shift at Boeing that's oriented around safety and quality above profits. That will require sustained effort and commitment from Boeing and unwavering scrutiny on our part. The big question now is who will lead that federal effort? Whitaker says he has the utmost confidence that agency staff will continue to apply rigorous oversight required to make sure this happens after my tenure as administrator ends. It will be up to President-elect Trump's second administration to nominate a new FAA chief who can get confirmed by the Senate. That job has been in a bright spotlight the last few years, and the rumors are really flying. But right now, no clear successor to take the reins of the FAA. Boeing just said its internal turnaround project is moving along, and the big focus has been simplifying processes for workers, empowering them to speak up when they see problems, and not letting little jobs linger as they travel down the production line, like what happened in the door plug blowout. Boeing just said its overhaul is on track, Boris, and showing tangible improvements.",
