And she had been tasked with trying to get information about the timing and presence of President Zelenskyy during that visit to Mykolaiv.Now, Ukrainian intelligence officials say they got wind of this. They had information about this planned possible assassination attempt and took additional security measures, that in their checks and follow-ups on this woman, they've also found other communications from people they believe are her Russian handlers that have been telling her to find out information about the whereabouts and locations of Ukraine's electronic warfare installations. Of course, these absolutely vital to defeating these cruise missile and drone attacks that Russia is firing into Ukraine that she was tasked with trying to find out those locations, as well as stores of ammunition and weapon supplies that were feeding into the Ukrainian frontlines. And this is information she was supposed to gather and apparently shared with her Russian handlers. Now, she's in Ukrainian custody.

They want to decapitate the Ukrainian government. And one of the easiest ways they think to do that would be to go after Zelenskyy himself. So, he's at great risk.

So, I want to bring in CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz.

So, the defense attorney, John Lauro, for Donald Trump was even on CNN yesterday talking about how he wants the public to be able to see the evidence in this case, and he wants to get to trial quickly. He's also said that in court to the magistrate judge last week when Donald Trump entered his not guilty plea.But nothing can get started here until there's some sort of non- disclosure plan put over this case. That's something that's really typical in a criminal case that gets put in place pretty early. And so the Justice Department has gone to the court and know Donald Trump is out there on social media even saying things in a veiled, threatening way, saying that he would come after you. And so now they want to make sure that they have something in place that will govern all of the preparations for trial and make sure that the evidence that is very sensitive is locked down. Now, that can't happen until there's some sort of an agreement. And so the judge in this case has set a deadline for Donald Trump's team of 5:00 P.M. today to get back to her and to the prosecutors about what their plan is, how they want to make sure that evidence is protected. We're going to have to see what they say in court if it matches what Donald Trump's defense lawyer is saying publicly about wanting evidence. But right now, this is going to be a crucial thing, Omar, as we look forward to trial timing. Because once the evidence starts flowing from the prosecutor's side to the defense side, everybody is in that phase of getting ready for trial. But you can't start that until there's some sort of provision in place to protect things and govern things going forward.",

But as far as what we know so far in this case, Judge Tanya Chutkan has no reason for a recusal. She has previously had a case before her from Donald Trump related to his time in office and after, and she was able to rule on that. It even went to the Supreme Court.

Same way, by the way, Judge Cannon, who Trump appointed, was randomly assigned to his case down in Florida.So, let's get that clear. He keeps suggesting this was handpicked, not at all. There is no basis to recuse this judge. The fact that she's an Obama nominee does not at all mean she's necessarily prejudiced against him. Again, same thing with Judge Cannon. She's a Trump nominee. Doesn't mean she's prejudiced in his favor. Yes, this judge has had prior cases relating to January 6th. She's ruled on them correctly. She's been upheld by the courts of appeals.
