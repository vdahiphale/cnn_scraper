This is just a remarkable moment in this conflict, and the Ukrainians have gotten very good at intercepting these Russian conversations, and it is clear from all those beeps, even if you don't speak Russian, that they are not happy about these North Korean troops.Let me ask you, first of all, how do you think, how cohesive a force can a, you know, joint army like this with these thousands of North Korean troops joining these Russian forces in Ukraine, how effective can that be? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.) AND CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's going to be quite a mess, Alex, and I think as these intercepts show, there is absolutely nothing in place within the Russian army to accept the North Koreans. What they've done is they've set up a system where they'll have senior officers, three per battalion, showing up along with an interpreter, and, you know, the translation between Korean and Russian is not an easy thing. Those are, you know, not related languages. Russians would be much better off if they put Belarusian soldiers in as opposed to North Korean soldiers. So it's going to be a command and control nightmare, it's going to be a supply nightmare, and it's also going to, I think, diminish the effectiveness of the Russian forces because they're pulling commanders from active duty units that are on the front lines and putting them into battalions with Koreans in them. That's going to diminish their capacity to lead, it's going to diminish their capacity to conduct military operations.",

He doesn't want to institute a draft or conscription of any type or do a mobilization.And it's a political reason in the sense that he doesn't want to diminish any type of loyalty toward him. And that loyalty is really dependent on him not deploying a mass of urban Russians into the fight. And so he's trying to do a stopgap, put the North Koreans in place. The North Koreans may get something in exchange for this, but those soldiers are basically cannon fodder.",

I suspect they are not.Also, the presidential guard in North Korea, that is a very elite unit. That could potentially be used for elite uses, for commando raids and things like that. But that is not what we're seeing here. It looks very much like a standard infantry battalion that was sent over there. And that is the kind of thing that we're probably going to be dealing with here. And those forces are basically conscripts. They are trained, but they're not trained to the same standards as the Russians. And they're going to be -- it's going to be a huge challenge for the Russians to even start to use them effectively in a combat situation. And it's going to be very interesting to see what happens if they actually make contact with the Ukrainians in the form of combat.",

CACHE MCCLAY, BEYONCE REPORTER, GANNETT/USA TODAY NETWORK: Well, Beyonce tends to have a track record of letting her art and her actions speak for themselves. And today seems to be no different. While this is a huge, huge deal, it's certainly not surprising. Beyonce has shown her support for the Kamala Harris campaign in so many different ways. I mean, we know immediately after Vice President Harris announced her bid to be the next U.S. president, Beyonce has kept clear of her 2016 song Freedom to use on the campaign trail.
