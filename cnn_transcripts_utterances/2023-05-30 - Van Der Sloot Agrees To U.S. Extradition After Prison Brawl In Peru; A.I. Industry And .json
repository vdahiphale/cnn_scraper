The industry leaders say that A.I. could pose, in their words, an \"extinction risk\" for humanity and should be a top priority.CNN's Jon Sarlin joins us now with details. Jon, we were just speaking about a whole other view of A.I., and that is the potential it has in health care and other positive uses here. Here you have the other side, I suppose, drawing trend lines here out to the extreme of an extinction risk. I mean, I wonder how big a risk they're talking about here. Is this only a hypothetical one? Are they saying it's very serious? It's hard -- it's hard to balance all that you hear here because some is very positive and some is very negative.",

      "sentences": "Right. This is a short but concerning statement about the risks of A.I. from many of the people behind developing this technology.The statement is short. It's 22 words. It reads, \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority, alongside other societal scaled risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" This is a statement saying that A.I. itself poses a risk of extinction. Notably, the people who signed this letter are some of the executives building it themselves. People like Sam Altman, the CEO of Open Mind. You have people from Deep Mind, Google's A.I. company. Although, there were some notable missing names from the letter, people like Elon Musk, who signed a previous letter saying that A.I. needed to be paused for six months. Although, Grimes, his partner and the pop star, did sign the letter. What are the concerns? Organizers behind the letter told the \"New York Times\" that there weren't details specifically in this letter to unite the concerns of different so-called A.I. doomers, who see this technology as a significant threat. There are concerns like disinformation which we're seeing in the 2024 election. But then also the more science-fictiony Sky Net scenarios where you have runaway A.I., A.I. that will become more intelligent than humans and we wouldn't be able to turn the switch off. I talked to one tech executive who shares this belief. And he said, look, tigers have sharper teeth than humans and humans keep tigers in cages in zoos. The reason? We're smarter than them. Well, if A.I. becomes smarter than humans and we're unable to control them, there's no saying what will happen next.",

And the state Supreme Court in New York will soon decide whether to extend a temporary restraining order that blocks New York City from transporting migrants to Rockland County. A judge issued the order earlier this month after Mayor Eric Adams announced plans to send asylum seekers to a hotel in Orangetown. Rockland County officials argue the plan violates local zoning laws. And some travelers leaving Auckland International Airport will be asked to step on a scale before they board.

Here it is right now on the weather model. And the wind is blowing from the east. Not the usual pattern, but it is. And it's blowing it farther inland, into Bucks County, into New York City, all the way even into Scranton. Now 1,700 wildfires in Canada already this year. Normal is about 1,500. That's not unusual. The unusual number is 6.4 million acres have already burned. That's 10 times normal. Now talk about Nova Scotia property. That's 50,000 acres in Nova Scotia compared to the 6.4 in the western part of Canada.
