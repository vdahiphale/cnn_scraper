At least 100 people were killed and 150 others injured after a fire broke out at a wedding hall in the north of the country. A wedding guest says the bride and groom are devastated but are doing fine.Firefighters are looking through the burnt out building for survivors and the prime minister says officials will \"do everything they can to help those affected by the sad incident.\" Well, authorities say the fire was caused by candles and fireworks used during the wedding ceremony. And the situation was made worse by \"the use of highly flammable low cost building materials that collapse within minutes when the fire breaks out.\" Well next to Armenia where there's a growing humanitarian crisis and influx of refugees after neighboring Azerbaijan defeated separatists in the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. The Armenian government says more than 28,000 of what it calls forcibly displaced persons from the enclave have arrived in the country as of Tuesday. The mass exodus has led to this scene right here. The only road connecting the region to Armenia packed full of cars as people try to flee. The International Committee of the Red Cross tell CNN it is working with officials to open more aid routes into the enclave. Doctors say many of the new arrivals suffer from malnutrition on. Nagorno-Karabakh has been under blockade since December of last year, which prevented the delivery of food fuel and medicine. A US official says the recent military conflict has made the situation worse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Vitali Perfilev is in charge of the security piece while Sitii runs the commercial side. Sitii likes to keep a low profile these days which is not surprising given that he survived a mail bomb attack here in December 2022. After the attack, locals began to wear T-shirts in support of him, a sign of the Wagner's entrenched popularity here. We first met Sitii back in 2019. Officially, he was acting as a translator. But documents showed he was the head of a now defunct Wagner-owned company called Lobaye Invest and that he had started working with Prigozhin to influence U.S. elections in the so-called troll factory back in 2016. Educated in Paris and fluent in French, English and Spanish, Sitii later created the Russian cultural center in Bangui which investigative group The Sentry says Wagner uses as a front to sell its gold and diamonds to VIPs and manage its timber and alcohol operations. The center is one of the last places Prigozhin was photographed alive. Seen here with Sitii standing by him.

MIPS originally meant Mauritius Internet Payment System. But now it has become Multiple Internet Payment System working with all six different means of payment available in Mauritius meaning payment apps, wallets, financial apps in Mauritius and those for e-commerce and physical walk-in machines allowing the merchant to keep synchronized every digital means of payment coming in this ecosystem whether it be e-commerce or front facing for walk-in (INAUDIBLE). I just made with the same machine a payment by card. Previously I just made a payment with a QR code. The two types of payments were going to these financial institutions but for the merchant and for the user perspective it is one ecosystem, the same back office is used for (INAUDIBLE), the cashier doesn't have to ask the client which means of payment you will use. Everything is synchronized through the same back office. We have approximately 1,000 merchants in our portfolio (INAUDIBLE). We have workstations so these are big merchants. We have government institutions. But we also have SMEs, little shops. And the presence of mixed logo makes me very proud especially when I go with my kids to (INAUDIBLE) and they say Hey Dad, this is your logo. MIPS operates mainly in Mauritius. We also operate in Seychelles, Maldives and Madagascar.
