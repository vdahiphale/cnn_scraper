A siren sounded around the central parts of this city for the first time. The question now is what more will follow? Because over the last couple of days, we have been watching as Hezbollah has been flexing its muscles in new ways, showing its ability to strike deeper into Israel and its willingness to strike targets that it previously had not targeted, such as Haifa, for example. We also saw that Hezbollah was targeting the Ramat David Air Base, which is several miles east of our location. And many of the communities around that base were also fired upon with one hit yesterday, hitting a civilian home in that very area. We also saw today as a part of the West Bank, just east of Tel Aviv, also received Hezbollah rockets, at least two of those rockets actually making impact, one of them hitting a Palestinian community in the West Bank.

Idon't have a snap poll to read out to you at this instant on that. But what is clear is that the support that exists for the moves that the military is making in Lebanon right now is born out of the fact that there is a kind of lassitude with the constant barrages of rockets that Hezbollah has been firing into Northern Israel and the way that the government -- the Israeli government has been framing its actions right now is saying that it cannot allow those barrages to continue and that something needs to be done to change the equation. This government has clearly chosen the escalation route rapidly over the course of the last week, escalating the number and the intensity of the strikes that they are carrying out in Lebanon, others would say that this government should have chosen another path, which would be a ceasefire in Gaza, which many experts believe would likely have led to a diplomatic agreement with Hezbollah as well, since Hezbollah has been saying that they are firing rockets into Israel because of Israel's military campaign in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Clearly, that is not the route this Israeli government has chosen. The question now is whether Hezbollah has the will and the capability to continue to join Israel on this escalation route. So far, it seems like they are, but there's no question that these strikes in Lebanon, over the course of the last few days, have significantly impacted Hezbollah's capabilities.

Here's Cozumel, Cancun over here, here's Southern Mexico, Puerto Escondido, big music festivals go on there. And then, also up toward Acapulco. Now, Hurricane John, not moving much at all. Will likely become a Category 3 major hurricane before making landfall. But notice where it goes, which is nowhere in five days. That's why the rain is going to pile up. Hurricane Center saying life-threatening situation. And that's going to be the case when you talk about this much moisture, this much rainfall in this large of an area, everywhere that you see that white, that's 500 millimeters. That's 20 inches of rain or more. And some models put out a devastating 60 inches of rain in the next 72 hours. I can't even think about what that would do to the landscape there.

Now, these models here, these cones are not always going to be perfect, and they're not even made to be perfect. So, Tampa, you're not out of it. All the way over to Mobile, you're not out of it. But a major landfalling hurricane in the next 72 hours, this is going to ramp up very, very quickly. This is going to be a rapidly intensifying storm that is going to make landfall where people are just now thinking about preparing for a storm, and it will be onshore rather quickly, by the middle of the week. The temperatures here somewhere between 32, 33 Celsius, upper 80s Fahrenheit, a lot of water, a lot of heat. And yes, the American model is significantly more impressive, stronger than the European model. So, kind of take half and half, but there are models here that take this to greater than Category 3 intensity before landfall. Not much time to prepare, but if you are anywhere from almost to Orleans, maybe not quite, but then all the way down toward Tampa and Sarasota, you only have a couple days to prepare for a big storm. The storm doesn't even have a center yet. I can't tell you where it's going to go yet until the models say, oh, there you are, and there you're going. That's the problem right now.

We have gone after a quite different way of portraying this. We're not shouting that I'm cheaper than my neighbor. That's not a real good argument in this space.

Long known as the Vegas of Asia, Macao is nowlooking to diversify its economy away from gaming, with more emphasis on unique heritage. Today, Marc Stewart has the story of an iconic Macao hotel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In a place obsessed with constructing new things, Simon Sio is following his own path. He owns Hotel Central, a nearly century old building and one of the most iconic in Macao. SIMON SIO CHAIRMAN, LEK HANG GROUP (through translator):  Hotel Central and I are faded together, and that's because my family lived across from Hotel Central when I was born. STEWART (voice-over):  When Hotel Central was built in 1928, it was known for its glitz and glamour. SIO (through translator):  As children, we would frequent the largest building in Macao out of curiosity. One day, I got caught by an employee and was thrown out onto the streets. So, I pointed at the hotel and swore that I would buy it someday. STEWART (voice-over):  That's what he did in 2016. SIO (through translator):  I felt that restoring the hotel was a huge business opportunity. STEWART (voice-over):  Restoration got underway in 2020 from re-piling the delicate foundation to restoring the exterior. Simon wanted to retain the hotel's original integrity. After about $50 million U.S. dollars and years of restoring the building, Hotel Central officially reopened in the summer of 2024. The design is based on styles from the 1920s to the 1940s. Cultural heritage is essential for a healthy tourism sector, observers say. The global heritage tourism market reached more than $580 billion in 2023. That number expected to grow to more than $810 billion by 2032, according to market research firm IMARK Group.",

Yes, this is just an absolutely amazing season that Shohei Otani is having,and he is definitely repaying big chunks of that $700 million contract that the Dodgers gave him at the start of the season. As you've just referenced, he's already up to 50 and 50. He was actually the first man to do 43 and 43. And he has big plans for the rest of the season and the postseason. This is Shohei in action with two more steals in a big come from behind win against the Rockies on Sunday. He had two steals and another homer. That was the homer, and it was huge coming in the bottom of the ninth inning, which helped them beat the Rockies. That's Mookie Betts with the winning score in this game. So, Dodgers are sitting very, very pretty at the moment. They haven't yet won their division, but they are already into the playoffs. Meaning that Ohtani is going to be in the postseason for the first time in his career. It's amazing to think that he's never actually experienced playoff baseball before. With half a dozen games still to go in the regular season, they want to keep going. The Dodgers want to win their division because that means they'll have an advantage in the playoffs. They'll be able to skip through the wild card round. And when you look at what he's doing, it is just absolutely incredible. He's on pace, I think, to be the MVP, which would make him only the second player ever to win MVP awards in both of the leagues in Major League Baseball. And of course, he wants to go much further than that. Hopefully, leading the Dodgers all the way. But even just looking at what he's done, it is phenomenal. It is absolutely historic. And, Richard, you may know that he's not just a batter, he's a pitcher. He's the kind of guy that hasn't existed since Babe Ruth way back in the day, but he's recovering from elbow surgery. So, he's not able to pitch this season. And that's one of the reasons why he makes so many steals because he feels bad that he's not contributing more for his team. So, he's doing everything he can to help them out, and he certainly is.",
