The decades-old and, honestly, very strange tradition to save a few fortunate Turkeys from the fate of the Thanksgiving day feast.All right, 6 a.m. here on the East Coast. A live look at Capitol Hill, where people are taking a break beginning this week, just for a little holiday time. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us on this Monday as we head into the Thanksgiving week. Donald Trump's vision for his second-term cabinet. We now understand it in full. The once and future president's personnel choices revealing a stark contrast with his first administration. So, among Trump's picks this time: an independent with the last name Kennedy, who supports abortion rights; more than one former Democratic presidential contender; a centrist Republican who is favored by the Teamsters union; a man who fundraised for Al Gore and advised George Soros. And then, of course, there are quite a few MAGA loyalists and FOX News favorites. It all adds up to a cabinet that is united not by dogma, but by loyalty to Trump and his vision. Over the weekend, Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei writing this in Axios: quote, \"Lost in the noise of Trump's most controversial picks is the simple undebatable fact that this might be the most ideologically diverse cabinet of modern times. The team represents the Trump worldview: traditional conservatism is dead -- and its biggest, lifelong advocates neutered to the point of irrelevance. A Trump transition source told us that most of the picks are a version of Trump in their thinking and approach: 'They're fearless disrupters who can walk into these buildings and know they have a mandate for reform and change.'\" A mandate for reform if, of course, they can land the job. Trump has suffered at least one defeat on that front so far. Matt Gaetz withdrawing his name from consideration for attorney general just eight days after it had been announced. And of course, getting Trump's other controversial picks -- Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. -- approved by the Senate could pose the first great test for just how far a Congress dominated by Republicans will let Trump go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO): I think ultimately, this is a decision that President Trump made to bring in another disrupter. And I think, if you look at this election, it was disrupter versus establishment. He ran on this. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): In the end, it is the Republicans that are going to have to make a decision if these people are qualified for these jobs. They have the votes.",

But some of these, the ideological diversity on display, not something that a lot of the Republicans in the Senate are going to be used to voting for. I mean, the abortion rights question with Kennedy, the union questions for the labor secretary pick. He's asking for a lot. MATT GORMAN, FORMER ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: You know, as you're reading the Axios snippet, I thought about the fact that, look, this was an ideologically diverse coalition that enabled Trump to win. It was the Teamsters, in a lot of respects, speaking at the Republican convention. You had a working-class vote. Obviously, some of the Kennedy vote, you had go to Trump. So, in a -- in a large part, this is a makeup of the voting coalition for Trump that propelled him to win. And you're right. There's some murmuring on the right about Lori Chavez-DeRemer and her ties to kind of unions, close ties to unions. But also, you're seeing a little bit of grumbling about Kennedy. And I think, you know, it seems that Pete Hegseth, Gabbard, and Kennedy are among the trio that will have kind of the toughest confirmation fight. My money right now could be on Kennedy having the toughest, simply because you're getting it from the right, with the abortion or the pro-life advocates; and you're also having kind of pharma, food processors.

The question here, I think, going forward is we can talk about the ideological diversity. Often, the word \"loyalty\" is used to describe the relationship to Trump. It was in Sangers article. I think more what you see in practice is from Trump an interest in obedience right? And in not -- he is not very loyal to people. He expects people to be loyal to him. And that is the question here with the Senate confirmations. Will the Republican Senate actually buck his choices? And then, when it comes to governing, will these secretaries, whoever gets confirmed -- I assume most of them will be confirmed, if not all of them -- will they be obedient to him? Will he care what they're doing? Will he take an approach similar to what he did in his first term of running the White House and not being that interested in what's going on in each of these departments?

      "sentences": "Yes, about 80 million Americans traveling this week, seeing their family, their friends, their loved ones. Maybe you're hitting the airways.OK, we've got the potential for some minor delays across the airports here, from Chicago to Detroit and Minneapolis. That's for today. Moderate weather-related delays along the West Coast, especially near the state of California. But I want you to notice, as we advance into Tuesday, how that weather kind of moves inland. So, places like Denver to Salt Lake City, some of those transfer hubs could have some weather-related delays, as well. There is a cold front that will sweep through along the Eastern Seaboard; could bring some delays from Atlanta through to New York City, as well. Now, it's not just Americans hitting the airports, but it's also Americans hitting the roadways. We've got about 90 percent of us traveling on the roads, and right now we could have some snowfall that impacts the roadways across the Northern portions of the Great Lakes. But again, I highlight the West Coast, because this is an area that's been battered by storm after storm. So, this is the storm system that's going to move Eastward today. This is going to bring rainfall overnight and into Tuesday morning along the Eastern Seaboard. And then we focus our attention on the bigger storm that will impact travel for Thanksgiving and the day after. And I want you to take note of the cold weather that will settle in behind it. Yes, this is going to be a big wake-up call. Winter is coming back with a vengeance. Temperatures drop like a rock behind this cold front as we head into the weekend, so enjoy the warmth while you can -- Kasie.",
