But first, General, I do want to ask very quickly how the Israeli -- the IDF ended up getting Yahya Sinwar. What does it tell us about patterns of terrorist activity? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY (via Webex by Cisco): Well, when you have a situation like this, John, and a terrorist leader like Yahya Sinwar, they know they are under threat continuously. Now we experienced this in Iraq and Afghanistan where we had terrorist leaders who knew they were constantly being watched. Intelligence was driving their potential location. So you will see them moving quite frequently, maybe sleeping at two or three different places throughout a week or maybe even more. So they are moving and that puts them in a position where they pop up somewhere. And I think in this particular situation I can see in my mind's eye Sinwar probably came up out of tunnel entrance inside this building and realized that he and his two compatriots were surrounded and didn't have much of a chance other than to fight, and that's what happened. So those are the kind of things where sometimes, as Carl Clausewitz, the old Prussian philosopher used to say, chance plays a part in war. We call that luck but sometimes the terrorists will stumble into the bullseye, and this is what happened yesterday. And I think the Israelis were quite fortunate to find him as he popped out of a tunnel.",

      "sentences": "And so, Peter Gergen, Sinwar is gone. He was the leader of Hamas. You know, Hassan Nasrallah is gone, the leader of Hezbollah. These -- you could call them decapitation attacks, right? You take out the leadership of a terror movement. But Israel has some experience with this.How has it worked out in the past? PETER GERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, HOST, \"IN THE ROOM WITH PETER BERGEN\" PODCAST:  Well, not very well in the sense that Israel killed one of the leaders of Hamas early on, Sheikh Hassan. Hamas grew bigger after that fact. Israel also killed the military commander of Hezbollah in Damascus in 2008, Imad Mughniyah. Hezbollah grew stronger after that. Obviously, the fact that a lot of Hezbollah leaders have been taken out and a lot of Hamas leaders have been taken out does make a difference. However, who's going to replace Sinwar? It could well be his brother Mohammed Sinwar who is as militant as his brother and as unlikely to be a -- sort of a good faith negotiator as his brother proved to be. So Hamas also is not like al Qaeda. There's a lot of discussion this is like getting bin Laden. From a psychological point of view, yes, but al Qaeda was a relatively small group of a few hundred people. Hamas has 20,000 fighters. A lot of them have been killed but a lot of them haven't been killed. So I think it's a tactical victory; it's not a strategic victory.",

You know, having decapitated terrorist organizations in my lifetime in combat you're always high fiving each other because you've hit a main target. But the next day a car bomb will go off or a missile will explode in your area of operation. There are a lot of fighters left in Hamas even though Israel has decimated them.What Israel could do is potentially -- you see the Palestinian people. There are reports from intelligence sources that say just like the revolution against al Qaeda in Iraq the people of Palestine have seen the terror that this can wrought among their citizens. So they have an opportunity -- Israel has an opportunity to use this as a psychological weapon. So many of their leaders have been dead, Israel might say, so what are you going to do now to support them or to not support them anymore in the Gaza? So that becomes an opportunity if they use it correctly. But again, I think they will have a measured approach to his. They will continue to go after fighters that will be launching rockets. And I would bet there will be some attacks coming out of Gaza in the near future to prove that they are still alive and well. But at the same time they can use it as an opportunity to persuade the Palestinian people that you have to get rid of this organization that has been leading you. And that becomes a tipping point. We've seen that in other wars and it's possible today that Israel might use that same approach.",

I mean, privately, they will probably hope for quite a significant response against Iran. And as you know, John, they -- the Israeli war cabinet has been debating what precisely that strike could be.President Biden has said do not attack Iran's nuclear sites. The past record of President Biden saying things that the Israelis pay attention to I don't think has been particularly strong. But obviously that would be a huge blow and something I think the Saudis would at least privately applaud because, of course, they're very concerned about an Iranian nuclear weapon. So I think this is -- obviously, it's a big story. But I think if you're looking from a wider strategic point of view -- from the Saudis' point of view, they're really looking at what is Israel going to do with this potential Iran strike that has been in the works now for almost three weeks.",

What she's going to continue to do in terms of focusing on economic growth for everyone. And also remind people the debacle that Trump was when he was there for four years. You know, my dear friend Scott loves to talk about how everything was great under Republican rule. Well, under Republican rule with Donald Trump at the helm he absolutely put our economy in the toilet when he refused to understand how to be the leader during a global pandemic. Refusing to accept the science of COVID. Lost millions of American jobs. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died on his watch. Businesses were shuttered, which is why you saw cities going into decline. And the -- and the fact of the matter is that under the Biden-Harris administration those cities are coming back, including Detroit. And so she is doing both and she's also focused on showing Republicans that it is time to turn the page. The hundreds of Republicans that she had at the event that she had earlier this week. The Republicans that worked for Donald Trump in his own cabinet and in the Oval Office that are now the ones that are saying this man is a danger to the country is also an important message, Kate.

There were conversations with The Shade Room to potentially sit down with Donald Trump. And in conversations earlier this week when describing why an interview hadn't come together just yet, a Trump adviser told The Shade Room producers that Trump was \"exhausted and refusing some interviews, but that could change at any time.\" This was according to two people that were familiar with the conversations. That he was exhausted. Trump's national press secretary Karoline Leavitt made clear that she was not part of the back-and-forth in The Shade Room -- with The Shade Room regarding the interview but said the idea he's exhausted is unequivocally false.

And every time he is now in public and in a rally, you can see his mental decline almost in real time. Everyone who has seen him now versus even 2016 and 2020 absolutely say he is not the man he was. And so for his own campaign to say that he is exhausted, I get it. He's an old man. And so that also leads to the contrast of somebody new, somebody fresh.

I really love the one, although I am married and not on Tinder, that says \"Hot people vote.\" OK, Cupid has also added matching questions that users can show to other users that might be potential matches like -- things like what are the most important issues for you in this 2024 presidential election, or is it a dealbreaker if your match doesn't have the same political views as you do ahead of the 2024 election?

The county attorney now says that she came to the decision to drop the charges after personally reviewing the evidence and speaking with senior attorneys, as well as community members.

The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Ryan Wedding. Agents say his group moved 60 tons of cocaine a year and also ordered the killings of four people. He's just 34 years old. He's also charged with -- well, now charged with murder and drug crimes. And the FBI believes he could be hiding in Mexico.
