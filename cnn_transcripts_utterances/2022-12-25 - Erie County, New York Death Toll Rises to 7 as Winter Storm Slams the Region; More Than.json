The governor also confirming that among the now seven dead, confirmed dead, in and around Buffalo where some of those vulnerable, some homeless individuals, as well as some individuals that were found in their vehicles. And then also those that were perhaps experiencing a medical emergency and help simply couldn't make it to them during the height of the storm Friday and yesterday. But today really this at least offering some hope for so many people, but I'll tell you what, though, the next chapter of this challenge will be the power issues. I have spoken time and time again to individuals who are having to turn to hotels for warmth because they've been in the dark for two days. Officials, though, saying that if they are safe at home, even if it's without power, stay in place. The travel ban, those restrictions, they're still in place. And that's why I actually went up to the 19th floor. You can look down on these highways that you see up there. They are mostly clear. The only vehicles I'm seeing out there are emergency vehicles, public works folks, so that's a good sign. But still, you are seeing individuals, still out, and perhaps do things that they need to do. But it is Christmas Day. Obviously everything would be closed anyway, so hopefully folks are staying in place. Tomorrow, perhaps, some hope for a little more recovery. Paula, back to you.",

This is an area that has approximately half a million residents between the city of Buffalo and some of our suburbs. It was such that we had to pull emergency rescue vehicles off the roads. We had to send search-and-rescue teams, those that are trained for these very bad winter conditions to actually go and rescue first responders who went out to try to respond to emergency calls.And so now we're getting to a point where we're trying to open up additional roads, so that we can get to those individuals who may have had an emergency call that we haven't been able to get to. And we're also working with National Grid and New York State Electric and Gas to restore power to areas that have not had power for two days. There are homes right now that we know are below 30 degrees because we're getting reports of pipes bursting from individuals who are at homes that unfortunately the temperature has gone below 32. So what we're telling everybody is if you are at a home that doesn't have heat, and it's been like that, make sure you have your water running. It doesn't have to be a strong amount of water but you should have your water running so there's water going through the system, and your pipes don't burst. And then we also -- we're trying to get the power back as quickly as possible. The biggest problem that National Grid is dealing with is a number of their major substations that support the city of Buffalo, not only were snowed in, but were frozen, completely frozen, suffered serious damage of equipment. And it's still going to probably be 36 to 48 hours before they can get to a point where they're going to be able to restore power for those areas.",

POLONCARZparts of the state. They are authorized to drive into the community even though there is a driving ban throughout all of the county. It certainly isn't going to impact people's travel into the community, there's no doubt about that. I know from hearing the reports from the airport is that one of the reasons that they are closed until then is because of not just having significant snow on the runways. They can actually handle the snow on the runways. It's snow that's piled up against the terminal and in other areas of the airport. So they just need to be safe so that before they can have any travelers go to the airport, it's in a condition where they don't have to worry about the safety of individuals.",

It has smaller and more narrow streets with cars on them. Lots of drifting issues in the city. And even though it's only about three feet plus of snow, the drifts are eight to 10 feet tall in some areas.Last night we were getting reports of streets that were closed -- I mean, excuse me, streets that were open in the suburbs and then we got about a foot of snow, with the heavy winds that came, and now you had two to three-foot drifts going across these roads that had previously been cleared. So I feel like we're in a much better position for some of the major towns, like the town of Tonawanda, the town of Cheektowaga, the town of West Seneca. But the town of Amherst and the city of Buffalo are still in a situation where it's going to take some time to clean some of these areas off. And just once again, there is a driving ban.

And I've also been in contact with the Biden administration and they've offered additional assistance and they're seeing what they could get up here rapidly.

So I think the thing to look at is this lawless behavior of Mnuchin.Now the IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, was a Beverly Hills tax lawyer whose specialty was helping people suspected of tax cheating avoid indictment and reducing what they paid to the government by ginning up as much litigation trouble as possible. And this just shows lawless behavior. Mr. Rettig, the commissioner, didn't go along with this. He should have resigned as a matter of principle.
