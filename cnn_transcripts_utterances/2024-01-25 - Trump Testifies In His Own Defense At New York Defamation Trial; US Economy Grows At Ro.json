It's economic news that's driving the markets. I'll get to that in just a moment. The main events, Donald Trump is on the stand. The former president testified for a few minutes at his civil defamation trial. What's the significance? We will ask. US economic growth is unexpectedly strong. There are signs the public is starting to notice. And the debate that's getting international diplomats involved. I like a nice cup of tea in the morning. How to make the proper cup of tea and someone is suggesting it might involve salt. Live from London, Thursday, January 25th. I'm Richard Quest. I know you may not recover from that though. I mean business. Good evening. Donald Trump has taken the stand at a New York courtroom. It's for his civil defamation trial brought against him by the former magazine columnist, E. Jean Carroll. It will decide -- the case is deciding how much Donald Trump has to pay in damages. The former president spoke for about four minutes in the last hour speaking in his own defense. Our senior legal analyst is Elie Honig. He is with me. Do we know what was said? What can you tell me?",

It fit into the time of one commercial break here at CNN, and the reason it was so short was because the judge set very strict parameters. This trial is not about whether there was a sexual assault. This trial is not about whether Donald Trump defamed Miss Carroll, that is already established. This trial is simply about damages. And so essentially, the questions boiled down to do you stand by your deposition, the statements you made in your deposition about the events in question? Donald Trump said, yes, I don't know what that really establishes whether one stands by their deposition. It is what it is. And then there were questions about you only made your statements about Miss Carroll after she had publicly accused you of sexually assaulting her, which is a fact, and Donald Trump said yes. And I think they're trying to show there that Donald Trump didn't sort of start this on his own volition, and then the last thing Donald Trump said was, I made my statements because I was attempting to protect my reputation and my family. So it was really sort of uncontroversial what he said, and I don't know how much it helped him with the jury.",

Jean Carroll out of nowhere, that he was responding to her defensively. I don't think that undermines the fact that it was defamatory as a prior jury found.

In the first trial, thejury came back with a finding of $5 million in damages. Now, that will certainly be appealed. But I think if we use that as a guidepost here, I think I would expect to see a verdict in the range of multiple millions of dollars. Now in this case, E. Jean Carroll is asking for up to $10 million, but what the jury has to do really is separate damages into two categories. One is compensatory damages, meaning how much financial damage to her job prospects, to her reputation did E. Jean Carroll suffer? And then there is what we call punitive damages, meaning there needs to be a message sent to this person to dissuade him to punish him.

On one hand, you have Tesla, which used to be able to takecomfort in the fact that it was essentially unmatched in this electric vehicle space, and that is just longer the case, especially when you're talking about these Chinese EV makers. The company in an effort to keep up has been slashing prices. The company said last night, that margins were nearly cut in half in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, and I think that's what shareholders wanted to hear last night was now that you're no longer the only player in this game, what is your plan to compete? When do we see an end to these price cuts? And that's what Musk and team largely failed to deliver on last night. They sort of touched on the fact that there may be a new lower priced vehicle coming in the next couple of years. But I mean, you look at that stock price down 12 percent today, it's down about 25 percent from the start of this year. I think people have real questions and questions, too about Musk's leadership at Tesla. In this difficult moment, he's not able to give people the answers that they want, and then you hear him talking about wanting to raise his ownership stake in Tesla and there are shareholders who I think rightfully have brought up this question that it was Elon Musk himself, who decided to sell off a large portion of his Tesla ownership in order to fund his acquisition of Twitter in 2022. He didn't have to do that. A lot of people see that acquisition as having been a distraction for him, and so I think there are some questions about why he decided to do that, and why now he's talking about wanting to raise his stake in Tesla again -- Richard.",

The term is regulatory capture. In this case, what you have are, instead of FAA inspectors on those factory floors in Renton, Washington, you have Boeing employees serving as their designees.

But when you listen to the comments, I mean, it does track with our understanding of Netanyahu. He says here that he believes that Qatar's role has been problematic. He tells the hostage families, you notice that you haven't seen me thank Qatar in this. And then he compares the country to the United Nations and the Red Cross, with whom the Israeli prime minister, of course, has had some beef with, to put it lightly. The Qataris slamming these comments, saying that it is unhelpful to the negotiations and suggesting that Netanyahu is undermining those talks. But I think what's important to note here is that despite this diplomatic spat between Israel and Qatar, it does appear like there is some significant momentum behind these hostage negotiations, and that's because we've just learned today that the CIA director, Bill Burns, has been dispatched to Europe in the coming days to meet with his Israeli and Egyptian intelligence counterparts as well as the Qatari prime minister. And that comes after Brett McGurk, another top advisor to President Biden, has been in Cairo and Doha this week, building up steam, building up momentum for these hostage negotiations. The Qataris have made clear that both Israel and Hamas seem to be responding to various proposals very quickly, suggesting the deepest and most significant level of engagement since that week-long truce that saw the release of dozens of hostages fell apart.

There's a really big issue now because the psychiatrist in jail wrote notes that Ethan said once he got in jail, you know, I lied all the time. And he said I lied to my friend when I texted him, saying that I told my dad I need mental help. And he told me I'd take a pill and suck it up, and my mother laughed. That didn't happen.
