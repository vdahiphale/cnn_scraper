      "sentences": "So that's more than 600,000 people accessing this medication. Now, the case today is focusing on one of two drugs used in this regimen. The drug is called mifepristone. The other drug used in this regimen is called misoprostol.Now it has been approved by the FDA for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy since 2000. And right now, this is available in states that have abortion access. It's not available in states that have bands. There are 14 of those states. There are additional 15 states that have put restrictions in place on medication abortion itself. But if the Supreme Court rules with the appeals court, which essentially has rolled back some of the accessibility of mifepristone, all of those states would be subject to the restrictions on access to this medication. Some of the challenges here are around the safety of the medicine and whether the FDA acted appropriately. Scholars and experts in the pharmaceutical industry point out the safety of this medicine has been proven over the decades since it has been on the market. They say the risk of serious complications is about 0.3 percent using these medicines, Sara.",

You're looking at live stunning daylight images of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in the Patapsco River in Baltimore right now. This is a major American roadway in a major American city, and it is simply under water this morning. There are search and rescue operations underway for as many as sevenpeople who perhaps fell in there. Can we bring the footage back up there so we can see it again, just how stunning this image is right there of that bridge in the water. It all happened overnight when a huge cargo ship, the DALI, rammed into a pylon holding up the bridge. We have footage of the moment that this happened. I can show it here on the wall for you right here. There was the ship as it approached the pylon there, it struck the pylon, the bridge collapsed into the water. It is not clear why or how this vessel ran into that pylon, but officials tell us this morning there was absolutely no tie, no reason to expect any tie to terrorism. That bridge that you're looking at falling into the Patapsco River normally carries 31,000 vehicles a day. This was the 911 dispatch the moment it happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But you can see why this would be a heavily trafficked roadway. Maybe people headed to BWI, there's all kinds of warehouses right here.

This is not some small section. It is quite a large section here. And so the water is choppy, frigid conditions out there.

So when that huge cargo vessel almost 1,000 feet long struck that pylon, a lot of steel fell into the water right there.As you said, we are getting word that there were some maintenance workers who were working on the bridge at the time overnight around 1:30. They may very well have been working on the road board level of the bridge, no reason necessarily to believe that the work they were doing had anything to do with the structure or structural integrity of the bridge itself.

We are also hearing from the ship management company this morning, and we are learning that Synergy Group, that is the owner of the ship says that no crew members were injured, and that was a question because you see there the ship with the bridge collapsed on top of that deck and there was word that there may have been workers working and out on that deck at the time of this accident.

These are the live pictures we are getting back from Baltimore right now.That was the Francis Scott Key Bridge, a major bridge, Interstate 695 in Baltimore, it collapsed overnight and you can see why. That is a huge cargo vessel, the Dali, registered out of Singapore, which rammed into a pylon supporting the bridge overnight causing the bridge to simply crumble, to collapse, what you see there. Some 31,000 vehicles a day normally cross that bridge. We do understand, we have been told there are search and rescue operations underway. The number they say they are looking for is seven people, at least seven people they fear could be in the water. Sonar has detected several vehicles inside the water, and there were also some work crews on the surface of the bridge, working on some concrete stuff when the bridge collapsed. It could be that there are people in the water. The search and rescue efforts are underway. There were two people pulled from the water right after the collapse. One completely uninjured, one in serious condition. But again, the search continues still for seven others in that still truss bridge. Let me just show you where this is on the map right here so people can situate themselves to Baltimore. Here is Downtown Baltimore. There is the Inner Harbor. This is 695. That is the Francis Scott Key Bridge that has now collapsed. BWI Airport is down here, so you can see a major roadway right there, also very important for the moving of cargo. A lot of warehouses in the like right there as well. Again, the search and rescue operations continue this morning, and we are going to update you as that comes in.
