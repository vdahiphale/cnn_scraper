I have a former Trump attorney with me to try to make the case.Also tonight, the DNC prepares for war with third party candidates and one of them joins me tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" All right, can you just imagine what must be going on in Donald Trump's head tonight? I mean, he's got five, just count them, five days to come up with nearly half a billion dollars in a bond in his civil fraud case in New York. And so far, insurance companies who could back that bond are sending his calls to voicemail. The last thing the presumptive GOP nominee wants the world to see is the allegedly multi-billion-dollar man, whatever he actually might be worth, going perhaps hat in hand or selling properties like his namesake, Trump Tower, for bargain basement prices. Because make no mistake, the New York AG, Letitia James, she has zero sympathy, maybe even negative $464 million worth of sympathy. But now there are rumblings in the Trump world that the only number he wants the appeals court to hear and pay attention to is the number eight, as in the Eighth Amendment, which reads, \"excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor the part you probably know best, cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" And it's that phrase, the earlier one, excessive fines, it seems to have really caught Trump's attention. I mean, really. I mean, so much so that he whipped out a copy of it during a Fox town hall just last month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, we've got to have a spiritual and a moral tone in talking about such a difficult moment. We hear Trump engaging in that kind of ugly anti-Jewish language, vicious attacks on liberal Jews and Jews in the Democratic Party. Well, that's par for the course. We know he's a gangster. He's done this before. It's an echo in some ways of the American First Committee. It goes back to Robert Stewart, Jr. He graduated from Princeton in 1937. He was the founder of that. And Charles Lindbergh was there. Henry Ford was there. The latter two received 1938, the German Eagle Medal from Hitler. And Henry Ford has invoked in Mein Kampf, Hitler's text in an admirable way. Hitler had a picture of Henry Ford in his office. Meaning what? This is dangerous stuff. This is organized hatred tied to the kind of politics that we have. And we just need to be very honest about this. Schumer made a very important move, pivotal move. But even Schumer, he didn't really talk about the suffering of the Palestinians. It was still very much about Jews. It reminds me of the Confessing Church in Germany, where they talked about the Christians in Germany, didn't say a mumbling word about the Jews being attacked because they were concerned about the purity and the concern of just Christians. Thank God for Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He criticized that as a Christian. Most Christians did not. Both moments, Weimar, Germany, America these days, ooh, very, very grim, very dim, as it were.

So, to intervene rhetorically, as Schumer did, is a very different kind of thing.But you've got to get to the root of the problem. That's what I would tell brother Schumer. You're not going to get to the root of the problem unless you deal with the Palestinian suffering. You've got to end the occupation. Of course, you need ceasefire. Of course, you need to end the siege. You've got to end the occupation. There will never be precious Jewish safety and security predicated on occupation and domination. You've got to have Palestinian and Jewish dignity, Palestinian and Jewish equality, Palestinian and Jewish security and safety. And they say, well, but that's a pipe dream. Yes, that's right.

And what is the response for us not to become preoccupied with it? We've got to galvanize ourselves and others to be a countervailing force against this kind of hatred and revenge and lies. And that's why I'm convinced that both parties are in many ways beyond redemption. I know that's a radical claim for a lot of people, but the Democratic Party, Biden had his chance to get at the fascist presence of a Trump, but he couldn't do it. He couldn't speak to issues of poverty. He couldn't speak to the issues of working class strong enough. He couldn't support Black voting. He had a chance to even push through the John Lewis bill. All he had to do was suspend the filibuster and put pressure on Manchin. He wouldn't do it. He said that wasn't a priority. Well, you see, if you don't have that kind of backbone, then fascism will sooner or later take over. An alternative to fascism is not some kind of milquetoast moderation.
