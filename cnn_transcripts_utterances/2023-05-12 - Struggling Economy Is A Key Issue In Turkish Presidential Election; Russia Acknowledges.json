But first, Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, says that Russian forces are losing ground in Bakhmut parliamentary -- paramilitary, rather, leader has been in a public dispute with the Russian Defense Ministry for months over one of the toughest battles in the Ukraine war. And Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza launched rockets into Israel intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system. The two sides have been exchanging fire for days. And a pandemic air expulsion rule called Title 42 has expired in the U.S. Thousands of migrants have made their way to the U.S. Mexican border hoping to enter the U.S. and hoping that it will be easier now. But American officials say that is not the case, and they've snuffed up to handle the influx. Stay the course or upend Turkey system of centralized presidential powers and is one of the main choices facing voters in a high stakes and by all accounts very close to presidential election this Sunday. Also, the opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu with a slight lead over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The election results will be closely watched in the U.S. and Europe and in Russia, and could have a huge impact on Turkey's future foreign policy. One of the central reasons for that, a weakened economy, skyrocketing inflation, a dramatic fall and the value of the Turkish Lira versus the U.S. dollar and rising unemployment have made voters unhappy with President Erdogan's policies. Now, if Kemal Kilicdaroglu goes on to win the election, who will be managing Turkey's economy? One name mentioned to lead the overhaul, Ali Babacan, the former Economy Minister oversaw an economic boom in the 2000s and early 2010s. He's a founding member of Erdogan's AK Party, but resigned in 2019. And Ali Babacan, who is also the chairman of the DEVA Party joins us live now from Ankara. Thank you so much for being with us. Obviously, the economy, when you think about it, is one of the key issues in this election. You think about just how much inflation has risen, more than 85 percent. You think about the fact that Erdogan has been reluctant to raise interest rates. You think about what that has done to the Turkish Lira. Just walk us through what your policies are going to be going forward. If you do end up as the economy minister.",

But just going back to the economy, one of the reasons why President Erdogan has, of course, been very reluctant to raise interest rates is because he feels as though -- he has felt as though it would damage the economy from a different perspective, just in terms of wanting to make exports that much more attractive. When you think about what that has done, the refusal to raise interest rates and what it meant for the lira back in 2021, the fact that the lira lost a significant percentage of its value, from that point onwards, what does that meant for ordinary people in Turkey, especially with inflation, especially with just how much food prices, for example, have risen?",

And the central bank made some irrational steps, which made a huge loss of credibility for our monetary policy. And there is actually no economic policy right now in Turkey. There are just some random steps of the government and the random steps of the central bank. That's why I mentioned stronger institutions. So we do need a stronger central bank, which is an independent central bank. We do need a strong treasury. We do need strong banking supervisory and regulation authorities, and only by strong institutions our economy will be strong. And we have prepared everything. We have agreed on 2,300 steps of reforms as six parties together. And by these reforms, we are going to be moving forward. So we need to have a rational fiscal policy, a rational monetary policy, rational banking policy, and, of course, structural reforms moving forward. I have run Turkish economy in 2003 for when we had the crisis. I was the head of Turkish economy during the 2008, 2009 global crisis, mortgage crisis and so forth. So we had two major rounds of crisis solution.

And, of course, I am very, very -- I find it very unfortunate that Mr. Ince had to feel that he had to resign. And according to his statement, the reason behind his resignation was the opposition's personal attack on him supported by the attacks of fettered terrorist organization, which was behind the 2016 military coup attempt in Turkey that costs the lives of our 251 citizens. And President Erdogan, upon Mr. Ince's statement, invited all Ince's supporters, and we know that Mr. Ince had resigned from the CHP.

However, there is this feeling now that now that he's out of the race, that that will be damaging for your party, the AK Party. Again, just to reiterate my first question, what do you think Ince dropping out of the race will change just in terms of your party's fortunes on Sunday? Again, it's very unfortunate that this had to happen, but we are -- have an open invitation to all who would want to support our party. Look, last elections, 29 million people voted for AK Party.

He did in fact say that two days ago, he might even abandon Bakhmut. The outcome of this extraordinary bout of criticism of Russia's top brass has been today Yevgeny Prigozhin to claim that Russia's Ministry of Defense troops have moved into the outskirts of Bakhmut around his Wagner mercenaries who hold the city, and essentially over the past 24 hours have given up five square kilometers to the northwest of that city area. And now he says this now has given Ukrainian armed forces the high ground which can be very advantageous for them moving forward. And indeed too someone that is backed up by a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defense that sort of somewhat deceptively, almost borrow from Prigozhin description of it. Talk about their soldiers moving back to a more advantageous position. Prigozhin called that out really saying that any Russian minister of defense needed to stop lying about the reality of the ground. But this bickering between Russia's military elite, the mercenaries on one side demanding more shells, artillery shells from the military on the other, the military moving in it seems on the outskirts of the city, yet, pulling back in some areas. And the mercenary, Wagner Group, staying in the city center and claiming that they continue to take more areas there. That is simply the worst signal, almost unimaginable, frankly, a year ago, in Putin's Russia, showing how rattled, how dis-unified Moscow's military elite are in this key city that's been such a symbolic task for them. They've utterly failed to comprehensively taken, and now in fact, seeing Ukraine in small amounts here. Let's not overstate the significance of these advances in small amounts, though beginning to reclaim territory that could herald something more what it absolutely unequivocally does in the days and weeks ahead is give a signal of probably low Russian morale, low Russian cohesion ahead of Ukrainian counter offensive, which senior U.S. official said, has begun its shaping operation stage. That's essentially where key parts of Russia infrastructure, fuel supplies, other elements of their occupation of southern, Eastern, and Crimea in Ukraine may well end up being targeted with precision strikes. That's basically what we've been seeing, frankly, over the past two to three weeks, citing reports from pro-Russian officials in the occupied areas, but a sign of the building potential intensity as a head of Ukraine's counter offensive and his president says yet to start wanting more Western weapons. And to this startling display of Russian disunity and tiny, tiny amounts of retreat around Bakhmut, a city which they've invested. That's the wrong word. Entirely squandered so many thousands of human lives and tries to capture. Zain.",

She also now is facing criminal charges. And the reason why the former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, believes that he will be rearrested is because he thinks that all of this, these corruption charges which his party, the PTI, claim are completely bogus. They say that the corruption charges are being fabricated by the current party that's in power, the current government that's in power, including the prime minister, who has accused the, you know, the -- his predecessor and his party, the PTI of, you know, pushing the country towards destruction. And the PTI folks would say that their platform of anti-corruption and rule of law, you know, potentially has eyes on some of the people that are now in power in the country. And so -- and so how do you solve that issue? Well, you get rid of the -- you get rid of the dissenting voices, and they certainly are rounding up senior leaders of the PTI at a scale that's really striking. Just last night, their spokesperson, Shireen Mazari, who appeared on this program on Tuesday, she's now -- she's one of the PTI Party leaders that have been arrested. So they're rounding up senior leaders. And Imran Khan, obviously, if you put two and two together, he feels that they will -- there will be some other charges that come to the surface. And he'll be back behind bars and potentially his wife as well. Now, the fact that Pakistan Supreme Court ruled his arrest unlawful and has granted a bail, it's certainly a promising development. And yet, the reality on the ground is that protesters are angry, and they're facing off against some of the most hardened fighters that you will find in this part of the world. These soldiers in Pakistan have been deployed to fight the war on terror in the country's northern region for more than 20 years. So you have soldiers that are used to fighting terrorists who, you know, who themselves are highly trained, and instead they're on the streets, you know, trying to control civilians with zero training as for -- or very little training on how to handle a civilian protests. So the fear amongst human rights groups and others is that these -- you know, what could be potentially a violent weekend or a violent week next week, if -- especially if the former prime minister is re-arrested, it could result in much more brutality than the deadly protests that we've already seen, Zain.",
