Also tonight, Donald Trump now has 30 days to pay up after a $454 million judgment against him in the New York civil fraud case, that case has just been finalized. Will he meet the deadline? Plus, Trump and Nikki Haley are making their final pitches in South Carolina just hours before the primary.

Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

And that has culminated in this sweeping package on over 500 targets.Now, to break it down for you, this includes hundreds of military industrial-based entities, 26 third-country entities helping Russia evade sanctions, and, separately, the State Department imposing sanctions on three prison officials who are connected to Navalny's death. The idea here, according to U.S. officials, is to choke off Russia, to essentially slow down their ability to access goods and their ability to build weapons. But, of course, Wolf, we have seen multiple sanctions already on Russia from the United States and western governments. Russia has adapted to them, but all the same, U.S. officials saying today that they are that this is hampering Russia's economy and will be detrimental to them in the long-term. The president also expected to talk to G7 leaders tomorrow in a call to reaffirm support for Ukraine as it marks that two-year anniversary.",

Senator, thanks so much for joining us. I know you just had a chance to meet with President Zelenskyy in Ukraine. You're now back across the border in Poland. As Russia is making battlefield gains right now in this, the two-year anniversary of the war, what did President Zelenskyy tell you about Ukraine's urgent need for U.S. military aid? SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Well, Wolf, he told us he's a very strong man. He's dedicated to keeping Ukraine free. And he told us two things, very simple. He said, if we get the aid, if Ukraine gets the aid and we vote for the supplemental package, they will win the war. They have the troops. They still have a great plan. And they have much better fighting ability than the Russians. But he said, if we don't get the supplemental and the ammo we need, which includes anti-aircraft defense, which includes long-range artillery, which includes dealing with the mining -- remote mining program to deal with the Russian mines, and dealing with more long- distance missiles, that they will lose. It's very simple. If they get the package, they will win. If they don't get the package, they will lose. And if they lose, Wolf, the consequences to the west are enormous. Our allies will think we will not stick with them anymore. It will be of great hurt to NATO and Europe. And, worst of all, autocrats will feel they can push the U.S. around. This aid is essential. We went because we felt an obligation to go. We felt this was not just a nice thing to do, but there was a moral obligation to go. And one more thing, Wolf, we need Speaker Johnson to step up to the plate. We need Speaker Johnson to make sure that we get that aid. If he put the bill on the floor, it would pass. There are a good number of Republicans in the House who know how important it is. And he has to see that history is on his back. He cannot have obeisance to Donald Trump. He has to do the right thing here. And we're going to make that point to him, because we got in great detail how Ukraine will win if they get the aid, but how they won't win if they lose. One of the Americans said to us, of course, we saw our people there, that if we -- oops, sorry, that if we don't get the aid, the Ukrainians could -- the Russians could be at the Polish border within a year.",

Monica Connell said, misuse of funds spent on jets, on black cars, five-star hotels, hundreds of thousands of dollars in suits, million-dollar deals to insiders, payments to loyal board members, and pervasive violations of internal controls. And so they have ordered the jury, or found, that Wayne LaPierre has to return $4.3 million on top of the $1 million he says he already paid back to the NRA for expenses that could be considered personal. They have also found that he should be barred from returning to the NRA, but that is something that the judge is going to decide in a separate bench trial, which is yet to occur. So, this is a signal of a giant change for the NRA. LaPierre's defense through all of this was that he was Wayne LaPierre, president of the NRA, that his identity and the NRAs was fused together and his personal expenses on suits that he had to wear for important events and T.V. interviews were part of his business expenses and the expensive vacations on private yachts were part of the hobnobbing he had to do to rub elbows with fundraisers.

And now it really ends up that the goal here is not to get rid of the NRA in New York State, but to really clean it up, to rid it of its corrupt leadership, and that has now been achieved.And under this verdict, Wayne LaPierre and other executives will have to repay the NRA for over $4 million in outstanding damages.

We have a 24-week rule in place. That's where pro-lifers see it. That's where, really, I think a lot of Americans see it. So, every state is going to be a little bit different, but just because you're pro-life doesn't mean that, you know, you're not for providing any choice whatsoever. There's going to be -- there's nuance here. And that's where the voters should have the say, not just Congress, not just the White House, but the voters in the states are going to have their say there.But the thing I push back on is the extreme rhetoric, the extreme language. I mean, even in just the 24 hours, people saying, oh, this Alabama thing was going to define the Republican Party and where they are on this issue. You know, Donald Trump is pro-life, and, you know, as is Nikki Haley, and they both believe that IVF needs to be available, that the court decision was wrong, and that the voters in Alabama, hopefully, will do something to overturn it.",

It's like the banks, insurance companies, they didn't lose any money, and they say that this was a politically-motivated prosecution.Now, of course, the judge didn't see it that way, and the attorney general, Letitia James, who brought the case, also doesn't see it that way. Today, she tweeted, quote, Friday feelings; no one is above the law. But while Trump appeals, he has to either put up the cash or post bond to cover a portion of this verdict. And there is an open question, Wolf, about whether he has enough cash to do that. We're also seeing him try to put off his obligations in the other judgment, E. Jean Carroll case, where he's been ordered to pay her over $80 million. Now, in this case, he asked the judge to hold off on this for at least 30 days, but the judge rejected that request.",

In fact, Donald Trump did that in the first E. Jean Carroll verdict, which was only, by comparison, $5 million.Now here, I doubt he's going to be able to pony up $450-plus million in cash. So, the way typically that you bridge that gap is either by getting someone else to post the money, a bank based on some surety, or by posting the rights, the deeds, the title to certain properties to certain buildings. So, essentially, what he'll try to do here, I think, is cobble together enough cash plus the value of certain properties or buildings that he can at least give the court as an assurance that he's good for it if and when the bill comes due. BLITZER:  Well, Elie, let me get you -- let me press you on this. What are the chances, Trump's chances, if he appeals this verdict? Do you see any way for him to get out of this?",

The judge should have credited our witnesses. The judge should not have believed the other side's witnesses. That's up to the trial judge, and Judge Engoron here, makes pains in his verdict to say that's exactly what he did. As far as allegations that this case was politically motivated or should not have been brought, there may be some credence to that. I mean, there's no mystery Letitia James was politically motivated. She ran for office on a basis of, I'll bring this lawsuit or a lawsuit if you elect me. But I don't know that that's necessarily a basis for an appeals court to throw it out.

They rearrested him and now they have him locked up pending his bail hearing. It's an extreme measure. It shows me the extent to which the FBI is concerned this person might flee. As to the judge's comments, I'm surprised by them as it sounds like Paula is for the judge to say that he believes the defense lawyers intended to help this person flee, I don't know what that's based on. That's a pretty remarkable accusation by the judge. I would hope and assume that the judge has some specific basis on which to make that accusation.

Odysseus meets that definition. But if you're definition of a successful soft landing is landing perfectly upright?
