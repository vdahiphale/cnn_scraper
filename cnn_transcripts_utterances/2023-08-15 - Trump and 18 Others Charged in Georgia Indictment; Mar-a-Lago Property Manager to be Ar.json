      "sentences": "Former President Trump lashing out after the Fulton County grand jury decided to indict him and 18 alleged co- conspirators. Trump has taken aim at District Attorney Fani Willis throughout this two year plus investigation. And last night, after news of the indictment broke, his campaign released a statement calling her a, quote, \"rabid partisan\" and a \"biased prosecutor.\"Let's discuss all of these developments overnight with our political commentator, former special adviser to President Obam, Van Jones, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, co-author of \"Politico's\" \"New York Playbook,\" essential reading I should note, Emily Ngo, and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig is back at the table. Let me actually start with you, Emily. You haven't been with us yet this morning. After reading through this indictment, let's talk about politically how it plays. We'll get to what's going to happen in the courtroom. But what does this mean for Donald Trump? EMILY NGO, CO-AUTHOR, \"POLITICO'S\" \"NEW YORK PLAYBOOK\": So, by now the former president and his counsel, his supporters have a playbook in mind. This is their fourth indictment in about as many months. And they know they're going to attack the prosecutor. They're going to call it a witch hunt. They're going to go after President Biden's so- called cronies. And that's their line of attack is to keep pushing back and not address the substance of the charges. What strikes me as unique in this indictment is that it's both sweeping and narrow in scope at the same time. And so many people who are up and down the totem pole in Trump's world are now indicted as well. And they are a part of this whole mess that he's created for himself.",

But now that he does, we expect him to plead not guilty at his arraignment here later this morning to charges that he schemed with former President Donald Trump to try and delete surveillance video from Trump's Mar-a-Lago property. That's video that was sought by federal investigators in the Trump classified documents case. Now, according to prosecutors, de Oliveira asked another Trump staffer, someone who works in IT, about purging the video after federal investigators showed up at Mar-a-Lago to retrieve several classified documents. The indictment alleges that the 56-year-old told this IT staffer, quote, the boss wants the server deleted. De Oliveira is facing four counts, including lying to the FBI about helping Walt Nauta, he is the former president's personal aide. He's charged with helping Nauta to move these boxes that had these classified documents. Prosecutors say that the surveillance video shows both of these men moving these boxes around the Mar-a-Lago property after the Justice Department had subpoenaed those documents.
