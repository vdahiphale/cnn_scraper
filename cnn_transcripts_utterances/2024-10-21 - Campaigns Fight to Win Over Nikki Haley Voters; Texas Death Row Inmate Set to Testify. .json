That's why we voted unanimously on our subpoena last week. And so we expect that to happen. It's a valid subpoena. The legislature has a very important role here. And the question is not whether he will appear. The question is how. Mr. Roberson cannot appear virtually. It is impossible for him to do so because of his mental disability. And his attorney has made that very clear on the record. So the question now is whether he will show up today, whether he will show up at another date here at the Texas Capitol, or, if necessary, whether our committee will take a field trip to Huntsville three hours away to interview him in a public hearing there at the prison. We will figure that out here in the coming hours.",

I always have, and I consistently will.But I have been doing this long enough now to know when the system has failed someone. And, in this case, from the initial investigation through the trial through the appellate courts, at every step of the way, the system has failed Mr. Roberson and his daughter Nikki. And so the legislature, like I said, has an important role to ask questions, to seek the truth, to hold accountable those who have done wrong, to fix holes in the system, like I said, to ask tough questions. And that's what we're doing by way of this process. Look, Mr. Roberson is still alive today. He was not executed last week by the state of Texas because our committee stepped up and spoke up and acted. I'm very grateful to have played a role with many other individuals in that effort. But going forward, we have got to make sure that not only does Mr. Roberson receive the fair trial that he's deserved, but that we fix the holes in the system here in Texas to make sure this never, ever happens again. HILL:  As you mentioned, this execution was halted. The reality is, as I understand it, the DA in that county, though, could reschedule it. Are you concerned that will happen?",

Sure, I'm concerned that could happen.Just a few days ago, there were a number of folks including the district attorney in Anderson County, who remained largely silent on his impending execution. Realize this. He was just 20 minutes and 20 steps away from receiving a lethal dose of pentobarbital last week. I mean, he was right outside of the execution chamber. I'm so grateful that the Supreme Court of Texas did the right thing in recognizing the power of the legislature to step in when something like this is happening by responding to our subpoena, allowing us the opportunity to investigate, to ask questions, to meet with Mr. Roberson to judge his credibility. But for their actions, but for the actions of our committee and many other great people who have spoken up and stepped forward, Mr. Roberson would not be alive right now. And so, again, all we're calling for is a new trial, and so all of the facts can come out and justice can be delivered here. That that's our goal. And that's what we're committed to doing as long as it takes.",

      "sentences": "Erica, this event today is really a continuation of something that started last week, also in Pennsylvania, also in the suburbs of Philadelphia, this appeal and this reaching out to moderate and perhaps even more conservative women in these all-important collar counties.Listen, one of the senior campaign advisers to the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania was quoted in recent weeks saying, at least in Bucks County, which is not too far from here, you can't win in Bucks County as a Democrat unless you peel away some Republicans. Here in Chester County, where this event is today, this actually had the highest number of Nikki Haley voters who voted in this past Pennsylvania Republican primary of the collar counties. So those are the people that the Harris campaign is really trying to appeal to and get by this event today. It's going to be a discussion, as you said, with former Congresswoman Liz Cheney. The vice president is already here on campus, on scene here at this little theatrical venue. And, again, to emphasize this particular event here today in this particular spot, because it's indicative of a number of events that we're going to see also in other suburbs of Detroit and Wisconsin later today, Chester County, make no mistake, it's a blue county in Pennsylvania. But it went for Mitt Romney actually back in 2012. It was the only of the Philadelphia suburban collar counties that went for Mitt Romney back in 2012. In fact, it was seen as a big step backwards when, in 2016, former President Trump lost the county in big numbers. It's affluent. It is high-educated. These are the type of voters, again, that the Harris campaign really wants to bring into her camp. And I mentioned that event last week, Erica. It was in Bucks County, again, in this similar vein. The messaging there was, they had 100 Republicans who also came to her event to support her. They had former representative Adam Kinzinger take the stage in support of Vice President Harris. And the way that she's framing her ticket in these events is, this is a unity ticket. This is supposed to be a bipartisan ticket. And she's trying to bring the message across that you can vote for her campaign and that that vote, if you are a moderate Republican, a conservative Republican, that this will be a vote for country over party, just because, in the Harris campaign's view, former President Donald Trump is that much of a risk to the country. So I think that's a preview of what we're going to see today in the next couple of minutes as this event gets under way. I think you can also probably, Erica, expect to hear some of the continuation of the attacks that Vice President Harris levied against former President Donald Trump after he went on, frankly, a vulgar and profane and odd series of comments in the western part of the state back on Saturday. So we will be listening for that as well, Erica.",

Joining me now, Republican strategist Erin Perrine and CNN political commentator and Harris' former director of communications Jamal Simmons. It's good to see both of you. So, my colleague Danny Freeman pointing out wisely just before the break that this is happening in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Chester County had the highest number of Haley voters in these collar counties. The fact that Liz Cheney is going to be here, we know there are some talks for Donald Trump to hopefully get to an event with Nikki Haley. Is there a sense at this point in terms of movable voters who could have more sway, a Liz Cheney or a Nikki Haley? Jamal, what's your sense?",

That feels like an anti-Trump vote more than even it being a pro-Nikki Haley vote at that moment. I did a lot of politics in the South. And people have a saying, it's the stuck pig that squeals. And the fact that Lindsey Graham went \"on Meet the Press\" yesterday and began talking about these Republican voters, the fact that J.D. Vance has gone full throttle against Nikki -- I mean, against Liz Cheney, calling her small and petty and implying she's just bitter and has hatred, like, those are, frankly, not great phrases I have ever used when thinking about women. But they have been doing this. It makes me think that maybe there's something in the data that they're trying to hold back. They see some movement that may occur with these Republican women and they're trying to stop it.",

Will it be someone like a Liz Cheney in Pennsylvania that can help move a few persuadable voters? What, we looked at about 16 percent of the Republican electorate in the Pennsylvania primary, about 158,000 voters who went for Nikki Haley. Those are open voters, but it's so late in the game now that you're seeing that some of these voters, even a hard-core Democrat voting blocs or persuadable voters, are saying, hey, now you're trying to get my attention, you're trying to get me to vote for you. Why now? Why at the very end are you all of a sudden making these overtures to me? Because that will ring hollow. So while there's a persuadable bloc there, it may not be enough to try and move that state, whether it's toward voters who are saying, I'm going to stand behind Nikki and go towards Trump, or those who are going to say, I voted for Nikki, I'm looking at Liz Cheney, and I'm going to go with Kamala Harris.",

And I think each one of these campaigns is scrounging for every vote they can get.I will say, they didn't just start -- the Harris campaign didn't just start talking to Haley voters. They hired somebody very early in the Harris campaign. You got to remember, it's only been around for three months. So, for the Harris campaign, it's a couple of months ago. They hired somebody pretty early to focus on Haley voters and start talking to them. They have been doing targeted communication toward them. Maybe the rest of us aren't seeing it because we're not in the target community. But I think people have been hearing from the Harris campaign. This is something they take very seriously. But this is kind of a coalition that stretches from AOC and Bernie Sanders all the way on the left to kind of Liz Cheney and some other Republicans on the right, Dick Cheney, in particular. And for those of us who've been Democrats for our entire lives, being on the same side as Liz and Dick Cheney tells you something big must be going on, because if you can get Bernie Sanders and Dick Cheney to agree on the same thing, they both agree that Kamala Harris should be president and Donald Trump shouldn't, that's a big deal.",

Yes, they might have hired someone to try and make overtures toward a Nikki Haley voter or Liz Cheney voter. But those voters were not making the moves to show that had been an successful endeavor so far, so all things to say that these -- that Donald Trump has a path through both the Rust Belt, those blue wall states, and the Sun Belt states to get to 270. Kamala has a much harder time in the Sun Belt states. So we will see Trump bounce back and forth, probably a little less of Kamala down there.",
