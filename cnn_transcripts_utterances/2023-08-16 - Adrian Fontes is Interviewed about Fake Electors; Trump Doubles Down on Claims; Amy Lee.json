A state where Biden's margin of victory was even tighter than it was in Georgia. Part of the 98-page indictment reads, quote, \"the enterprise operated in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the state of Georgia, and in other states, including but not limited to Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.\"Now, following his loss, Trump's legal team pressured state lawmakers not to certify the state's results and to audit the election to sew doubt in the voting process. Joining us now is Adrian Fontes. He's the secretary of state in Arizona, would be in charge in the 2024 election. He's also the former Democratic Maricopa County recorder. Thank you very much for your time, sir. I want to start with what people should think the Georgia indictment, what we saw out of the district attorney means for, if anything, what's happening in Arizona as it relates to looking back at the 2020 election efforts. ADRIAN FONTES (D), : Well, first, thanks for having me. And, second, our very capable attorney general, Chris Mace, news has reported already, that they've got an ongoing investigation (INAUDIBLE). Well, they're in the Grand Canyon state. I'm out of state right now. But we are making absolutely certain to cross all the t's and dot all of the i's. That office is going to be very thorough. You may recall that as a candidate a year and a half ago I called for an investigation into some of the folks who were trying to overturn our election in Arizona. I continue stalwart against folks breaking the law when it comes to elections, election administration. And we're going to stay on the path of making sure that the law is followed. That includes -- I'll make sure to note for folks, because I'm a former prosecutor myself, that all criminal defendants are presumed innocent by the law until they're proven guilty. And so, hopefully, justice will prevail in this. And we're looking very carefully at making sure that we are crossing t's and dotting i's in Arizona.",

And so that's why the manual is promulgated.And under Arizona law, the legislature has pulled itself out of this process. They have given me the statutory authority to draft the procedure manual and then the approval goes to the governor and the attorney general. If the legislature wants an active role in this, then they can change the rules that they made. But at this stage of the game, we are moving along very nicely. And the impact versus 2020 is really political as to outcomes. It's not technical as to the administration of the election. And that's the way we hope to keep it in Arizona.",

So, Georgia, which, obviously, Joe Biden won, becoming the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry the state. It's a state that is going significantly further to the left.And we look, you know, in terms of Donald Trump and his sort of popularity amongst the GOP base in Georgia. Look at this, Trump endorsed candidates won this often in 2022 GOP primaries. Nationwide, look at that, 95 percent. But it's just 67 percent in Georgia for Congress and governor.

OK, Republicans who think Trump has committed serious federal crimes. Look at this, this is nationally, 27 percent of Republicans with a college degree believe so, versus just 12 percent amongst those without a college degree. And why is that so important for Georgia? Because let's take a look at the six closest swing states that Joe Biden won back in 2020. Look at this. This is Trump voters with a college degree in those states. Georgia ranks near the top at 35 percent. Significantly more than say Wisconsin, more than Michigan, Nevada. Only Arizona tops it.
