It includes evacuating people from Rafah before the offensive but no word on how that would be done.The decision comes despite warnings from aid agencies that it could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. Surrounded by rubble on Friday, these people took part in Ramadan prayers. There are 1.4 million Palestinians in Rafah. Well, the IDF claims it did not open fire on civilians waiting for aid on Thursday as Gaza officials claimed. The IDF released video that it says shows Palestinian gunmen shooting at civilians waiting for aid. We're not showing it because CNN can't independently verify the video's content location or time. And we do have video from Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital showing the wounded and a warning that the video does include some disturbing images. The hospital says it received more than 60 injured people about an hour after that incident. One witness says the victims were waiting for aid to arrive when they were bombarded with shells. Gaza's health ministry says at least 20 people were killed. More than 150 wounded. Israel's war cabinet is scheduled to meet today. They're planning to discuss guidelines for the negotiating team that will attend next week's ceasefire talks. One Israeli official says they expect very tough negotiations. Hamas says one of its conditions is that all Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza. It's also calling for the release of up to 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Israel says the latest demands are ridiculous and absurd. But U.S. officials say they're cautiously optimistic about the next round of ceasefire talks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have conversations that are happening now as we as we speak here. and I am convinced they'll go on into the coming days. Israel has sent back a negotiating team to pursue this and I think it reflects the sense both of possibility and of urgency to get an agreement, to get a ceasefire, to get the hostages back, to get even more humanitarian assistance in.

They're asking the Israeli government to do more to get their loved ones home. On Friday, they staged a protest outside Israel's war cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv.The protesters are calling on Israel's government to close the deal that could bring the hostages home. People in Gaza are as desperate as ever for humanitarian aid. A few have starved to death. But now 150 tons of much-needed food and water has been delivered by a barge, which docked at a hastily built jetty in Gaza. The supplies were loaded onto 12 trucks to be distributed throughout northern Gaza. The relief was organized by the charity World Central Kitchen and coordinated with the Israeli military which inspected all of it first. The non-profit hopes to send a second aid ship to Gaza soon but is unable to confirm when that will happen. Well, the White House says U.S. President Biden and Ireland's prime minister emphasized their shared view for a two-state solution in the Middle East. The two met Friday at the White House. Later, they both addressed the Friends of Ireland luncheon on Capitol Hill. Mr. Biden urged Congress to pass a bill to help Ukraine, Israel and, in his words, maybe equally important, a humanitarian assistance to Gaza.

It all started with this photo to mark Mother's Day in the U.K. meant to calm fevered speculation over her health but in the end, only made things worse. The image, put out by Kensington Palace, is the first glimpse of Princess Catherine since her last public appearance on Christmas Day. The only problem, it had been edited. By the end of the day, major international news agencies had withdrawn the image, citing manipulation concerns, including the French-based AFP, where Eric Baradat is a photo director.",

What the palace needed then to do was issue a few updates, a little message, perhaps some Kate saying thank you for the lovely get well soon cards, maybe perhaps a photo and a card as we saw as damage limit, which I completely think the car photo on Monday was a set-up, a little bit of damage limitation. Instead, there was nothing, radio silence, which was a complete contrast to what we saw with the king. There was messages from the king, even though he's undergoing cancer treatment. And into that radio silence, into that vacuum rushed all these conspiracy theories. I mean, some of them, I've never seen anything so extreme in terms of what these conspiracy theories were. And it became an international story. And then the photo, well, royals always Photoshop their pictures. Henry VIII, he Photoshopped all his pictures. One of my favorite Henry VIII pictures, portraits, has Henry the VIII aged 40 next to his daughter, who -- he died -- he died when she was 12 but she's in the pictures. He's 55. And I love that picture. (LAUGHTER)",

There've been all kinds of drama.And the drama has just increased and really I think this is crisis time to the royal family. People are saying they can't be trusted. Their photos can't be trusted and we still haven't really heard from Kate. We've heard this, what she said about editing the photo but that was it. And I think it's really worrying. I think they are going to have to come out and do a photo of her (INAUDIBLE) clearly going to very hard times. Surgery is brutal on the body. She's clearly having a tough time.

And that's extremely worrying for Kensington Palace to be compared to the agencies from these countries. So there really is a trust problem here. And I think that people are just so concerned. And what we've seen is Kensington Palace in damage limitation. So we saw William out there doing a little engagement with a youth project in London. And he made a statement, saying, oh, my wife's the arty one. Now that's what -- the fact is. William was silent as well. We didn't see him. He moved from a memorial service for his godfather, the king of Greece. And William and how he -- doing the Diana legacy service on Thursday evening, that's very important as well. So they are going to be in damage limitation. I think they are going to have to think about putting out some kind of extra statement from Kate. And I think a lot of people feel so sorry for Kate. She is clearly going through a lot. It's tough. And I think a lot of people don't believe she edited that photo and she's taking the blame for someone else. (CROSSTALK)",

It could be very profitable. They have a pared down aesthetic, this pared down California aesthetic. I presume that's going to be a look. So it is, I think, something that the royal family probably actually are welcoming at the moment because the heat has been on them. It's not like Charles can go out there and do and engagements. He's still -- he's sheltering for quite some time with cancer treatment. The royal family is having a really, really tough time, just one year after the coronation. It was all wonderful picture, beautiful coronation this time last year. Now it's getting tough.
