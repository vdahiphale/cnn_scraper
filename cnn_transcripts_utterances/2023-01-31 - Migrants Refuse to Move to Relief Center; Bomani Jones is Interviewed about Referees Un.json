      "sentences": "This morning, some newly arrived migrants who have been housed temporarily in a Manhattan hotel are refusing a move to an emergency shelter in Brooklyn and have camped out in front of the hotel. The city says it was making room for families by moving some single men to a communal relief shelter, but those men say the conditions are subpar after this short cellphone video that you see here was shared among them.CNN's Polo Sandoval is live, covering all of this near the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. And, Polo, I know some of the migrants were camped outside The Watson, refusing to move. What is the latest that you're seeing there this morning?",

      "sentences": "They told me yesterday, Kaitlan, that anything is better than getting on a bus and being brought here to this part of Brooklyn that's fairly difficult to access. You know, this is as far as we can actually take you because of the restrictive access. But there are a few messages -- welcoming messages that have been posted by some non-profits here.It is a very complicated situation that these migrants are finding themselves in. But the city saying that really this is - there's a simple -- at least a simple reason why they're doing this. You see they continue to receive a significant number of women with children and families with children. The city saying that they are the ones who have to take priority when it comes to these private quarters, these hotels that the city has basically been renting for months now to provide some housing for these families. But, look, the concerns that I'm hearing from these migrant men is that not only do thy not feel safe in some of these barracks style living facilities, but, at the end of the day, it's also extremely inconvenient for them. You see they believe that the only shot that they have of any potential employment is in Manhattan. So, relocating them out here to a cruise terminal that is not very easy to get to if you don't have reliable transportation, that that places yet another hurdle in their way. So, I heard from many, many migrants, including a 33-year-old man named Nedio Gonzalez (ph), who traveled here from Venezuela with his cousin. He says he'd much rather stay in the city than come here. The numbers continue to rise, though, Kaitlan. Eighty-one emergency shelters that have already been opened five of these so-called HERKS (ph) or these emergency resource centers that are open. But the city saying it's doing the best they can given the unprecedented number of people they continue to have to find housing for.",

Where Mahomes is basically Michael Jordan in cleats. I say that over and over again. I'm not going to stop. Jalen Hurts, what I find so good about his story is, this wasn't a slam dunk situation. And at various points the Eagles had an opportunity to say, no, I think we should go get somebody else. Hey, let's bring somebody else in, see if this guy can do it. Let's get somebody to push Jalen Hurts. And they believed in him. And he doesn't jump off the screen as a superstar like Mahomes or other guys. And normally for a black quarterback to get this far, you have to jump off the screen. Instead, Jalen Hurts exists as like a leader, a guy that people know. Hey, that's the guy we're going to follow. He's going to manage this game whiling also being able to run like the modern quarterback does.

I think it's virtually unprecedented. No administration, Republican or Democrat, that I ever worked for engaged in this kind of diplomacy. And I think it reflects their concern, but it also reflects the reality that I think they want to take the prime minister at his word. He put together this government, which includes two extremistministers. And I think by engaging him directly, they want to make it unmistakably clear that he is responsible for the actions of his government.
