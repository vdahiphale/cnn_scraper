That and a new report, from The New York Times that Israel actually knew the plan, for the Hamas attack, more than a year before it happened. Plus, indicted Congressman George Santos could be out of a job, in just hours from now. And now, he's threatening to take down his own colleagues, if expelled, from the House. And racism, hazing, sexual assaults, what top-ranking military officials have been concealing, from the public, for years, we expose a Coast Guard cover-up right here, tonight. I'm Pamela Brown. And this is THE SOURCE. And good evening to you. Kaitlan is off, tonight. Just three hours from another truce deadline, what could be the end of the pause, in fighting, between Israel and Hamas? Negotiations going down right to the wire, once again, on the seventh day of the truce, as a seventh group of hostages were freed, and are now safely back in Israel. Only eight hostages released in this handover. Israel and Hamas agreed to count the two extra Israeli- Russian hostages, released yesterday, as part of the 10 required in this deal. There are significant questions, about whether this deal can survive another extension. Negotiators initially believed Hamas wouldn't likely be able to offer more women and children, to stretch the pause, beyond an eighth day. And meanwhile, there is a major story, tonight, from The New York Times, also reported by Israeli media that Israeli officials had the battle plan, for the Hamas attack, more than a year before it happened. But the Israelis largely dismissed it as aspirational, considering it too difficult, for Hamas to carry out. I want to start with CNN's Oren Liebermann, who is live, for us, in Tel Aviv, tonight. So Oren, let's start with the truce. It expires in less than three hours from now. What are you hearing, from your sources, in Israel, about what will happen next?",

      "sentences": "Pam, it is just after 4 in the morning here. So, there are three hours until this truce is set to expire, with no announcement from any of the sides here, neither from Israel, nor Hamas, nor from Qatar, which has led the negotiations that there is a deal in place to continue this, for at least another 24 hours.It has been Qatar that has made many of the critical announcements, saying that it will continue that there will be more hostages released. We haven't seen that announcement yet. Now, the IDF has basically said they're ready to continue operations, as soon as the order is given. We expect that order would come shortly after 7 in the morning, unless Hamas announces that they are ready to release 10 more Israeli women and children. But we haven't heard from the political echelon here, about where those negotiations stand. We know they are ongoing. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, was here, and continues to be here, but spoke and said that the need for a continued pause is critical, not only to allow for the release of more hostages, but also for more humanitarian aid to go through. He also said before Israel launches the second phase of its offensive, in Gaza, it needs to have a plan, for both the humanitarian aid, and a plan to reduce civilian casualties, in Gaza. That's been a major concern of the U.S., and frankly, of the international community. Crucially now, we are simply watching the clock. Last night, this went down to the final few minutes, when Hamas produced a list that was acceptable to Israel. As our colleagues have reported, including Alex Marquardt, and MJ Lee, Hamas produced two lists that were unacceptable to Israel. Now, it's unclear if we're in that same back-and-forth, right now. This will very much go down to the wire, Pam. We will absolutely keep an eye on it, to see if this war restarts, in just three hours now. BROWN: Really getting right down to it as before. Thank you so much, Oren. Appreciate it. And I want to go to this New York Times reporting as well that Israel obtained Hamas' attack plan, more than a year ago. It has also been reported in Israeli media. And the Times reports that a veteran analyst warned Hamas conducted a training exercise, similar to what was outlined, in those plans. And so, I want to bring in our Alex Marquardt, here on this, our National Security -- our Chief National Security Correspondent. This New York Times article really lays out all the warning signs, from this pamphlet that the Israeli intelligence officials had received. Would the U.S. intelligence have been aware of this?",

And so, it really raises the question of why they were able to do that, and why the Israeli officials thought that it was so aspirational.

Israel has made clear that they will continue this pause, if Hamas is able to come up with 10 more women and children. The U.S. and Qatar, which are the center of these negotiations, they want to see this pause, continue. But Hamas really does have to release more hostages. Oren referenced the list that had been rejected, by Israel, last night. That's because they didn't include only women and children. They had some dead bodies, of which we believe there could be a significant number that Hamas has. Another list included elderly men. But Israel is saying you have to give us all the women and children. So, there's a lot of focus on what happens, tonight. If they come up with a list of 10 women and children, we'll see this pause extended by another day. But the U.S. definitely wants to expand the conversation, to include some of the men that they have, to include the Israeli soldiers that they have. So, even if tomorrow goes smoothly, and another 10 are released, we're getting into a possibly another chapter, where negotiations will have to start over the next categories. And in the meantime, if those negotiate -- if the releases stall, we could see the military operation, by Israel, start back up again. That could happen if not tonight, then certainly in the coming days.",

Clearly, there was a serious intelligence failure here. But just giving you a sense of the complexity of these issues. I must say also that I'm a little disturbed by this report, not just because of what it says, about the intelligence failure. But it seems to me, already part of the, I don't know, sort of the back-and-forth, that political back-and-forth, about who is going to respond -- who's going to be responsible, for this intelligence failure, whether it's going to be the military or the government.

As we look at these next few hours, we don't know if this truce is going to hold, right? It is right down to the wire. So, that means that Israeli military operations could start back up, right after. The Biden administration has urged Israel to be more surgical, with its military operations, once the truce ends, to limit civilian deaths. So far, the Hamas-controlled Palestinian health ministry says more than 14,000 civilians have died, many of them women and children. Here's what Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said today.

It's actually a boomerang. And a ceasefire means Hamas wins. It means Hamas gets away with mass murder. It means 250,000 Israelis can't go back to their homes, because they've been removed, from those homes. They wouldn't go back if Hamas can reorganize and launch further strikes. And that's precisely what the leaders of Hamas said they're going to do. So, it is not in Israel's strategic interest, to increase the number of Palestinian casualties. Israel will do its utmost, to limit those casualties. But it's going to be difficult, because Hamas is going to continue to hide behind them and use them as shields.

We know that.We know they conflate the number of Palestinian terrorists, who have been killed in that number, as well as the significant number of Palestinians, who have been killed, by Palestinian rockets, that fall short. About 30 percent of their rockets fall short, and fall on Palestinian neighborhoods. We all remember what happened to the Al- Ahli Hospital, several weeks ago. So yes, any casualties, doesn't matter what the number are too -- civilian casualties are too many. And it's in Israel's interest, as I said, morally and strategically to limit that, keeping in mind, we're dealing with a densely populated and densely built-up area. And Hamas is under that area with over 300 miles of tunnels. You imagine what this is like, for a military, to try to remove that threat. At the end of the day, Israel has to remove that threat. We cannot live as a country. And we will have to make some very difficult choices, about the hostages. I don't know how long these truces can go on. We are trying our best to get as many women and children, out of the hands of Hamas. But at the end of the day, let's be clear, Hamas will not give up all the hostages. The hostages are the get-out-of-Gaza-free card, for Hamas. And they know that once they give up the last of those hostages, Israel then could flood those tunnels. It could set those tunnels of fire.

First of all, if every time a country went to war, against an evil enemy? The United States, in World War II, thought it would create more Nazis, by destroying Nazi Germany, then United States would never have gone to war, against Nazi Germany. And every time we've gone to war, in the Middle East, and we've gone to war quite frequently, since our founding, in 1948, yes, we risk creating another generation of terrorists. But we have no option, of course. This is our option we have to live. But the opposite, the positive side of this whole process is that every once in a while, people in the Middle East will internalize that war is not the way. You could get an Anwar Sadat in Egypt. And Egypt made war against us four times, wars of national destruction. Jordan went -- made more twice wars of national destruction. And King Hussein internalized it, this wasn't the way, and we made peace. And we made peace with the signatories of four Arab countries, who were a part of the Abraham Accords. So, it's not true that continued war, always going to create generations that want to wage war. Some generations wake up and say, \"Maybe this is not the way to get a better future for our children and grandchildren.\" And that's the hope here.

Because he had the opportunity, to answer these questions, and put forth information, before the Ethics Committee. He did not do so. And he had the opportunity, to withdraw and step down, as many have asked him. He's not doing so. So, expulsion is the only answer. And look, this is not a matter of the precedent of someone, who has never been -- had not been convicted, being expelled from Congress. Look, this is about there are conduct and standard of behavior, amongst members of Congress. He has not met that. And rational Republicans that I've been speaking with saying he is a disgrace--",

Look, judges have to be very, very careful, when they do impose gag orders, because any person, in Donald Trump's position, absolutely has very broad First Amendment rights. But they're not unlimited. And attacks, on court staff? I'll tell you, from my experience, in courts. That is just out of bounds. You just do not do that.

Top officials, at the agency, spent almost a decade, trying to make sure that you don't see what's in the report that we have now obtained. I'm talking about what's called an almost ironically titled \"Culture of Respect\" study. For eight years, the Coast Guard tried to keep it hidden. But CNN has it.And it reveals some alarming conclusions, based on interviews, with hundreds of Coast Guard employees, including that \"Coast Guard personnel accept poor behavior as status quo.\" \"The Coast Guard does not provide sufficient measures to prevent sexual assault.\" A \"Coast Guard personnel had been discriminated against and sexually harassed.\" And \"CG indicates we will not tolerate discrimination, yet even when found guilty of these offenses... there are no consequences.\" One Coast Guard employee said the attitude is \"Hey, I got through it. So can you.\" And the culture was, boys will be boys. Well, this report was from 2015. But CNN has spoken to dozens of current and former Coast Guard employees, who say the culture, well it hasn't changed. Our investigative team, reporters Blake Ellis, Melanie Hicken, Audrey Ash, and I did our first story, on the culture of cover-up, within the Coast Guard, back about five months ago. And, at the time, we uncovered yet another damning report. That one focused on sexual assault, at the Coast Guard Academy. That report, like this newly-discovered one, was purposely buried, for years. After our story, Congress held hearings. Coast Guard Commandant, Linda Fagan, promised transparency. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA FAGAN, U.S. COAST GUARD COMMANDANT: I'm committed to improving our prevention efforts, prompt and thorough investigations into reports of sexual assaults and harassment, accountability for perpetrators, compassionate support to victims, and full transparency with Congress and the American people.
