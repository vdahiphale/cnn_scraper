It looks like pieces of the balloon infrastructure there, this taking place just off of the coast of South Carolina. Some of that debris has now made it to the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, to be analyzed. They are going to be trying to extract whatever intelligence they can from it.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim and Erica, that recovery effort is well under way. In fact, just a few minutes ago, it appears that the FBI has started to secure an area about 21 miles north of the main debris site. It's an area just to my right. It is where for the past three days the Navy has prepositioned a lot of their equipment, a lot of their boats as well as personnel. In fact, we were here bright and early this morning when more boats were brought out, more personnel came out. A lot of these folks were carrying some equipment with them. They had these oxygen tanks and at least two of those boats made their way toward that debris site.Now, for better part of the day, we are told that crews out a few miles off of the coast of South Carolina, they have been using equipment essentially to try to get a better sense of just how much of this balloon is in some pretty shallow water. They apparently have been able to remove all of the debris that was at the surface of the ocean. However, they are still trying to get a better picture of what is out there. And then the hope is once they are able to do that, then they are going to be able to start the process of removing some of this debris. But just as you guys mentioned, it is our understanding that some of the debris has already been put on a shape and has already made its way to Quantico for the FBI as well as other agencies to get involved, but again, right now, 21 miles north of that main search site, it appears that the FBI is working with the Navy to try to keep this area safe and secure in the event that any of that debris gets brought out to this location.

      "sentences": "Listen, this is a very, very sort of complicated setup that Disney has here for now, anyway, but in this bill, it would essentially give the Florida governor more control over who governs Walt Disney World, and essentially take some of the power away from Disney. It gives the governor the ability to appoint who serves on the board for the special district. That special district is called Reedy Creek Improvement District for now, anyway.And for more than half-a-century, it has allowed Disney to sort of self-govern in those Orlando-area theme parks. It allows them to maintain their own buildings, their own roads, even have their own fire department. On that board right now, land owners with ties, close ties to Disney, this bill would change that, and put that control into the hands of the governor. This bill would also change the name of that special district. Now, the Republicans that I have talked to tell me, look, this is about leveling the playing field, this is about making sure that one company, in this case, one of the largest employers in Florida, does not have any sort of special privileges here. But the critics will remind you quickly of the history here, because this has been sort of a year-long feud of Governor DeSantis and Disney. And if you can remember last year, when Florida decided to strip Disney of that special district, this came at a time when the critics said this is about retaliation, this is about the governor seeking revenge for Disney speaking out against a then-bill that limited how gender identity and sexual orientation was discussed in the classroom. What Disney is saying today, well, we got a statement after this bill was filed yesterday, and in it, the president of Walt Disney World Resort says Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world. And regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year. Again, this was a bill, a very long bill, 189 pages, filed yesterday for the special session. So, we will have to see sort of if any changes or what actually gets through this legislature, but it is a legislature that is controlled by Republicans. So, by all accounts, it is expected to pass.

In just a few hours, Beyonce fans who managed to sign up for pre-sale access to her world tour will have a chance once again to snap up the ticket. So, everybody watching this really intently, because remember T. Swift and Ticketmaster? Boy, was that a mess.So, how are they doing things differently this time around for Beyonce? Joining us is Lance Ulanoff, he's the U.S. editor-in-chief TechRadar. Always good to see you, my friend. So, there was a lot of blowback understandably for how poorly that was managed. We even saw some hearings about what happened. This has been a little bit differently. So, fans who want to go, how to pre- register, they're also rolling this out in a staggered fashion, so not all dates are on sale at the same time. How is it working so far? LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, TECHRADAR:  Much better. I mean, I am hearing stories about people getting through within ten minutes and I think that's -- look, it is the big difference between saying opening the door to a billion people all at once or opening 100 doors scheduled over time, and you just even the best and the most powerful and scaled up system is going to have trouble when you do it all at once. So that's been a big difference, location base has been a big difference. They are really trying with the pre-verification to weed out the bots. You are looking for, before you even get to the point of trying to buy these tickets, any kind of activity that looks like bot-like behavior. And there are all these different -- it is a lot of hoops to jump through because you have to be kind of like verified, like you have to sign up for fan sites. There are multiple of this, the Bey Hive pre- sale site, there's the Citibank pre-sale site, there's the Verizon one. So, you can sign up for any of those. But one of the things that I'm reminding people is, I demand, no guarantee you're going to get this. And even after you have done all of that verification, you still get an access code. Now, the access code is texted to you. That is very important. Because, right away, it is almost like two-factor authentication, coming to the phone that you used to sort of register for everything. So, it starts to put people together with tickets as opposed to a bot, where it becomes harder for a bot to basically act as if it is human.",

You can pay a lot more there, and we know, in other places. We look at some of those prices there.In terms of limiting the resale, though, there has also been talk about shifting when and how you can resell your tickets.",
