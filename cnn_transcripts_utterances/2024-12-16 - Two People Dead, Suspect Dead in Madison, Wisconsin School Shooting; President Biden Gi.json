According to a law enforcement source that this suspect is a female teenager who attended the school but other than that Jake law enforcement was very reluctant to give many more details. What they did say though Jake is that at this moment they are working to obtain search warrants. They also said that the family at this point is cooperating.There are many more questions about how this horrific day unfolded. It started at 10:57 when law enforcement received that terrible call that there was an active shooter. That call coming from someone inside the building reporting an active shooter. Law enforcement saying that that shooter had a handgun on them out when they arrived at the school. Jake, it is not clear exactly how long between that initial call and when law enforcement made that entry but the police chief describing an immediate response when they got there. Jake, they found that the shooter had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Our CNN Josh Campbell is reporting that the handgun on that shooter was a 9- millimeter pistol but there were very few details beyond that surrounding specifically the shooter, Jake. At this point there are many more questions about the school's protocols. This is a private school, so public law enforcement here doesn't have a lot of visibility on the protocols that were in place at the school at the time. For example, the police chief though is saying that there was, to his knowledge, not a school resource officer. But again, the security protocols at a private school would have been out of his purview. So there may be more, certainly more to learn there. Jake, the other main question that we asked today was whether or not the shooter had prior contact with law enforcement. Here's what the police chief said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's a civilian model that's easily available across the United States. Now, here I'm told that a law enforcement source tells us that the ATF is conducting a trace to find out the origin of that firearm. That agency obviously instrumental in these types of crimes to trace the origin of where a particular weapon came from.Here it's critically important because there's a question about the age of the shooter. Let's look at some of the gun laws governing the use and possession by young people of these weapons. A federally licensed dealer cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21 years old. In Wisconsin, through a private sale, someone who is 18 or over would be able to obtain this type of handgun, but it is illegal for a minor to possess a handgun, so someone under the age of 18. The big question here, if it turns out that this is indeed someone who is a minor under 18, there will be a major question about who owned that firearm, how this person got access to it. Jake, we've seen in the past, and sadly in these shootings, that you actually see gun owners, including parents, actually prosecuted whenever their children go on to use these types of firearms in a crime.",

But you go back to when we started keeping these figures back in 2008, there was just double checking something like 18 shootings then. Now again, 83. That's the most that we've recorded in any one year since that time frame.Looking at where these shootings have taken place, you can take a look at some of the characteristics. There have been 83, as I mentioned, 56 within K-12 institutions, 27 on college campuses. We're talking 38 dead, at least 150 people -- 115 that were injured in these school shootings. So as we've constantly reported on with this violence, there's seemingly no place that is immune to this type of gun violence, but of course schools, the data show, can be a violent place and we see those numbers continue to go upward.",

So in this case right here, law enforcement personnel from ATF, as well as our partners can contact the tracing center, provide information from the recovered firearm. They will need to reach out to that federal firearms licensee and find out who in fact did purchase that weapon. Again, leading them to the first person that has officially purchased that gun and then they can start trying to pick up the pieces from there. And that's exactly what law enforcement is doing in this case. They're trying to figure out how this firearm, this weapon system ended up in the hands of someone below the age of 18.",

These are kind of the signs that we teach kids what to look for. And it's usually not just one sign, it's an escalation of signs. While we can mandate for this sort of training to happen in schools across the country and mandate things like anonymous reporting systems to help enable and get early interventions. We can also mandate things like secure storage and ensuring that young people in particular can't access firearms to commit these acts of violence. So the more we can intervene by recognizing the signs and getting help and ensuring that they cannot access in order to fulfill their plans, these are things that we absolutely can do and that we know work that we have so much evidence and proof how these things work.

We need Congress to come together to pass an assault weapons ban. We did a lot of good bipartisan work making gun trafficking illegal, making it a federal crime.

Half of them they can figure out are aircraft or helicopters or drones or balloons, but there's half that they don't have enough data, they don't have enough information or it just isn't something they can figure out.

He spoke from Mar-a-Lago at an event billed to highlight a $100 billion investment in the United States from the Japanese owned SoftBank. It quickly moved on the news conference to cover a wide range of issues. CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach and Kristen Holmes is with me here in studio. And Alayna, Trump presented something of a friendlier tone at moments. What should we make of that? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTERHe really does believe that he, you know, is going to be calling the shots moving forward. And he's emboldened by that, I'm told. Now I thought that line that you just played about him commenting on him being embraced by a lot of these tech leaders, commenting that, you know, in his first term they were all trying to fight him. Now they want to be his friend. It's the same thing I'm hearing about how he feels about the foreign leaders all reaching out to call him. He said he spoke to more than 100 foreign leaders since Election Day. Unclear if that's actually true. But again, he's emboldened by this. What he feels is the world and also many of these companies embracing him, unlike the way that they operated with him his first time around. And what I took as notable as well is that again this was supposed to be this major announcement, him touting alongside the SoftBank CEO this investment of a $100 billion over the next four years with them claiming that it should create 100,000 -- 100,000 jobs. And then Donald Trump kind of used the stage to give somewhat of a campaign speech. He painted this optimistic view of America, but then tried tout all of the things that he wants to talk about, talking about his policies as it comes to the economy, as it comes to energy, and trying really to use this moment and use this platform to, again, paint this, you know, bright future for America. It is very different than a lot of the rhetoric we know Donald Trump used on the campaign trail. But that's again because he has now won the election and he is very much happy with the way that the world is responding to him.",
