Right now, there is no clear leader.And while those numbers are too close to call, 28 percent of likely voters say they feel they need to learn more about Kamala Harris, while only 9 percent say that about Donald Trump.

She's been poring over briefing books with his past comments, with his insults against her. She has also been in conversation with Hillary Clinton and President Biden, who have both debated the former president multiple times. She's also been engaged in these intense mock debate prep sessions with a Trump stand in. Ultimately, her goal here is to not only forcefully take on the former president, but to also convey that it is time to move on from the Trump era of politics. Now, we have seen a bunch of polling recently. I can tell you that the campaign is largely swatting away those polls, arguing that they have always run as the underdog and will continue to do so 50-plus days out from this election.",

But it's certainly an argument that they are trying to make. We have polling that speaks to this. The New York Times says among likely voters that 55 percent view her as more of the same.

Now, there're several pieces of evidence that the police have been able to secure so far, which led them to decide that Joseph Couch was the man that they are looking for.They found his vehicle and importantly, they found a weapon, which they believe was used in the shooting, Kate. It's an AR-15 style rifle. They say they're still processing those items for now, they're still looking for him. But what's making this extremely challenging for them is the terrain in which they're searching. This happened off of the highway on a very wooded area, rugged terrain, not easy to navigate, And when they lose the sunlight there, they have to pull back for safety reasons. So, this community remains on edge. It is Monday morning, schools are closed and people are not going to be able to go about their regular business without feeling like they have to look over their shoulder. In fact, that's part of what the Kentucky State Police said yesterday, asking people to remain vigilant. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, the Republican report, led by the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul, basically focuses in on the fact that they claim that the Biden administration, throughout the course of this withdrawal, was focused on optics over the security of the personnel on the ground. And one of the things that they do in the report is they cite some of the public comments that were made by folks like White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki at the time, which contradicted some of the private conclusions that the administration found in terms of what was actually happening on the ground to make their point that they were trying to knowingly mislead the American people.I want to read you a quote from the report saying, quote, the Biden- Harris administration misled and in some instances directly lied to the American people at every stage of the withdrawal, from before, the go to zero order until today. They also focus in on one character, Zalmay Khalilzad. He was the lead negotiator with the Taliban. We know that he was negotiating a power sharing agreement between the Afghan government and the Taliban. They learned in their interview with him that actually got to the point where it was 70-30 in favor of the Taliban at the end of those conversations. Obviously, that power sharing agreement never came to fruition, Sara, because we saw the Taliban take over Kabul, take over the country. But they have concerns about the conduct of how this was carried out throughout the course of the Biden administration. Now, we should note, of course, that this is being injected into the conversation at a very specific moment when politics are really ramping up. Chairman McCaul was on CBS yesterday, and he claimed that this report has nothing to do with politics, they're not releasing it now because the election is in its final stages. He says that, effectively, it just took them this long to get all the information that they need. But the ranking member on the Democratic side, with their memo out today, focusing in on the changes -- excuse me, the decisions that were made during the Trump administration is saying that they are putting this out at this time because they want to put the feet at the fire of Vice President Harris, even though she's not really mentioned in the report at all as being a critical decision-maker when it came to this withdrawal.
