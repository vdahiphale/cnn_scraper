And what do we see in 2022 in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Well, it turns out that the average poll in those states actually underestimated Democrats by four points. It underestimated democrats by four points.And I want to apply that to the electoral map because of it turns out that the polls underestimate Donald Trump - or underestimated the Democrats, excuse me, like they did in 2022, what happens? Well, Kamala Harris wins a sweep because she wins all these Great Lake battleground states, she wins down in the southeast, and she wins down in the southwest and she gets the 319 electoral votes. The bottom line is this, dear audience and Mr. Berman, I think a lot of folks are sort of counting in that Donald Trump will, in fact, be underestimated by the polls. But when I'm looking at the evidence, I think you got a hold on a second. Maybe that'll happen. Maybe it will happen. But I think that there are folks who are underestimated the idea that maybe Kamala Harris will be underestimated by the polls, at least a week out.",

SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And my own view on this is, look, again, I haven't seen the joke. I - I, you know, maybe - maybe it's a stupid, racist joke, as you said. Maybe it's not. I haven't seen it. I'm not going to comment on the specifics so the joke. But I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.

Madison, I'll start with you, Vance, you heard him there, telling voters they should just brush off the racist joke, stop getting so upset, after the campaign has already tried to distance itself from that particular joke. Is this the closing argument you want the campaign to be making a week until the election? MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 BOARD MEMBER: Well, I think the campaign has to be out there making a closing argument about the issues that voters care about most about the economy, about the border, about, you know, what's going on internationally when we talk about the Middle East, or we talk about the war in Ukraine and Russia. I mean people want to see peace across the world, especially in many of the swing states like Michigan, where they've isolated themselves from the Kamala Harris campaign. A lot of people in the Muslim community not supporting her that may have otherwise. And so, I think there are a lot of issues that President Trump should be piggybacking on right now about his successes from 2017 to 2020, talking about what he was able to do for the American people and what he's going to do in the next four years if elected. I think you're seeing similar concerns coming out of Kamala Harris' super PAC that are putting out statements saying you shouldn't be focusing on this purely negative character attack on Donald Trump. The most effective messaging for Kamala Harris and her campaign is calling contrast messaging, talking about abortion, talking about the economy. And so I think it's a big mistake on her front as well to be continuing to talk about what went on at this rally. Well, obviously, people don't support this. You could see in the room people were appalled by these jokes. It wasn't the venue for it. I don't think it was OK at all. But again, I don't know necessarily if this is going to swing the needle for people who are really concerned about, you know, putting food on the table, for people who are concerned about energy prices, for people who are concerned about the border and what's gone on in their communities as a result.",

And I don't think to just say, oh, it's all, you know, rainbows and butterflies because she's different than Donald Trump is the answer.I mean my husband's black. My family's black. They're supporting Donald Trump because of the economy. They're supporting Donald Trump because of the border. And so, you look across the country and there are many people who feel the same way who were hoping maybe for a contrasting message, for more policy details. The polling continues to reflect that many minorities and specifically swing voters and in swing states want to hear more about her policy proposals, don't feel comfortable with what she's said so far on some of her flip-flops. And I don't think she's provided them with the answer to that. And so, when it comes to next Tuesday, it's going to be down to the margins. It could potentially come down just to Pennsylvania.

They have had it. They have had it with the chaos and with the cruelty and with the insults. They want someone who's going to focus on their future.

The move faced immediate backlash by way of some top reporters resigning according to NPR and at least 200,000 people canceling their subscriptions. Bezos says that politics is not at play in his decision. Here's what he said in part in the op-ed, \"what presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision and it's the right one.\"CNN's Hadas Gold is following all of this, what's been said, what motivated it, and now what's come of it after the fact.

And \"The Washington Post\" giving it a nice splash here in the paper where the headline is called \"The Hard TruthAnd that is essentially Jeff Bezos' argument. He's saying that people have lost trust in the media, they believe the media is biased, and that these types of endorsements only contribute to that perception of bias when they're trying to rebuild the trust. I want to read part of what he says. He says, \"I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning and not some intentional strategy. I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here.\" And that's because of that meeting we saw on Friday between former President Donald Trump and members of the Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space company. And there was a perception that this non-endorsement was coming at the same day of this meeting. There was also a meeting of the editorial board yesterday, led by David Shipley, the opinions editor. And he is saying that he had tried to convince Jeff Bezos to still make this endorsement. He said that Jeff Bezos first expressed doubt back in September with what he called an arched eyebrow. But David Shipley said to the team, I failed in trying to convince him. He did try to convince them until the very last minute. [08:45:01] We also know of at least three members of \"The Post's\" editorial board resigning from the editorial board. That's nearly one-third of the entire editorial board. It's a ten-member editorial board. They are not resigning from their jobs at \"The Washington Post,\" but they are resigning from their position. But you see all three of them. And actually, David Hoffman, right there, he just won a Pulitzer Prize, actually, for editorial writing about how autocrats will try to use digital means to further their power, the dictatorial power. And he told me in an interview yesterday, he said, \"we face a terrible, terrible choice, I believe a looming autocracy. I don't want to be silent about it. I don't want 'The Post' to be silent about it. And the fact that we're not going to endorse is a degree of silence I cannot stand.\" And we're seeing this very swift backlash also from the readers, from the subscribers. The - NPR is reporting that some 200,000 subscribers have canceled their subscriptions. Now, Shipley was asked about this in the meeting by members of the editorial staff. He said he didn't have the numbers. \"The Washington Post,\" though, notably has declined to comment on this. That means they're also not denying that that number of subscribers have canceled. That's significant. You know, a lot of newspapers are struggling right now, and Jeff Bezos is talking about how they need to increase their subscriber numbers and increase that trust.
