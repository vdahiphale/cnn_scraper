This is video yesterday from Las Vegas. Again, you can see flooded roadways. A lot of mud. Cars were trapped on roadways because those roads were underwater at certain points.You still have more rain in the forecast, not just for Las Vegas, but for a lot of these other surrounding areas too. You're talking portions of Utah, even stretching farther north into Oregon and Idaho, looking at the potential for very heavy rain today and possible flooding. The Central U.S., the main story today is going to be that heat. But if you live in the northeast, the mid-Atlantic, that heat is coming your way by the end of the weekend as we start to see a lot of those temperatures begin to expand. Look at Minneapolis, for example, the high today of 95. Tomorrow, topping out at triple digits. Their normal high is only 78 this time of year. Chicago, looking at the next three days, all in the 90s, despite the fact that their normal high is only about 80 degrees. And you're looking at about 100 potential records, not just today, but all the way through Monday. And that's going to be for the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, and areas of the Northeast. And if you're headed to some beaches today, keep in mind, any of these areas you see here shaded in pink have the potential for some rip currents today.

Pizzola is seen in the now infamous video breaking a window at the Capitol as the mob swarmed into the building. Judge Timothy Kelly said from the bench that Pizzola was \"the tip of the spear that allowed people to go into the Capitol.\" Now, Nordean's 18-year sentence is tied for the lengthiest among the January 6th cases. Stuart Rhodes, a leader of the Oath Keepers, another right-wing pro-Trump group, also received 18 years. Judge Kelly reminded both men on Friday that the violence on January 6th broke the U.S. tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. The judge said during Nordean's sentencing, if we don't have a peaceful transfer of power, I don't know what we have. I mean, all the cases so far, Proud Boys members have apologized for their role in the violence and pleaded for leniency, sometimes crying before the judge.

When you have removal the state case is still prosecuted, the state crimes are still prosecuted, but they're prosecuted in a venue federally so that it expands that jury pool beyond that one particular county in Georgia. There's an advantage there.Additionally, as we know, there's no cameras and videos allowed, so the public can't see the vulnerability of some of these people and hear everything in real time like they will in a Georgia state case. There's an advantage to that too to them. They don't want that to happen. But basically, the standard is I was working under the color of my office, in particular Meadows, as the Chief of Staff. And I have to show that I have a colorable defense. It doesn't have to be beyond a reasonable doubt, but that there was a connection of my actions to my office. But the difficulty there, and I think you will ultimately fail, for example, is that how do you say I was offering campaign dollars to Fulton County, or pardon me, to Georgia, to say let's speed up this recount, this signature review process. Well, that's certainly not your role to get involved in those local elections in the state of Georgia, and it's certainly not your role in furtherance of your position to offer campaign money.

Now, the FDA emphasizes it's doing this to help prevent children from picking up smoking since flavors are attractive to them and menthol flavor can make cigarettes more addictive. Nearly half of kids who smoke use menthol cigarettes. And historically, tobacco companies have aggressively targeted black and brown communities by marketing menthol products. So, the hope is for this ban to crack down on that as well. And nationally, we know that cigarette smoking is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death here in the United States.
