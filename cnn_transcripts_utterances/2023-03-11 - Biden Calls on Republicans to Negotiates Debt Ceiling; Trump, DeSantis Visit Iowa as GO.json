And I do know, speaking with many of my former colleagues in Iowa that a lot of them have been put on ice waiting to see what the Florida Governor DeSantis does.I took a really close look at a poll this week from the Des Moines Register, and they are generally pretty spot on looking at the potential GOP field and the favorability have the different candidates. Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have virtually 80 percent of favorable ratings amongst Republicans in Iowa. The key crosstab that I took out of that poll was when GOP voters in Iowa were asked, Would you likely vote for Donald Trump, only 47 percent of them said that they would, which is down 20 percent from two years ago. And what that tells me, Boris, is that people in Iowa Republicans strongly have supported Donald Trump. They know exactly what they're getting with Donald Trump. They know what's in the bag, but they're window shopping. And what we're seeing is Donald Trump's stronghold on the Hawkeye State is absolutely loosening. And what I can really reject my dear friend Maria's characterization of what they're talking about, these Republican candidates are going through Iowa talking about what they can do to help improve the economy, what they can do to make their streets safe, what they can do to improve the education. But we have also heard from former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is talking about a transformational change of younger fresher ideas. And the key that ticket for winning Republican candidate is to look at the policies that Donald Trump espouses, and has supported, but present them in a different tone and tenor that is much more agreeable to voters. And that way you keep his base on board, but you broaden the electorate to include the people that have been disaffected and disenfranchised, quite frankly, due to the tactics of Donald Trump.",

And while the President wants to tax the job creators of this country, ultimately leading to billions of dollars in taxes for people that are creating jobs and expanding businesses in this country, we need to cut spending.

The Gulf Cartel, Scorpion Group, was strongly condemned the events of last Friday.

It's unclear if the five men arrested are the same group of men the cartel said they were going to turn over to Mexican authorities. Now the family of one of the victims who survived the kidnapping reacted to the news. The mother of Latavia Washington at McGee told me they want to see more arrests, quote, \"they need to keep getting them until they get them all.\" The father of one of the victims who died, Shaheed Woodard, said he had not read the letter and that the family was still trying to get their son's body back to South Carolina where the family lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES WOODWARD, SHAHEED WOODWARD'S FATHER: Just been trying to make sense out of it for a whole week. Just restless, can't sleep. Couldn't eat, which is crazy to see your child taken, you know, from and certainly weighed on a battle lay like that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he told us, you know, that he's just so out of options, feel so abandoned, that he had no other route than to take this step to come to us, CNN, to try to get a message to the President, and all those who would be involved in doing whatever it takes to get the last of the Iranian-American hostages prisoners home. And he said that, you know, there's nothing else that he could do. And if he didn't do it this way, he might always regret not, you know, not calling on CNN to make this public. Here's what he told us.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIAMAK NAMAZI, AMERICAN-IRANIAN IMPRISONED IN EVIN PRISON: I think the very fact that I've chosen to take this risk, and appear on CNN from Evin prison, it should just tell you how dire my situation has become. By this point. I've been a hostage for seven and a half years now. That's six times the duration of the hostage crisis. I keep getting told that I'm going to be rescued and deals fall apart where get left abandoned. Honestly, the other hostages and I desperately need President Biden, to finally hear us out, to finally hear our cry for help and bring us home. And I suppose desperate times call for desperate measures. So, this is a desperate measure. Today, I'm in the general ward now. This situation in the general ward is far better than the corner of hell that I used to be in, in a detention center. It's far from a pleasant place to be in, but everything becomes relative. My situation today is very different than the first 27 months of my arrest, when I was still being held at a detention center. There, my situation was really precarious. I did not feel safe at all. And I want to mention that the Obama administration knew exactly, exactly how unsafe I was, I made sure that. At that point, it seemed my captors had made it their mission to strip me of any semblance of human dignity. I spent months caged. I spent months cages and solitary cell that was a size of a closet, sleeping on the floor, being fed like a dog from under the door. And honestly, that was at least my troubles. I, to this day -- I'm sorry, I didn't realize this can happen.",

According to the Cleveland Clinic, daylight savings time has been linked to an increase in car accidents, stroke and heart attacks. The effects can lead to sleep deprivation and sleepiness that can last for several weeks. So joining me now to discuss is Dr. Nancy Foldvary-Schaefer, Director of the Sleep Disorder Center and staff in the Epilepsy Center at the Cleveland Clinic.Doctor, thank you so much for being with us.

But during the course of daylight savings time, we don't sleep as well, we don't sleep as much. And that's because light in the evening will stimulate our brains and will suppress melatonin, which is the sleep hormone that promotes sleep. So this can lead to lots of adverse consequences, including poor reaction time, which is why there may be an increased risk in motor vehicle accidents the Monday after daylight savings time. But it also leads to a chronic misalignment of our circadian rhythms. Our internal clocks are no longer aligned with the external environment. And that's believed to promote inflammation in our bodies. And that can lead to chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, stroke, depression, etc.",

Sometimes reducing light in the environment in the evening is going to help promote sleep. So I would avoid bright lights this evening, get off your electronics a little bit earlier, avoid caffeine after about noon time and avoid alcohol tonight. And then get up tomorrow morning at the same time you would otherwise get up. If you're very sleepy tomorrow, and you need to take a nap, limit that to 15 or 20 minutes so that you don't prevent your brain from being able to fall asleep tomorrow night. And then it's important to be very hyper vigilant about protecting our sleep, which is so critical to brain health and total body health.",
