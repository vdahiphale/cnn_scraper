And the U.S. says their peace plan is nothing more than excuse for Putin to buy time to press on with his war of choice. On Tuesday, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping signed a joint declaration and deepening their partnership. Xi says he built a close relationship with Putin and that relations between Russia and China are crucial to the world order.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Of course, we did not ignore the situation around Ukraine. We believe that many of the points on the peace plan put forward by China are consistent with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis of a peaceful settlement when the West and Kyiv are ready for it.

It was drawn up without any involvement from Ukraine. And it's a plan that's been roundly criticized again and again by the West, including the U.S. and NATO.

They are going on the defensive. They can't conduct any more offensive operations. In the meantime, the Ukrainian forces have marshal their forces, have trained their people, have received new equipment and have conducted an intelligence preparation of the battlefield. In other words, where are they going to attack with a monumental effort.

Sources tells CNN that the ruling from Judge Beryl Howell makes clear for the first time that the Justice Department is arguing that Trump himself may have committed a crime. And Judge Howell believes that prosecutors have met the burden to require Trump's attorney Evan Corcoran to testify to a grand jury, meaning he can't claim attorney client privilege to broadly decline to answer questions from prosecutors. Sources say Howell in her sealed ruling determined the prosecutors were able to show Corcoran's illegal services were used in furtherance of a crime.

President Xi talking about strengthening and deepening the relationship, talking to business terms of, you know, working together from science to agriculture, from manufacturing of cars and airplanes, across pharmaceuticals. So a real idea there to strengthen the economic link President Putin talking about building more roads including a train network, improving border crossing. But he comes in to all of this the weaker partner.He needs this financial support from China and China for President Xi's part can get some good deals here. Historically, he's been able to do that when Putin is weak. Putin needs the economic boost from this because he's facing international sanctions. It will allow him to continue to fight the war in Ukraine. He wants weapons from China. That's what Jen Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general has said, no clues (ph) but he's getting them. But if that was part of the behind-the-scenes discussion, it certainly wasn't made public that that was another narrative that emerged here which wouldn't seem to particularly if you're in Ukraine's shoes or supporters of Ukraine, NATO, the United States, would seem to use inverted logic. The peace plan for Ukraine that President Xi talked about he said upholding the U.N. Charter. President Putin talking about how it's their rights that are being violated, that China and Russia are the one's that are going to uphold the U.N. principles of democracy when from Ukraine's perspective, and many countries' perspective it would seem odd that neither Putin nor Xi mentioned that it was Russia's unprovoked, illegal, massive invasion of Ukraine that started the war. So Putin's and Xi's analysis of how this peace plan could work very well, Putin was saying he agrees with much of what President Xi was putting forward. But in terms of how they frame as upholding the values of the United nations, it really seems to be a peace plan but it's totally one-sided and not something that's going to advance the situation with Ukraine any time in the near future.

But I do want to point out one more thing for small banking because it is an important part for small businesses and communities and they invest obviously differently and know the interest of the community but the FDIC, just to be clear, if you're co-owner of a joint couch, each co-owner or depositor gets up to 250,000.

This is the heart of the Cuban exile community in the United States, a community that's largely anti-Cuban government, a community of people that have had to flee from this island over many, many years.

It was an opportunity for them, this World Baseball Classic semi-final to broadcast their message here in Cuba. The city government blasted the atmosphere at this game saying it was an atmosphere of hate directed at their players and at the government here. But they have celebrated the players upon their return even though they lost, it was their best showing of the Cuban National Team in years. It included some members of the team last year have left Cuba to play abroad and were welcomed to play -- welcomed back to play, we're all with this team. But while what happened afterwards is still something of a mystery because there's one player, Ivan Prieto did not make the flight home. He has not talked at this point. We've asked the city government for comments. So far, they have not but in years past, they have blasted players who leave on official trips like this one saying that they are deserters and traitors and often ban them from returning to this island for years.
