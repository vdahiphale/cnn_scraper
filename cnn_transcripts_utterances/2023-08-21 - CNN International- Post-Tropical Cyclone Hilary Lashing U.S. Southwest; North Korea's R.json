Just ahead, tropical storm Hilary is the first to hit California since 1997 is unleashed record breaking rainfall putting 25 million people under flood warnings will be live on the ground view.Then Russia calls Denmark's pledge to transfer F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, a quote escalation in the conflict. But how much of a game changer will these jets be in battle. And India has some of the worst air pollution in the world but the electric vehicle industry could soon have a wide ranging impact on the country's environment and its economy. Right now post tropical cyclone Hilary is barreling through the U.S. southwest after unleashing catastrophic flooding, and record shattering rainfall in parts of southern California. The City of Palm Springs alone saw half a year's worth of rain in just six hours according to the National Weather Center. Forecasters warned the threat of more destruction isn't over yet. In the coming hours historic amounts of rainfall are expected to cause life threatening flooding, as well as landslides and mudslides in some areas of the Southwest. Flood watches are also an effective day for more than 25 million people from Southern California to Northern Idaho. CNN's Stephanie Elam is tracking the storm east of Los Angeles, in Cathedral City, California, Stephanie.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the storm is winding down across Southern California but the flood threat still exists. That what Stephanie was showing there. It's so true. It's so dangerous mudslides and landslides because they can travel at such great speeds.They pick up everything literally in their past from boulders to trees, sometimes houses, vehicles we saw refrigerator floating down a road in some of our earlier video footage, just incredible amount of force behind it often flowing faster than people can run so to outrun a mud flow nearly virtually impossible. This is the remnants of Hilary it's called a post tropical cyclone, which means it's losing its tropical characteristics. All you need to know is it's produced a lot of rain and impressive rainfall totals. Look at this over a half a foot for many locations. We are approaching 268 millimeters. This is really roughly a 24 to 48 hour period that is a lot of rain in an area that's typically dry this time of year. So it doesn't have the opportunity to absorb that type of precipitation into the soil. And unfortunately we get the mudslides because a lot of that rain falls in the higher elevations comes off the mountains and brings the debris along with it down to the valleys in the communities below. Here's a look at the watches. This extends all the way from Idaho, Oregon all the way to the border of Mexico and the United States. We have flash flood warnings in place. It was just canceled for the Los Angeles area. The good news is as we zoom into the radar here, the rain starting to slowly abate for LAX and the greater surrounding Los Angeles metropolitan area. But the reason we were so concerned about this area is because of the mountain ranges that line in Southern California. When you get that amount of rain and the high elevations we get the potential burn scars adding to the problems here. And all of its, funneled, down to the canyons and allows for that rapid rise in the in the creeks and the river beds at the valleys below. Look at these rainfall totals that have been accumulated here just really impressive. So where do we go from here? Well, this is the radar over the western U.S. you can see precipitation falling from Phoenix to Salt Lake all the way to Billings, Montana. This is a large storm system. It's getting sheared apart, basically rained out. However, we still have another 12 to 24 hours to go adding more misery to the pain. It's already being felt from the leftovers. How, what was trouble storm Hilary, Max?",

Ukraine says heavy fighting continues in the Eastern part of the country and caused a situation particularly difficult near the Northeastern City of Kupiansk. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, addressed the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen earlier and thanked lawmakers after Denmark.And Netherland is announced they will supply Kyiv with F-16 fighter jets. Ukrainian President called the decision historic but Russia warned it will only escalate the conflict. Clare Sebastian is looking at this. We're going to talk a bit later about whether or not this will be a game changer, which is quite worrying hearing from Russia, they see it as an escalation too.",

So it's a little hard to identify any retaliation from the sort of general course of aggression.But certainly, there have been concerns in the West about the F-16 is just how involved the processes of training involving NATO countries, the sort of maintenance and technical elements of this that would strengthen Russia's argument that it is somehow also fighting the West in this war. And that it could lead to some kind of retaliation and that I think, is still there. But obviously we've now crossed this Rubicon, Netherlands and Denmark have both firmly committed now to supplying these planes. And the training is according to the Ukrainian Defense Minister, already underway. But I think this also speaks to the moment in the conflict that we're in that it's very important for President Zelenskyy to get out there to speak to these countries, which are providing aid to try to combat the kind of fatigue that we've seen creeping into some discourse in the West. Take a listen to what he said to the Danish Parliament a few hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All eyes on the Korean peninsula after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un reportedly oversaw naval tests of strategic cruise missiles. This comes as South Korea and the U.S. kick off their annual military drills which Pyongyang denounces as a rehearsal for war.

      "sentences": "Exactly Max, and that's potentially what we saw today. There was no date on when exactly that cruise missile test and launch took place in North Korea. But the fact that they decided to announce it with photos of the North Korean leader the same day that the U.S.-South Korean military drill start may not be a coincidence.There is always often messaging in the timing from North Korea. They are angered by these drills. They have consistently said they think that they are a dress rehearsal for an invasion something that the U.S. and South Korea deny. But those drills have started between the U.S. and South Korea. They'll go on until the end of the month so most experts and officials believe that we could see more of this kind of reaction. In fact, just last week, the Intelligence Agency here in South Korea said that they believed there could be an ICBM launch and intercontinental ballistic missile launch because they have seen movement of vehicles around the missile production facilities and other issues related to an ICBM launch. So that is something they are watching very closely, but it would not be unusual or unexpected for North Korea to carry out something like that. We also heard on Sunday from the South Korean police that there have been attempts to hack some of these military drills back in February we understand from the police. They believe that North Korea was behind it Kim Suki the group that they believe carried out an attempt to target Korean employees of some of the domestic companies involved in these drills. They said they didn't manage to get through no malicious codes were put through though because of a security system. And they said once again, there was an attempt back in July, so just last month at targeting these military exercises. So there is an assumption once again that North Korea is trying to sabotage this. But certainly we have been seeing over years North Korea reacting to these drills. There is no reason to believe why this would be any different now. And as I say the NIS saying there could be a launch this imminent.",

And what can Russia indeed do to escalate short of the background threat of nuclear force, which is constantly something Russian officials float to the surface at certain moments.But isn't part of their response necessarily, to here. I think one of the big takeaways from the war so far has been that even though at the start, perhaps many Western powers thought that the supply of armor, shoulder launched missiles against tanks, all sorts of things, I think that might possibly create them too close to provoking Russia into something graver, that hasn't happened. And they appear to have been able to pump tens of billions of dollars in without any major Russian response towards NATO. We're taught that a technical problem with F-16s, Max, which will be hard for NATO to overcome. They require an awful lot of servicing maintenance. And that's complex in itself. That probably can be done in Ukraine, if you train Ukrainian technicians fast enough. At some point, though, if they're going to have the turnaround and present in the sky, so they need to make a real difference. They may need some sort of Western assistance, technically does that mean the jets go to NATO countries? Do they get service there? Do they get serviced in Ukraine by Western contractors? All questions I'm purely speculating about now. We don't know what the precise policy is. But the fact that these are airborne things does potentially run the risk of Russia feeling that NATO was somehow closer to the combat lines. And they were before if NATO gets more involved in their servicing. That's why there's been such reticence, but it's important to point out Russia is always talking about what it will do in response to escalation but we've seen how little juicy does seem to have militarily here in Ukraine let alone taking on the largest force in military history something like NATO, Max.",
