And some of the families of those service members did speak at the RNC last night and they say that they blame Joe Biden really for the deaths of their loved ones. Something, of course, that President Biden has repeatedly said was not the fault of his own. That, you know, the U.S. was basically forced to withdraw from Afghanistan because of a deal that President Trump had made during his administration with the Taliban. But take a listen to what some of the families said just last night about how devastating they say this has been for them over the last few years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTY SHAMBLIN, MOTHER-IN-LAW OF LATE MARINE CORPS SGT. NICOLE GEE: While Joe Biden has refused to recognize their sacrifice, Donald Trump spent six hours in Bedminster with us. CHERYL JUELS, AUNT OF LATE MARINE CORPS SGT. NICOLE GEE: Joe Biden said the withdrawal from Afghanistan was an extraordinary success. Joe Biden may have forgotten that our children died, but we have not forgotten. Donald Trump has not forgotten.",

It's not a huge spike, but it is there. About 45 states now all showing that the numbers are actually increasing. That's a number of infections overall.The truest sort of measure is really people who are going to the hospital, going to the ER or going to - being admitted to the hospital, and that's gone up in some places as well, primarily in the west and in the south. So, it's something that people are keeping an eye on. But I will say this, this is coming off some of the lowest numbers of Covid in May of this year that we've seen really since the beginning of the pandemic. So, while the numbers are going up, they're starting from a very low baseline. Something to keep an eye on over the next few weeks and months, Sara.",

With us now, David Frum, staff writer for \"The Atlantic,\" former speechwriter for George W. Bush. I just want to ask you about a bit of new reporting from Jeff Zeleny here, who says that Blue Rose Research, it was a Democratic research firm, is sending around research talking about concerns among down- ballot Democrats that say, quote, \"defending Biden's fitness for office is an untenable position for down ballot Democrats.\" What do you think about that? DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, I find the whole political year so strange. 2024, tightest job market since the '90s, maybe since the '60s. Inflation is now subsiding. In fact, we may be heading into disinflation and even price drops. Housing starts, up. Marriages, up. Number of births, up. American troops in combat, zero. It's the safest and most prosperous year America has seen in the fourth year of a president since, I don't know, maybe Ronald Reagan in 1984. Meanwhile, at the Republican Convention, there's an attempt to sell a nostalgia for the Trump administration, who's fourth year was the most disastrous in American history since 1932. And it's a fascinating contrast and puzzle. How can the - one conventions sell nostalgia for when things were terrible, and the other convention cannot sell satisfaction when things are good.",

She was walking on the beach and saw a sign. One of those advertising flyers behind an airplane that said, \"Jill, come back, I am miserable without you.\" And she thought - \"love, Jack.\" And she thought, bad message, Jack. Too much about you, not enough about her.When you are selling a second term, it has to be about you. It has to be about us.
