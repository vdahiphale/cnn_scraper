      "sentences": "The case that can change the course of the election. And nine justices are ironing their robes, as we speak. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"In just a few short hours from now, the Supreme Court of the United States are going to hear arguments in a historic effort, the one to ban former President Trump on the ballot because of his alleged role in the January 6 insurrection. We're all going to be able to listen live tomorrow morning, so let me make it easy for you to follow their conversation tomorrow. You've been hearing a lot about the 14th amendment. It's at the very center of the case before the Supreme Court tomorrow. Now, it has five sections. And of those five, you may only really know Section 1, the one about due process in connection to laws, that one. That is not what we are talking about tonight. It's the other white meat, Section 3. That's what's so important. The so-called insurrectionists ban. Now at its core it says you can't hold office if you've engaged in an insurrection. But if it were that easy, well, frankly, I wouldn't have to explain it to you, would I? And the Supreme Court wouldn't bother taking it up. There are a couple words you have to pay attention to. They're so crucial. And they are exactly the words that brings us here today, brings the court there tomorrow. And that court will dissect these words when trying to understand whether the insurrectionist ban of Section 3 really does apply to Donald Trump. The first word to consider is officer. The big question is the President of the United States an officer of the United States? You may think you know the answer, but the court has to mull over that one as one of three main questions we're going to talk about right here tonight. As for the second big question, is Section 3 self-executing? That's lawyers speak for; can a plaintiff sue to remove someone from the ballot without Congress specifically saying that they can. Which brings me to another word, the third important word, and it's one we've talked about a lot, insurrection. We all saw what happened on January 6th. We watched what happened live. We saw the images. We're still reeling from what we see here today. And that third and final question is this, can former President Trump be disqualified from the ballot for having engaged allegedly in an insurrection? Now, remember, he's never been criminally charged with insurrection, and that political process of an impeachment, it failed to convict him. But there was this speech on January 6th, one before the riot at the Capitol, calling out his own vice president and vowing to, quote, \"fight like hell.\" Will this be enough for the Supreme Court to answer that question?

So, it was directed not just at him, but all the others who were part of the Confederacy. And going back to the original textualists, you have to look at what did they intend when that amendment was passed. You have to freeze frame it almost like a football game.

I want to get to the oath though, because we've seen the spectacle of a president taking the oath. It's called the inauguration, right? We know this very important moment. But there's this question of taking the oath. And Trump said that his oath is to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution rather than support it. That's the argument he's making.Now, the current argument is that defend and support -- well, they are synonymous in many respects, as we all understand them. And so, I mean, I wonder how the conservative members of the court are going to parse through that distinction that will hold on, maybe the oath didn't apply in the same way?",

They mean the same. Those words are synonymous. COATES: So, is the reason for the so-called reach then, because there isn't the leg to stand on, or do you think the Supreme Court, either of you, is going to say, you know what, even though you haven't been criminally charged and convicted of an insurrection or engaging in one, that's enough to disqualify you from the ballot.

But you know, of course, there was also the move by the main secretary of state to remove Donald Trump from the main ballot. And I will note that could potentially have some more ramifications come the general election because even though Colorado leans Democratic in the general election, Maine actually allocates electoral vote to the winner of each of the congressional districts.

States he lost by less than five points are one in 2020. Look at this. We have a slew. We have eight states. We have red states like Texas. A lot of electoral votes there. Really red states like West Virginia. But there's some swing states in there, too, right?

It was like a conservative wish list, but he put them in a position to tell him no, and they've done it. And now it creates an opportunity for him to really put this at their doorstep, the failure of the border, the open border on Republicans. But the question is, is whether or not he can effectively do that alone. He's not yet proven that he can sort of disseminate, promulgate an effective message that penetrates the key audiences.
