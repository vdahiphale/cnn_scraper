They said they were looking at it through the lens of a hate crime but now we see five counts -- five charges of first-degree murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury. Now, amongst the LGBTQ community here in Colorado Springs, they have been saying since early Sunday morning this was a hate crime directed at their community.Now, two law enforcement sources have also told CNN that records show that this 22-year-old suspect purchased these firearms himself. And that is raising questions. Why did it not trigger any red flags because he has had previous run-ins with law enforcement most notably, last summer? He -- his mother called the police to say that this young man was threatening her with a bomb and other weapons. And he was arrested by police here. However, he was never formally charged. Charges were not pursued, so that wouldn't necessarily show up on a background check or a red flag. But you know, officials here in Colorado are saying we need to use this as a learning moment in terms of how we actually use the red flag laws here. Now, as you just heard from that bartender, he was subdued by two people in that club, and he was kicked and punched. So, the suspect is still in the hospital. Charges we're told will be filed once he has been released. And by the way, one of those people who subdued the gunman, he is also in the hospital right now says the police chief and we're waiting for an update on his condition, guys.",

We have a shortage of people to help people out. And we have all this vitriolic language that keeps going on. And there's people here in Colorado that are spewing these kinds of things. And we need to -- we need to put the brakes on these things and get that to stop because we're not hearing the good things. We're hearing all these bad things about the LGBT community, but we're not really doing a very good job of lifting up the people who weren't doing the good work. You know, as Nancy was saying, the work of these organizations in those communities that are doing good work to help the LGBT community. And we need to lift up the positive things.

She seems to be the only witness in that original case. So, that, all they have is he said she said essentially, they didn't see a bomb. There was no -- there was no evidence that he was -- he had bombs.So, the question now is, why didn't a family member come forward if they had knowledge of the purchase of these guns, which we now are reporting he did himself? But family members may have known about it, especially if his -- if his radicalization, his hate towards the LGBTQ community was known to them, and they knew that he had gone. So, look, this is another instance in which red flag laws are often not self-executing that that police either needs specific charges, family members coming forward, a community coming forward, they cannot solve the problem of our common responsibility, which is a hate is spewing as we heard the previous speakers and people from Colorado say, hate is spewing, guns are not hard to come by, especially in Colorado.

That is not unusual, believe me. And so I'm not surprised in the least bit that she's not cooperating in this particular case, as far as red flag laws can only do so much.Laws can only do so much. People have to step up. Somebody knew this guy harbored this kind of hatred and should not be in possession of an assault weapon firearm, what have you and nobody said anything. And so, until we get people to step up and really say, listen, this person is a problem, so then you can really take a serious look at him.

They've also asked for $10 billion in COVID funding. There's also expected to be some action on this Respect for Marriage Act to protect same-sex and interracial marriage. Electoral Count Act reform, that's also a possibility. And the National Defense Authorization Act is also coming up for its annual review, so, a lot to get done over the next few weeks. And the president, he is expected to meet with congressional leaders from both parties from both houses of Congress in the coming weeks. He said he would do so following his foreign trip that he got back from last week. We don't yet have a scheduled date for that but clearly, that will be a top priority as the president tries to get some bills done here before Republicans take over the House, and the president's life and his legislative agenda expect it to get a lot more difficult going forward, Bianna, Victor.",
