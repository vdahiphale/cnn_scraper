We will have the news and perspective from the ground here in Israel, as the nation promises a new phase in its war on Hamas is coming.That phase presumably Military ground operation, as more Israeli troops gather near the border with Gaza. Israeli firepower pounded the Gaza Strip today again from the air. Officials say a Hamas commander who played a key part in last Saturday's attack was killed, while UN officials are warning the evacuation of more than a million people from northern Gaza during a siege would lead to disaster.",

Here, sending both of these carrier strike groups into the region, the USS Gerald R. Ford, which arrived earlier this week, and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which just deployed from Norfolk, Virginia, yesterday, and will arrive in about two weeks, sending them both to the Eastern Med is first a sign of how seriously the Biden administration views the situation, but also a strong message of deterrence not only to Iran, but perhaps more importantly to Iranian proxies in the region, specifically Lebanese Hezbollah, just on Israel's northern border. There have been some call them skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah on that northern border. But, it hasn't escalated beyond that point, and so far at least looks to be contained. But, everyone knows how delicate and volatile that situation can become. So, that's part of the reason of having not only the carriers themselves, but also the destroyers and the cruisers that come with them as a message to Iran, hey, stay out of this one.",

But, even the State Department message didn't say the border will be open at these hours. It only said, if the border opens, it may not be open that long. So, it'll help to be as close to it as possible. And there you can see some of the images of those waiting at the Rafah border crossing.The problem here is you need Egypt, Hamas, and Israel, all to either explicitly or tacitly agree in some way to this. Egypt, so far, according to reports there, hasn't opened the border because it wants Israel to send humanitarian aid in first. And there are also the concerns about how many people will just flow into Sinai. Hamas needs to open its side of the border, and it's unclear under what circumstances that happen, would happen. And then, Israel needs to have some sort of tacit understanding that it won't carry out any strikes in that area, as people are trying to get out of the Gaza Strip. Anderson.",

When you penetrate, you want to penetrate deeply. You want to penetrate quickly. You have to secure your flanks. You know you're going to be shot at. But, when you link up with friendly forces, you then can secure that area, and then you begin the removal of Hamas targets from the south to the north. That's kind of what I would say the primary objective. Clearly, that leaves the southern part of Gaza out of the fight, at least initially, is what I would assume.

And you can see there is a lot of Israeli troops that have been concentrated up on this northern border, close to Lebanon, a short distance from here, close to Syria as well. There has already been some exchanges of fire, mortar attacks from across the Lebanese side, artillery fired in the other direction by the Israelis.It's also been, according to local Israeli forces that were spoken to here, rocket attacks from Syria, and there has also been an Israeli response to that as well. But, none of those attacks or exchanges have in the words of Israeli officials reached the point of an escalation. It's just sort of haven't -- hasn't got to the point yet where we're looking at a sort of broad wide scale attack by forces, for instance of the Hezbollah militia across in Lebanon, on the territory over here in northern Israel.

There is the possibility that they could use drone strikes to carry out attacks in Israel. Drone strikes didn't really exist, to a very great extent or at least to the extent they do now, back in 2006. That's new technology that has transformed the battlefield.Now, Israel has new tech as well. It didn't have an Iron Dome or not much of one to speak of back in 2006. It's got one now. And that facility, those weaponry, those anti-missile systems are really in place here and bolstered and ready for what could be a massive onslaught.

So, maybe a miracle will happen. It would be a real miracle for Jordan if he could manage to lose onlyfour votes on the floor from the Republicans. And there is zero chance of any Democrat voting for Jim Jordan for Speaker. Then, what do they do if it's not Jordan? Well, all kinds of names are being floated. But, as I said, it's hard to see any of them not losing at least four votes. Some of them would lose dozens of votes. Democrats are hoping that somehow a small group of moderate conservative Republicans, I would say mainstream conservatives, I don't think there are many moderate conservatives left in their caucus, if any, they will go to the Democrats and say we're going to make a Hakeem Jeffries as Speaker if you agree to A, B, C, D.

When it happens at the state level, there are plenty of precedents for doing that. In fact, in Alaska right now, both houses of the Alaska legislature are run by a bipartisan coalition. This even happened in Texas a few years back when a few moderate Republicans approached the Democrats, and they managed to overturn the preferences of the majority very conservative Republican Caucus there in Texas, and they got a moderate conservative in as Speaker, and he lasted five terms.
