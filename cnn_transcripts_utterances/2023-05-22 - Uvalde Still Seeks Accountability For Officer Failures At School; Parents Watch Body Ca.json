They have banned parking around the city's main plaza, Robb Elementary School and the healing murals. They say it's being done out of respect for the families who are demanding accountability for the officers who failed to rescue their children during the 77 agonizing minutes the gunman terrorized them inside the school before he was shot and killed. Here was the mayor of Uvalde just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR DON MCLAUGHLIN (R-UVALDE, TX): In a year's time, they still don't have answers to simple questions they should have gotten. I mean, I'm the mayor. I've been one year, I haven't got one briefing from anybody from day one. Not one. Nor has the county judge. It's very frustrating. So, if it's frustrating on us, you can only imagine what it does to them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as you said, when it came time for a plea, he remained silent. He did not enter a plea either way. And his lawyer stood up and said, \"Your Honor, we are standing silent.\" Because of that, the judge had to enter not-guilty pleas for him. I just got off the phone with a university of law professor who told me this is highly unusual. And it could have happened for a number of reasons. The first being that this case is under high scrutiny. There's a lot of attention on this case. And so entering a plea either way would offer a characterization. Obviously if he entered guilty, he would assume guilt there. If he entered not-guilty, then it's possible people could have been outraged that he wasn't taking responsibility for his alleged actions. So by not saying anything, there's no characterization either way. I'm also told that sometimes the parties are negotiating behind closed doors. It's possible that the defense and the prosecution talked about this, if there is some kind of agreement, some kind of plea agreement that could be happening behind closed doors. And lastly, it could just be that he doesn't want to cooperate. So a number of reasons here. But I am told this is highly unusual. Now, with today's not-guilty plea entered on Kohberger's behalf, now the prosecution has 60 days to announce whether they will be pursuing the death penalty. When Kohberger was told that he faces potentially life in prison or the death penalty, he remained emotionless. No visible reaction. His trial date has now been set for October 2nd and it is expected to last at least six weeks -- Brianna?",
