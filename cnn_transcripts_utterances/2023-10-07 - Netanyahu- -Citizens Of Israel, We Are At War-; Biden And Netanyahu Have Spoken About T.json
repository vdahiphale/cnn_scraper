That follows an unprecedented attack into Israel today, where, at least, 70 people are dead, and 985 wounded, and those numbers are expected to rise. The attack called Israel by surprise at sunrise. The Palestinian group, Hamas, launched their offensive by air, sea, and land. Hamas fighters infiltrating Israeli towns and launching more than 3,000 rockets into Israel. Scenes of urban warfare as gunfights unfolded between Israel and Hamas. A short time ago, CNN spoke with an Israeli military spokesman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: When we target someone on their side, we go for a military target. These terrorists that came in this morning, we didn't go only for military targets, they went into communities. They abducted grandmas. They abducted families. They killed children. A very, very severe morning and we're going to respond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Launching its own airstrikes into Gaza, where Palestinians say hundreds have been killed. Israel also is mobilizing its troops and its reservist, calling on 10s of 1000s of them to join up now.

And that there are ongoing hostage situations of civilians in towns in southern Israel, specifically towns like Be'eri and Ofakim. These are ongoing situations. We don't have specific numbers of those prisoners of war or hostages being taken. Hamas has claimed that they have taken what they say are calling a big number of prisoners. They claim, they've also taken senior commanders and saying that they are -- they have started this battle and ready to pay all that is needed. To give you a sense of the scale of what we've been experiencing in the last more than 12 hours now, more than 3,000 rockets have been fired. That number was given to us by the Israeli military a few hours ago. So, it's slightly higher. That's just in less than 12 hours. In 2021, during that 11-day war between Hamas militants and Israel, 4,300 rockets were fired. (CROSSTALK)",

A warning that this video could be disturbing to some videos. And we should note that it was released and edited by Hamas. It shows Hamas fighters yanking two soldiers out of a disabled tank. It's unclear from the video how the tank was disabled. But Hamas has been using drones to drop bombs onto Israeli tanks. You see one of the soldiers being kicked on the ground, and second soldier is seen being led away, while another is on the ground. CNN does not know the current whereabouts or status of the three soldiers. An Israel Defense Forces have not fully commented on the claims that they have captured them.

Clearly from that video, you just played, there were military personnel. We've also seen authenticated video that we're going to bring to our viewers presently of a female civilian or somebody in women in civilian clothes being -- looking rather bloodied, a younger woman being bundled into what appears to be a captured Israeli jeep by Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip. So, this is clearly going to be an extremely difficult problem for the Israeli authorities to deal with. If they've now got a hostage crisis on top of the desire to go into Gaza, and seek revenge and try to break the back of Hamas, it's going to be that much harder. But this is how things have evolved in the earlier part of the day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice over): Palestinian militants celebrate the destruction of an Israeli tank near Gaza. Dragging what appears to be the body of a crewman from the vehicle. Dozens of Gaza-based Palestinian fighters have infiltrated Israel under the cover of a massive rocket bombardment. In what could be the biggest Israeli intelligence failure since Arab nations attacked Israel 50 years ago. Hamas brought war to the streets. It's bullets tearing into a civilian vehicle in Sderot. Locals filmed fighters on rooftops and shooting at police. Here, the aftermath of a gun battle, Israeli civilians lie dead on the street, close by what a reported to be Palestinian militants also dead. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): We are at war. Not on an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens. We have been in this since the early morning hours.

Do we know whether they are hostage inside Israel? Do you know whether they've been taken into Gaza? And this is a huge matter for Israel, which always tries to get its hostages back? How will that unfold? MICHAELI: First of all, the hostages situation is both in Israel and in Gaza. And it's not only soldiers, it's also civilians that have been kidnapped and taken. We are not sure about the numbers yet. And our forces are still combating those terrorists within the communities in Israel. And we're still doing first and foremost, you know, what needs to be done in order to take back our communities, and the control back into our hands.

I mean, that's just, you know, the -- I don't expect you to answer that. President Biden has spoken with your prime minister and condemned what he called the appalling assault against Israel, by Hamas terrorists from Gaza. And many, many, many leaders, all the leaders around the world have condemned this and stand very, very firmly with Israel, and its right to self-defense.

I think that's going to be the most urgent focus of diplomacy. Egypt historically has played a role for example, in mediating that will be one thing to watch, I think, in the coming days.But again, people are definitely evaluating the question of whether this sinks for now, the prospects of the wider regional peace deal that the Biden administration has been involved in intensive negotiations with Saudi Arabia and the Israelis over so that's one immediate question, Mark.",

How much worse is it today than what happened in 2006, which was, you know, the last major time Israel was infiltrated? EHUD OLMERT, FMR. ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Without going into all the details, I mean, so long story, but the outcome of the second Lebanese war in 2006, was 17 years of deterrence, which stopped the Hezbollah from shooting even one bullet across the border to the State of Israel. So obviously, the confrontation in Lebanon was a major success from a strategic point of view. And I think that will happen today is a terrible, terrible event, which will almost inevitably will have serious consequences in terms of the need to fight against the terror from Gaza in a somewhat different way. The truth is that in the last few years, Prime Minister Netanyahu did everything in order to appease and to try and reach out to the Hamas, instead of trying to build up a relationship of trust with the Palestinian Authority, which now I think he's back in a very tragic and painful manner to the Government of Israel.

And some Israeli citizens and Israeli soldiers are being held as hostages and prisoners of war.Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has just spoken with President Joe Biden is the international community braces for a conflict that no one saw coming, at least to this extent. And we're now getting new video that shows Hamas appearing to take Israelis captive. This video has been geo-located by CNN, but we want to warn you that it is disturbing. It's war. This is in Gaza. You can see a barefoot woman pulled from the trunk of a Jeep by a gunman and then forced into the backseat of a car. Her face is bleeding and her wrists appear to be cable tied behind her back. The Jeep is also appearing to have an Israeli Defense Force license plate, suggesting that it might have been stolen and brought into Gaza. Now Palestinians in Gaza are paying the price for Hamas is brutal attack today on Israel. The death toll there is rising, too. The Israeli prime minister has declared war and promises a severe retaliation against Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the background is that we've been under Israeli military occupation for 56 years, Palestinian refugees have been displaced from their homelands in 75 years.We have been suffering all these years. My grandfather, my father, myself, and my daughter never had a day of freedom here, like all Palestinians. And during the last eight months since the beginning of this year, the Israeli army killed 248 Palestinians, including 40 children. We've witnessed terrorist settlers attacks on Palestinian cities, burning cars, burning houses, attacking villages. And we've seen unprecedented level of settlement expansion. And we've seen Netanyahu carrying the map of Israel in the United Nations, which included all of the West Bank, all of Gaza Strip, including also Jerusalem, and the Golan occupied territories, and declared that this is Israel. His government declares that they want to annex the West Bank, that there is no place for Palestinian statehood. And what we've seen is Netanyahu advocating normalization with Arab countries to marginalize and liquidate the Palestinian cause. I think Mr. Olmert has just said that, of course, Palestinians would react to that and would react to the efforts of Israel to marginalize their course. And that's what happened today.",

And Israel continues to grab land. And during the last three months, Israel forced 20 communities to be ethnically cleansed in the area C of the West Bank. So practically this is going on before the attack happened from Gaza.And the big question here is what is the way out of this? The only way out of this situation and of -- and I hope that the word will not continue to say that Israel has the right to attack Gaza aggressively again. This will not solve the problem. Israel already conducted five wars on Gaza. 5,000 people have been killed mostly civilians, this did not change much. The only way to change the situation is to accept us as equal human beings is to end the Israeli occupation. And in the system of apartheid, that everybody says is much worse than the system of apartheid that prevailed in South Africa at one point of time. Equaly is the way.",
