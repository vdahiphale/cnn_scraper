I will put my record against that guy any day of the week. But for Doug's comment that we just talked about, think about this.

In April, \"The New York Times\" reported that 23 Chinese swimmers had tested positive for banned substances and were still allowed to compete in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. And we're just hours now from all of that getting started again here over there in Paris. Let's go to Christine Brennan. She obviously has done a lot of reporting on all of this. And I'm sure the athletes are just thinking about this right now, Christine. They're lining up to dive into the pool and they're wondering, is the athlete next to him or her doping? What can you tell us?",

But it is an issue that has, of course, came up in the spring. This is 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive before the Tokyo Olympics. No one knew about it until the spring, more than three years later, Jim. And 11 of those 23 are going to be here competing in Paris starting on Saturday, including a multiple medalist, Zhang Yufei, the 100 butterflier, a woman, and, as I said, 10 others. And so this will be an issue that is going to carry over right into the pool, as it should, because now we can focus. We now know all these generations of Olympians from other countries, the U.S. and others, that were robbed of medals because of cheating by East Germany and Russia and China. At least now the issue is out in the open and can be discussed, and the swimmers can have some sense of an idea of what is going on in the competition next to them.",

And, yes, these Ukrainian athletes here are concerned about potentially something that could happen. The security here is extraordinary. Perhaps you can hear the police sirens below me. I think the Ukrainians will be fine, but there certainly are threats out there. And it is a very concerning time for those very brave and courageous athletes from Ukraine who are competing here at the Paris Olympics.",
