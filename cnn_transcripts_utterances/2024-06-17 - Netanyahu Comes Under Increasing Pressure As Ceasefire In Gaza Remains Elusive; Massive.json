A lot of the decision-making is now going to move to the security cabinet. And then he's going to be holding smaller forums, as well, when it comes to especially sensitive matters. Just take us through that. PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera):  Well, Zain, what this means is the war cabinet, which was effectively just three men who were the permanent members. You had the Prime Minister, the defense minister, and Benny Gantz, as you say, has resigned because there was no strategy, he said, from Netanyahu, no day-after plan. So, that has been disbanded, but he said that there will still be these small groups that he will, on an ad hoc basis, we understand from an official, be creating when there are certain strategic decisions that have to be taken. There will also be decisions made by the security cabinet. So, there are pains to point out that there's not going to be a void or a vacuum in decision-making. But there are some assessments that what this means is that Netanyahu doesn't have to either accept or reject the request by the far-right ministers to be part of that war cabinet instead of Benny Gantz. That would really pit this war cabinet against what much of the international community wants to see, and of course, the U.S. administration as well, as they don't want decisions on the ground to be made by these more far-right elements within the coalition.

So, talk to us more about the significance, in your view, of the war cabinet being disbanded, because on the one hand, it can be viewed as just a formality that was expected given the departure of Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot. You have others suggesting that the reason that Prime Minister Netanyahu did this was to shield some of the far-right elements and extremists in his cabinet there from having any say in these really sensitive negotiations about the war.

Netanyahu's decision, which, you know, was made, I think,already when Benny Gantz left the government more than a week ago and was just announced today, is not really significant at all, meaning it was clear that this is where things are going when Benny Gantz left the government. The war cabinet was formed only as part of the coalition agreement with Gantz. This was his main condition. When he's out of this government, there's no point of continuing this thing. But, you know, in the matter of, you know, reality, Netanyahu never looked at the security cabinet as the forum to really make big decisions. It was more like a rubber stamp for decisions that he took on his own or as part of the war cabinet. And I think this is going to continue. He's going to hold, you know, small consultations with, you know, his close advisors and then just bring things to the security cabinet to be the rubber stamp.

Fifty to even 60-mile per hour winds, and that's what really limited those firefighters over the weekend from making some more advances in the containment. The hope is that over the next few days, those winds will start to come down. Now, today, still looking like 40 to 50 mile per hour winds in the forecast, so it is still going to remain difficult. But once we get to, say, late Tuesday and into Wednesday, notice those winds really do start to come back down, and that will certainly help the firefighters there begin to really make some big improvements on those containment numbers and really start to bring that fire down. Now, another thing to note is it's not just California that's dealing with the fire risk, but also areas of New Mexico, Arizona, even up into Utah, all of these areas looking at those gusty winds, warm temperatures and very low humidities. Heat is going to be the big story really for a giant chunk of the country. Over 80 percent of the U.S. population is expecting temperatures 90 degrees or even higher, and for some of these areas, it's so high we're going to be nearing records. We're talking about almost 200 potential high temperature records that are expected to be set as we go through the rest of the week. Now, the bulk of those are going to be in the northeast and the midwest, but you'll notice we even have a few dots in the southeast and out to the west, so a lot of areas are really expected to be impacted by this heat, but it's portions of the northeast and the midwest that are under a lot of these heat alerts because it's the prolonged nature. Cleveland, for example, looking at least a five-day stretch of 90 degree temperatures. Caribou, forecast of 99 on Wednesday -- that may break their all-time record high of 96. So, a lot of these areas looking at extreme temperatures. And ladies, the other thing to note, some of these areas may not even peak until Wednesday or Thursday of this week.",

I think it tells us a couple of things. First of all, that the Biden campaign has a lot of money and has decided to make this potentially a referendum on Trump's character rather than Biden's tenure in the White House. It doesn't seem to be making a lot of progress on economic arguments, for example. And the other thing is that this is a very, very close race. And we're only now, you know, within five months of the election. It's not really shifting.

Yeah, and I think that is a symptom of a country that is deeply divided and of the work that Trump has done since leaving office to poison the views of many people against the last election, against the legal system that's been pursuing him. So, we'll have this debate at the end of June. As you say, it's at least several months earlier than we're normally used to seeing debates. Campaigns tend to go a little bit quiet in the summer. Two interesting things here, as well. That would give the President a chance to perhaps cement a successful debate if he comes out and is seen as winning that debate. But it would also give him a chance before a second debate in September to try and regroup for one last assault on Trump. And we should also remember that in September, people start voting, early voting, mail voting in some states. So, although the election is at the beginning of November, the whole calendar has now been pushed forward in American politics. So, having a debate in the end of October, as traditionally has been the case, may not influence the campaign that much.

I think, I mean, Bianna and I were talking about this in the commercial break, just how terrifying it is as mothers when you think about just how addictive social media apps are. We're talking about an average daily use for kids of about five hours a day. Like buttons, the infinite scrolling, just so many aspects of it being, I mean, autoplay obviously being so addictive. From your perspective, how much would a warning label realistically change behavior, do you think? JASON FROST, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, WIRED HUMAN:  I think it would make a huge difference. It sets a precedent. And just like cigarettes, when you go to buy a pack of cigarettes, which does have barriers, you see what kind of consequences you're facing when you're using these products. And let's just take a quick step back from social media as a whole, that these products are massively dangerous because of the scalability of them and how they have the ability to reach into every single American home and to the global homes of our society and bypass the role of parenting quite often. And so, it is critically important that parents realize what their kids are actually engaging with and that the Surgeon General is speaking the truth when he's saying that they need to be informed of the very real dangers that these products have.",

They're witnessing it within their own homes. And as somebody who runs a youth coalition that meets around the nation with leaders and tech industry leaders and policymakers with youth to talk about these issues, I often have parents coming to me, sharing with me in private the hidden journeys they're going through and the shame they feel about those journeys of the exploitation that they're facing and that feeling of failure as a parent. But I think what they would be shocked is that so many parents, if not all, are facing those very same challenges in their households. So, the first thing we need to do is remove shame from the issue that parents feel and recognize the war they're all battling is very real. And let's just take a step back for a second. When our kids get online, they are not seen by the tech industry as actual human beings. And what I mean by that is any time we look throughout history and we see radical injustices that have happened to minority groups, and I'm talking about children in this moment. They don't have a voice. They don't get to vote. They don't usually get the platform to speak. Once you take away that piece of humanity from them, you look out throughout history and you see leaders and nations do horrible things to minority groups. And looking at youth today, when Vivek Murthy says at the end of his article that he wrote or that he had published in \"The New York Times\", that you put the thermometer into society to see how healthy we're doing, and kids are crying, they're dying, they're suffering massively under the burden of social media. And it's time for us to stand up as a community together as parents, as schools, and say, you know what, we're going to do this better, and we're going to hold these people accountable. And they are not ones and zeros on this platform. They are human beings. They are the future of our countries and our nations.",

And the tech industry, they are the innovators. They have the ability to make changes right now to protect kids. But the reason they don't is exactly what you just mentioned, is that it is a highly profitable business model. In the U.S. alone, they're making around $11 billion a year on school-aged children. And they have no incentive at this point to implement any safety features. And again, to reference the article that Surgeon General Vivek Murthy put out, and he said that look at all these other industries, like that they ground an entire line of airplanes because of a door issue. The auto industry used to be massively dangerous. I mean, I remember writing about this in our book, that we've improved since the 1920s, 96 percent in safety. But if we were going to look at the 1920s and say we just carried on as it was then, there would be about a million deaths a year in the U.S. But we've made those changes. We've held businesses accountable to doing better. So, we need to really focus in also on the legislative end, like with the Kids Online Safety Act, that really requires businesses to put kids and people before pixels and make those that use the products their priority, not their profits at the end of the day.

And we're seeing deaths, suicide, eating disorders, and all these massive, massive consequences of their actions. And yes, if they had to open up the book or pop the hood, per se, on what they were doing with A.I. and algorithms that analyze billions and billions of data points, and in microseconds are able to collect that data and then suggest content just to keep those youth and kids hooked a little longer at the sake of their health and even their lives, I could only imagine we would have a revolution of change in the tech industry if people actually knew and were fully aware of how dark it is in the way that they are treating our youth online.",

We've been invited to the White House to talk about these issues. When the truth is set free, man, it defends itself.
