Look, you can see Adam Laxalt had a very narrow lead over Catherine Cortez Masto, a lead of about almost 16,000 votes. In Nevada, the rules are if ballots are postmarked by Election Day, they can actually arrive until Saturday, and they will be counted. So we estimate -- and we don't know for sure because more votes could still arrive, we estimate there could be anywhere from 110, 000 to 135,000 votes still to count. And that includes in a couple of the very large counties, including Clark County here, which is 75 percent of the state. You can see Catherine Cortez Masto actually was the lead, she's the incumbent by the way, over Adam Laxalt here. There's about maybe 80,000 mail votes and drop box votes still to be counted there.And in Washoe County, which is kind of a swing County, we think there may be 20,000 mail votes to be counted but there could be more, and more still could come in. And we're starting to see reports of some of the more rural, very red counties mail votes also. It's key to find out what this vote looks like. We'll learn more over the next several hours. We'll get a report tonight. They'll keep on counting these. We'll get a report tonight when those come in, what the breakdown of the votes are there. Last night, there were some counts from Clark and Washoe County in those skewed heavily Democratic, and Catherine Cortez Masto was able to close the margin for about a 23,000 vote lead down to 15,000, guys.",

That's a big number right there even in multicolor as you go across. In Arizona, ballots need to arrive by Election Day or they can be dropped off by Election Day. It's mostly a mail-voting state. And these counties have just a lot of votes to process.They have a long time to do it. They have several weeks to do this now. And that's just the way they get it done in this state. There are some 400,000 votes still counting in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state. You can see Mark Kelly, the incumbent Democrat with a lead of about eight points there. We know from two years ago -- and I should note that overall he's got a 95,000 vote lead there. We know from two years ago, Joe Biden won Arizona but was by like 10,000 -- 11,000 votes. Donald Trump the margin between the two candidates kept on closing as they counted more votes there. Typically in most states, mail seems to favor Democrats. In Arizona, the late-arriving mail ballots, the last election skewed more toward the Republicans so we just don't know who will favor -- it could be enough to give Blake Masters a runway to overtake Mark Kelly. We'll have to wait and see. A sort of the polar opposite, as in Nevada where there could be the runway for Catherine Cortez Masto to overtake Adam Laxalt. We're going to have to wait and see, guys.",

We're told that those 290,000 haven't begun to be counted yet. That's next in the queue.Now, that's Maricopa County, we're talking about the most populated county here in the state of Arizona.

Where I'm here now in the processing center, this was fully staffed with a lot of people, a lot of volunteers, a lot of election workers. One thing I want to point out that we've been seeing all day is what's called this adjudication process.

I mean, it is -- there's never a good time to carry a credit card balance but this is arguably the worst time. Experts are saying now is a good time to -- if you have a credit card balance to consider transferring that to a zero-interest credit card or to take out a low-interest personal loan to try to pay some of that debt off.Mortgage rates we know continue to go up sharply above 7 percent for the first time in 20 years. This has just been a dramatic move. And this means that you can afford less home. Let me show you what I mean. If you looked at a $500,000 house a year ago at sub 3 percent mortgage rates, you are now paying $1,000 more per month than you would have a year ago all because mortgage rates have gone up.

There's a lot of criticism of the Democratic Party leading up to the midterm elections. They weren't focused on the economy, enough, but they passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs.You had about 19 speeches and events from the president since October 1 until the Election Day talking about the economy. He understands that people are struggling, and he is trying to address it as much as possible. The other thing that I think that has been helpful is that days leading up to the election, you saw President Obama on the campaign trail really making that case for Democrats about who do you trust with the economy, who do you trust on issues of crime, these are experienced candidates.

He understands that there -- he's likely working with a divided Congress. And he is a master of the Senate. He understands the way that Congress works. And so, I think that you will see President Biden a bit more hands-on trying to figure out how to negotiate deals.But then you also have the Democratic base, who is going to come out and various constituencies are going to come out and say, Democrats, you owe us. We delivered on Latino voters. We delivered on black voters. Where is the DREAM Act? Where is the Voting Rights Act? Where are all of these issues that you promised us in the last presidential election and heading into 2024? You still need to deliver on. So I think it's a very tough position for the White House. But I do think that you will see a president try to find common ground with Republicans on it -- on issues, you know, like that you mentioned before because he understands the importance of bipartisanship.",
