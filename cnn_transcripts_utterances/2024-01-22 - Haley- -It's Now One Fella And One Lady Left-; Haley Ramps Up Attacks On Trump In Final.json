That's how Nikki Haley describes being the only candidate left standing between Donald Trump and the Republican nomination. With just one day left to reach voters here in New Hampshire before the primary that could jumpstart her campaign or effectively end it.Plus, abortion on the ballot. Kamala Harris is hitting the trail today saying just that, using the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade to remind voters of what Trump helped take away and how voters' choices in November could impact the future of abortion rights in America. And Judge Judy's 2024 verdict. She's putting her support behind Nikki Haley and weighing in on the former president's multiple legal battles. I sat down with her here in New Hampshire, you're going to see that coming up. I'm Dana Bash, live from New Hampshire. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. And we start right here of the political universe where we are just hours away from the first voters heading to the polls. Ron DeSantis ended his much-ballyhooed campaign that went from juggernaut to afterthought in a stunning leech along with that announcement yesterday. He also became the latest former rival to endorse Donald Trump. Nikki Haley is down by double digits in the latest CNN poll. She'll need to do better than that to prove she still has a place in this race. Meanwhile, the former president is hoping for a commanding win here in the Granite State could wrap things up for him. We have a team of reporters on the ground here in New Hampshire. And I want to start with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is live in Amherst following the Trump campaign. We'll get to Kylie Atwood with the Haley campaign in Concord in a moment. Actually, I'm going to start with you, Kylie. Go ahead.",

This is her first full day on the campaign trail in New Hampshire as it's turned into that one-on -one race between her and former President Trump. New Hampshire is obviously fertile ground for Nikki Haley, particularly because independence can partake in that primary tomorrow.So, the question is to be competitive with the former president. Now with Ron DeSantis like she could get some of the supporters from folks who are planning to vote for DeSantis. Of course, there are questions about how assured that would actually be given that DeSantis has already endorsed Trump, and Haley for her part is already making her pitch to voters here in the Granite State. She is of course, reminding them that she is the next generational leader. We've seen her in recent days also ramped up her attacks on former President Trump, going after his mental fitness specifically. And just earlier this morning, she has done this time and time again, she's defending herself against the attack ads that Trump is putting on TV here in New Hampshire. Listen to what she said? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Every single thing that Donald Trump has said or put on TV has been a lie. He says I want to cut Social Security and raise the retirement age. I never once said that, not once. If anything, we're going to make it solvent so that no one lives in fear. He said that I don't want to have a border wall. I never said that. I said you can't just do a border wall. You got to do all these other things that are going to stop what's happening at the border.

A judge actually -- adjourned court because a juror was sick and then it seemed to be a back and forth between Donald from layer and the judge. Essentially judge saying they could still go through with this. But instead, the Trump's lawyer saying no, we would like for it to be adjourned.Now, of course, as you said, that's his favorite campaign stop, but he has another campaign stop tonight at 9 pm in Laconia. He'll be giving a speech and I have just learned from a senior advisor. He's going to be joined by Senator Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy, as well as Governor Doug Burgum. As we talk about Ron DeSantis dropping out of the race. There's this question of Trump in terms of votes? Well, they don't really think it's going to move the needle that much because Ron DeSantis didn't have a ground game here in New Hampshire. They always view this race as a one-on-one race with Nikki Haley. Now, with this endorsement, it's given Donald Trump and his team the opportunity to essentially say that Nikki Haley should drop out because the Republican Party is coming together around Donald Trump. And this is an example of that bringing together people who are formally his opponents now are people who have endorsed him and saying, look, all of these people who I attacked, who we went -- up against, now they're backing me. It is time for the Republican Party to come together, put all this nonsense away and make me the nominee. Obviously, as you heard Kylie say they're, you know, Haley's team saying this is a marathon, not a race. But when I talked to Trump's advisors, they really do believe that this right now is a race. If they can do well, if they can win those double digits, then they believe they've got this wrapped up. But if not, they don't know what I bought, and of course, South Carolina, but they do want him.",

Kristen, thank you so much for that. And I spoke with Nikki Haley just moments after Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race. I asked her about her strategy to love Joe Biden and Donald Trump together.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'd like to take time to congratulate Ron DeSantis. He ran a really good campaign. I will tell you it's not easy.

I guess we probably will have a fight through South Carolina, at least. But I think the margins here do matter very much in terms of, you know, how close can she get?And in terms of DeSantis, I mean, the reason that he endorsed Trump is because he wants a future in the party, right? I mean, if he didn't, that's kind of a dead end, particularly somewhere like Florida where the president is -- the former president is quite popular.",

And I think the donor wants an important point too, because unlike DeSantis, she's not more reliant on those small dollar donors. She has a backing up of Americans for prosperity to kind of get her there. But there's also the looming complication that South Carolina could be an embarrassing place for her too.There's the recognition of that as a home state, but that's a state that's conservative base has really shifted to become more Trump like over the last 10 years. I mean, I think the Trump campaign will take a one-on-one matchup with Nikki Haley and when we get to South Carolina, but I think if she comes in single digits or close to 10 percent here. There will be an incentive to keep going because remember, the challengers here are also thinking about Donald Trump's legal complications. Also, there is a somewhat of a feeling that maybe if he is convicted or in federal court for most of the time, then that -- there should be a person kind of waiting in the wings and alternative. The problem is the voters haven't one of that part of the reason he has been able to ascend is because they've rallied around him and particularly because of those legal cases. So, it gives them a candidate like Haley and incentive to stay in longer closer to the convention. But I do think the pressure from the party, think of someone like South Carolina's Nancy Mesa endorsing Trump today, the pressure of the party rallying around him will become more and more intense and really isolate her if that margin is big in New Hampshire.",

He's only now mentioning it.The Nancy Pelosi thing was the latest example. But it's been half does not seem to have the same fastball he had. Does it matter his voters? Probably not. But to other voters going ahead. It might. So, I'm not sure in the final days now, it's the -- she's making the argument. Not sure she'll change many minds. But I think one thing is striking to what Astead was saying earlier. She's long talked about South Carolina being a feather in our cap, that is one of the, you know, sort of pluses she has. It may actually be a minus. If she didn't have a home state embarrassment factor to worry about, would she stay in longer? Is this something that's actually going to make her get out first? We will see what the margin is. And here is what Jackie was saying -- the donors are saying, but she is the last best person standing. It's a delicate race. She'll get some delegates and going into super Tuesday is actually a decent date for her because a lot of the primaries almost a dozen are open. Independents can vote. So, they're hoping for a tight margin. A win here would obviously change the conversation, but not necessarily expecting that. They're just hoping for a tight margin.",

And that's the reason he is kind of saying it at these types of rallies.But I also think it meshes with the overall picture of presidential power. He's trying to paint for 2025. This is someone who has been working with kind of lawyers and conservative thinkers to think about how they will get around Congress in a second term to think about how he would kind of make his policy positions come to fruition without going through traditional legislative measures. How to weaponize the DOJ. How to weaponize the courts. This is part of the explicit promise of what Trump is telling voters.
