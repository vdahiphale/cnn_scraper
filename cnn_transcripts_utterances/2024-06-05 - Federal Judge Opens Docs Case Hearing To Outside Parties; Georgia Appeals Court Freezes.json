Amanda Knox was wrongfully convicted in 2007 for the murder of her roommate, but today was found guilty of slander for pinning the crime on her former boss. Knox had spent four years in prison for the murder, wrongly, before her conviction was overturned. The slander charge, though, remained. Today, she was sentenced to three years in prison for that crime, but she will not be going back to serve any of it because of the four years she already served.Thanks so much to all of you for being with us.

Two of his three remaining trials get pushed back further, one indefinitely.Also tonight, why Trump's about to lose the privilege of carrying the guns he's had a permit to carry for years. And later, marking 80 years since the D-Day invasion with some of the last surviving veterans of the operation that turned the tide of World War II. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. And how different tonight is from just a few days ago, when a New York jury convicted the former president on 34 felony counts. Six days later, other than all charges being dropped, it's hard to imagine a day going any better for a criminal defendant than this day went for Donald Trump. First, Aileen Cannon, the judge overseeing his classified documents trial in Florida, today revamped the timetable, pushing a number of pretrial hearings later. She did this less than a day after announcing a June 21st hearing on a defense request to declare Special Counsel Jack Smith's appointment illegitimate. A hearing to which people who are not party to the case are invited to take part. Then, in Georgia, the other shoe dropped. A state appeals court put Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' case against the former president on hold indefinitely. Meanwhile, the president - the former president is talking retribution. Here he is last evening on Newsmax floating the idea of using the criminal justice system if re-elected against his opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it also raises questions about whether a trial will happen at all. Now, typically what happens when the appeals court in Georgia takes up an issue is that the proceedings in the lower trial court are automatically stayed put on pause. But this case was a little bit different, a little bit odd and that the judge at the trial court level, Scott McAfee, allowed the proceedings to continue even if the appeals court took it up. So that's why we saw today the appeals court officially pausing all proceedings in Scott McAfee's courtroom until the disqualification matter is resolved. And look, that means we have several more months ahead of us of relitigating those allegations about Fani Willis' personal life, about whether she financially benefited from a romantic relationship with her top prosecutor instead of preparing for a trial of Donald Trump and his fellow co-defendants in Georgia.

The District Attorney's Office declining to comment as they sort of weigh their options.

A lady who taught me Sunday school when I was a kid lambasted me after I criticized Trump after Access Hollywood, and the reason she gave is look at his vice presidential candidate, he is such a Godly man.So it helped some people to work through the question of, am I really voting for Donald Trump? I don't think any of those people would have voted for Hillary Clinton, but it helped them along. And the second thing was that Mike Pence understood and knew the evangelical world. He knew how to communicate with evangelical leaders and how to sell the administration's agenda to them. I don't think that'll Trump needs that anymore. I think instead, he goes directly to his base.
