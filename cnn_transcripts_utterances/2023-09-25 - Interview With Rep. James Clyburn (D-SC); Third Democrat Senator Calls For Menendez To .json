We are Keeping Them Honest. Also tonight, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez on whether anyone actually buys his new explanation for all that alleged bribe money found in his home, as two more fellow Democrats in the Senate want him gone. And later, the young poet whose words of hope electrified President Biden's inauguration, Amanda Gorman and her warning now about silencing writers and banning books. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight Keeping Them Honest with Kevin McCarthy, who by title at least is the most powerful Republican in Washington, not to mention the Speaker of the House, second in line after Vice President Harris to the presidency. It is certainly a lofty role and a lofty title and today, when asked about what it takes, including working with Democrats to pass legislation to prevent a government shutdown now six days away, Speaker McCarthy had a lofty answer.

It's increasingly concerning and alarming for officials, not only in Colombia, where some of this video is starting, and you can then see them continuing through the jungle, which is and of itself very dangerous.But also officials in the U.S. who are watching this and knowing that those individuals are headed north. Ultimately, the vast majority want to get into the U.S. Now, the jungle portion of itself is incredibly dangerous. I mean, not only are the terrain elements of themselves treacherous, but people are getting robbed, they're getting assaulted, and some of them have even described seeing others lose their lives right in front of them. I caught up with some folks who are just a few days on the other side of having crossed through that have now made their way where we are in southern Mexico. Here's how they describe it.

So this is just over the border from Guatemala.You can see here what are hundreds of folks, and we've actually even got another camera, too, to give you a better sense of the crowd. Hundreds of folks that have been lined up throughout the past hours, days, some of them even weeks. And even if we continue over here, you can see it goes much farther back, a couple of blocks back. And they're settling in for the night because they've lined up here, the offices that are processing some of their asylum claims for Mexico, because that's part of the rules to get to the U.S. They have to claim asylum in a third country. So they're choosing Mexico, or some of them are just trying to get transit documents. And so, they're waiting out until they get their appointments to meet with Mexican officials.

More than 40 percent of all book bans, according to the PEN report, occurred in Florida school districts.And that state's governor, presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, as you know, championed a law in Florida that requires approval of books in school libraries. Now, a separate report by the American Library Association says that almost half of book challenges occurring through August have occurred in public libraries. Last week, more than 175 writers and actors and entertainers and others signed a letter warning how these bands are, quote, \"antithetical to free speech and expression\", how they'll have a, quote, \"chilling effect on the broader creative field\". My next guest signed that letter, Amanda Gorman. She's a poet and author who famously read one of her poems at President Biden's inauguration.

It's about another once wealthy and powerful American family, the Astors. The name Astor became synonymous with wealth and elegance and glamour. But as we write about in the book, which is just out now, the story behind the Astor fortune is a complex tale of ruthlessness, ambition and greed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER (voice-over): When you hear the name Astor, you might think of elegant balls and high society and gilded age palaces like this. But the story of how the Astors made their fortune and held onto it for so long is not a glamorous one at all. John Jacob Astor, a young immigrant from Germany, became America's first multimillionaire by monopolizing the trade of beaver and other animal furs in the late 1700 and early 1800s. KATHERINE HOWE, CO-AUTHOR, \"ASTOR\": He started buying up all the furs that he could and then he started voyaging up into the wilderness in upstate New York and into parts of Canada, where he picked up indigenous languages and very quickly started to amass his fortune. COOPER (voice-over): Astor amassed that fortune ruthlessly using alcohol with indigenous people to get the better of them in trades and often sending them into debt. He plowed all his profits into buying parcels of land in the rapidly growing New York. He and his descendants would come to own much of the land New York was built on, Greenwich Village, sites near Times Square and the land where the Empire State Building now stands.",

The rents paid to the Astors would fund their high living for generations. Caroline Astor reinvented the family of fur traders and slumlords into scions of New York society.",

COOPER (voice-over): Vincent was married three times.

COOPER (voice-over): The Astor money may be gone in America, but you can still see the Astor name all over New York City, especially an Aster Place in Greenwich Village, where on the walls of the subway stop, if you look closely, you'll find ceramic tiles depicting beavers, the source of the fortune John Jacob Astor so relentlessly and ruthlessly carved out of the American wilderness.
