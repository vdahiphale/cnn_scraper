      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.Former President Donald Trump has already been indicted on federal charges for mishandling classified documents and state charges for hush money payments. He's pleaded not guilty to all charges but he's also the target of another investigation by the Department of Justice appointed special counsel looking into his efforts to subvert election results in seven states. One of those states is Georgia where President Biden flipped blue for a win in 2020. President Trump refused to accept the result and he and his allies engaged in a number of plots to overturn Biden's win. And some of these actions were so aggressive they drew the attention of the Fulton County district attorney who launched her own criminal probe in 2021. Now a grand jury has been convened, and the former president could face even more indictments in the weeks to come. So what exactly did Trump and his allies do in Georgia? And what charges might they face? Over the next hour, CNN's Sara Murray will lay out the entire investigation and piece together what we know about the pressure campaigns, Trump's private calls to election officials, a major data breach and a plot to subvert the electoral college process.
