U.S. military officials say one of the Russian jets intentionally flew in front of an unmanned American MQ9 Reaper drone. The Russian jet hit the drone, damaging the drone's propeller. This is the first time Russia and U.S. military aircraft have come into direct contact since Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.A spokesman for the U.S. Air Force called Russia's actions today, quote, \"reckless, unsound, and unprofessional.\" Let's bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who's at the Pentagon for us. Melissa Bell is live for us in Levy of Ukraine. Melissa, let's start with you. This is coming at an already incredibly tense time in the region. What are we hearing today from Ukrainian and Russian officials about this incident in the Black Sea?",

What the Russians are saying, Jake, is that there was no contract at all and that drone went down into the Black Sea as a result of sharp maneuvering. Moscow accusing that drone of flying without transponders.Now, those are the devices that allow a plane or a drone to be tracked, and that is in violation, says Russia, of the temporary measures that were put in place for the special military operation in that area. Of course, the euphemism that Russia uses for its invasion of Ukraine. What seems to have happened, according to Russia, is that drone was detected just off the coast of the Crimean Peninsula. Russian fighter jets scrambled to get up there, identified what Russia describes as the intruder and a sharp maneuver, then saw that drone crash into the Black Sea. Now, we have seen, as you say, a lot of tension around the Black Sea. There is an awful lot of military hardware up there as a result of what's going on in Ukraine. And what we've heard from the United States is that we've seen a history really recently of aggressive action or dangerous action on the part of Russian pilots. I think the key question here at this stage, Jake, is whether those Russian fighter pilots got too close to that drone by accident or whether they may have been a deliberate attempt to take it down. For the time being, we just don't know.",

Look, it basically just means that the U.S. is going to send a very sharp protest to the Russians over this incident. They want an explanation from Antonov over why this happened. And they want to express, of course, their displeasure with the fact that it happened, because, as has been alluded to intercepts of this kind are not uncommon. But the behavior of the pilots, that is what has been very unusual here. The pilots, just to remind our viewers, they actually flew very, very close to this plane, to this drone, dumping a whole lot of jet fuel on top of it, and then at one point actually got close to the propeller of the drone, which then hit the propeller and forced the U.S. military to actually take that drone down over international waters.So, what we're hearing, of course, is a very stern statement from both the Pentagon and the White House about how this is very unacceptable. Because I should note, Jake, that we're not talking about a small commercial drone. We are talking about a very large drone that is extremely long, that is extremely large, and if it came down in an unsafe way, it could have caused serious damage, of course, not only to the drone, but also to the Russian fighter aircraft. So U.S. officials also briefing allies on this incident, making it very clear to the Russians that moving forward, this is just not going to be acceptable, Jake.",

In 2018, about a month after you resigned from the White House, President Trump signed a bill that rolled back parts of the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act, which eased restrictions on some banks. President Biden and some others have said that this rollback may have contributed to this banking failure.

It's very costly. It's very expensive. And who bears the cost of that? The depositors bear the cost of that. The banks have to charge someone for that expense, and they take it out of the rate that they're willing to pay depositors. It also would have forced many of these small and medium sized banks, and we're talking about medium sized banks 50 billion to 250 billion. It would have forced them out of business. They would not have been competitive with the larger banks because the larger banks can amortize these enormous regulatory costs over trillions of dollars of assets. What the Trump administration rolled back had nothing to do with capital. It had nothing to do with liquidity. We had an old fashioned bank run here. And what happens in a bank run is all of the depositors want their money out simultaneously. Banks are not equipped to allow all of the deposits out simultaneously. Remember, banks are really important for the U.S. economy. They take depositors money and they lend it out to stimulate economic growth. They lend it out so people can buy houses, they can buy cars, they can get educations, and they can have credit cards. So banks will never be able to replenish all of their deposits in one day.
