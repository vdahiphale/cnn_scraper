      "sentences": "And the good news is that the rate of inflation has cooled substantially. Prices are no longer skyrocketing. But there is growing concern from economists about how the jobs market is holding up after all that tough medicine from the Fed. There are yellow lights flashing, the unemployment rate is still low, historically low at 4.1 percent, but it has moved noticeably higher. A year ago, it was at 3.5 percent. The black unemployment rate, that's moved up even faster. The rate that workers are quitting their job, getting hired, has gone down.Now, by no means am I saying the jobs market is imploding. It's not. But cracks have clearly emerged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he acknowledged as much yesterday, telling lawmakers that the jobs market has, quote, \"cooled considerably.\" And he said, inflation is not the only risk we face. Thats why investors on Wall Street, they're betting and the Fed is going to dial back that inflation fighting medicine by cutting interest rates. The market is pricing in a 73 percent chance of a rate cut not in this next meeting, but the one after that, the one in September. Now, economists I'm talking to are warning the Fed not to wait any longer than that. Moody's economist Mark Zandi, he told me, quote, \"The biggest danger is a policy mistake, that the Fed keeps rates too high for too long. Right now, the Fed is signaling a September cut. I think that's OK. But if they wait any longer than that, I fear they are going to overdo it.\" John, there's a lot of pressure on the Fed to get this just right. The stakes here are massive.",

And we should point out even before the debate, former President Donald Trump was leading in many of these states. But if you look at our road to 270, of course that is the magic number needed to win, some important adjustments here. Look at Michigan. That now in our rankings is lean Republican. Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that is part of the blue wall that Biden has been holding onto, needing to win. Not saying he can't, but it's in a very much more difficult position than they were hoping it would be here in the month of July.Also, look out west to Nevada and Arizona. Arizona is still a battleground in our map, a toss-up, but Nevada is much more difficult, and the Biden campaign is aware of this. Also Georgia, of course, the site of the debate, has always been one of the more difficult battlegrounds for President Biden to win, but they've been investing heavily there. Now that is lean Republican. But Minnesota, I am told by many Democratic advisors and strategists now that is also on the cusp of becoming more difficult as well. So we have moved that into lean Republican. So the bottom line here is the battleground map is expanding, the opportunities for Donald Trump to win have grown. And Minnesota, you may think, well, that sounds like a Democratic state. But if you you'll think back to 2016, that was the narrowest defeat for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, just lost it by about one percentage point or so. So think of Minnesota from here forward as the reddest blue state, if you will. So the bottom line to all of this, this race is now more difficult for President Biden going into the final stretches here. So he won the pressure campaign, at least so far this week in Washington. But what type of a race is left for him, and it's harder, Kate.",

The thing that has changed though, and it still kind of remains to be seen how it has changed is the use of artificial intelligence. This is a very strong arrow, I think, powerful in the Russian's quiver and it will be very interesting to see how they deploy it and how effective it is going to be for them.",

So I think you really need to think twice about what you're reading and think twice about what your response is going to be and try to figure out whether or not somebody is trying to easily manipulate you and that's not an easy thing to do, it is an easy thing to say, but I think it is up to all of us, as Americans, and even in Western Europe as well to try to identify when we are being manipulated.

There are -- they've already been shut down by the majority of Western-leaning democracies in the world. They are still associated with sort of these down and out states like Iran, North Korea, and the rest. But Russia is a significant threat because they have nothing to lose. Iran is still sort of feeling its way. It has a pretty sufficient and efficient capability to try to influence things, but they are more of a chaos agent. I like the way that that is characterized. China has to be really, really careful because they have the most to lose. China has already said, look, we want to engage, we want to be a global power. Our economy needs to expand and because of that, they've got to be extremely careful. So although they've said they're going to sit this one out, sort of, I think what that really means is they are going to be extremely careful as they go about their information operations so as not to get caught.",

This happened June 30th at the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, and it is not clear what led up to this incident, but the family's attorney, Ben Crump says police told them that Mitchell caused a disturbance at that hotel and that's why security escorted him out of the hotel. As you had mentioned, quite a bit of this encounter was captured on video that was later shared on social media and what you can see in this video are four security guards pinning Mitchell to the ground. That's what is prompting this comparison to the George Floyd homicide in 2020. And what we know now is that again, there were four security guards.
