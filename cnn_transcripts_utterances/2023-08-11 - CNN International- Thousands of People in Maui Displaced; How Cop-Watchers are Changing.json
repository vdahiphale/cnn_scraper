The news reportedly sent some Indian expats in the U.S. into panic buying mode. But American rice producers say U.S. has enough of its own supply to go around. CNN's Vedika Sud reports from the situation in India. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Dozens of panic-stricken buyers scrambling to buy Indian rice in a store in Dallas. Just a day after Indian, the largest exporter of rice impose a ban on shipments exporting non-basmati rice. The USA rice Federation says they've stored enough to go around. But New Delhi's export restrictions have triggered fears of a global food prices. India's rice supply has been hard after heavy rains devastated large regions where the staple is grown, crippling livelihoods. Last month the Indian government said it was necessary to halt all exports of non-basmati rice to calm domestic rising prices and ensure adequate supply at home. In a village in north India, third-generation farmer, Shapka Kumar (ph) sits by his patty field that's been submerged for over a month. It's destroyed his newly planted seedlings. Farming is Kumar's only source of income. He's taken loans to re-cultivate his land. I've suffered huge losses, he tells me, now nothing can be grown on this land until November. Here the rice export ban is a double whammy. It's going to have an adverse impact on us, Kumar tells me, we won't get a higher rate of rice even exported. The floods were a death blow to us farmers. This ban will finish us, he says. The southeastern nation accounts for more than 40 percent of world rice exports globally. And Delhi's rice export rice hub create uncertainty as rice stocks are piling up. The export ban has left traders with huge amounts of stock. We now have to find new buyers in the domestic market, trader Rup Kuran (ph) tells me.",
