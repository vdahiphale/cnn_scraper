Israel's military is ramping up its bombardment of Gaza. It's part of Israel's plan to prepare for a possible ground incursion into Gaza. Israel carried out a rare air strike in the West Bank earlier today hitting a mosque. The IDF says it thwarted, quote, \"an eminent terror attack.\" The Palestinian Authority calls it a dangerous escalation -- Erin.",

It's significant, Jim, because this happened inside Gaza so they are not just saying they're inside but that there actually was fighting. It's just the second time that Israeli forces have even confirmed that they were operating inside Gaza since the Hamas terror attacks two weeks ago. And the last time was just in the past 48 hours special forces.A CNN journalist has witnessed at least 14 trucks meantime crossing from Egypt into Gaza. That's desperately needed humanitarian aid. It is fair to say it is a drop in the bucket, though, but it is something. And for almost two weeks, there had been nothing. An official at Gaza's main hospital says the deteriorating conditions meanwhile there are catastrophic and other hospitals say that they are simply overwhelmed by the number of dead and wounded from the intensifying bombardment. Israel tonight just saying that they conducted dozens of strikes just today -- Jim.",

We saw those two American women released on Friday after captivity by Hamas for almost two weeks. We saw it today the trucks moving for the first time into the Gaza Strip.And so what I've learned from two separate sources is that there has been some pressure from the Biden administration to Israel to delay what we believe is an imminent ground invasion of Gaza. Because there has been this progress, there's been signs in the conversations around both the hostages and the aid and sustained aid, I should say, is the priority, that this could continue. And of course the U.S. and other countries who have hostages in Gaza as well as Israel want to see all of those hostages freed. So we should note that the Israelis are flatly denying this, that there has been no request from the U.S. side to delay their incursion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked this very question earlier in the day and he did not deny it. He simply said that these are decisions for Israel to make. President Biden said very flatly yesterday that he is speaking with the Israelis when he was asked the same question. Jim, the U.S. and Israel have been very sensitive and very careful about not making it seem like the U.S. is telling Israel what to do and dictating their war.",

There is a sense that it is what they may be trying to do to buy time, to also buy some goodwill and give the impression that they are willing to release these foreign hostages, to release the civilians, and that would obviously escalate the pressure on Israel to allow for more time. They may also think that they could get a cease-fire or more aid out of this.And that pressure that comes as a result of essentially Hamas giving a glimmer of hope, that more of these hostages may be coming out. That makes things a lot tougher for Israel.

If you look at what's happening Hezbollah has been sending antitank missiles into Israel and continues to be aggressive on that part of the border. You've got these proxy wars going on in Iraq against our services, in Syria, and then we had these missiles that were launched from Yemen.So when you look at the situation, there are a lot of proxies, terrorists, who are trying to put pressure on Israel and the United States. And so for that reason, I think the United States has to be in a posture of making sure that we are protecting our forces in that region. So I think the secretary is taking the right steps to try to make sure we defend our troops. ACOSTA: And what we're hearing from our correspondent Alex Marquardt, that sources are telling CNN the Biden administration is pressing the Israelis to delay a ground invasion of Gaza for aid to reach Gaza, for more time for hostages to get out.

And right now there are two principal objectives for Israel. One is obviously to destroy, undermine Hamas, go after its leadership, but the second objective is to retrieve our hostages.And I'm going to leave it up to Israel to decide how to balance those two objectives. But those are the objectives of what this war is all about right now.",

But we do know that ultimately Israel has to target Hamas and their leadership. And very frankly, that can be done with good intelligence and with special forces.So I don't -- I don't expect that Israel is going to suddenly pull back on whether or not to go after Hamas. That's going to continue, I think, under any circumstances. Now, this balancing act with the hostages, I think what they have to determine is whether, in fact, Hamas is operating in good faith, which I think we all question, or whether or not this is just another hoax to try to drag the war on.

What are you learning? OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they just released an update not too long ago, Jim.
