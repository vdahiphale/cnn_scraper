So, hear that any of your officers have been injured in any kind of way but critically injured. But it's also too, it rubs me and it just rocks my world to have anybody being injured and losing their life. And so, I am just truly -- I have so much respect for the families because they were still present. And we're very appreciative of what was done and how LMPD responded today. And they were actually embracing me as I was embracing them. But let me say this. The evil that took place today, we shouldn't hear the tears that were coming out from these families. And that right there sticks because they are weeping because someone decided that they wanted to take life today.

It's been a very emotional journey for everyone involved there from the governor who lost one of his friends in this shooting that has claimed five lives, including the gunman, who was just 23 years old and was an employee of the Old National Bank before using what the interim police chief said, Was a rifle going in and firing upon people there. Four people killed. And you heard the mayor there who also was very emotional about all that transpired there.And among those who are injured and in critical condition, a 26-year- old police officer who just graduated from the academy and the interim police chief there, talking about how she had just recently sworn him in on March 31st. A very emotional day. So many lives that have been impacted from the shooting that took place earlier today. Our Omar Jimenez is there in Louisville. Also, back with us is our CNN, senior crime and justice correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz. So, we begin with you, Omar. And of course, we've got a host of people. Andrew McCabe and Chief Charles Ramsey as well. Omar, to you first there in Louisville.",

      "sentences": "So, I think what we're seeing here from the police department and the mayor and the city officials is a focus on the victims. The fact that you have a governor who knew one of the victims. You have the mayor who knew one of the victims. And this city you can really tell it's affected so many different officials.So, I think one of the things that they're doing here is they're -- they really want to get everything together and focus more on the victims at this point. And what we've learned is 23 years old, some significant information in the sense that he is a current employee. So that's significant, right? So, easily should have access to the building. The other thing that we've learned that I think is significant. We've been hearing rumblings of this earlier that the shooter was livestreaming this. So, law enforcement appears to have this. They appear to be reviewing it. So that is going to provide a lot of clues. But I also think what's so important in all of this is this officer Nickolas Wilt, 26 years old, just 10 days on the job. And just to understand what's going on in Louisville is, you know, this police department in Louisville is reeling. I mean, they've had a lot of problems. They've been investigated by the federal government for civil rights violations. So, for them to see their officers react this way in such a forceful manner in such a speedy manner. An officer who put his life on the line got shot in the head. And the police chief they are saying that those officers' actions saved lives. And time and time again, this is what we're seeing in a lot of these mass shootings. The officers have to be on the front line and really the only hope to preventing more murder, more violence. And the fact, you know, that I was certainly struck by the fact that when the police chief took to the podium there and that she was thanking her officers for showing up. She said, thank you for showing up. If we don't do it, who will? And then, she said this should not continue to happen. And so, so many police departments across the country now having to deal with this, having to face such horrific violence on a daily basis. And the fact that a police chief is thanking her officers for showing up. I thought it was kind of pretty significant. Especially there because they are definitely, definitely suffering. And obviously there's still so much that we need to learn about the motive here and what was going on inside that bank that brought this horrific event. But it really -- I thought it was really interesting that what she said there and with the mayor said, and the governor is just a focus on the victims here today and what happened to these families.",

The focus is on the victims and again, those who died ranging in ages between 53 and 64, aside from the 23-year-old employee of the Old National Bank, who was also killed. Still unclear whether the gunman shot himself or whether police shot him.But while publicly that is the sentiment. Focus on the victims. Give us an idea of what is taking place behind the scenes right now, with the investigation to learn access to the gunman had to the bank. The motivation, any kind of footprint or any kind of red flags that led up to this. Charles Ramsey, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I mean, that's all part of the investigation, but this occurred in the bank and banks have cameras everywhere. And so, I'm sure they're reviewing the video footage. It was mentioned that this individual was livestreaming so they're looking at that as well. So, there are a lot of things going on right now, behind the scenes in terms of trying to really paint a picture. Get a timeline together of what took place and so forth. I also want to commend the chief for taking time and recognizing the difficulty that it is that this taking place for police not just in Louisville, but around the country, and I too want to thank them all for showing up. Because without him who knows what would take place, and this is an example that despite all the different controversy and criticisms and so forth, when the call goes out, they respond and they responded in a very heroic manner. And you've got a young police officer less than two weeks on the job shot in the head and my prayers are with him and his family that he's able to recover.

So, I think the one thing that really, maybe points towards the significance of this person's potential social media accounts and postings is the fact that he livestreamed this attack.Now we don't know all the details about exactly what was put up on the livestream just yet, but clearly like just to engage in that that is an act of expressing to the world what you're doing and why you're doing it. And if he was that committed to making a public display of his violence, then it's also likely that he's left a trail of writings or statements or communications to other people. Be they on social media or in journals or in private emails and text messages and things like that. So those are some of the things that investigators are trying to get access to. Right now, they'll be serving legal process on internet service providers and email providers and phone companies. If this person likely had a smartphone or a mobile device, they will be trying to access any electronic devices that are found at his residence or in his vehicle. Computers, telephones, iPads, things like that. And really looking for statements that would shed some light over why this target? Why are these people? Why today? And I should also say, Fred, the livestreaming is -- once again we're seeing a mass shooting that is showing clear connections or echoes to prior mass shootings infamously the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooter, livestreamed his attack on two separate mosques in Christchurch. Then we had the Tops supermarket shooter in Buffalo, New York, who also livestreamed his attack and in his own manifesto copied some of the language from the Christchurch shooter's manifesto. So, you may see those same sorts of themes echoing with this individual. It's possible the livestreaming with some sort of a connection to an awareness of others who have gone before him down this spiral path.",

The Department of Justice is arguing for an emergency stay.Where attorneys write, quote: If allowed to take effect, the court's order with thwart FDA's scientific judgment and severely harm women, particularly those for whom mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity. This harm would be felt throughout the country, given that mifepristone has lawful uses in every state. But there is a conflicting new court ruling out of Washington state.

And so, even the judge in Washington state noticed that there were inconsistencies in the FDA's record.We do know that the drug has the ability to harm women. It certainly takes the life of an unborn child. But it has the potential to harm a woman. And we're talking about a drug that is given to a woman who is healthy and has a healthy pregnancy. And it's not a drug designed to cure an illness. It's not just a drug designed to cure a disease. It's not designed to save a life. The purpose of the development of the drug is to take human life.

Even the studies that have been done by abortion -- the abortion industry you're looking at 5 to 10 percent -- there's a Canadian study that used -- that found 10 percent of women have severe side effects that can put them in the hospital.So, you take that and you extrapolate those numbers. We're talking 54 percent of all abortions and the last numbers we have, the abortion number in the United States is over 900,000 abortions per year. You take that number you could look at somewhere between 45,000 and 90,000 women ending up in the emergency room. That is unacceptable for a drug that is not designed to cure disease.
