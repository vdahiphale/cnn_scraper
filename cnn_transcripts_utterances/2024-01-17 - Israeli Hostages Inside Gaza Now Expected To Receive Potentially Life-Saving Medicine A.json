Israeli hostages who have languished inside Gaza for more than three months are now expected to receive potentially life-saving medicine as part of a deal brokered by France and Qatar. The agreement also includes more humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians. It is important to note that the Qatari ministry is saying that it is unclear. They don't know yet when the medicine and aid are expected to reach Gaza but this is the first breakthrough agreement between Israel and Hamas since the collapse of that humanitarian truce more than a month ago. At least 45 hostages are said to be in urgent need of medication in Gaza. Nic Robertson joins us live now from northern Israel with the latest here. Nic, what more do we know?",

And some of the over a hundred hostages that are being held that are still alive, at least, are elderly, some into their 60s, 70s, and beyond. So, there's concern that some of those will have been and are understood to have been on important, ongoing medical treatments that require regular medicine that they haven't been getting. So, there's been a huge amount of pressure on the Israeli government, not just to get the hostages back, but to make sure that the medicines can get through to them. That has been a real push and drive by the families. They also, of course, want the International Committee for the Red Cross to be able to get to see the hostages. That would also be a minimum. But it does appear that the Qataris have been able to not only make this deal happen so far, get the medicine for these 40 plus people, and get it close to putting it in the hands of those hostages. I'm in northern Israel at the moment, and I just have heard a very loud detonation coming from the border area there. I'll just say that because we heard fighter jets overhead, and that's a little bit uncommon, but there's been a little bit of uptick in interaction across the northern border of Israel over today. But that, there's the fighter jet right now. But that aside, it's been very important for the families of the hostages to make sure that their loved ones get the medical treatment that they are missing at the moment. But as part of the deal, the Qataris were under pressure from Hamas to get something in return. And what they got in return was a commitment to allow more medicine and food and humanitarian sustenance to get into Gaza for all the people there. As we know, U.N. officials are describing the situation in Gaza for some people there as literally close to starvation and medical facilities close to collapse. Less than half the hospitals in Gaza are working. The daily death toll continues to climb -- every day. And this, of course, is something that Hamas wanted as a quid pro quo for letting this medicine through. But as you say, it's not clear yet that the medicine has actually made it to the hostages themselves. And getting that information may be really tough because the International Committee for the Red Cross, the sort of global standard for prisoners, they haven't been able to see the hostages yet.",

We've got our eyes and ears open over the region. And I'm sure we're going to go back in much more forcefully on the next seven strikes. That's the way to deal with it.

I think we'll all remember Kate was in and out of hospital having babies very fast. But now I think it's something that she doesn't need to recover fully from.",
