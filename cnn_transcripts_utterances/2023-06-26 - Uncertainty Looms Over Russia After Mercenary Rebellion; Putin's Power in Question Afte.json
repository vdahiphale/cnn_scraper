The thing that strikes me about Prigozhin is the most interesting thing is that he is one of the few, if any, of these players we've seen in Moscow over the past couple of decades being able to make the jump from essentially an oligarch. Remember, he started off as Putin's chef. He was basically the catering service for the Kremlin, which is a pretty bigger job than you might imagine. But he was able to make the jump from being that kind of guy to basically a military warlord. There's very few people in Russia who have ever done that.

You talk to American and other western senior military officials and they'll say they can talk to a guy like this, speak the same language.Shoigu, on the other hand, has never had, this is his first military experience. So, you might say, okay, our secretary of defense here in the states doesn't need to be, for example, a military leader, but Shoigu really has zero experience except for his connections to Putin.

They have about 11 divisions right now that are equipped and ready in position for the counteroffensive. Only about two-and-a-half have actually started seriously fighting so far.So, the Russians understand that. And they'd be concerned if suddenly you've got the Kadyrov troops, the other major paramilitary, loyal to Putin, they were peeling off and said they're going to fight against Wagner. Who knows what's going to happen with the Russian Defense Forces.

So, I think that was right.What I'm very concerned with, and I think a good lesson to take from this is we don't have to tiptoe around Vladimir Putin. There's always been, particularly out of the administration, this idea that we can't do this one more thing, because we're just going to cross Vladimir Putin's red line. We can't give him ATACMS, and the U.K. gives them Storm Shadows, pretty close to the same thing. That's where the administration hopefully can see what transpired over this and say, look, this red line that Putin puts out isn't really a red line. He will advance until he hits a brick wall.

All of that is real.But I agree with David that an exit ramp for Putin, which already was looking deeply problematic, is now looking a lot harder. We learned that he doesn't really have friends, right? I mean, Belarus, which isn't effectively sovereign, let's be clear, Prigozhin is still kind of in Russia right now in terms of Russian intelligence and Russian special forces and all the rest. But the Chinese, when Putin was facing an existential threat, said virtually nothing, referred to it as an internal Russian matter, and did not provide any support, any military support to the Russians, just as they have not over the past months.

There's no one in a position of power right now that's facing what he's been facing over the past months. The decision to go into Moscow felt to me like a man who truly was facing desperation. He was told by the Russian government, you either let your people -- force your people to sign contracts with the Ministry of Defense, so you lose control, or you're insubordinate to the Kremlin, and not just the MOD, but to Putin himself. What kind of a choice is that? So, when he finally decided, okay, I can't do it. I'm not going to let my people sign those contracts, he was already dead man walking. So, at that point, he throws himself and his troops against Moscow, does whatever he can. And I think when he's offered a line, when he knows that fighting Moscow itself with troops that are reporting directly up to Putin, not part of the normal MOD structure, I think he recognizes that he's going to die, his people are going to die.

There's some indication he may not be in the Kremlin, but we don't know. But the deal is sort of interesting because we were told it was brokered by the leader of Belarus, maybe it was. But the fact of the matter is, presumably Prigozhin would have wanted some guarantee that Shoigu and others or the other military leadership are out.",

This doesn't pass a sniff test at face value until perhaps we know more details, and we may never do that. There is no way that President Putin would allow a weak neighbor who is a supplicant to him like Lukashenko to negotiate a deal without him having some say so in it.Prigozhin has leverage. He has leverage because he's been the Kremlin's go-to guy for setting up all sorts of business deals and support in the Central African Republic, in Mali, in Sudan, in Libya. These are lucrative. They're worth money to him. This is more than just about money and power, more than just about power in the inner circle around Putin. This is also about money. So, Shoigu -- Prigozhin has had something to negotiate with his value to the Kremlin on those overseas operations. That's a currency that will erode with time. But I think Lukashenko's role in this has been very much at the behest of Putin rather than a loan operation.",

There are indications that the Kremlin are going reneging on their word that he has some kind of amnesty out of this. So, I think that's going to be a difficulty for him. In Belarus, he's easily accessible to the Russian military, to Russian intelligence. The value that he has with these connections and assets inside Africa, that is going to erode and he will know that.So it's probably safe for him to get furthest from Moscow. He can. He knows that the Kremlin is reneging on it, on its words. So, he knows he can't trust them. He knows that he's been disloyal to Putin and Putin hates disloyalty.
