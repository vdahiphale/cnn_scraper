Also ahead this hour, Julian Assange is out of prison after a plea deal with U.S. authorities he has flown out of Britain where is he now? Plus two days and counting until the first presidential debate of 2024 and the stakes couldn't be higher, with recent polling showing no clear leader in the rematch between Donald Trump and President Biden. And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now let's have a quick look at the numbers for you and the futures indicating a mixed open. On Monday they continue to look for direction. NVIDIA has provided the biggest upset its shares tumbling by more than 6 percent Monday its losses over the last couple of days of trading total some $500 billion. We start this hour in Nairobi where protests against proposed tax hikes have reached boiling point. Protesters are now inside the parliament building which is partly on fire. Just a short time ago, our CNN team reported seeing at least two bodies lying on the ground after police fired live rounds at protesters. More on that as we get it. Well, more than decade's long legal odyssey of WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange appears to be winding down. Assange is heading from a London prison to the North Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Under a deal with U.S. he will plead guilty on Wednesday to a single conspiracy charge for releasing secret U.S. military records. Assange is expected to get credit for time served meaning he could go straight to his home country of Australia CNN's Clare Sebastian following this story for us from London. Just get us bang up to date. What do we know at this point about where he is and what happens next?",

If that plea is granted he could as you say, then walk free. And Australia has made it very clear that they will welcome him home. We believe that his wife Stella Assange, she was fronted every single attempt to release him over the past few years that she is already there in Sydney. She tweeted out a picture of him FaceTiming from Stansted Airport just outside of London last night. So we believe that she is there waiting for him. But obviously, look, this has been a very long run legal proceeding that now this week could be over. There also seems to be a backdrop here that the political climate changed in the few months leading up to this. The White House says this was nothing to do with them. This was a decision by the Justice Department. But we did hear comments from President Biden back in April, that he was considering a request from Australia to drop the case against Assange. So that is the backdrop. Take a look at this long and winding story so far.

In April three of Hania's (ph) sons and four of his grandchildren were killed in another Israeli air strike, according to Hamas. Hania said at the time that killing the sons of Hamas leaders would only make the group more steadfast in its principles. Well, the entire population of Gaza is bracing for severe levels of food insecurity through the summer that is a sobering forecast in a just released report by ISP the Integrated Food Security Phase classification, it says a high risk of famine persist across all of Gaza and can only be reduced through a stop in fighting and sustained access for humanitarian groups. Paula Hancocks shows us the shattering impact of this food emergency in Gaza in a report that does contain disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Amal (ph) meaning hope was born two months premature. She died after just four days of family says a baby born into war in Northern Gaza. It is a result of her early birth the head of pediatrics says which is a result of malnutrition and starvation of her mother. This is the fourth child that's died in this department this week. Amal's father says they were displaced with no shelter, food or water. A real starvation he says my girl died because of this. Hospitals across Gaza are full of malnutrition cases doctors say needing special care that simply does not exist. Yunis (ph) is nine years old his mother takes off his T-shirt to show the painful evidence of malnutrition and extreme dehydration. She says he was healthy until they were displaced multiple times from Northern Gaza to Rafah to a beach area where she says they don't even have a tent. The food was no longer available his mother says. There were bad living conditions and polluted water. I'm losing my son in front of my eyes. More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition according to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees UNWRA. Eight months of war have decimated the health system, water sanitation and food distribution. Clean water has become a luxury many struggle to access. The IDF says there is enough aid in Gaza the distribution is the problem.",

And Paula, very sobering images in your reporting and disturbing new numbers about the massiveimpact of food insecurity in Gaza as this war continues, and it does continue a few minutes ago, we reported on the sister of the Hamas political leader getting killed in an airstrike. What more do we know at this point? HANCOCKS (on-camera): Well, Becky, this report is very much data driven. It's the IPC is effectively the U.N.'s hunger monitoring system. It uses the global scientific norms to assess the food insecurity, and it is used widely across the board by humanitarian aid groups. So the fact that it has come out with such a sobering report is being noted by many groups. The World Food Programme, for example, has said that it proves what they have been seeing on the ground. Other aid groups say that this matches their testimony of the dire situation on the ground. Now, they also talk about the southern part of Gaza, saying that food was able to get in in March and April and they could notice a marked improvement. But then as soon as Israel's military operations started in Rafah, the Rafah crossing was closed since early May. Then the situation deteriorated significantly. Similarly that the World Food Programme said that in the northern part of Gaza, they had seen some slight improvements clearly as another land crossing was opened by the Israelis allowing food and water to be able to get to those specific areas. So we can see a very direct correlation between the access to get into Gaza and improvements on the ground, Becky.",

Now that election, of course comesafter a helicopter crash last month that killed hardline President Ebrahim Raisi. Iran's Supreme Leader is calling for maximum turnout to quote, overcome the enemy. His comments follow a parliamentary election earlier this year that saw record low participation. CNN's Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen joins us live from Tehran.

One of the things that he said is that every time there's low participation, and in the Iranian election, he feels that the enemies of Iran are emboldened and criticize the Islamic Republic of Iran. So obviously, the folks here in power to the system they believe, a high participation is extremely important as far as the candidates are concerned so pretty interesting field. There are, as you mentioned, six candidates who are still in the running. There are three who I think many people would consider being the front runners. One of them is actually a moderate. And that's a little bit different than the last presidential election were Ebrahim Raisi, of course, was elected. His name is Massoud Pezeshkian (ph). And there are some who believe that he might have a dark horse chance to actually win. He also has the form of foreign brief in his corner as well, Becky. But I think the other thing that you mentioned is so important as well. And that is the fact that of course, all this comes only a little more than a month after that helicopter crash that killed Iran's President, Ebrahim Raisi and all that, of course, still really looms over this election. I'm actually here at festivities that are going on for a very important religious holiday today here, but of course, the election very important in that as well. And I want you to take a look at that election poster over that. That's for one of the conservative candidates. That's Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf who is the speaker of parliament. But as you can see on there, he is there holding hands with the deceased president with Ebrahim Raisi, showing how important a figure Ebrahim Raisi is, especially to the conservatives who are still in this race. And obviously one of the things that Mohammad Ghalibaf says is that he wants to continue the work of Ebrahim Raisi, who of course was killed in that helicopter crash. So that chopper crash, really looming over the preparations for this election. I think one of the things that were very important for the Supreme Leader of Iran is he came out and he said, look he guarantees that the functioning of the Iranian government will continue. And I think holding these elections only a little bit over a month after that chopper crash took place after the head of the government obviously was killed in that chopper crash is very important for the Islamic Republic and very important also for the supreme leader to show that voting this country will continue and the functioning of the government and its institutions will continue as well, Becky.",

They think similarly to what our, legislate out. They actually think Trump can do a better job talking about the economy on stage than Joe Biden. So the economy is definitely something behind the scenes. I know that Donald Trump and his team as well as a group of policy experts, advisors, and potential VP contenders, all of them are meeting with Donald Trump to sharpen their rhetoric. So the economy is one, he also wants to focus on immigration and the border, again, things that they think he pulls better on compared to the president, however, for as how he's preparing, it's a little bit different from what the Biden campaign is doing. Donald Trump is not holed up somewhere for a week like Joe Biden is at Camp David. Instead, he's actually been pretty aggressively working on the campaign trail over the weekend. He had a rally in Philadelphia, as well as a stop in Washington D.C. at a Christian Conservative Conference. He had a fundraiser last night. He is spending the next two days at Mar-a-Lago for more of those policy discussions that I just laid out. And then he has a rally again later this week. And so all of this is really the Trump campaign trying to show that they believe Donald Trump needs less preparation than Joe Biden. But of course, behind the scenes, he is doing his homework. Now, Donald Trump did address this question himself in a podcast interview yesterday. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And his team has really been trying to argue that look,when he goes to these rallies when he speaks with voters that is his version of preparing, of course, I have to point out that it's a friendly audience. Normally, when he is meeting with his own supporters like he did this weekend in Philadelphia, when he's doing these interviews, often they are friendly interviewers that he is meeting with now. I can also tell you that the Trump campaign doesn't exactly know which version of Donald Trump is going to show up on that debate stage on Thursday. We've seen Donald Trump at times be able to be more presidential talk about his own policies focus on the issues, but also, he's very much quick to be aggressive. He likes to meander, we saw in 2020 in the first debate between him and Joe Biden, Donald Trump was very aggressive. He barely let Joe Biden get a word in and then actually negatively impacted him in the polls in the days after that. And so Trump's team has been working also behind the scenes to try and rein in some of that more vitriolic language.

We're walking past City Hall, which is just a few 100 meters away from the Kenyan Parliament and the Office of the Governor is on fire. There are bits of the building that are now on fire. We're working right inside it that the door has been broken in and processes appear to have made their way inside this building. And said parts of this building on fire, leads us to pushing them back further away from the center of government buildings where the parliament and City Halls, the Office of the Governor of Nairobi and other buildings operates in an extraordinary state. They are tried to get into the National Assembly and occupy Parliament as they declared these seven days in raids in major protests against over taxation in Kenya, Becky.",

But these young people have continued to be on the streets. And they have been determined to get to Parliament to have their voices hard.

A few of them not all the protesters, lot of them have been held just outside of Kenya's National Assembly by the police. There's been a dramatic scene all afternoon with police trying to push them back with water cannon and with tear gas and they throw back with tear gas and push back the police. At one point they made it right outside Kenya's National Assembly. So the scene you have here is still a strong police presence. All of these trucks here, we see the protesters just on the periphery of Kenya's National Assembly here. We have seen at least two bodies on the ground. We saw police use live rounds while the protesters breached the fence of the National Assembly. And that's how some of them were able to get inside the Kenyan parliament. And as the protesters were getting closer, overwhelming the police some of these security officers, some of the men inside Kenya's parliament. We saw them, using live rounds. And after that we saw at least two bodies lying here on this street. This is called Parliament Avenue because right in front of Kenya's Parliament. And this is the building that houses both the National Assembly and the Senate. There's still a standoff here between the protesters and that roundabout over at the end of that road and the police trying to hold them back there. But part of the wall has been breached. And protesters made it all the way from the -- into the cafeteria and inside the floor of the National Assembly and made out of the mace. They were trying to get it through the fence and they kind of broke it into two and they got out with the arm of the mace but the rest of it remained inside parliament. So the most dramatic scene I've seen covering protests here in Kenya for a long, long time. But also the two bodies we've seen. Those are the ones we personally saw a CNN. The protesters tell us they've seen other bodies and other parts of the city. They were largely peaceful protesters and they are angry that police appear to be using live rounds to beat back and to disrupt peaceful protesters.",
