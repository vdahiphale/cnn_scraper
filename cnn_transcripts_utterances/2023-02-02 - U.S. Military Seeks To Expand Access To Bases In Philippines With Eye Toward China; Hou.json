But depending on the state of her mental illness, she may have believed that because of this postpartum depression that is so severe and, as part of that, she wanted to die with them.

A green hued comet, that has not been visible in the night sky, since the Stone Age, that's about 50,000 years ago, it was recently photographed above Stonehenge, in England. As close as the comet got to Earth, it was still a ways away more than 100 times the distance to the moon. But it is a rare and historic treat to see it. I'm joined now by Adam Frank, Professor of Astrophysics, at the University of Rochester. Professor Frank, thank you so much for being with us. How significant is this comet? And did you get a chance to see it yourself? ADAM FRANK, PROFESSOR OF ASTROPHYSICS, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER: Well, the thing that's really cool about this is time, right? If you think of the comet as it goes around, in its orbit, is like a clock? Then the last time that the hands were pointing to, where it is now, was the Ice Age, essentially, when there was two miles of ice, above my head, in Rochester, and the entire world's population could fit into Cleveland. So, it's just, what this really shows us is these comets are visitors, from the dawn of time in many ways. And it's just such an amazing thing to think about. The last time this comet went by, it was all forests. And now it's New York City and TikTok! So the comet's pretty - probably pretty surprised!",

You catch them the first time that they're coming in, because often they'll fall into the sun, or once they're gone, they're not coming back forever, or for 50,000 years. So it's this new telescope technology, amazing technology we have that can pick up faint objects, in the sky, as they change position, one night after the other.
