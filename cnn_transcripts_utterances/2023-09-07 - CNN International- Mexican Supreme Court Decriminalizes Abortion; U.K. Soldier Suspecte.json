In fact, by the time the Mexican Supreme Court issued a ruling Wednesday decriminalizing abortion at the federal level, 12 out of 32 states had already invalidated laws banning abortion. MARIA ANTONIETA ALCAIDE, IPAS/MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA: Our reaction was of pure joy and celebration. But also of being very proud of being part of this Green Wave, this movement that have been working to advance the abortion agenda.

Mexico City was the first jurisdiction to end the ban on abortion in the country back in 2007, starting a trend in the still mostly conservative country where more than 3/4 of the population identify as Catholic.

DOMINIC MURPHY, COUNTERTERRORISM COMMAND, METROPOLITAN POLICE: We have a focus of our effort in London at the moment. We have counterterrorism command officers now leading the investigation, supportive officers from across the Metropolitan Police and our partners. But we also have notifications out to every force in the country. We're working really closely with borders colleagues to try and understand any risks that might be posed by him leaving the country. And so at the moment you could describe this as a nationwide manhunt involving every force in the country. VINCENT (voice-over): Mr. Khalife is a soldier who was based at these barracks in Stafford. He was arrested after allegedly leaving fake devices at the base. Magistrates in Westminster were told that he had done so with the intention of inducing the belief in others that the items were likely to explode. He is charged with terrorism offences and is accused of gathering information which could be useful to an enemy. Wandsworth Prison was famously escaped from 60 years ago by one of the Great Train robbers. Ronnie Biggs put a ladder over one of the walls. More recently, problems at the category B jail persist.

Nearly 300 students were in a abaya to school on Monday. 67 were sent home for refusing to take it off. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): They say that the abaya is a religious dress, but it's not at all. It's not a religious dress, it's a traditional dress. STEWART (voice-over): A Muslim rights group has already brought an appeal against the ban to the country's highest court, with their lawyer saying the ban doesn't legally define what an abaya looks like. VINCENT BRENGARTH, LAWYER (through translator): The ban is not based on any legal text. It's purely a political announcement. STEWART (voice-over): Another lawsuit is being prepared after a student wearing a kimono and jeans was expelled from class. Disproportionate is how one teaching union described the abaya debate. When issues like funding and bullying also need to be addressed. At least one other major union has supported the government's ban. And that division gets to the heart of the secularism debate in France. Laicite, a principle upheld by many across the political spectrum as Frances blind defense against religious discrimination. But critics condemn it as a veiled attack on Muslims in France. Hijabs, bikinis, now abayas falling under the glare of an unyielding French state. Exactly what Macron asked of his teachers, faced with resistant students this month. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): We know that there will be cases because we know that there will be some through negligence, perhaps, but many to try to defy the Republican system, we must be uncompromising.

Some with different chemical or physical properties. Some that are found in distinct locations within the solar system. And each of those asteroids is a remnant of the earliest building blocks that made-up all of the planets and moons.
