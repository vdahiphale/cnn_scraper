This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd or contradicted by the facts. So Boris Johnson obviously not taking it lying down. And last week in his statement he very much hinted that, look, he was stepping back from politics for now.

Daniel Penny was indicted on second degree manslaughter charges in the death of Jordan Neely last month. He surrendered to police but is out on bond. The incident was caught on cellphone video. Here's some of it. Penny held Neely in a chokehold after witnesses say Neely shouted, he was thirsty, hungry and didn't care if he died. Neely's death has led to protests calling for justice.The law firm representing his family says Penny should have let Neely go before he died and, quote, did not have the right to be the judge, the jury and the executioner.

The answer came from prosecutors, who told police to hold off because they said we need more information. They wanted to hear the 911 calls. They wanted to see if there was any other video. They wanted to talk to the passengers on the train. Ask them if they felt threatened. And finally on May 12th they ordered his arrest. Began that grand jury presentation and obtained this indictment. The video is the thing that you always wish you had as a prosecutor.If we had this on tape, we could prove exactly what happened. But the tape starts halfway through the incident. What it does not capture was the pacing around by Mr. Neely that witnesses described of him, balling his fists up, throwing his jacket down, talking about not being afraid to go back to jail or go away for life. They are wondering, what he is about to do that he could go away for life for. It suggests that he was about to hurt somebody in the mind of Daniel Penny. So this case may boil down in large part to that video. But also in large part to the decision that his lawyers will make about do you put Daniel Penny on the stand because they are going to have to have some show of proof of what was in his mind when he decided to use that level of force that he can articulate he thought was about to happen that justified it.

The former head of the school's morgue is now facing federal charges of trafficking in stolen human body parts allegedly taken from the cadavers donated to the school. Apparently, no body parts were off- limits and were even sent through the U.S. mail system over the past five years. The indictment names Cedric Lodge, who was fired by Harvard last month, along with his wife and several other people. The reaction at Harvard has been outrage. The deans of the medical school said the reported incidents are a betrayal and HMS and most importantly, each of the individuals who altruistically chose to willed their bodies to HMS through the Anatomical Gift Program to advance medical education and research.Researchers in the U.S. and U.K. says they've created the first world's first synthetic human embryo like structures. They did it using stem cells and without not using any actual eggs or sperm. What it created doesn't have a beating heart or even a brain and raises legal and ethical questions. But scientists say these embryo models could some day improve our understanding of the genetic diseases or what causes miscarriages. The embryo-like structures are confined to test tubes and planting them in a womb would be illegal. Police in New Zealand has ceased a record amount of methamphetamine. It was hidden in maple syrup containers in arriving from Canada. Officials say they intercepted almost 1,600 pounds, more than 700 kilograms of meth worth more than $150 million. The seizure was made in January as part of an operation that also involved police in Australia and Canada. Officials say six people have been arrested.
