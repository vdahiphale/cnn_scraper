And - and he's the one -- you know, with everything that Liz and I went through, and we're not asking for sympathy on this, but it's amazing to me the number of Republicans that in quiet, in silence, and he talked about this in his speech, would say, yes, Donald Trump is completely unfit for office, or, I'm so glad you're out there saying what you're saying, Adam. I can't do it because my district wouldn't re-elect me. I'm like, well, OK.But it -- I think the thing that confuses me most is just how people have no red line.

The fever doesn't seem to be breaking. In fact, the organism seems to be evolving so that it always has a fever. I think what's going to probably happen is the question will be put again and again and again, are we ready for a post-Trump Republican Party? I think we're getting an answer that this is not going to be the year where that happens. That's what Chris Christie wanted to try and believe was going to happen. It just didn't - the cards just didn't fall his way. HARLOW: So, you could see his - and he talked about this internal sort of battle he had in his heart, in his mind, and what he talked to his wife, Mary Pat, a lot about making this decision.

Maybe if everybody else on that stage would have taken him on, they actually could have taken down Donald Trump. But I do think he talked a lot, if you'd watch his town halls, he talked a lot about education, he talked a lot about what he did as a blue state Republican governor. But, yes, when he would go after Trump, nobody else did, so that's what kind of hogged the message and it became all about that. I have a ton of respect for him making the effort.

Goldfus' challenge, find all the others. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): And I think the takeaway from that has to be that there is really no fast when you're fighting what he described - Goldfus described as fighting a war that's like a Rubik's cube, where at - you know, you can shift it at every dimension and pieces move. How to figure out how to force Hamas to come out of a tunnel in one place, how to know that they're not going to come out of a tunnel behind you somewhere else. How deep do you go in those tunnels. How dangerous it is for the troops when you put them in those tunnels. All of that makes it complex. So, when Secretary Blinken was here over the past few days, and he spoke about this U.N. commission coming into Gaza to figure out when the conditions for Palestinians to be able to mauve back to the north of Gaza, back to their homes from where they're condensed in the south of Gaza right now, you really understand that that -- actually the conditions from that, from the IDF's perspective, that is going to take some considerable time more.
