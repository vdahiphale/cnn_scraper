In fact, minutes ago, the RSF commander says he has talked to U.S. officials and pledged his assistance when it comes to evacuating Americans.

So that's in a straight line road distances about, you know, a little more -- a little less than double that. So it is a very difficult environment. And the fact that this ceasefire is really very fragile and upholding at all makes it even more difficult for U.S. forces or other forces to go in and rescue a diplomatic personnel or other personnel in a place like Khartoum where the airport has shut down.

It's not like flying a commercial airliner into, you know, say Dulles Airport or JFK or an established airport like this.Once the airports shut down, the civilian airports shut down. The military would have to provide their own air traffic controllers. They would have to secure the perimeter around the airport or the airbase depending where they go. And it would also require them to have continual security around those areas. So I -- you know, kind of what you saw in Kabul back in August of 2021. But hopefully with less, you know, less of a non-permissive environment there. So they'd say, it's a big challenge from that perspective. So security would be number one, making sure the airplanes have the right fuel, and can get not only to Khartoum, but out of Khartoum to a safe location, whether that's Djibouti or Saudi Arabia, or Egypt or some other place. That would have to be done in cooperation with all those other countries. So it's a diplomatic challenge, it's a military challenge. And it's obviously a security challenge right on the ground. And just follow up on that, Colonel Leighton, I mean, as we just read and heard from Larry Madowo talking about how some of the local forces there on the ground are offering to help the Americans in terms of any evacuations that might be needed. But I would assume, based on what you're saying -- what you were just saying a few moments ago, that you're going to want American military personnel to essentially secure any airfield where you have American diplomatic personnel being evacuated. I mean, I assume you're going to want to have that in place, I would think, right?",

So it would require a lot of brokering, a lot of understanding of what the local situation is. And that's sometimes really hard to do in a very fluid moment like this.",

Disney is going to challenge the legality of the -- of what the legislature is trying to do in nullifying what they. It is cuckoo crazy, cuckoo crazy to the point where I think Ron DeSantis is doing himself great harm with mainstream Republicans, actual conservative Republicans who realize that this is insane, and counterproductive, and costly, and stupid, and vindictive. And people have to ask themselves, you know, what is the thing -- the only thing scarier than a governor weaponizing government? A president weaponizing government.

Are they sending mixed messages? We'll talk about that with former NFL linebacker, Chad Brown. There he is. He joins us next. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:3:19] ACOSTA: Three NFL players are banned indefinitely and two others are hit with lighter sanctions after the league accused them of violating its gambling policy. The NFL said Quintez Cephus and CJ Moore of the Detroit Lions and Shaka Toney of the Washington Commanders are facing an indefinite suspension. Shortly after the NFL's announcement, the Lions released Cephus and Moore from their contracts. Two additional Lions players, Stanley Berryhill and Jameson Williams are suspended from the team's first six games of the season. And let's talk now with the former NFL linebacker, Chad Brown. He joins us now. He played more than a dozen seasons with New England, Seattle, and Pittsburgh. Chad, great to see you. What do you think about this gambling situation? Does the League have a problem with this? Is that what we're starting to see emerge?",

Now we have news of this Washington Commander player and Detroit Lion players, but there's also been coaches who have been suspended. There were low level staffers from Detroit Lions earlier this year who were fired due to their gambling connection. So, this partnership while the owners are certainly making money, I think from a public perception standpoint, it begins to chip away at the integrity of the league when players and league office personnel are getting busted for their gambling outside of League protocol.",

There are placards in every locker room outlining the gambling protocols. But even in the midst of that we know gambling can be an issue for some people, so for a league with as many people and players in it as the NFL, there is bound to be every single year a small percentage of guys who cannot help themselves and will cross over those lines the League has tried to put in place.",
