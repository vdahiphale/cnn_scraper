Right now, the top four congressional leaders are behind closed doors with President Biden, trying to hammer out a deal to avoid parts of the government shutting down this Friday. One Republican senator summed up negotiations as a quote, misery March.Plus, get out and vote. Michigan its primary day and some Democrats are refusing to back President Biden over his support for Israel and its retaliatory war in Gaza. What happens at the polls in the next few hours may serve as a critical warning to the president in a state he needs to win reelection. And Cornel West doesn't care about being called a spoiler. But what if his independent presidential run lands Trump back in the Oval Office? I'll talk to Cornel West one-on-one this hour. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start at the White House where as we speak, the big four McConnell, Schumer, Johnson and Jeffries are in the Oval Office with President Biden. And what happens in that room could have major consequences, not just for this country and the ability to keep the government running but for the entire world. Ukraine is in a dire position. President Zelenskyy told my colleague Kaitlan Collins. His country can't stop Putin's forces without more funding. And whether or not the U.S. comes to their aid is pretty much all up to Speaker Johnson at this point. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Arlette, I know they're in there. And we heard briefly from President Biden just a few minutes ago. What are you hearing from White House sources about what his goals are?",

And it comes as there are a few consequential issues facing the president at this moment, the most pressing one being that government shutdown -- with that partial shutdown looming on Friday.Now, the president in his remarks ahead of the meeting said that he -- is Congress's responsibility to keep the government open. He said that a shutdown would be -- have significant impact on the economy if one were to take place. And ahead of the meeting, House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed some optimism over on Capitol Hill, telling reporters that he does think they will be able to prevent a shutdown. So that is part of their discussion today. But the president is also using this meeting, really to ratchet up the pressure on House Speaker Mike Johnson to pass additional assistance for Ukraine. The president has requested $60 billion in assistance for the war-torn country, as well as aid for Israel and Taiwan and some humanitarian assistance as well. The Senate has passed that measure. But so far, House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to bring it up for a vote in the House. Now to highlight the stress that the president wants to put on this issue in that meeting is also National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And the president warned that not getting this aid to Ukraine will severely limit the Ukrainian soldiers' abilities on the battlefield. Take a listen? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Mike Johnson says that the border security needs to be dealt with first to the GOP liking before he green light more aid to Ukraine.

Melanie, I'm going to start with you because you just came from Capitol Hill. You're going to go back right after this. I think the point that Manu made there, which is really critical, when we're talking about the politics of all this.Is that -- it is the Democrats right now who have all the leverage, they hold the cards, for lots of reasons, not the least of which is because Mike Johnson knows that it is not in the Republicans political just stay on shutdown for a second funding the government. It's not even the Republicans political interest to have a government shutdown. And it is -- it is up to him to avoid it.

And that is really what you're seeing Johnson wrestling with right now.Does he came to his right flank, which is pushing for a number of policy demands that Democrats would never go for. Some of them are pushing for a complete shutdown, which Johnson doesn't want to do. He wants to avoid that. But the question is, what does he do? It really is in his court. And I think it's important to remember that walking into the meeting today, he is on an island, because you have McConnell, Schumer, Jeffries and Biden all aligned, they don't want to shut down. They want to have these clean funding bills. And they also want more Ukraine aid. So, Johnson really is on the island here.

This, you know, he has a bipartisan majority in the House that will pass it.There was a bipartisan majority in the Senate that has passed it. But he has chosen, and he could in this moment, sit in the Oval Office and say, I'll put that on the floor, it'll pass it would be done.

What's the status?Short answer, no plan to fight. Here's the long -- longer form of the status. Update, no security, no funding. After passing three continuing resolutions for five months at Pelosi funding levels without promising -- promises to fight the NDA is Tolkien, DEI policy wins. And he goes on and on and on. Fight, fight is what they want Mike Johnson to do. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. And listen, Chip Roy has been sounding off on Mike Johnson for months and months. He is not happy. He is not happy with the fact that nothing has gotten done that the right flank would like him to do. You know, the problem is that the right flank is still a minority. Mike Johnson has a very, very slim majority there, even slimmer now with Tom Suozzi there. So, all they can do at this point is kind of fume, add to that mix, sort of Donald Trump being the puppet master over everything. And Mike Johnson, obviously, wanting to please Donald Trump. So, it is a complicated stew and a mess for the country. This sort of inaction, this ability to come together. And there is a sort of ignoring of reality, right, that they have to work with Democrats. We all know how this is ultimately going to end. It's going to be some sort of bipartisan bill.

Because it's one thing to espouse conservative principles, which the Dave Joyce's of the world absolutely do. I mean, he's a true conservative.

And they've gotten over a million votes already, which when you look at the total turnout, they got in 2020, it was just over 2 million. So, a large proportion of this voting base has already come and made their voices heard. Yes, I'm not going to -- I'll spare you the full walk and talk here. Since obviously, we've got a little bit of an absence of voters right now. They've streamed in over the course of today. And you mentioned look, there's no surprises necessarily on who is expected to win on the Democratic primary side and on the Republican primary side. But a lot of general election clues that we could get based on what voters are saying over the course of today. We just talked to one Biden voter a little bit earlier, who said he is voting Biden because he wants to return decency back to the White House. Now the Trump voter we spoke to said, he doesn't necessarily think Trump is a decent person, but likes the policies that he's bringing and wants to see him back in the White House. So, it'll be interesting to see some of that dynamic. But of course, also, within the Democratic side of things, a large push to vote uncommitted, instead of voting for Joe Biden, especially from the Arab American community here in Michigan, which is the largest community of any state in the country, over his handling of the war in Israel and Gaza.

I think the context going into tonight's voting is -- and I'm just channeling him right now. It's really important to say that, yes, this is an effort to get people to vote uncommitted, which is actually on the ballot. You can check the box or pull the lever for uncommitted versus Joe Biden. It has happened before without any big efforts. Barack Obama, he got -- there were 174,000 total votes and there was a 21,000 uncommitted, when he was on the ballot and there was no such effort. So that just gives a little bit of context, going into what we're going to see tonight.",

They're trying to get, I think 10,000, uncommitted votes, is what they said. But look, it's not just the number of votes, it's where they're coming from. That's something else the White House is going to be looking at very closely.They're looking at places like Dearborn, like Detroit. They're looking at black voters, they're looking at suburban women. They're looking at union workers, all key pieces of Biden's coalition and they're going to look at tonight's results and see how much work he has to do come November. But it's also the same for Donald Trump. And I know we'll get into that. But both of them are going to have a very better look after tonight of what it's going to be like and just remember.",
