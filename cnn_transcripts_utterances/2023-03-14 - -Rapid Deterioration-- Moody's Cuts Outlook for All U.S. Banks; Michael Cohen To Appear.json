This as the Justice Department investigates Silicon Valley Bank and its CEO.My exclusive interview tonight with a senior chairman and former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, is next. Plus, a Russian fighter jet forces an American drone to crash into the Black Sea, fears growing of escalation as the battle in Bakhmut Intensifies further, a Ukrainian soldier on the front lines is my guest tonight. And, Ron DeSantis does a complete 180. The Florida governor now says backing Ukraine is not in America's best interest. It is the opposite of what he said when he was in Congress. You will hear for yourself what the KFILE found. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, rapid deterioration those are the words used by the bond credit rating king Moody's. That's how they're describing the entire banking sector in the United States today, downgrading their outlook for American banks to negative, warning of sharply rising deposit costs. And then they go on to say, quote, pressures will persist and be exacerbated by more increases in interest rates. And here's the thing, Moody's views matter. They're rating impact the prices that banks pay to do business, the price of loans. And Moody's is sounding the alarm after bank failures began with Silicon Valley Bank, something that the chair of the Senate Banking Committee said today requires more government action. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH):  We clearly need stronger capital standards. We clearly need stronger liquidity standards. We clearly need to do the strength and the stress test.

And the aggressive hikes we've seen the past months have come at a pace that we have not seen in American history in 40 years.And that increase in interest rates were at the heart of Silicon Valley Bank's problems, as economic analyst and OUTFRONT regular Jim Bianco pointed out the other day, it was six days ago that traders thought there was an 80 percent chance that we would get another increase in interest rates of half a percentage point next week. As of yesterday, there was almost an even chance that the Fed might cut rates. Rate is changing day by day. But this is the whiplash, the economic whiplash that we're talking about here. And it can lead to more volatility. No one understands the situation, the health of the U.S. bank system better than Lloyd Blankfein. He's the senior chairman, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs. And I'm going to speak exclusively with him in just a moment, his first interview since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. But this all comes on the context of the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, they are now investigating Silicon Valley Bank. Shareholders themselves are suing the bank and top executives like the CEO, Greg Becker, according to \"Reuters\". And this has come to light less than two weeks before SVB's collapse, Becker sold nearly $3.6 million in bank shares. That's according to \"Barron's\". Anyone else right now, that would be worth zero. Becker also pressed Congress in 2015 to exempt Silicon Valley Bank from new regulation because of the, quote, low risk profile of our activities and business model. Congress ultimately did just that. And just a few months ago, Becker was touting the strength of SVB and its prospects for the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because of the action that the government has taken so far, I think it would be very, very hard for a bank to go under at this point. They can take their securities they have and use them as collateral and get financing not only for the value of securities they have, but including the losses on that security so they will have money.At the same time, if they do lose deposits, that those deposits they can borrow from the -- that same money they'll borrow from the Fed, but at a much higher rate. So to the extent that the banks had a margin, they invest -- whatever they were making from their investments versus what they were paying for deposits, they will be paying more for the money that they get from the Fed. And so, whatever -- if it was negative before, their revenue might be a bigger negative. So, I can see at the same time, we're not afraid of the banks going under, the market may consider that the banks may not make as much money.

He's the key witness in a case investigating a hush money payment to adult film star, Stormy Daniels.That payment made just days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors handling the case are signaling that a criminal indictment for Trump could be coming soon. The former President slamming this case in a fundraising email today, saying prosecutors are trying to 'destroy our MAGA movement.' And his attorney is doing a media blitz now claiming that Trump himself is the victim in this case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE TACOPINA, ATTORNEY FOR FMR. PRESIDENT TRUMP: President Trump has denied from day one having an affair with this woman. What he is, is an extortion victim. She came out right before the campaign and said or the election and said, unless you pay me I'm going to make a public story about something that he says is completely untrue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
