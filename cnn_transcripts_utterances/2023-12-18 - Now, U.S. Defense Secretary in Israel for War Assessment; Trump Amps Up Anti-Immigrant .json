Let's get straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, the U.S. officials that have been on the ground in Israel consistently, particularly over the course of the last couple of weeks, do we have any sense whether they will have influence or leverage to change the direction of where this conflict has been headed?",

And so they really have to work through what the next phase of this war is going to look like and how quickly it will come with their American partners.The United States is Israel's top provider of security assistance, of weapons, of munitions, and therefore they have to listen to the United States as they prepare for the next phase of this war in Gaza and also for the possibility, again, that still exists of a widening war in the north with Lebanon, with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Today, the U.S. defense secretary is meeting with his defense counterpart, as well as Israel's war cabinet. He's also going to sit down with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And what he's going to be looking for is for specific assurances and milestones of what kind of progress they feel like they still need to make in their war against Hamas before they can transition to a less intense phase of the campaign, one that is not going to look like what we see now, with extensive of Gaza, an all-out ground offensive, and instead transitioning to something that's much more special forces-oriented, intelligence- driven operations to go after senior Hamas commanders. It's interesting. The last time the Secretary of Defense was here was about two months ago, and I spoke with him on the tarmac of an air force base in Israel where he was actually overseeing the delivery of additional U.S. munitions to Israel. And I asked him about what kinds of assurances he had received from Israel, especially amid the mounting toll of civilian casualties about how they would be used. At the time, he expressed confidence in Israel being a professionally led military, and he said he's confident that they would do the right thing. But now, amid that mounting -- continuing to mount civilian deaths toll, there's no question that the U.S. is looking for additional assurances from Israel as it prepares to provide additional support over the coming weeks.",

Unlike other tunnels where you would have to walk single file, very narrow tunnels for people, this one can have vehicles go through it. The Israeli military said you could drive a large vehicle through it, and that may very well have been one of the purposes of this type of tunnel.There are electronic systems, ventilation, communication systems throughout this tunnel. It's part of a network of about two and a half miles of tunnels, and it emerges about a quarter mile from the Erez crossing, which is one of the key crossing points between Israel and Gaza. It's also where Hamas militants attacked on October 7th to carry out their deadly attacks that day. The Israeli military is systematically discovering more of these tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip. Hamas has said that they have hundreds of miles of these tunnels. They continue to present a significant threat to Israeli forces on the ground, where they have been ambushed by Hamas fighters using these tunnels. And so the Israeli military discovering and destroying these tunnels as they go on with this campaign.",

And Chris Christie, who, of course, is a no friend these days of Donald Trump, said what I think a lot of the critics have said is that Trump is essentially blowing a dog whistle to a lot of people blaming the troubles that you may have, the very real troubles with the economy or things that have been driven from other parts of the world on this group of people, demonizing them essentially. And if you remember, this draws many similarities to what President Trump did in his 2016 campaign when build the wall was the focal point of his campaign, at least the immigration policy at that point. For some of the same reasons or claims that we are now seeing in this final stretch, he clearly thinks it's going to work. And I guess we're just going to have to see.",

On the other hand, this is really complicated. And the lead negotiator, Senator Chris Murphy, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, both underscored that point last night when I was on Capitol Hill, and they had broken from about a three-hour meeting.And, you know, reporters were repeatedly asking, are you going to have a framework tonight? Do you have any announcement to make? And they both said, we don't have any special announcement. We are making progress, but this is really hard to do. And despite the fact that they believe that they can continue having these conversations, they're going to be back at the negotiating table today, the chances that they have a deal, that they can write legislative texts, that they can communicate this with their members and be ready to vote by the end of the week, I think that's a really high bar. And at this point, it may even be an unrealistic one to meet. And there are a lot of Republican senators who are sounding the alarm that this is something that they should pause on and come back in January to deal with, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  This is a catastrophe, and it's a result of the Biden open border policies. SEN. LIDNSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  The bottom line here is we feel like we're being jammed. We're not anywhere close to a deal. It will go into next year. The policy choices of the Biden administration has made the border a dangerous place to come to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we know that state party officials are going to meet in early January to officially remove Ziegler from his chairmanship.Now, over the weekend, party officials told me, look, at this point, there was nothing that Christian Ziegler can tell them that is going to change their minds. They believe that he has to go. As you noted at an emergency meeting here in Orlando on Sunday, the party stripped Ziegler of his duties and his salaries in a meeting where we're told that Ziegler tried to apologize to board members as well as defend himself. But those were remarks that were told were not welcomed by party officials. Now, over the weekend, there had been some talk that Ziegler was trying to score a buyout, but that is something that Christian Ziegler told me was 100 percent a lie. And it is something that party officials said at this point, it is not going to take place. They want Christian Ziegler out on his own. Ziegler himself has been under investigation since October when a woman told the Sarasota Police Department that Christian raped her after a planned sexual encounter between Christian Ziegler, the woman and Christian's wife, Bridget Ziegler, fell through. The woman told police that she canceled on that encounter after learning that Bridget could not attend, but Christian still showed up at her home in Sarasota where the alleged assault took place. As you noted, Ziegler has not been charged and he says that the sex was consensual. Here now is the vice chair of the Florida Republican Party describing why everyone in Florida, from Governor DeSantis to both senators here in Florida, as well as county level officials, believe that Ziegler has to go.
