They're asking the judge to hold him in contempt, and fine him a $1,000 for each alleged violation. The latest filing comes in the wake of another one, earlier this week, accusing Trump of three other violations of that limited gag order. The news continues. \"THE SOURCE\" starts now.

      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Please be seated. The 12 New Yorkers will decide the fate of a former President of the United States, now criminal defendant. A roller coaster day in court ends with a jury of his peers now picked, in the case of the People of the State of New York versus Donald J. Trump. What we've learned tonight with opening statements as soon as Monday. Also, why prosecutors are refusing to tell the defense, who their first witnesses are. The judge appearing to agree that the former President simply can't be trusted for certain, to contain himself. And the Kennedys versus a Kennedy. Six of RFK Jr.'s own siblings very publicly snubbed their brother, and endorsed Joe Biden for reelection. My source tonight is RFK Jr.'s sister, Kerry Kennedy. Is it a family feud, or just plain politics? I'm John King in for Kaitlan Collins. This is THE SOURCE. A rough start, but then rapid progress, on day three. Rough because two jurors previously seated in Donald Trump's historic hush money trial, were stunningly dismissed. A New York criminal court quickly though made up for lost time, not only filling those two lost seats, but also picking five more jurors, to round out the full panel of 12, seven men and five women, one alternate juror also selected, before the court wrapped for the day. The search goes on for more jurors, tomorrow. We don't know all the specifics, about why those two jurors were excused. One though did raise concerns that part of her identity was being shared publicly. Prosecutors raised concern about the other juror, though the judge did not make public, the ultimate reason for letting him go. What we do know is that Trump made it through the whole process today without getting scolded by the judge, like he did on Tuesday, for muttering aloud and potentially intimidating some of those jurors. He was said to be engrossed with the process, today, craning his neck at times, to get a good view of those seated in the jury box, as they gave their answers. When he left the courtroom, an attempt to sway a different jury. Voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial. These are all stories, this is over the last few days, from legal experts. This is Wall Street Journal editorial. But all of these are stories from legal experts, saying how this is not a case.

That actually went on and on and on for a couple of minutes.He complained, yes, he complained about the temperature in the courtroom, and also about the trial taking him off the campaign trail. But according to him, all his legal troubles are actually helping his campaign. Time, of course will tell us about that. First, Donald J. Trump has to get through the trial. A load to take apart on day three. We also just heard, for the first time, from one of those two jurors dismissed today, after being sworn in. We'll tell you why prosecutors won't be sharing their list of first witnesses, with the Trump team, with the blessing so far, at least of the judge. But first, let's get right to some of our best legal sources. Our CNN Anchor, Chief Legal Analyst, Laura Coates. CNN Legal Analyst, and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Attorney, Renato Stabile. And veteran New York trial attorney, Arthur Aidala. Laura, let's begin with you. First big picture, then we'll get into some of the specifics. What stands out to you about the jury? We now have the 12, seven men, and five women, plus the one alternate more to come. But what stands out to you about this jury? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: The breadth of what their experiences are. Some don't have social media. Others have been well-versed in reading \"The Art of the Deal,\" and also find him, in some way, intriguing. But others are from different states, not native New Yorkers. Others are from different countries. You've got really the gamut of the cultural melting pot that is New York, which really makes you wonder who is going to be either the wildcard or the blank slate you can actually persuade. That's going to be where the jurors are going to have the most impact, for these particular attorneys.",

In the Harvey Weinstein case, we did it four months ahead of time, under seal, with a sealed courtroom, when we had the hearing.So, those are the first two things. The third thing I'm doing is Your Honors of the Appellate Division, you had a juror, who they -- we asked for cause. She said she doesn't like this guy. She doesn't like this guy. And they still sat him, when there was 500 people outside. I want to -- I want a reversal on that as well. And I'm giving up on juror 11. I'm just saying OK, Mr. Trump, we're not getting an acquittal here. We're getting a hung jury at best. And so let's focus on the three or four people, who are going to say, no, no, no, we're not convicting this guy.

Joining me now to discuss is Kerry Kennedy, the sister of RFK Jr., and a human rights activist who introduced President Biden at today's event. Kerry Kennedy, grateful for your time. Describing your brother's candidacy as dangerous, is that because you view it as dangerous, because it could cost Joe Biden the election? Or do you think your brother would be a dangerous president? Does he not have the temperament or the experience? K. KENNEDY: No, I think, you know, this is an extraordinary election. We are on the precipice, here in the United States. There's only two candidates, who have any prayer of getting the 270 electoral votes that they need to become president. One is Trump. The other is Biden. Trump has said that he wants to rewrite the Constitution, so that he can go after his enemies, including members of the press. He said that he will be a dictator on day one. He's proudly said that he packed the Supreme Court, in order to overturn Roe v. Wade, and take away women's rights over their health care. The list goes on and on and on. President Biden, on the other hand, came in at a time, with a disastrous economy, has built that up, has overseen 15 -- 14 million new jobs, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, has always been on the side of women, wrote the Violence Against Women Act, is -- and marched with the United Auto Workers, and has spent his entire life working on behalf of working men and women in this country. Not the enormous corporations and the wealthiest Americans who Trump has said he's going to give a tax cut to. So, I think the choice is clear. It's either Trump or Biden. And a vote that's not for Biden is, let's be clear, a vote for Trump. Don't do it. Vote for Trump -- excuse me. Vote for Biden.",

President Trump spent a month trying to overturn a free election, and then fomented an insurrection at the Capitol. That's very, very clear. There's no question about it. So, he has said he wants to be a dictator on day one. He has cozied up to Putin, to the dictators in North Korea, in China, in Turkey, and beyond.

Let's not talk about who might or might not be a good president. The question today is who do you vote for? When you go to the polls, are you going to vote for a country based on -- on -- you know, when Martin Luther King died, and my father was speaking in Indianapolis to a crowd that John Lewis had organized for him?

We know that looking at flight radar, flight tracking, that a number of flights have diverted their flights over the skies and away from the skies over Iran this evening. We also understand that a NOTAM, a no-fly zone has been declared in the west of Iran as well. There are a number of other cities, where we've heard, from local sources on the ground, locally reported, unconfirmed by us, that there have been other explosions. We can also say that earlier on, this evening, a number of small earthquakes were detected in Iran. All of these different developments, John, we're trying to piece together, to give a complete picture of what is happening. Of course, there has been huge expectation that Israel was going to strike back, in a decisive way, at Iran. Indeed Prime Minister Netanyahu said, just a couple of days ago, that that would be happening. And the British Foreign Secretary indicated he understood there will be strikes in Iran. What we are trying to assess, right now, is who is behind these explosions, reported in Isfahan, what the bigger picture is adding up to, at the moment, and therefore, the implications that this might lead to.
