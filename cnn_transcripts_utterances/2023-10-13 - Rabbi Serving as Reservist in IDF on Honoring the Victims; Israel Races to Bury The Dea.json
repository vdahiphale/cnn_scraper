Aryeh Shlomo Ziering was a 27 year old dual Israeli American citizen who was a captain in the Israel Defense Forces canine unit. Danielle Waldman attended the music festival where her boyfriend and she were killed. And Itay Glisko was 20 years old and an Israeli soldier his family said his death is, \"a loss to humanity\". 1300 Israelis have been killed in Hamas's attack that is the count thus far. Now in Israel families are starting to bury the loved ones. Joining us now is Rabbi Elyada Goldwicht reservists working with an Israel Defense Forces Search and Rescue Unit in Central Israel.Rabbi, thank you for being with us. Your perspective on all of this is so unique because as a rabbi, you are working to comfort those and bury those while also stepping up to serve your country. What is your perspective now six days after the attack?",

Basically, my role in the Army is to as quickly as possible identify those who were murdered, brutally murdered, raped, killed, in the most tedious ways possible.And we try to do so as fast as possible, because we know that right now there are hundreds of families in Israel who do not know if their son, daughter, brother, sister, father mother was murdered was taken captive and who knows what's happening to them by, you know, the Hamas or if they're just shell shocked and hidden, you know, under some shelf somewhere. So we know that every minute that's wasted is a minute that a family is not getting closure and the soldiers on the front line. So we feel that Israel is really right now fighting on two fronts, there's the front of defending ourselves, making sure that the terrorists do not invade. And murderous like has happened throughout our history, unfortunately, many times that so many thousands of people have tried to annihilate the Jewish people. And then the second front is to give closure to these families as quickly as possible, and really do that in most respectful and dignified way.",

But at least in their organizing principles, they acknowledged that there is a role to play for a Jewish state. Now, you know, I don't know how much they mean that. There are obviously some nuances involved in there. But Hamas exists for the express purpose of destroying Israel and eliminating the Jewish state, in fact that the Hamas argument basically to Palestinians is, trust us instead of the Palestinian Authority, we are even harsher than they are, we will kill more Jews, and we will run them out of here. And we will create the Palestinian state that stretches all of what we know today to be Israel, not just the West Bank, and not just Gaza.

OK, that those are two very different things. It's disturbing to see it internationally. It's really disturbing to see Americans and people here in the United States of America, in the streets marching, in response to a call from the organization that just carried out these atrocities. I think that's very disturbing to see that play out. Now, as far as the region is concerned, look, I think the Jordanians are nervous right about what could happen there and their own streets. I think the Egyptians are nervous in that regard. And that's why they do not want to allow Palestinian refugees into Egypt. I think multiple countries in the region are nervous about the views of their own population, which is why I think you see some of them put out statements, even as they, from a back doorway, cooperate with Israel on many things, put out the statements because they have their own streets to manage. So that's a real concern. And then the other obviously is, you know, we have to keep a very close eye as Israel does move into Gaza and tries to eradicate Hamas. What happens then does that now force or trigger a response from Hezbollah, and from Iran and from other elements that aligned with them.",

I think from the point of view of the Biden administration, if you think about how the President has reacted this week with, I think, refreshing moral clarity about what this was a terrorist attack against Israel.I think one of the reasons he's done that and is so stalwart in his support for Israel is to have influence over some of those questions about what is next? You worry about a two front row war and the role of Hezbollah in the north. Is there an opportunity here to perhaps empower the Palestinian Authority? American governments going back to George W. Bush have been 100 percent behind a two state solution, the creation of a Palestinian state. And President Biden, his administration would support that as well. But you've got to have real Palestinian leadership. Hamas is not leadership, Hamas is terrorism. Hamas is just wants to destroy Israel. There's no negotiation with Hamas. The Palestinian Authority has at least the potential as Senator Rubio was alluding to. To be a real partner is problematic is that it's been over the years. So I think that's what you look for down the road. But I think the intermediate step is the extent to which President Biden and his team have the ability to have any influence over what's about to transpire in Gaza, over the days and weeks to come, which I'm sure is going to be just a continuation of the horror, and the ugliness of what we've seen, because it is a war and I think the Israeli leadership has made very clear what they're prepared to do now.",
