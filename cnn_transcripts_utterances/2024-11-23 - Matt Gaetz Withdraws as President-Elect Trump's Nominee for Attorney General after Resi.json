Today we're asking, after the Matt Gaetz debacle and concerns about other nominees, will Senate Republicans reject more of Donald Trump's cabinet picks.Then, peace through strength? We'll break down President Biden's change of mind on Ukraine and whether it could lead to the end of the war. And later, if it's good enough for LeBron, is it good enough for you? The ginormous bed that's all the rage this holiday season. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, Donald Trump's transition troubles. This week his pick for attorney general withdrew from consideration, and his choice for defense secretary tried to build Senate support amid sexual assault allegations as Republicans on Capitol Hill walk a tightrope, handling Trump's controversial nominees.

Welcome back, everyone.Kristen, let's start with the Gaetz rejection by Senate Republicans. How big a setback for Donald Trump? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CONSERVATIVE POLLSTER AND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CONTRIBUTING OPINION WRITER:  I think I mentioned on the show last week that this was Donald Trump was a raptor testing the fences. He has discovered that they are electrified, that there are some places that Senate Republicans simply will not go. I think that Gaetz was always going to be the hardest sell. I am not surprised to see him have to withdraw. I do think that the Republican senators want to get to yes on everybody else, and I think that includes Pete Hegseth. WALLACE:  We'll get to that in a moment. But I do want to talk about the message here. Trump was riding high after the election, picking cabinet nominees at a record pace, telling the Senate to go on recess and give his choices a pass. But now Gaetz appears to be the earliest failed cabinet pick in modern history. Nia, how big a reality check for Donald Trump? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, OPINION COLUMNIST, \"BLOOMBERG\":  Well, listen, I think Donald Trump thought he was going to be able to muscle Matt Gaetz through. If you think about it, this is his second defeat in the face of this Republican Senate. He really wanted Rick Scott to be the majority leader. They picked John Thune. So now with Matt Gaetz, they sort of said no, thank you, to Donald Trump. He was threatening a lot of these folks with primary challenges that were going to be backed by Elon Musk, and they still turned their backs on what Matt Gaetz was going to be. And I think he sort of has misread or overread the mandate, overread his ability to power through this Republican Congress and this the Senate.",

Some of us already believed that some of this is improvisational. Some of this is testing the guardrails, number one. Number two, some of us also believed that the genius of the framers is that, guess what, senators are elected to six-year terms. Senators are jealously protective of their institution and their prerogatives. And so the idea that he was going to somehow get all of these Republican senators, all these senators period, to subordinate themselves to him, it was always a bit of a fanciful sense. I think that this was very, very predictable.",

He went through Zoe Baird, then Kimba Wood, then finally Janet Reno, someone that he did not know at all. These things happen.What's happening now is that the cycle is much faster.

He wants to dominate the media narrative. He is fascinated by television. He wants these people to go out and be his spokesperson. And really, he thinks that that is why he won the election, that he was able to kind of dominate the new media game, that he was really able to penetrate parts of the country that were not penetrated before. And I think that he believes that these people are going to be able to do that. And again, he's planning on radically remaking government.

And I don't know that it's going to have the intended effect, as Kristen points out, of actually leaving Ukraine in a stronger position. Putin's strategy has always been one of a waiting game, of waiting out the American system of democracy, to have -- to leech support for Ukraine and or have a different administration come in.
