      "sentences": "Hey, Boris and Brianna.So closing arguments have finished up in the last day of this trial and Carroll's attorneys arguing to the jury that the only way to stop Donald Trump from repeating these defamatory statements is to make him pay. They say that E. Jean Carroll should get at least $24 million in compensatory damages and, what they said, a large amount in punitive damages, so asking for a big amount of money. Because the question they put to this jury, they said, this case is about punishing Donald Trump for what he's done and what he continues to do. And they said that even after that jury last year found him libel of sexually assaulting Carroll and defaming her, that he continued to repeat those statements just 24 hours later at a CNN town hall. That was the moment that Donald Trump got up and left the courtroom during Carroll's attorney's closing arguments. They also told the jury, one of the defense arguments has been that Carroll has asked for this. And her lawyer said, when you make an allegation against a sitting president, and he uses his massive megaphone to go after you, more people are going to know who you are. They said the hate mail, the threats that she's gotten, they parrot Donald Trump's words, so trying to tie the negative statements, the threats that she's received to Donald Trump. Now, his lawyers and their closing statements, he returned to the courtroom for this. They did make their argument that E. Jean Carroll was seeking some kind of publicity from this, that she was enjoying the attention she got when she went public, even reading some of her own words that she'd given in interviews immediately following that. They said that the former president is not responsible for Twitter trolls, that he does not condone what they said. And they're saying that it's wrong of Carroll to try to ask this jury to make Donald Trump pay for, as she put it, mean tweets. And she also cited from Carroll's friend that Donald Trump was called as a witness, some of the text messages that she sent privately where she said that Carroll was like Santa at the Christmas parade, enjoying the attention she was getting, but Carroll's team asking the jury that -- saying that a person can enjoy moments, but they can also be deeply hurt and threatened by some of the things that happened. So, right now, the judge is instructing the jury. That is expected to take about a half-an-hour or so. Once that's completed, then jury deliberations will begin.",

It's a very important case in its own right, but also as a forecast of how he might behave in the coming criminal trials that could lie ahead this year.[13:05:00] Four are currently on the schedule. And I think his walking out and his other shenanigans during the trial, his loudly proclaiming that it's a con job, his shaking his head, his grimacing, which led the judge to chastise him several times, actually prove the malice. Now, if the jury is sympathetic, maybe some of these behaviors might fan those sympathies. But looking at the proof, at E. Jean Carroll's powerful testimony of how she was injured and all of the evidence that came in, the greater likelihood is that the jury is going to tag Donald Trump with a very large damages number. And his walking out, the rudeness that that represents, that these comments and grimaces will actually be used by the jury to say, gee, this is somebody who really does have malice. That's the test.",

And it's impossible for jurors to erase something very striking.Having often appeared before juries and talked to them afterwards, they do pick up on everything that happens. And, of course, that's why we have multiple jurors. It's not just one person. It's nine people who are watching, and then they go back and they trade notes. And I think one comment that Trump made that the judge ordered stricken will have some resonance with the jury. I don't think it'll be enough to help him with -- but it's the comment where he said, \"I did it for myself, my family, and for the presidency.\" So what he's doing there is saying, I didn't act with malice. It wasn't with bad intent. I was defending myself. If there's one juror who is a Trump sympathizer, that line, despite being stricken, speaks to that person. It has a certain commonsensical resonance. I don't think it's going to be enough, but there is that risk of a juror going rogue. We call that jury nullification. It's a risk. I don't think we're going to get that here.",

Take us through what that could mean. EISEN:  Damages are calculated in two categories. There's compensatory damages, and we have just seen a request to make Carroll whole. That's things like hiring a consultant and having a campaign to repair her reputation, the pain and suffering that she has endured. That's $24 million. Then, to send a lesson, when a defendant is found to have acted with bad intent, malice, that he wanted to hurt E. Jean Carroll, you multiply that compensatory damages number by an X-factor. The factor can be quite high. There is a limit. They couldn't order billions in damages. Normally, the upper ceiling is about 10 times compensatory. So, you could be looking here, if there is a true home run, and the proof has come in powerfully, the argument has been strong, Trump wasn't allowed to speak -- you could be looking at multiple times of $24 million, and that would send a message.",

In a way, it is also very disappointing that the court did not rule in favor for an immediate cease-fire at this time, because I personally believe that that is what the people need.

How significant is this? PIERRE-RICHARD PROSPER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR WAR CRIME ISSUES:  Well, I think it's significant in the sense that the court did not rule that Israel is committing genocide. Really, what we have here is a placeholder decision where the court wants to reserve jurisdiction to review this before, because evaluating whether a nation or an individual has committed genocide is very complex and it comes down to the intent. So what they decided to do was essentially say, preserve information, report back to us in a month or, so we stay updated.

The perpetrator has to have the intent to destroy the group in whole or in part. So, in this case, South Africa or others would need to prove that Israel is out to destroy the Palestinian people in its entirety, effectively. And that is a difficult task for any court to evaluate and anyone to prove. So, again, what the court did here is that it's plausible in a sense where people are dying, but they don't have any evidence or sufficient evidence to discuss the question of, what was Israel's intent in the specific acts? Because lastly, again, Israel will argue that these -- the civilians are casualties, if you will, collateral damage, if you will, but that they're not -- they don't have the intent to kill the population; they're going after Hamas.",
