What we have been waiting for and still waiting for, which is news of this deal being finalized.At this point, Israel and the cabinet there is working on that, this deal to release about 50 hostages, women and children, from inside Gaza. But we also heard -- Eyal, I will ask you about this -- the argument or the reporting from the IDF spokesperson that the incursion is still under way inside Gaza, and it will until and unless this deal happens. And what they're doing is they're trying to, in his words, expose more hospitals. We've been looking for days and days at Al Shifa and at what Israelis say and they showed American media, and media from around the world, some tunnels and some weapons. Looks like they're going to do the same at other hospitals, which your government --",

Unfortunately, this -- we knew this for many years, and the ability to expose this is important because people need to understand what terrorist organizations such as Hamas is doing. We've been telling everybody that they're using their people ashumidity shields. Very difficult to believe us when we just say it, unless we can put footage. We talked about Shifa over the last few weeks. Before that there was a children's hospital where we found evidence of hostages, baby hostages, kept in tunnels underneath the hospital. The IDF found motorcycles where they carried hostages into the hospital, connected to the network of tunnels. This is what they do. Hiding underneath the hospitals where they know we will not bomb from the air is just -- this is the role. We need to fight them while we maintain our values, maintain the international law. We need to reach places, otherwise we cannot remove Hamas from the leadership of Gaza. We will continue to do that at other hospitals because they continue to use it. They're underneath schools, underneath mosques, every civilian infrastructure they can hide underneath because they know we will not bomb them from the air.",

If Prime Minister Netanyahu brought this to a vote, he probably knows it has the approval because of the way things are. This is the way it should be. The pushback from the other ministers are important also to address what David said before. I'm sure their message is that we need to continue the fighting until we get all of our goals, and this will be imminent, with the discussions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Biden, after this deal is hopefully approved in the near future. We'll wait and see.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think, you know, it's very interesting to hear Eyal's comments about this because that internal process is going to be really important when it comes to the future phase of this war. You know, what is Israel going to do next? That is going to really depend on its ability to realize those strategic goals that it has. It was interesting hearing the IDF spokesman talk about not only is the goal right now to get the hostages, but the other goal is still to eliminate Hamas. And if Hamas is to be eliminated, that, you know, that may counteract some of the other things that have been going on in this immediate future.",

If it wasn't for the military going after the leadership of Hamas, we wouldn't have this deal.I think the anger of the people is because of the situation. The Israeli public has been failed by the government. The Israeli public has been failed by the military. The military's purpose is to defend against enemies, against Hamas in this particular case, and failed miserably our own people on October 7th. The level of anger is high all over. Specifically on this, I understand the reality. If IDF hasn't done what it has done, they wouldn't release any of them. They delivered two voluntarily first time, Dana, when two American women were released and then another two, and then Israel rescued a soldier that we knew where she was and until then we only get corps. This will be the first time this is done. This wouldn't have happened or occurred unless the pressure on Hamas.",

A deal to free about 50 hostages, we are told, who are held by Hamas, this could be imminent.And that source, one of the sources that our team is talking to, say that the hostages to be released would be the first phase of a potential deal. Israeli citizens and dual nationals are among those who they are talking about. Women and a lot of children, according to our own Becky Anderson. As we speak, the Israeli government is meeting to review this potential deal. An announcement could happen very soon. Sources say that the agreement would call for the release, as I mentioned, of 50 women and children. The source telling CNN most will be children. In exchange, there would be a four to five-day pause in fighting. Now three Palestinian prisoners would be released for each civilian hostage released and Israel would stop flying surveillance drones over Gaza for at least six hours a day. Meantime, there is another potential front. The militant group, Hezbollah, says it is launching attacks on northern Israel in response to the killing of journalists and civilians in Lebanon today. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is live in Beirut. Ben, what can you tell us about what's happening there in?",

That apparently, they were using that vehicle in order to launch these attacks against this air base. So yet another response by the U.S. here to these groups that have been launching these attacks on U.S. forces, over 60 times since October 17th, that have resulted in dozens of injuries among U.S. servicemembers at bases in Iraq and Syria. Roughly 64 times American personnel have been attacked by these Iran- backed proxy groups. U.S. officials say these groups are taking advantage of the broader regional tensions to stage these attacks and send a message to the U.S. and its allies that they are not going to be safe. However, the U.S. responding to airstrikes in Syria and now this strike against these militant groups in Iraq. It remains to be seen whether these groups will be deterred by this -- Dana?",
