JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military hidden under hospital. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): On Thursday, Gaza again found itself under a total communications blackout according to a U.N. agency. This time, due to fuel shortages. Many hospitals in Gaza have already shut down. As the medical system collapses, getting updates from inside has become more difficult by the day. Israel may now be preparing to expand its ground operations after previously telling Gazans to evacuate from the north, leaflets dropped in South Gaza Wednesday warn people to move and head towards known shelters.

The families of the hostages continued their march toward Jerusalem, stopping at the home of Noa Marciano who died in Gaza.

The IDF did not mention a specific cause of death. The IDF spokesperson says she had been murdered by Hamas.

She says that she was raped in her own home when she tried to leave him. That she was often beaten, kicked, punched, stomped on, resulting in bruises and burst lips black eyes and bleeding. That he blew up a man's car at one point when he thought that that man was interested in her. That he introduced her to a lifestyle of excessive alcohol, substance abuse and required her to produce illicit prescriptions to satisfy his own addictions. Now, there are always two sides to every story. And his attorney has released a statement to CNN which reads, in part, Mr. Combs denies these offenses and outrageous allegations. For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail, baseless and outrageous lies aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs' reputation and simply seeking a pay day.

Of course, it is not a lie. It is an ugly fact. Though the rapes have not gotten as much attention as the murders.Israeli authorities have only recently begun their investigations into these atrocities. But sadly, often the evidence has been lost along with the victims. A warning, the story we're about to show you contains graphic content and it assuredly will be disturbing to most viewers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): In the aftermath of the October 7 attacks by Hamas, Israel's focus immediately turned to war into identifying the bodies of those slaughtered by Hamas in Israel's largest mass casualty attack. But now Israel is launching an investigation into allegations of rape and other forms of sexual violence on that deadly day. Israeli police are starting to build rape cases relying on eyewitness testimony, video, and forensic evidence, as well as Hamas interrogations. Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy named Chair of the civil commission on October 7 crimes by Hamas against women and children points to one reason why the investigations have been so difficult. DR. COCHAV ELKAYAM, CHAIR, CIVIL COMMISSION ON HAMAS OCT. 7 CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN: We'll never know everything that has happened to them. We know that most women who were raped and who were sexually assaulted were also murdered, and it will take time. Even in other atrocities it takes time until the crimes against women are revealed until survivors even share their stories. TAPPER (voice-over): Still, CNN found witnesses to the atrocities and their aftermath. \"G,\" a paramedic and Israel's elite 669 Special tactics rescue units went house to house and kibbutz Be-eri, one of the sights of the worst massacres. He did not want to be identified on camera. \"G\": While we're sorting through those houses, one of the doors I open it's a bedroom. I see two girls, two teenagers, I guess 13 or 14 years old, one was lying on the floor, one was lying on the bed. One on the floor, she's lying on your stomach. Her pants are pulled down towards her knees. And there's a bullet wound on her backside of her neck in her head and there's a puddle of blood around her head. And there's remains of semen on the lower part of her back. TAPPER (voice-over): \"G\" says the other teenage girl also appear to have been assaulted. \"G\": There's a bullet wound on the upper part of her chest. And there's bruises all over her body. So, no, these are two girls that were just killed, executed, perhaps raped in their own bedroom. TAPPER (voice-over): Israeli police say the body's at Shura, one of the handful of sites where dead bodies are brought for identification, show trauma consistent with rape and assault.

And it often seemed to be gratuitous cruelty, abject cruelty, because it was seemed to have been done just to mutilate them. The women we saw were not just killed. They were cruelly, cruelly mutilated in many parts of their bodies.TAPPER (voice-over): Women's groups say the humiliation women experienced as they were paraded through the street, thrown on the backs of motorcycles and degraded either before or after they were killed at the festival that also constitutes gender based violence. Here's what one Nova festival organizer told us that he saw. RAMI SHMUEL, CEO,UNITY FESTIVAL ISRAEL: What we found in the area, on the field outside the safe zone. There is not a doubt about what our girls went through the terrorist. We found naked women stripped out without any clothes. Their legs was spread out. And some of them were butchered. TAPPER (voice-over): Israeli police acknowledge that the investigation is likely to take months. Tuesday, police held a press briefing in which one witness said she saw a gang rape, quote, they bent someone over and I understood he was raping her. And then he was passing her on to someone else. She was alive. She stood on her feet and she was bleeding from her back. I saw that he was pulling her hair. She had long brown hair. I saw him chop off her breast. And then he was throwing it toward the road, tossed it to someone else. And they started playing with it. I remember seeing another person raping her. And while he was still inside her, he shot her in the head. Another shocking part of all of this to these women and investigators, the absence of international outrage, including United Nation statement a week after these terrorist attacks that did not mention these accusations at all, as if the rape of Israeli women does not count as rape. DR. COCHAV ELKAYAM-LEVY, CHAIR, CIVIL COMMISSION ON HAMAS' OCT. 7 CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN: It's much worse than just silence or an insult to us as Israeli women and to our children and to our people.
