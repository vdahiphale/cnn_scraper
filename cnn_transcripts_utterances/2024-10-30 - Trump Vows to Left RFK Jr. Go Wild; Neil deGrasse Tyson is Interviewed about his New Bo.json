There were many other speakers as well at Madison Square Garden at his final closing argument. Compare that to Kamala Harris, who in her closing argument last night said that to her political opponents she's not going to threaten to jail them as Donald Trump has. She's going to give them a seat at the table. That's probably why so many Republicans, especially in the suburbs of Philadelphia, are actually supporting Kamala Harris in this campaign.",

I do think, if it's all you're doing, if you're not making overtures to women, I do think that that's a problem considering that women are the majority of voters in this country.

In today's \"New York Times,\" a great column by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, Republican pollster Amanda Iovino. I adore both of them.
