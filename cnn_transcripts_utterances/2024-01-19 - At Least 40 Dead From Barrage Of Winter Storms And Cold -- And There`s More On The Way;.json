      "sentences": "To understand the very real fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East, it`s useful to take a closer look at theaxes of resistance, the proxies and allies of Iran stretching from the red sea to the Mediterranean. This latest regional tension was sparked by the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th and Israel subsequent war in Gaza. The U.S. says Hamas is funded, equipped, and sometimes trained by Iran. Although Tehran claims it was not involved in the October 7th attack, then Iran`s other proxies got involved. October 8th, Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of the most powerful forces in the region boasting some 100,000 fighters and links with the Lebanese government fired missiles across the border into Northern Israel, which Israel`s military responded to this raised fears of a wider conflict. Next, on the 19th of October, the Houthis rebels in Yemen launched missiles against Israel before moving their focus to commercial vessels in the Red Sea causing global chaos in the shipping industry. U.S. and U.K. strikes against targets in Yemen have not stopped these continued attacks. In Iraq, there are a number of Iran-backed militia groups that are increasingly active since the war in Gaza targeting U.S. troops in the country on a near daily basis, operating under umbrella group, the Islamic resistance in Iraq. They`re united in ideology, but splinted in operations, making them more challenging to target. There is little to suggest that Iran wants direct conflict with Israel or the United States at this point, but the sheer number and reach of its proxies, engaging the U.S. and its allies, inevitably sparks fears of an unintentional wider conflict.

With the palm of their hand, this new biometric payment system is part of a trial by Chinese tech giant Tencent for its ways and pay users. The digital wallet and payment service is a sister app of WeChat and users must opt in to use the contactless service. Infrared cameras analyze both a user`s palm print and a unique pattern of veins under their skin. Within seconds, the user is identified and a payment is made.
