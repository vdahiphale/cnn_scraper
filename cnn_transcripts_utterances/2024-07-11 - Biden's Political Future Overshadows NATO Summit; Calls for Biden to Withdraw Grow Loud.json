CNN's Kristen Holmes has new reporting.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump has yet to make a decision on who his vice presidential pick will be, but he was weighing in on all three of the top contenders over the last two days, some with more negative input than others. Now, as we have reported, there are three people who have been circulating at the top of the list, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. Now, he did weigh in on Burgum and not necessarily in the best light. Something we have heard from allies of Rubio as well as Vance is that Burgum went too far on the issue of abortion when he passed a near total abortion ban in the state of North Dakota. People have warned Donald Trump that that could be bad for Trump because they think that it would bring the issue of abortion, something Donald Trump has tried to stay away from on the campaign trail, back into the spotlight. Donald Trump himself has said that privately, but now he was saying it publicly. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a little bit of an issue. It's a pretty strong ban. You know, I think Doug is great, but it is a strong, he's taken a very strong stance, or the state has.",

It feels significantly better in the northeast today, at least itwill, as we cool things down probably 10 to 15 degrees with the cold front as it comes on by. It felt like over 105 in D.C. yesterday, and now we're only going to be around 92 for the actual air temperature and a lot less humidity as well as those storms went by. Back out to the west, we don't have to worry about the humidity, just the heat itself, where Vegas was 118 today, likely 117. I don't think you can feel the difference. Even for Phoenix, another day in a row above 110 in the afternoon, and the morning lows aren't cooling down either, so it's not like you can open up the doors and let in some cool air because it's well above what your air conditioner is probably set at there all across the desert.

You had the spy chiefs, right, including the head of the CIA, all in Doha, working on the details of what would be the first phase of a three-part deal that had been proposed by President Biden. That first phase, as you heard, is a potential six-week ceasefire that would see Palestinian prisoners, some of them released from Israeli detention, in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the most vulnerable among them, women, the elderly, the sick, to be released. We could also potentially see, during the ceasefire, Israeli troops withdraw from major population centers and potentially some Gazans able to return to certain parts of Gaza. That's the proposal. That's the idea. That's what's on the table. The U.S., Egypt and Qatar, of course, being the key mediators in this. But it all comes down to the details, of course. Which hostages will be released?

Officials said suspect Kyle Clifford was found in North London on Wednesday afternoon, less than a day after the wife and daughters of a BBC journalist were killed. CNN's Nic Robertson has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): It began Tuesday night. Emergency services called to the house of a BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, after women's screams were heard coming from the home. Medics found Hunt's wife, Carol, and his two daughters, Louise, age 25, and Hannah, 28, seriously injured. They'd been brutally attacked. The medics were unable to save the women and a massive 24-hour manhunt began in search of their killer. CCTV video captured near the family's house appeared to show a man leaving the vicinity carrying an object tucked under his arm, covered in a white cloth. Police believe he may have been carrying a crossbow. Police tracked the 26-year-old suspect to a North London cemetery, 45 minutes' drive away. Police say the suspect, Kyle Clifford, is a British military vet, and police believe he knew the victims. Police say when they captured Clifford, he was injured and taken away on a stretcher.",
