      "sentences": "Yeah, this is really, you know, a technical case about the meaning of state and federal laws, whetheror not they conflict. But the arguments they just wrapped up and like you said, they were very passionate. They touched on all of the practical implications that have been stemming from Idaho's law that's currently in effect, banning nearly all abortions and creating criminal penalties for doctors who unlawfully perform those abortions. In fact, it was really interesting that the solicitor general for the federal government stressed this twice. She said that Idaho doctors are in such an uncertain place about what they can and can't do that they've actually resorted to airlifting women out of the state about once every other week to nearby states where doctors can actually perform abortions without the real questions that they're facing in Idaho. So, what the federal government was arguing here is that there's a federal law, it's called, EMTALA. It says emergency room doctors, they need in all cases to step in and offer stabilizing treatment when a woman's health is in danger. And the question is, you know, should that federal law preempt or kind of overtake, override the Idaho abortion ban? They're saying the federal government that even if a woman has an injury that isn't life threatening, if she's not on death's door, they're saying the federal law still demands that doctors do everything they can to help this woman avoid serious injury, even if that includes abortion. Then on the other side, we heard Idaho's attorney and they're basically saying, look, this federal statute, it's only four pages long. It never includes any mention of abortion. And in their view, Congress never intended for states to not be able to regulate abortion care. So, Idaho's attorney is asking or saying that if, you know, if the federal government sort of preempted states being able to regulate, that might allow doctors to run wild in emergency room when it comes to all kinds of care, whether it's for opioids or other things that they say the state can regulate. So, we really saw a lot of passionate argument in particular from the liberal leaning justices, all three of whom are women. But we're really looking closely, you know, in the weeks to come before an opinion comes out likely in June to the Chief Justice, John Roberts, also Justice Amy Coney Barrett, because they asked -- act a lot about. They asked a lot about the practical implications of Idaho's law, in particular, you know, how are these doctors being judged if they determine that a woman's life might be in danger and they need to perform an abortion, who is making that decision? Are they sort of looking over their shoulder, wondering, well, will a prosecutor indict me on a crime here? So, there were a lot of practical questions about this, resulting in very passionate argument. In the end, though, this does come down to really a technical argument about whether this federal law sort of preempts the state law in Idaho that is currently in effect that really does ban most abortion.

      "sentences": "Yeah, absolutely. Because after Dobbs, after Roe v. Wade is overturned, many, many states, including Idaho, areplunged into legal uncertainty. So, here's the two sides. And I heard questioning on both fronts. I was listening very carefully for specific things. First, in Idaho, the statute only contemplates emergency medical care, which could include an abortion, if the woman is facing death. So, it only contemplates death. So, the argument is, what about if a woman would have infertility for the rest of her life if she doesn't have this abortion? What if she would have kidney failure? What if she would have other issues that are serious medical issues? And the answer is, well, the Idaho law does not speak to that. And that's why the solicitor general was arguing that this is plunging the whole system into medical uncertainty. As was laid out, patients are having to leave the state. Doctors are needing to leave the state because they don't know what they can do legally. So, that's one impact, which the state says the federal law would supplement and would allow doctors to act and provide the care needed when there were serious medical issues. Now, on the flip side, here was the big argument. This is what you were just speaking about, because we do have a court that overturned Roe v. Wade. And the reason they overturned is they said these are issues for states to decide with respect to abortion. And that was a prime argument. A lot of questions on that. What does it mean for the federal government to get involved in hospitals and medical decisions and for hospitals to lose federal funding if they don't comply with federal law? What's the spillover effect? Does that mean the federal government can say if you give gender affirming care to somebody, you lose federal funding? What does that mean? Is it a snowball and provides the federal government too much power? So those are the two sides. And to your point, wow, when we have a court that's really looking at state autonomy, I could see the court making a determination that these are issues for the state to iron out. But I will say arguments were entertained on both sides. Very impassioned arguments.",

Also, this idea of doctors potentially leaving the state, flying patients to a different state because they're not necessarily sure whether or not they are -- it is legal to perform some of the procedures that they want to perform. Just in terms of the level of chaos, I mean, if the Idaho law ends up standing, the level of chaos that would ensue. I mean, Amy Coney Barrett just talked about this idea of who is sort of standing over the doctor's shoulders, essentially saying what you're doing is legal versus not legal.",

This is part of the government's argument. The federal government's argument is that not only do we have these issues where this statute is only talking about death, not other necessary medical care, it's also having a destabilizing effect on the hospitals, on the medical field in Idaho. The reason being patients need to leave. Doctors are fleeing because they have fear of losing their medical licenses and being prosecuted. And that could be adverse to what they're talking about, their Hippocratic oath of providing the care necessary to a patient. So, absolutely, this is all in the wake of Dobbs. These are all unanswered questions. And many of the state legislatures have not dealt with the minutia of the fallout. And I'm calling it minutia from a legal perspective, but from a practical perspective, it's life altering for both doctors and patients.",

Well, they -- that deadline came and went. Hours went by. And then university spokesperson said they have been making progress. So, that deadline has now been extended out 48 hours. And specifically, as far as progress goes, they've said that they reached agreements on dismantling and removing a significant number of tents, ensuring those not affiliated with Columbia will leave the encampment and taking steps to make the encampment welcome to all. Now, the student protesters have said that they are not abandoning their encampment until their demands are met, namely, as I've spoken to some of them, that they want Columbia University to divest from all corporations they say are supporting Israel. Now, what point they see that resolution that they can agree with, we do not know. And the other question is, previously last week when this encampment first began, the university president called in the New York Police Department to come in and clear these protesters, a decision that was criticized by many students and many faculty who made that known when they chose to walk out by over a hundred people earlier this week. So, the question is, when you look at what alternative ways they have to clear these protesters, as was hinted in the university president's statement, we do not know.

And just to bring it back to his family, who you -- who you just mentioned and who you knowwell, I mean, they have relentlessly advocated for their son's release, both in Israel as well as in the United States, meeting with top White House officials and here meeting with top Israeli government officials. And this is the first time amid all of that advocacy, amid months of relentless advocacy, that they have actually gotten some sense that their son actually survived October 7th, survived the injuries that he faced on October 7th, because there was a video of him that day with this very serious injury to his left hand, but it wasn't clear whether or not he had actually survived. And now for the first time, they are seeing some kind of proof of life here. Now, in terms of dating that proof of life, there are some indicators. As you mentioned, he does talk about the fact that he has been in captivity for nearly 200 days. We are now marking 200 days this week since October 7th, since this war began. And he also talks about the holidays. And we are currently in the midst of the Jewish holiday of Passover. And that appeared to be a reference to that. But we do not have anything that we can independently verify in terms of the timing, the specific timing of this video. But in it, he is alive. You can see that his -- part of his left arm is indeed missing. It's not clear if it was just from the injuries that day, if it was subsequently amputated further up his arm. But he is a 23-year-old Israeli-American citizen who was taken hostage on October 7th while he was attending that Nova Music Festival. And in this video, beyond the message to the Israeli government, which we should note is obviously under duress here while he is being held by his captors, he also gives a message to his family, which I want to read to you, where he says more important than anything, \"Mom, Dad, Libby and Orly, I love you very much. I miss you very much. And I think of you every day that I'm here. I know that you guys are out up there doing everything for me to come home as soon as possible.\" And clearly, he knows his parents and his family well, because that is exactly what they have been doing over the course of the last six plus months. Now, in terms of the timing of this video's release, it is notable that Hamas is doing this at this moment at a very sensitive time in the negotiations where we have seen these talks be at a standstill really over the course of the last several weeks, backsliding in some senses as Hamas has entrenched itself in its demands, showing no signs of moving and even offering less than half the number of hostages that have been the basis of negotiations for months now. And so, at this uncertain moment, Hamas clearly trying to influence the state of these negotiations, clearly trying to level more pressure on the Israeli government, on the American government as well, as Hersch Goldberg- Polin is one of just nine Americans being held hostage in Gaza, four of whom we know are dead. He is one of five of those who we believe are alive being held hostage in Gaza. And so clearly, this is an influence to try and influence the course of those negotiations, which is part of the reason why we are not showing the full video, but we are showing the still image of Hersch.",

Ten other Marines who didn't go on camera told us they heard gunfire. A couple even said they saw a gunman, but two others stand out who we were unable to reach ourselves. Romel Finley was injured. And in an interview with a former Marine turned barber said he didn't see shooting. And his recollections are fuzzy by one moment. He remembers vividly.

The Pentagon has insisted all injuries and deaths were from the bomb and its ball bearings. But CNN has wide-ranging evidence pointing to many Afghans being shot. Two years ago, we heard 19 eyewitness accounts from Afghan survivors who saw people shot or were shot themselves supported by 13 medical reports of bullet wounds. Afghan medical staff also told us they counted dozens of dead from gunfire. Key was Sayed Ahmadi, head doctor at the Kabul hospital treating most of the wounded whose team assessed the injuries of the dead as they lay out in the parking lot that night.

I mean, for years, Tara, this has been something that Democrats have been warning about, had been campaigning about. I believe this is the first presidential election where you can't categorize it though, as hyperbole about what could happen because in the past four years we have seen Roe versus Wade overturned. We've seen the consequences of that play out in multiple states. This is an issue where Biden has been leading over Trump. The others, probably I would imagine the economy and immigration for now, at least judging by polls, Republicans have the upper hand slightly.
