And Special Counsel David Weiss's team has said in court filings that they may seek to bring those charges after a plea deal where Hunter Biden would have pled guilty to two tax misdemeanors had fallen apart, and they could bring those charges neither Washington, D.C. or California.And so what we know is that for one of the years that's under investigation, the statute of limitations, that is, the period that they can look back on this where they could still bring a case, would expire next month. So that certainly starts the clock on how quickly we may see some additional movement here, possibly other tax charges. You know, they said that they may bring them. We don't know if they will or what they will look like, but it's certainly something that is now right around the corner, particularly on the heels of the indictment yesterday where Hunter Biden was charged with three felonies. Two of them for falsifying an ATF form that said that he was not using drugs or addicted to drugs at the time he bought the gun in October of 2018, and then providing that form to the dealer, essentially giving a false statement to that dealer, as well as the charge of possession of the gun while he was addicted to or using an illegal drug. Those are all serious crimes. And the combination of the two, both the gun charges now on the table and the possibility of tax charges, you know, that's a real big reversal from where we are just a few weeks ago when it looked like there wasn't going to be a gun charge and the tax charges were going to be put out to a misdemeanor. Now, Hunter Biden's attorney, Abby Lowell, was on Aaron Burnett last night, and he was saying that he can only speculate as to what the reason is, but he thinks it has to do with politics. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S LAWYER:   You have to ask what changed and what changed you also just talked about.

Jean Carroll defamation and sexual abuse civil case. Trump initially indicated through his lawyer that he wanted to testify, but in the end he never took the stand.

Now, the charges that they were facing were one count of providing material support for a terrorist act and also possessing a firearm when committing or attempting to commit a felony. They were facing up to 20 years in prison on those charges. And this was a case that played out in front of a jury for more than two weeks.And I gotta tell you, they were quite emotional, as you can see there in the video, when the jury acquitted them of those charges. So going back to 2020, you probably might remember there was this plot to kidnap Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer. And now these three men sort of played on the lower level, if you will, according to the government as to what part they played in that,-- executing that plot of those 14 people that you just described. But this group of militia, Wolverine Watchmen, of course, this was a anti-government sort of militia that recruited each other through social media, would train together. And then were actually trying to execute this plot of kidnapping the governor. According to the government, these three men were actually supposedly doing surveillance on the governor's vacation home there in Michigan. And of course, now a jury's saying that they really didn't have much part in that plot, even though people that were with that plot were convicted, as you just mentioned. 14 people were brought on charges in this. And most of them, though, were convicted and found guilty by juries. But this, again, a win for these three men, who again, were very emotional in court today once that jury made that decision, Boris. Byrnn Gingras, thank you so much. Jim.",
