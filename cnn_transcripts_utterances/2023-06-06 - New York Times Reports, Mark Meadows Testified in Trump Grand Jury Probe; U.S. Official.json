      "sentences": "An incredibly significant development in the special counsel investigation. The New York Times reporting that Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has testified before the grand jury that Special Counsel Jack Smith has been using in both of his investigations both into January 6 and also into the possible his handling of classified documents down at Mar-a-Lago.Now, according to The Times' reporting, it's unclear if he has testified in just one of those investigations or in bulk, but he is arguably the most significant witness that the special counsel could speak to, certainly in the January 6 investigation. But it could potentially also have valuable information in the classified document probe as well. Now, in recent months, folks around former President Trump have expressed some concern, some puzzlement about exactly what was going on with Mark Meadows, because they told us that they didn't have any communication with his legal team. They were unclear what exactly was going on with him. They've even said on our air that there was no communication between Trump's legal team and Meadows' legal team, which raised a lot of questions about whether he was indeed cooperating with investigators. Now, in terms of what he could offer in January 6, the House investigation into January 6 basically concluded that all roads led to the former White House chief of staff. All the communication to the former president that day, including from his own family, went through Mark Meadows. He would have an incredible number of questions to answer before investigators. Now, also, though, on the Mar-a-Lago probe, we learned from our exclusive reporting in recent weeks that investigators have an audio recording, a really key piece of evidence where Trump refers to being in possession of a classified document. And that recording was made by Meadows' autobiographers, who were recording in the room. Now, in a statement Meadows' lawyers provided to The Times, they said, quote, without commenting on whether or not Mr. Meadows has testified before the grand jury or in any proceeding, Mr. Meadows has maintained a commitment to tell the truth where he has a legal obligation to do so.

But the thing that we've said repeatedly on air, including on your show, Wolf, is we just don't know about Mark Meadows, right? That is such a significant witness. Once they talk to him, then we can say for certain that this is definitely in the final phase and likely wrapping up.But, of course, we know that the investigation continues. Investigators are expected to speak to at least one more witness in Florida later this week. But the fact that they have talked to him, that this has finally been confirmed, this is something we've been waiting for to really understand whether they are indeed wrapping up this investigation. It appears, again, this is one of the most significant witnesses they would speak to. This is someone that it appears that they've likely spoken to in this final stage that we're entering now, and they contemplate whether they will indeed bring any charges. BLITZER: Yes. Let's not forget this is a criminal investigation of Donald Trump that we're watching right now. Paula, stay with us. I want to dig deeper with our legal and political experts who are standing by.

I think the fact that he has testified now before the grand jury and one of the big questions I have, Wolf, is did he actually testify from a substantive perspective, in other words, answer questions substantively, meaningfully, for what amount of time, how many hours was he in there, or were there a circumstance where he would have been in a position to invoke his own Fifth Amendment right?I mean, I think one of the big questions is whether or not Mark Meadows faces any criminal liability in these broader investigations himself. I don't know the answer to that question, but it would certainly affect the length of time that has gone before he testified, whether or not he entered into any kind of deal with the government, whether or not he had a motivation to testify extensively in his own interests and therefore how truthful and how forthcoming he would be in his answers with respect to whether or not they could implicate him in anything as well. So, there's his own personal interest, and then there's also the relevance to the broader investigation.",

We learned that on this recording, not only does the former president suggest that he is in possession of a classified document but he also appears to acknowledge the limits on his ability to declassify documents once he left the White House.Now, those comments are significant because they really undermine a lot of the public defenses that Trump has put forward. But in reporting that story, one of our big questions was, okay, who was a recording in this room and why? And through our reporting, we learned that during that time, the former president was in the habit of having journalists, writers, and anyone working on books record what he said, in addition to his aides as well. We learned that in the room during this critical conversation were two people who were working on an autobiography for Mark Meadows. So, again, he is tied into this specific case now, very clearly, other questions about what other types of recordings they could have related to Mark Meadows' book. Also, oddly, in Mark Meadows' autobiography, he suggests that he was in this meeting, though our reporting suggests, in fact, that he was not. So, I think investigators would have quite a bit to ask Mark Meadows about in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation.",

Yes, he started to negotiate or started to cooperate, potentially, with the January 6 committee pulled back. That wasn't something he was obligated to do. When you are called before the grand jury and the Department of Justice, it is, from his perspective, very different. Maybe just like Mike Pence. I mean, Mike Pence did fight going to the grand jury. They lost in court and then he ended up going. But it seems as though Mark Meadows might be following that playbook to sort of go and say what you want, but we don't really know what the subject in. I will tell you that there has been concern, and I'm sure Paula is hearing this as well, from some in the Trump orbit, that Mark Meadows is maybe making a deal or giving something in order to getting something in order to give something.

Where is it? It's in New Hampshire. He certainly staked everything on New Hampshire in 2016, but this time, he's even starting there.
