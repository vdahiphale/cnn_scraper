Tonight, frustration spiraling across the globe. Israel is again trying to prove there is intent behind its apology and not just words. The IDF says it has now removed two officers and reprimanded three other senior commanders over what they call a mistake. It's a mistake that has earned the condemnation of nearly every Tel Aviv-friendly nation across the planet. That mistake has been the subject of reports and phone calls and withering statements since near minutes after it crossed the wires. Missiles blowing apart seven volunteers from World Central Kitchen, missiles that targeted aid workers with a righteous mission just to feed the starving people of Gaza, missiles that may fray the already fragile Israeli-American relationship over what is essentially a case of mistaken identity. A preliminary report says that IDF personnel thought a bag was a weapon. It was a potentially world-altering error, a mishap that completes the rewrite from Israel as the lone beacon of democracy in the region to a state not worth, it seems for some, standing beside or at least questioning. The headlines spell out, unsparingly, the depth of Israel's loneliness now on the world stage. Reuters, six months into Gaza war, Israel faces deepening isolation. New York Times, after six months of war, some Israelis ask, is Netanyahu dragging it out? The A.P., after six months of war, Israel's isolation grows with no end in sight. And The Guardian, after six months, the war in Gaza is making Israel a pariah state. Tonight, evidence that shift is happening in real-time. Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House speaker, is now attaching her name and her gravitas to a letter demanding that weapons transfers to Israel stop. Quote, we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers. The tone and tenor is a world away from when the American president promised to never abandon Israel. Tonight, that same American president sits on the precipice of doing exactly that, dramatically scaling back at least what military aid and how many military dollars the U.S. gives. There are some indications Israel understands the relationship is now rocky. Benjamin Netanyahu's government exceeded to opening new routes for aid to reach Gazans in perpetual mortal danger. President Biden himself told reporters that Netanyahu is doing what he asked them to do for now. Listen to his secretary of state, and it is a trust but verify relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think that was the right step to take and the right action.I think the key we all need to focus on now is making sure that we can get to that temporary pause, that we can get the hostages freed. Because remember, not only did Hamas kill more than 40 Americans, but they still have Americans that are hostage now, including Edan Alexander, a 20-year-old from my district here in Northern New Jersey. And part of what I was focused on these last days in Qatar and Egypt was, what are we doing to get the hostages home? And, of course, how do we get more humanitarian aid urgently into Gaza, right? To me, those are the two major actions. And Israel, of course, is still dealing with rockets being fired into Israel, right? So, I mean, that's in the reporting. I think, critical to make a point of as well, right? I mean, you had Hamas attacked Israel. Israel is still dealing with rockets coming in. And, of course, you're dealing with an ongoing conflict where Hamas has said they will do it a second and third and fourth time until Israel is destroyed from the river to the sea and all the Jews are killed, right?

And this gets to the conduct of the war, right? Because prior to this World Central Kitchen strike, you had many thousands of civilians killed in Gaza by Israeli military operations, more than 13,000 children.

Hamas was at the table and they walked away again, right? Hamas looks for every excuse to walk away from the table, and they did so again today. But the key is making sure we get everyone back to the table, the president sending letters to the Qataris and the Egyptians, urging quicker action, urging them to lean on Hamas. Of course, the president rightly urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to stay at the table and make sure they take real action. And I think that's the key role that we play here, is making sure we get everyone to the table, get to this temporary pause. And as you point out, to make sure, and I think it's the right thing, you've got to hold all the parties accountable, but do so in a way that doesn't abandon our key ally in favor of a foreign terrorist organization, right?

This time, they're arguing the trial will somehow financially benefit her company. For more, I want to bring in former January 6th Investigative Counsel Marcus Childress and former Federal Prosecutor and Politico Contributing Writer Ankush Khardori. Good to have you both here. So, Marcus, we have Trump's attorney alleging that Lauren Merchan's company, Authentic, has, I'm quoting here, made money by assisting clients who have solicited donations using communications that specifically reference this case. The court's future rulings stand to further benefit those clients by harming President Trump while Authentic and Ms. Merchan make money in the process. So, it's a little different from his typical charge where that person is clearly biased against me for whatever reason. Maybe they made a donation in the past. This is a continuing financial interest. Does it have substance? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6TH INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL:  It's speculative at best. And I think you're going to find the court ruling in that way. Look this is part of the playbook for the former president is to file recusal motions. He did it with Judge Chutkan, where he said she was biased because she ruled another January 6 cases. Now he's doing it here with the judge.
