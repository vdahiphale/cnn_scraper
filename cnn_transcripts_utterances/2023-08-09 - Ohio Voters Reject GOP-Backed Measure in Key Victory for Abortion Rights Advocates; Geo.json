Well, exactly the opposite happened.As you said, a record turnout for an August election, not much precedent for that in recent times. But suburban voters, urban voters, a coalition of Democrats, independents and Republicans roundly rejected this amendment that would have raised the bar for an amendment in November to put abortion rights on the ballot. That will go forward. But this was also about more than abortion. Certainly, the issue was the driving force here, but also a minimum wage proposal that is likely coming next year.

That law has been on hold by the courts. But if this constitutional amendment on abortion rights would pass in November, it would simply make Ohio fall in line with several other states that we have seen, like Michigan most recently, enshrine the protection of abortion rights into the state's Constitution.And we saw in our CNN national poll yesterday that 64 percent of Americans disagree with the Supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade. So, Ohio becomes the latest examples of red states and blue states where if the citizens have their say, they are voting on the side of abortion rights. But, again, this was about more than that here in Ohio. It was about trying to change the rules in the process. We don't know how the percentage here, 57 percent, will line up with the question in November. But now, they simply need a simple majority of 50 percent to put abortion rights in the state Constitution. What it also means, though, is that Republicans certainly have some thinking to do about how abortion plays into their party platform because the voters here have spoken. This will be a driving issue, Democrats hope, going into the 2024 election as well. Victor and Poppy?",

The New York Times has obtained a memo written by unindicted co-conspirator number 5. That is Attorney Kenneth Cheseboro. The, quote, fraudulent elector memo was first mentioned in the indictment that came down last week, but we haven't seen the memo until now.And while we know the contours of the fake elector scheme, this memo shows how it evolved and how it was discussed behind the scenes. In it, Cheseboro writes, the Supreme Court would likely end up ruling that the power to count the votes does not line with the president of the Senate, meaning Mike Pence at the time. But even if it failed, he wrote, that it would do two things, quote, buy the Trump campaign more time and would, quote, deprive Biden of electoral votes and/or add to Trump's column. He also suggested what he was writing here proposing was a bold and controversial strategy. In this indictment, prosecutors say the memo shows the orchestration of a fake controversy would derail the proper certification of Biden as president-elect.",

And these are people that already testified before a special grand jury that spent months investigating this case.So, prosecutors already know what these witnesses are going to say. It's not about gleaning new information from them, but it's about using them to craft a narrative before the grand jury that they are going to seek indictments from, people who can talk about the fake elector scheme, people who can talk about the presentation Rudy Giuliani and other Trump allies made before Georgia state lawmakers that was riddled with conspiracies. And when I was talking to legal experts for our story on this, they said, look, in a case of this magnitude, her indictments are probably already done, already written and have been done for weeks, if not months.

They may open it up later today because they are going to have drone patrols up over the beach. I want to show you this, though. This is the beach where that happened, where that 65-year-old woman was attacked. First time in 70 years, as far as we can tell, that a shark has bitten somebody here. But look at all the birds out there. I don't know if you can catch that but there are lots and lots of birds out there feeding on school of fish and that's what brings wildlife, like sharks, into this area. I can tell you that there's very few people -- we saw a couple of surfers earlier in the water, which they are not supposed to be, because there is no swimming right now, but this is the beach. She was standing in sort of waist-high water out here. The shark came up and bit her left thigh, the back of her thigh, bleeding very, very badly. It was a very serious injury. And thanks to the lifeguards out here, they put a tourniquet on her. They were able to get her to emergency care. And it looks like she's going to make a recovery, but very, very scary.

Eventually, more people joined in fighting on both sides. Police say it happened after he had asked the men to move a pontoon boat so the river boat could dock in its designated spot.",

It is just appalling to see what happened. Some have been charged, but it was very clear from the police chief on CNN last night there will be potentially additional charges for maybe those people and also more people charged. Can you detail what you're expecting?MAYOR STEVEN REED (D-MONTGOMERY, AL):  Sure. First, good morning, thank you for having me. It's certainly disturbing video. And consequently, we're not leaving any stone unturned in this investigation. We're looking at everything we have seen, everything that has been reported to us by witnesses as well as those things that have been sent in by other bystanders. This is a very serious situation. It's important that people understand that we're a welcoming community in Montgomery. We're always open for business and we enjoy the tourism that comes here because of our proud civil rights history, but you have to obey the law. You have to obey authority. And what we saw in that video was someone and a group of people did not.",

That's something that I think shows a lack of respect for an individual. And I just didn't appreciate someone that's working to secure the safety of others who were on that boat being approached like that. And I think that's an issue.And I think our police department has done a great job in putting aside any emotion or what could have been and really looking at the facts. And I think that's what led to the arrests yesterday and there are two others who were supposed to turn themselves in who did not. And since they didn't, we may have to go pick them up and give them a ride.",
