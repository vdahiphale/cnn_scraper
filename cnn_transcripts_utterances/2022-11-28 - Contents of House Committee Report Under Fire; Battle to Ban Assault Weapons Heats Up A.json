The president returning to a Washington that will be very busy for him over this next week.The president is expected to host French President Emmanuel Macron for the first official state visit of Biden's presidency. It's going to be a visit full of pomp and circumstance and also an honor to the French president to give him the first state visit, a symbol of the closeness between these two countries, an alliance that has been forged for hundreds of years but also, of course, become stronger through the crisis in Ukraine. France playing a key leadership role in Europe and the United States, of course, President Biden working to keep that global alliance together. The president also has a lot of work to do on Capitol Hill. Recently he floated the idea of trying to get an assault weapons ban through in the lame duck session of Congress. That is unlikely to happen, but a slew of other items still on the agenda. The president needs to get the government funded over the next several weeks. And that is going to be priority number one as the president prepares for a Republican takeover of the House next year. Needs to get that funding bill through before that happens.

This, after a spate of recent deadly shootings across the U.S. In Virginia, where a Walmart employee shot and killed six co-workers before killing himself last Tuesday, the Chesapeake city council will hold a special meeting on Monday to confirm an emergency declaration to help fund recovery efforts. The mayor will lead a candle light vigil for the victims after the meeting. And despite the recent shootings, one Democratic Senator says his party doesn't have enough votes to pass an assault weapons ban.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): If you pass an assault weapons ban, you are not going to magically eliminate mass shootings in this country, but it is true that that AR-15 or AR-15 style weapon is generally the choice of mass shooters. And what you saw in 1994, when we passed an assault weapons ban was a dramatic decline in mass shootings that remained in place for a decade until the expiration of the assault weapons ban when mass shootings started to spiral out again.

He spoke later about the young Ukrainians that he met.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT KELLY, RETIRED U.S. ASTRONAUT: It was also heartwarming to see their resilience and, you know, like the resilience I think that all the Ukrainian people are demonstrating in this, you know, horrific war. But also, you know, like I said, just very, very sad to see and it's just hard to understand, you know, how Russia could attack this country and knowingly attack and kill and wound and maim children. It's really horrific. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's gaining some support and I think Vladimir Putin has already realized that the issue of the soldier's mothers is certainly one that he does need to tend to, regardless of this particular petition. There certainly have been some complaints by soldier's mothers coming up here in Russia, especially on telegram channels. There's been some video messages as well complaining about poor conditions for those who are mobilized.For the Russians more than 300,000s who have been mobilized since September saying that in many places adequate gear was very difficult to come by. But also, that they had to buy their own food and their own medicine in certain areas as well. That's also something that this particular petition does mention. And it certainly seems to us, Bianca, as though the Kremlin identified this as an area where Vladimir Putin needs to take action. He met on Friday with soldier's mothers. There was some criticism of that meeting saying that this was a group of hand-picked people rather than the big mother's organizations who for a very long time have been criticizing the way the special military operation has been conducted. Talking about that poor gear, talking about soldiers or newly mobilized being sent to the front way too early. If we look at this particular petition now, they also say that obviously if the breadwinner in many cases in the house is killed or severely wounded, then it will be up to the mothers once again to try to feed their families and to get by. And they certainly definitely say they want support for that as well. One of the most important things of that meeting, though, that Vladimir Putin had on Friday, was some of the other things that he said. He obviously tried to show empathy. But he also certainly did not look like someone who is willing and ready to back down in this at all in the conflict with Ukraine. He said he believes that the annexation of Donbas or the reunification, as he put it, with Russia is something that should have happened much earlier. He also claimed that Russia is not actually at war with the Ukrainians but with those who are equipping them and financing them. Obviously trying to stylize this sort of as a confrontation, a direct confrontation with the West. Again, Vladimir Putin in that meeting with the soldier's mothers certainly looked as someone who is in it for the long run and definitely not someone who is ready to back down at any time -- Bianca.",

Thank you so much, Fred Pleitgen for us there in Moscow.Clare, turning now to what we were talking about with regard to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a lot of concern has been focused on this, justifiably over the last months. Naturally because it is getting more difficult to get more information from the ground. We now have these conflicting reports. Ukraine is suggesting that maybe Russia is making plans to withdraw, but Russia denying this.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we don't have evidence -- we haven't been able to verify any claims Russia is planning to withdraw. This comes from the head of the Ukrainian nuclear power company who said over the weekend that he has received information that Russia -- although it hasn't started yet -- might be preparing to withdraw from the nuclear plant. He cited sort of information that's come out in the Russian media. For example, military bloggers have been speculating about this.But you know, I think without evidence you can assume that this may be sort of tactical by Ukraine, that so much focus is on this nuclear plant and so much concern around it that talking about it Russian withdrawal might raise further doubt on that. Russia, although the authorities in Enerhodar, which is the city just adjacent to the plant, they are denying this, they're saying this is fake. And of course, it is somewhat implausible that they would withdraw. This was such a big prize for Russia, something they took over in the very early weeks of the war. Putin has now signed a decree essentially annexing the nuclear plant taking it under Russian law. Even though course, we know that Ukrainian staff are still essentially running the plant. So, I think, you know, conflicting information at this stage.",
