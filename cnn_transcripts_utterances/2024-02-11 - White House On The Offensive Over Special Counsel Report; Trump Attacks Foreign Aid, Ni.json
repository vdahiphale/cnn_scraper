We'll look at how Taylor Swift is getting more women than ever to watch the NFL and how the league is responding. We begin in Washington, where the White House is on the offensive, working to get ahead of the uproar over a recent Special Counsel report. The First Lady added her voice to those criticizing the report's language, taking issue like her husband with a suggestion he didn't know when his son died. She wrote, quote, \"I can't imagine someone would try to use our son's death to score political points. If you've experienced a loss like that, you know that you don't measure it in years, you measure it in grief.\" Well, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez reports from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They're afraid of Joe Biden.\"Now, this memo also goes on to make notable mentions of people like General Mark Milley and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who have called the President alert and engaged. But of course, this comes on the heels of that special counsel report that also mentioned the President's age and apparent memory lapses. Now, this had aids to the President fuming over the course of the week who pushed back and said the President is sharp and tireless. We also saw that anger spill into public view from the President himself, who took particular issue with the Special Counsel, suggesting that he had forgotten the day his son died. Now, all of this is part of what is going to be a defining theme for the presidential election year, that being the president's age and fitness for office. Senior campaign officials say that the President is best when he is out on the campaign trail engaging with voters. And we have seen an uptake in traditional retail politics stops for him to do exactly that. And that is ultimately them, the voters, who are going to pass judgment on whether the President is fit to serve a second term. But of course, polls show that there's still some concern here about how old he is. But again, campaign officials and White House officials well aware of that, see it as something that they can navigate and remind the American people who he is and what he is like when he engages on the campaign trail.

And they tell me that's because he continues to do so well in the polls in this state. If you look at the past several months, he's consistently been leading her by an overwhelming margin, but it's also because of the intensity they've seen for him on the ground. On Saturday, for example, many people showed up. The venue was packed and a lot of people could not get in and it hit full capacity very early on. So that just gives you a sense how strong the energy is for Donald Trump here in the Palmetto State. But look, Donald Trump spent a lot of his speech on Saturday going after Nikki Haley, even though they are very confident in his chances here. He continued to ramp up his attacks on her.

The hundreds of thousands of fans who will be in and outside Allegiant Stadium will be protected by this massive deployment of law enforcement officers.Some of the resources they're bringing include physical scanners for everyone going into the stadium. There are explosive detection canines. There are also sensors that are being deployed that essentially sniff the air for any type of chemical, biological, or nuclear type threat. That's what's happening on the ground. In the air, a national security temporary flight restriction will be instituted just about an hour before kickoff that will be enforced by military fighter jets. Now, one area of focus for law enforcement pertains to drones. Drone technology is obviously very cheap to obtain. There are a number of ways that bad actors could cause harm using a drone. And so the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have brought in counter drone technology. The capabilities include being able to technically take over a drone, either drop it out of the sky, or perhaps take control, move it to another area if there's concern that it might contain a dangerous payload. Now, at this point, all of this is precautionary. Law enforcement tells us that they haven't identified anything specifically gives them concern, but they're ready.",

A crackdown which actually led to many of Khan's parties not being able to campaign properly for this election, not having an electoral symbol, for example, which is now even more compelling that Khan's party has won the lead in this election in the final tally that we received three days after the election took place by the Election Commission of Pakistan. But what must be noted is that at the moment, none of the three major parties, and you can't recall the independence affiliated with Imran Khan's party, a party, but they're the big block, have not received enough to form a majority to form a government. So now what we're going to have to see is who forms what coalition with whom, who is going to be the next prime minister. These are questions that are still up in the air. There's also a lot of rage amongst the youth here in Pakistan. So yes, those protests have been scaled back, but they're still happening. They're happening outside polling offices. They might continue. Would it be a peaceful sit-in that lasts for days? I spoke to Raoof Hasan, who is a Senior Aide of Imran Khan, and he said that his party is going to be taking all legal and constitutional parts to clear what they feel is wrong against them with regards to the inaccuracies in the data that's been released by the Election Commission of Pakistan, according to them.

People around the world were tracking Swift's plane after she wrapped up her concert tour in Japan this weekend with her plane touching down in Los Angeles yesterday in plenty of time to make the short hop to Las Vegas.Swift's impact on the league shows up in the numbers. Take the Chiefs Jets game she attended on October 1st at average 27 million viewers including two million women making the most watched Sunday show since last year's Super Bowl according to NBC. By the end of the regular season the NFL had seen its highest rating since 2015. It was also the highest regular season viewership among women since it started tracking the statistic in 2000. Well, CNN's Sports Analysts and \"USA Today\" Sports Columnist Christine Brennan joins me now. Christine, I hope you're as excited as what everybody else is. Tell me, is the Swift effect responsible for this incredible increase in viewership with NFL games? CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: Anna, absolutely, yes. That is the answer. It is undeniable. This is the football season, the NFL season of Taylor Swift. We might as well call it the Taylor Swift Super Bowl. These are words I would have never thought. I never would have thought I would have uttered them even six months ago, but the impact has been extraordinary and the NFL loves it. Yes, there are political people that are all up in arms about something or other, but that's insane.

You're smiling, you're laughing, you like it, you love it. Are they going to get married? Are they not? Will he give her the ring? You know, all these storylines, the NFL is just eating this up because they have men, right? Male football fans, we know that they're there. Women, many older women, absolutely. In fact, about 45% of the NFL's fan base is women. So they already had close to, you know, half and half. The difference was the young kids. The younger girls and women, the millennials, the Gen Z, the ones who were playing Taylor Swift music or going to Taylor Swift concerts, but they weren't watching the NFL. And now they are.

And in fact, the first commissioner who made a big impact, a man named Pete Rozelle, was a public relations man. And that explains everything. The NFL has just taken over America as a sports entity.

And I think the idea of also understanding what these young girls who are going to grow up and be incredible consumers, buying products and potentially tickets and whatever they see in the ads of a game for the rest of their lives.

The energy in Las Vegas for the Super Bowl, I mean, it's probably -- it's one of the best weeks I've ever seen it covering this -- this game for the past 12 years.The NFL should really consider having this game here in Las Vegas at least every three years that's how good it's been. But we got a great game here today between the Niners and the Chiefs. San Francisco two- point favorites for Super Bowl 58 but the Chiefs they're trying to make a little history here. They're trying to become the first team since the Patriots back in 2005 to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, they're trying to win their third title in five years and many think if they're able to get that third title they really will cement themselves as one of the dynasties in the sport (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Golden State was down two, three seconds left. They're going to get the ball to Steph Curry, who knocks down the three, the crowd there in San Fran, just going bonkers. That was Curry's 9th three of the game. He finished with 30 points as the Warriors would win that one, 113 to 112. All right, back here in Vegas, you know, we've been talking to people all week long, getting their predictions for the big game. And my colleague, Coy Wire, he was on the blue carpet at the big Fanatics party yesterday afternoon, getting some celebrity and athlete predictions. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I got a great stat for you, 16 of the last 19 Super Bowl champions have worn their white jerseys for the game. Who's wearing white here today? It's the 49ers. But that being said, one of those three teams over the last two decades that's won wearing their color jerseys, the Kansas City Chiefs, and they did that beating the Niners four years ago.So I don't know what that means for the jerseys today, Anna. But my take, I just can't bet against Patrick Mahomes. He's proven over and over again that he is one of the greatest players to ever play this game. And as an underdog, he is 10 and 3 in his career. He's a two- point underdog today. We'll see what happens. Hopefully we get a good one. COREN: Put some money on it, Andy. You are in Vegas after all. Enjoy the Super Bowl. Andy Scholes, great to see you. Thank you so much.",
