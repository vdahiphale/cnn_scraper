Will his performance ease fear among Democrats who say he can't beat Donald Trump in the election? As the NATO summit wraps, Biden launches an effort to support Ukraine's long-term security. And according to the U.S. there are positive signs for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, but the Israeli prime minister says he's not ready to agree yet.We begin with U.S. President Joe Biden trying to overcome concerns about his cognitive health and political future. He spoke with reporters at the end of the NATO summit in Washington. Biden insisted he is the most qualified person to run for president and to beat Donald Trump, but it's unlikely his performance will quiet the growing chorus of Democrats calling for him to step aside. Now, at the start of the press conference, he misidentified his own vice president. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, Donald Trump recovered from the \"Access Hollywood\" letter in 2016, obviously with another big intervening event from James Comey. But the reason this debate existed at all was because the Biden campaign and Democrats realized that he was trailing and he was not on a trajectory to win.You know, if you compare where he is now to where he was in 2020, going into the debate, his biggest problem was that he was underperforming with younger nonwhite voters, black and Hispanic voters, especially men. And as a result of that, the Sunbelt states where those voters are critical to the Democratic coalition look to be almost out of reach for him. North Carolina and Georgia in the southeast, Nevada in the southwest, maybe Arizona is a little better, but not much in the southwest. And that meant that in order to get to 270, he had to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, three states in what I once called the blue wall. He's trailing in all three of those at this point, you know. And so it is a very difficult path. And especially if you consider, as I said, his biggest problem is younger nonwhite voters. The debate solidified, cemented one of his biggest problems with them in that \"New York Times/Siena\" poll, 85 percent of people under 45 said that he's too old to do the job of president effectively. And when you kind of add all of this up, I think there are many -- there's a growing sense among Democratic professionals, certainly, but also elected officials that despite all the challenges Kamala Harris would face, at least she offers an opportunity to kind of reset the, you know, the chessboard and giving you at least a different set of contrasts with Donald Trump.",

And, you know, there are a lot of -- they've always been politicians who kind of resent celebrities meddling in politics. But I'll tell you one thing that one celebrity gives or provides is the opportunity to say things in public that politicians often will only say in private.We haven't exactly seen the profile and courage from the Democratic congressional leadership on this. They've been very cautious. And George Clooney said what a lot of Democrats are saying. It reminded me a little bit of 1968 when the only major surrogate that Gene McCarthy could get when he was challenging Lyndon Johnson, even though many Democrats felt that Johnson through the war in Vietnam was kind of rendering himself unelectable was Paul Newman. Paul Newman was the only one who would go to New Hampshire and say publicly because he was kind of like, you know, he was immune. I mean, he was a rich celebrity. He didn't need the usual political kind of rewards. And I think Clooney actually fits a little bit to me in that lineage where, you know, he is not the only person who has thought this. And what was so significant about what he said was that he didn't only say that he didn't think Biden can win. He said that the Biden he saw was like what they saw at the debate. And, you know, as we saw tonight, that's not going to be Joe Biden every day. But, you know, if voters know that that is a possibility, you know, on X percent of days, can you erase that concern by having a good day in public? I'm not sure you can.",

Avon and Somerset police say it got a call close to midnight on Thursday about a man acting suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge.Officers responded and found the two suitcases, but there was no sign of the man who they described as a black man with a beard dressed all in black with an Adidas baseball cap and a black backpack. Police say they're not aware of any current threat to the wider public. U.K. authorities say the man suspected of killing the wife and daughters of a BBC sport commentator with a crossbow is in serious condition in a London hospital and has yet to speak with police. Kyle Clifford was found by British police Wednesday after an overnight manhunt. Police also say a crossbow has been recovered. The victims were the wife and two adult daughters of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt. Police responded to the Hunt's home in the town of Bushey Tuesday night and found the women with serious injuries. All three died a short time later at the scene. A vigil was held Thursday for the Hunt family, where the community came together to mourn and remember the victims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
