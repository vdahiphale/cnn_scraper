We know that not everyone was initially accounted for, some people may have taken themselves to a hospital. Some people may not have gone at all reported their injuries.

But that number could change sadly, because we know that there are people in the hospital right now in the intensive care units fighting for their lives.

Meanwhile, human rights activists fear a crackdown in Kurdish areas of Iran. An activist group posted an unverified video allegedly showing Iranian forces firing indiscriminately into Kurdish cities. And warning in some of the videos disturbing to watch. The group says at least 36 people have been killed in the region since last Tuesday including two 16-year-old boys. CNN has not been able to independently verify those reports. However, in a tweet, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he's quote, greatly concerned that Iranian authorities are reportedly escalating violence against protesters.

We don't know when this video was filmed. It surfaced on social media after a little Kian was killed. It was one of a number of people killed Wednesday in what state media said was a shooting incident in the southwestern city of Izeh where anti-government protests have been raging for days. Family members say Kian was on his way home with his father when he was shot. The Iranian government says this was a terrorist attack. But activists say Kian is a victim of the regime's ruthless crackdown on protests, one of more than 40 children killed since September according to rights groups. Every day for more than 60 days now, Iranians have been burying their dead. More than 300 lives lost in this battle for change. 30-year-old Hudhan Kharami (ph) was shot in the head on Wednesday according to activists. This disturbing video captures the moment a bullet struck him. At Kharami's (ph) burial mourners chant, Mother, don't grieve for your child, we will take his revenge. With every funeral their rage grows the brutality only fueling their determination to risk it all for regime change. That regime struggling to contain the popular uprising is now sentencing protesters to death. Several have been handed the death penalty this week in what human rights groups say are sham trials.

The U.S. allied Syria Democratic Force for says Turkish warplanes targeted multiple locations along the Syrian borders in retaliation for a terror attack in Istanbul last week. At least six people were killed, 81 injured in that Istanbul attack. The Turkish defense minister is praising his forces for carrying out the airstrikes, but the SDF says they will retaliate. North Korea slamming the UN for siding with the U.S. and condemning Pyongyang's recent ballistic missile tests. State TV is reporting that the country's foreign minister said quote the UN Secretary General has taken a very deplorable attitude on the issue. Last week Pyongyang launched an intercontinental ballistic missile which some experts warn could reach the US. By CNN's count this was Pyongyang's 34th missile launch this year.

COP27 has come and gone and much like the other climate summits of the past 26 years there is still no global consensus over how to phase out the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

After all night negotiations, there is agreement that there will be a loss and damage fund set up.

Really, from 2015 onwards, it was becoming increasingly obvious that Russia was seeking to capitalize on irregular migration.

And I think that there is this really profound sense in which Europe is turning in on itself and it's partly because migration has become so politicized, so weaponized our domestic political cultures that actually third parties that wish us harm can use it I think very, very creatively and exploitatively as a kind of wedge issue.

On the other hand, you know, we're moving ahead to see this program, the Artemis program. Other companies, working with companies like SpaceX to developing new hardware, new spacecraft, new boosters that promised to, hopefully, will cut costs to get to orbit and to get to the moon and eventually to Mars. Ideally, we will have a partnership to expand the partnership, expand the partnership. You know, SpaceX is already a contractor that is helping to develop at least one lander or lunar lander for NASA.
