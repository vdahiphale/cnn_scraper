And returns from one of the most consequential elections in Nigeria's History finally trickling in after logistical issues and frustrating vote tally delays an extremely tight three way ways that could go to a runoff but a big early victory of third party candidate Peter Obi. We are live in Lagos with all the latest so much at stake that Africa's largest economy and most populous nation as it grapples with fuel and cash shortages, rampant corruption in the oil and gas sector, a punishing debt load and double digit inflation. We'll be discussing the way forward for Nigeria later in the show with Zainab Ahmed, the country's Finance Minister. And from Presidential votes to stock market quotes. Take a look at this, the major U.S. averages on track for an early session bounce after the worst week on Wall Street since December. Europe, as you can see also headed for a strong Session Result. The S&amp;P 500 meanwhile, falling more than 1 percent on Friday and more than 2 percent for the week that after the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation came in hotter than expected all this of course, raising fresh uncertainties over the path of borrowing costs higher.

The United States once again warning Beijing not to send arms to Russia for use in Ukraine and consequences your new reporting too on the possible origin of COVID from China more on all of that in just a few moments. But first, we do head to Nigeria where results are finally appearing characterized. If a third force candidate election Officials say the Labor Party's Peter Obi has won Lagos state that's the country's most populous region. The state is typically a stronghold of the ruling APC party. It is of course though, a historic election with the country's two party system facing an unprecedented challenge by Obi's Labor Party. But the election has been overshadowed by widespread reports of delays and technical issues. Many voters have complained of intimidation and attempt to suppress their votes. Larry Madowo joins us now live from Lagos. Larry, always great to have you with us! I can see people standing behind you. It's not just about the ability to vote in this election. It's also the ability to access cash. Huge questions, I think being asked about the delays here. How concerned are we that perhaps people question the ultimate result when we finally get it?",

He's the one that got the young people to register and record numbers. And that's why they were trying to change Nigeria, because situations like this, you see a situation outside the bank, where people are queuing up for money because Nigeria recently demonetized the higher currencies of the Naira. It led to a massive shortage and chaotic scenes outside banks. And the election is over; they're queuing up to vote. Now they're queuing up to access their own money. And these are some of the inconveniences of living in Nigeria that people have been telling us they want to change to. They don't want to have to queue up like this to access their own money. And that is why people who didn't have a chance to vote because of disruptions and violence and delays were so upset that they were denied a chance to actually have their voices heard and get determined the leaders, I spoke to some of them.

Were they provided an update to Congress about their investigation into the origins of the pandemic? And in that broader update, there was a section from the Department of Energy that said that agency had essentially changed from undecided to this assessment that it was the most likely explanation in their opinion that this likely leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. However important - up there, they said that they only had low confidence in that assessment that indicates that they did not have robust enough intelligence to draw a more definitive conclusion or say that with more competence, right? So the Department of Energy joins the FBI in basically concluding that the most likely explanation for what happened was that this came from a lab. But still the big agencies here the big Intel agencies, for example, the CIA, they still do not believe they have enough information to say one way or another. Whether this leaked from a lab or whether it came from an animal for example, the other leading theory being that this virus jumped from an animal, say from the seafood market in Wuhan. Now, it is important to note here that the Intelligence Community has made very clear that they do not believe that they can ever get a really definitive explanation for this without the full cooperation of the Chinese government, right? And so, what they have been saying repeatedly since 2021, when they released their first report on COVID origins is that without Beijing's cooperation and without Scientists and Analysts on the ground able to study the source really of this outbreak. It is going to be extremely difficult to ever find a definitive explanation for where this virus actually came from.",

KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: That's right and you heard CIA Director Bill Burns over the weekend, say that essentially, the goal here is to deter China from going ahead with this decision and actually providing military lethal assistance to Russia to be used in Ukraine, because what U.S. Officials have been saying is that final decision hasn't been made by Chinese leadership even though they are confident, as you heard in that sound bite that they are considering it. What the United States feels is that they could back away from it. And obviously, they believe that China should, as you said, there would be battlefield implications here, because any additional military assistance for Russia could prolong this would. And that is exactly what U.S. Officials don't want. So what they're doing is talking publicly about the costs that will be inflicted on China.

And this is one that's been brewing I think for manymonths, but it was really launched last week with Terry Brettell EU Commissioner for the internal market, launching what they're calling a consultation a 12 week consultation on fair share. So this is a battle about who should pay for the future of high speed internet, which, after all, is going to underpin all the hot new technologies you see around here, including AI and ChatGPT got it in there. But also, of course, Web 3, VR headsets, it's all very data hungry. And the cost of the infrastructure that's needed to speed up the internet and keep it running all these technologies is vast, according to the GSMA, which hosts this event and represents all the big telecoms $1.5 trillion is needed between now and 2030. And telecom says they can't afford to foot the bill all by themselves. So the CEO of orange today was stood up on a keynote speech she said around half of European mobile carriers will struggle to survive. They want to see other firms particularly those that stream content, the big tech firms also help pay for that. Now, of course, big techs are not like this at one bit at all. We've had a statement from Meta that says value flows both ways between telecoms companies and content hosting platform. They say they already invest a lot to keep the stuffer online facilities streaming. And they already see that they actually drive lots of content. And they are one of the key drivers for people taking out lots of contracts with mobile phone companies with network companies for broadband and high speed internet. So this is a battle I think that will run quite hotly for next 12 weeks. This is really the stage for the telecoms companies. So we're not really seeing big tech here as much, but it's got 12 weeks to run, Julia.",

Now there's that's going to be a very sort of delicate diplomatic language that is used to explain how this process will move forward because the EU also has strong views on this. But I think it is a measure of the compromises that have been made along the way, particularly over the past couple of months that this announcement is coming today that a deal has been done. But it is likely to be a very thick, heavy legal document that's going to take some time for any of us, specifically, the DUP to be able to go through and figure out where there may be things that they have issues with.",

Nic, I thinksome of the biggest complaints have been the sheer quantity of red tape involved with trade. Obviously, what you've said here is that we're trying to prevent this sort of hard border for goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland without having Northern Ireland feeling that they're in some way segregated or treated differently from the mainland United Kingdom logistically, this still feels challenging?",

      "sentences": "It does. And we've had a few sorts of hints leaks from government over the past month or so that indicate where the deal might belanding. And part of that, as indicated, you know, truckers who take goods between the Mainland UK and Northern Ireland goods that might be sold in supermarkets in Belfast sandwiches, for example, that sort of go over on a daily basis. Things like that have required a lot of paperwork to get them across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, that's at the root of the complaint here. And if the trucks, for example, have had lots of different multiple loads on taking a variety of different goods. Then that's required a huge amount of paperwork leading to hours and hours and hours of delay, crossing over the Irish Sea. That's been the concern. So one approach appears to be this is what's been leaked. That there will be red and green channels, a green channel, if the goods are only going to Northern Ireland, a red channel, if they're going to go to the European Union, across the border, go to Northern Ireland, then across the border into the Republic of Ireland. Of course, the European Union wants a good deal of scrutiny on that. And it's been speculated that possibly the EU will have access to real time live data of what's on those trucks going into the red channel. But all this requires a level of trust. And I think that's part of the accommodation that's been found over the past couple of years to this issue, that it required a greater degree of trust between the UK and the EU that this type of mechanism could work. But again, it's going to come down to the legal detail, specifically saying what can go and what can't go? For example, until now, if you wanted to take your pet dog from UK Mainland to Northern Ireland, something used to be able to do before Brexit with freedom. It's required is required to have the same level of checks and passes health checks and passes on your pet. As if you were taking that pet to the European Union, yet you're only taking it to another part of the United Kingdom. So a lot of detail we've got to hear about yet.",
