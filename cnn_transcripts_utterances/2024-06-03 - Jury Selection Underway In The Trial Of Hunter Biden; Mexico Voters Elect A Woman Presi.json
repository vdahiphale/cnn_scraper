      "sentences": "Yeah, President Biden is preparing to announce a sweeping executive action relating to the border,which sources say could come as soon as tomorrow. This plan would essentially shut down the border for those who are crossing unlawfully as they are trying to seek asylum once a certain threshold is met for those unlawful crossings each day. Now, it comes as the President is really trying to tackle this politically vexing issue head-on at a time when Americans have increasingly shown greater concern about border security. Former President Donald Trump has really tried to make his own hard-line immigration policies a key feature of the 2024 contest. And the White House has increasingly been trying to take this more aggressive approach to try to show that the President is handling and tackling this issue of the border. Now, sources who have been briefed on the potential executive action say that these details could potentially change as the final moments and tweaks are being put on the plan. But what they have been briefed on is essentially that they would restrict the ability for those who are seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border who are also crossing unlawfully, they would restrict the ability of them to be able to actually seek that asylum once a daily threshold is met. That would mean that they would limit this once border crossings have reached about 2500 people on a daily basis, essentially meaning that this would go into effect pretty quickly as the current apprehensions have been just under 4000 people. Now, undocumented or unaccompanied minors would be exempted from this proposal, a move that would likely spark some backlash from immigration advocates and progressive groups, a concern that people could begin to send their children by themselves to the U.S. southern border. Now, what this executive action would do, it would allow authorities to send people back to Mexico or their origin country if they have been crossing the border unlawfully, if those thresholds have been met. And importantly, this is also similar to a policy that former President Donald Trump tried to use when he was in office but was struck down by the courts and really met a lot of pushback from Democrats. So, it's likely that the President's proposal, once announced, could also face similar pushback from progressive Democrats, from immigration advocates, as well as the potential that there could be legal challenges to this down the road. Now, the White House has yet to confirm that the President will roll out this executive action this week. A White House spokesperson simply saying, quote, as we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options, and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system. Now, this all comes as the President's trying to address this issue heading into November's election, and importantly, with that first debate against Donald Trump just a mere three weeks away on June 27th. Now, it comes also as the administration really has become more aggressive in trying to show that the president's doing something to tackle issues at the U.S. southern border. It comes on the heels of just a few months ago, those bipartisan border talks failing up on Capitol Hill as Republicans shot down that plan at the urging of former President Donald Trump. So, what the White House is trying to do is trying to get ahead of this issue, trying to show that the president is doing much more on the border issues at a time when Republicans have really tried to put this front and center in the 2024 campaign.",

It does appear that the Morena Party has both control -- two-thirds control of the supermajority in the Lower and Upper House, which gives them the ability to change the constitution, amend the constitution, as you note, and also bring forward a Supreme Court justice. What can we expect, and what are some of the concerns on that specific front? CORREA-CABRERA: Yes, the two main issues for the country today are security and the concentration of power. The system of checks and balances now is part of the past. No checks and balances, and the possibility of Morena and its allies to pass the so-called Plan C, which is to, I mean, an election of the judges, of the justices by the popular vote, which will be Morena, the capacity of also having influence of the judiciary. That was the only instrument that the opposition had, I mean, to act as a check to the power of Morena. So, basically, now the concentration of power is there. There is a threat to some extent to democracy, because this is what the people wanted. So there is this, I mean, there is this issue that the people wanted, this concentration of power, but it's important to understand that the people of Mexico can also, I mean, check in the midterm election. But at this point, the concentration of power is huge. The polarization of the country remains. But Claudia, at the same time, started with a statement of unity. So, there is hope, as well. She's less radical than Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. She is very consistent, very disciplined, and at the same time, more pragmatical. And there is a chance that, you know, the incorporation into this project of different voices, of different political forces, political parties, will lead us to something better. I really like what she said about unity and incorporating other voices that are not very familiar or that does not fully support, do not fully support the project of the Ford, the government of the Ford transformation.",

Israel saying that they had to be there because they said they discovered a number of tunnels that were used to smuggle weapons in. How much concern is there currently? I know President Biden spoke with President Sisi a couple of weeks back to lower the tensions here and to see more aid quietly cross through.

But the fact of the matter is that we are at a period where Israel really isn't able to have a full conversation with many of its neighbors there on this topic. And I think that, again, goes to the question of why you saw the President make his announcement on Friday. He needs to put pressure on both Hamas and Israel to take this deal on the table. Israel -- of course, the Israelis, over the weekend, tried to, you know, back away a little bit, said, well, he didn't describe it correctly.
