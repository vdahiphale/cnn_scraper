I think this issue of China that you just mentioned, this was something I was looking for in the communique.If you go back just a couple of years, you see how the language and concern about China is growing. In 2022 the Madrid summit, they talked about a systemic challenge from China. In 2023 in Vilnius, the NATO communique talked about this strategic partnership that was growing between China and Russia and being a problem. And now they call it a decisive enabler, a decisive enabler they say because the no-limits partnership is allowing Russia's military machine to work at speed and at pace, produce weapons and armaments that make it a greater threat to the region, a greater threat to NATO. So, that, to me, that's one big take out of the message that's landing. But, it's perhaps not one that's going to reach public because of the conversations about President Biden. Maybe he can lay those to rest in the press conference this afternoon. But, another thing that's an interesting takeaway that's referenced perhaps the United States' position in NATO and commitment to it changing in the future, there is language in the NATO communique that talks about an more important EU-NATO conversation about defense procurement, speeding that, simplifying it within Europe. This is NATO speaking specifically about making Europe better able to produce weapons potentially to compete with Russia or whomever, but better able to be -- have this strong defensive posture that the United States is such a part of. But, this in a way is preparing Europe, maybe, maybe to have to rely on itself more.",

Democrats are said to be stunned at how things have seemed to unravel for the President in the past 24 hours. Sources say several deep-pocketed Democratic donors say they won't contribute to his campaign for now. Still, other Democrats on Capitol Hill are unwavering in their support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): He is the only person to ever beat Trump's ass an election. I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden. And I'm showing up tomorrow with brass knuckles. SEN.

The IDF issued the order on Sunday, urging hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza City to flee to what it's calling safe zones. It comes as Israeli forces move forward with a military offensive in the area. But, the United Nations warns the evacuation order will only fuel mass suffering for Palestinian families, many of whom have been displaced several times.

But, you still have diplomats shuttling around the region, trying to work with the various actors. Remember, the key mediators are Egypt and Qatar.And the other thing to know is that there was some \"cautious optimism\", that was the quote from U.S. officials, cautious optimism around this round of talks. Bigger picture here, what are we speaking about? We're speaking about a deal that was first proposed by President Biden. That is a three-phase deal. The talks were around the first portion, which would potentially be a six-week ceasefire that would see a certain number of Israeli hostages, women, elderly, the sick, the most vulnerable exchange traded for potentially hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. We could also see during this six-week ceasefire, Israeli troops withdraw from some population centers and potentially some Gazans able to return to their homes. But, this is all about working out the details here. How many hostages will be released? How many Palestinian prisoners will be released? What is the sequence of events? How does the logistics of this play out? In the past, Fredricka, these exchanges, these negotiations have taken years. We're now hoping, these diplomats are hoping, that they can resolve this in a matter of days or weeks. And of course, time is of the essence. You have a situation on the ground that gets more and more dire by the minute. You mentioned that Israel's military has expanded its offensive on Gaza City in recent days. Israel's military has also ordered the evacuation of every single person in Gaza City. But, just imagine what it's like to be a family trying to flee your home into an active war zone through what Israel calls are \"safe routes\" but have led, people have died on that route to the south where, again, bombardment continues, where there is no sanctuary, where there is no safe place. You also have the worsening health situation on the ground, the UN seeing famine is now spreading through the Enclave. So, you're seeing more and more desperation inside Gaza, these intense diplomatic efforts to get a resolution underway, but still no progress.",

Others may say, other analysts have said, no, this strengthens Israel's hand on the negotiating table. So, you have this conflict continuing to play out on the ground, continuing to claim lives.

They've also been much more harsh on gay marriage, transgender, access to transgender care.

And it's very much a bilateral matter between the United States and China, and to an extent between the European Union and China. So, I think it belongs more to these powers to really see how and whether they're willing to put some economic cost on Chinese support for Russia or not.",

So, there has been lots of stories on social media about how people are trying to keep their pets cool during this moment of no power and storm cleanup after what was Hurricane Beryl earlier this week.I just arrived back from Houston. It was a difficult situation and continues to be so because the heat index value there, which is a factor of the humidity and the temperature, is just so high and so unbearable. Without electricity, the ability to cool yourself off makes it very, very challenging. So, people are using generators to cool small rooms within their home. And of course, that's got its limitations as well. Not only do we have to cool our pets, but also let's say family members with medical needs. How about their oxygen tanks that require batteries to be recharged? That's the difficulty that people are facing. There is still about 1.3 million customers statewide throughout Texas. But, in Harris County, where Houston is located, there is just over a million customers without electricity still and that's ongoing. And this is amongst a heatwave that has overspread across the region. So, heat indices up over triple index heat. So, this is dangerous for the body. The authorities there are asking people to recognize the concerns with heat-related illnesses, whether it's heat exhaustion or heat stroke, you've got dizziness, headaches, you got muscle cramps, confusion. These are all telltale signs that your body is reacting negatively to the heat, and you need to cool down immediately, seek help, seek shelter, shade, perhaps water, and if you can get a hold of ice. Of course, that would help cool your body as well. Current temperatures right now is what it feels like on your body, in the lower 80s. But, it's climbing steadily. And through the course of the day in Houston, we will be just shy of the 100 degree mark. Of course, local pockets just outside of the city center could easily atop the triple digits. Now, it's not just Texas. It's the western parts of the U.S. as well. Look at this, Las Vegas. Do you see that shading of purple across southern Nevada and the Central Valley of California? That is extreme heat risk for the elderly and for the more vulnerable of our population. In Vegas alone, we have had five consecutive days where the mercury in the thermometer has reached 115 degrees or higher. In fact, there was an all-time record high set earlier this week. That puts it into context, another 100 record-high temperatures possible through the rest of the week. Look at the scorching temperatures. This is just downright dangerous. And if you combine that with no air conditioning, it makes it that much more difficult. Fredricka.",

Penalty given. Kane takes it himself and knocks it in perfectly. He is now the all-time top scorer in knockout games in this competition, with six.And then high drama, as the English went into stoppage time, Cole Palmer with the assistant, Ollie Watkins producing a superb finish right into the corner. It's a sensational strike. What a moment? What a way to win it. Look at the joy there for the Aston Villa man, England and their delirious fans, England 2-1 winners and into the final.

Last weekend, the city saw a demonstration against tourism's impact on the cost of living and quality of life. And these complaints are becoming more and more common in tourist hotspots around the world. CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau has that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): This summer is on track to break records when it comes to tourism. But, increasingly, it's the locals who need the break. In Barcelona, spraying holidaymakers with water to chase them away from cafes, posting fake warning signs on the beaches of Mallorca, tired of being pushed out of city centers where rents have skyrocketed and prices have increased so much that residents no longer feel at home.",

In one Japanese city, locals have blocked the view to Mount Fuji to dissuade visitors, and Austria blocking tourists from taking selfies, and in Amsterdam, cutting down on the city's famous river cruises to try to wrestle back control of the city. Many tourist cities clamping down on short-term rentals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): Unfortunately, they live with this conflict. Those who live in the historic center complained because there is too much tourism. But, if there is no tourism, there are no restaurants or hotels to offer work. Therefore, I believe they have to make peace. NADEAU (voice-over): As important as tourism is to many local economies, striking a balance for those who call these popular places home and those who want to enjoy them is an even bigger priority.
