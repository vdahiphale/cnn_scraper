Meanwhile, Lebanon accusing Israel of killing three journalists. Just 11 days to go until election day, and Kamala Harris brings out the celebrity big guns. Last night, it was Bruce Springsteen and today it's Beyonce. And as the BRICS summit wraps up, a new alliance comes into focus, Russia and North Korea. Welcome to the show. And people in Lebanon losing an apparently key option for getting out of harm's way. Israeli airstrikes near Lebanon's eastern border with Syria have forced the closure of two crossings. Israel says one of those sites was used by Hezbollah to transfer weapons. The other is considered a vital route for Lebanese people fleeing the war. The U.N. called that strike an unacceptable attack on a critical lifeline. Meanwhile, in southern Gaza, at least 26 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli strike on homes and tent camps for displaced people. And in the north, health officials say Israeli troops fired on and entered a hospital in separating men and woman. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comments. I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond joining us now from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what is happening right now? We've been seeing, you know, overnight strikes not only in Gaza, but also in Lebanon, where the border crossings have now been closed with Syria. Give us a sense of what is happening on the ground right now.",

But U.S. officials have grown increasingly critical over the last few months and weeks when it comes to the bombing campaign that Israel has carried out. They effectively told them that they didn't want to see them carrying out those daily strikes in Beirut that we were seeing a few weeks ago. Of course, those strikes in the Beirut area, southern Beirut have intensified again after there was a lull in those types of strikes. So U.S. officials have been saying that the civilian death toll really needs to be examined when it comes to these strikes that Israel is carrying out and, you know, one civilian death is too many civilian deaths, they say. Questions as to how effectively they can pressure the Israelis to change their campaign abound because the Israelis have not in the past abided by what have been these private pressure points from U.S. officials. And the secretary of state wrapping up his visit to Israel, Doha, and the U.K. today. It's unclear if he was able to actually catapult forward real progress when it comes to the Gaza front, when it comes to the ongoing Hamas-Israel conflict there. He went in two these meetings himself and President Biden saying that there was urgency, that there needed to be movement towards an end to the conflict there. And certainly there's some indication that his meetings didn't happen in isolation because there's going to be follow-on meetings with negotiators when it comes to the Gaza conflict this weekend in Doha. The CIA director Bill Burns is going to be attending those. But real questions, real concerns that both Israel and Hamas are not ready to effectively engage in those talks at this time for a number of reasons. Hamas, it's unclear to U.S. officials who's the decision-maker after the death of Yahya Sinwar. And we also talked to U.S. officials who say that for Israel, they're unlikely to actually make any real commitments to a pathway forward to ending the conflict in Gaza until they see what happens in the U.S. presidential elections, which is less than two weeks from today, because they want to know who they're going to be dealing with on the other side of the phone, their U.S. interlocutors based on who wins the elections in just less than two weeks from today.",

And among the big themes was this idea, this need to create a new world order, an alternative to the United States and some of the alliances it's formed with its allies, and that's why what's happening now is even more newsworthy.

Last year when here in Johannesburg, BRICS members decided that they would be expanded and then inviting six new members and we see four new members of BRICS this year. There was often a lot of confusion around, is this now a BRICS Plus? Is that going to change the name? What we do know is that BRICS continued with its name as BRICS. They consider that to be a brand and they would like to continue calling that. BRICS Plus is actually something quite different. It is an initiative that started in 2017 as an outreach of BRICS members to engage largely with countries of the global south. And that provides them the opportunity to dialogue and to provide new ideas but since the expansion last year, many BRICS members have started looking into more specific ways that it can engage in different initiatives within BRICS, but slightly more formally than what is within the BRICS Plus format. And that what had members states have been discussing for the whole year. And they created a new category of countries called BRICS Partners where 13 new members have been invited to participate within this group. They don't have the same commitments that they would as if they had full membership, but I think particularly provides the new members and some of the members that were not particularly excited with the idea of expansion last year with a bit more time and the same space providing this partner countries access to the new initiatives that have been announced in recent years.",

Members of BRICS represent nearly half of the world's population, make up nearly 30 percent of the global economy, by the way, very similar to what we're seeing in the G7 on the world economy, on the economic impact on the GDP front.

If we're looking to the decision-making of BRICS that is entirely done by consensus. That tends to tamper a lot how the decisions are made. So (INAUDIBLE) agree and if we look into the Kazan communique, the Kazan declaration that was presented two days ago, it is a much more nuanced space where it doesn't really talk about creating a new global order. But rather much more clearly presenting a space in which BRICS countries would like to have a more important role within the existing global order.

I think certain countries are countries like Russia, countries like Iran, for them, that is a lifeline, that is the only way they can interact. But for most of the other countries, they would like to maintain their relationships with Western countries and to reduce the risks of potentially reducing interactions, especially with China if the global geopolitical situation becomes far more complicated.",

They believe that there is a huge contingency of these potential voters that lean, right, that would vote for Donald Trump if they actually cast their ballot in November. The way to reach them is not through traditional legacy media. It's not through a traditional rally in a swing state. Instead, they believe it is through these various other channels like YouTube streaming, like podcast, that's why you've seen Donald Trump doing so much two of this untraditional media during this election cycle. And really the king of all of that is Joe Rogan. He has more than 14 million followers on Spotify. He is consistently one of the most popular podcast in the country, if not the world. And Donald Trump's team has been working for a very long time to make this happen, I will remind you that the relationship between Joe Rogan and Donald Trump publicly at least has not always been good during this campaign cycle. Joe Rogan said that all politicians on both sides were manipulative, other than RFK Jr. The reason why that's notable is of course because RFK Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Donald Trump. But one of the things I heard from people the day that it happened was that they were hoping that this would help with their efforts to a Joe Rogan sit-down and ultimately now it is happening today.",

All right, if you get an icy stare from your boss when you ask about a four-day workweek, just tell them it's working out great in Iceland.

There were about 2,500 people involved and the results of thesetrials showed that people that reduced their work hours but were paid exactly the same as they were before were just as productive and in some cases more productive at most of the workplaces. And in addition to that people's well-being shot up significantly. So ever since then, trade unions in Iceland have been negotiating contracts for people to work fewer hours but crucially for the same amount of pay. Now whether or not we can call this, you know, a huge trial, it's more than half of the workforce, it's what normally tried at this stage, it's kind of just reality. But interestingly, Iceland's economy is outpacing much of Europe. Unemployment is low so people are starting to look at this model and being, hey, maybe this is the secret sauce. But, Eleni, I think before everyone rushes out the door as it's kind of tempting to do on a Friday, you probably want to ask your employer, but also, I think it's worth considering that Iceland's quite a different sort of economy to many. It's very, very small and it's also really focused on things like tourism and services. If it had big factory output, I think people working fewer hours may not have so much of this sort of productivity gains that they're seeing.

I'm curious to see that a lot of the trials elsewhere in the world, for instance, here in the U.K., the trials have looked at reducing work to a four-day week, but actually some squeezing the hours.
