And we've seen it again with the previous two indictments. They are coming to his defense. They are criticizing Special Counsel Jack Smith and they're labeling these investigations as political.And I also think that's why you saw Donald Trump try to get ahead of this yesterday by announcing him receiving that target letter on social media. He is trying to control the narrative around this. I also think it is worth noting, Kate, that Donald Trump and his team have been reaching out to lawyers and allies, over the past 24 hours or so, trying to figure out exactly who else might have received a target letter and really try to put together what a criminal case against him might look like. They are very much expecting an indictment to be brought in this grand jury investigation around January 6th, and they want to have all of the tools in their arsenal to try and defend him politically.

We have seen, really, since the beginning of the year, Donald Trump, there's no question about it, and his rivals would agree reluctantly that he's in a stronger position. But what they say privately is that they see the exhaustion, they see the interest among some Republican voters to turn the page and move beyond Donald Trump. Why? Because of electability, because they believe in a general election, a rematch with Donald Trump and Joe Biden about the 2020 campaign simply is not a winning argument.So, what they hope, obviously, is that Donald Trump begins to falter. The question is that's not likely to happen on its own organically. So, who is going to sort of make those inroads here? But again, they have to be patient and watch all of this. And the first debate, of course, on August 23rd would normally be the metric, the place where all this comes together, but we don't know if Donald Trump will show up to that debate or not. So, they do have to run their campaigns and wait and see sort of how the public reacts to these indictments.

And one of the other things in this poll inside the numbers, strong favorability ratings for Tim Scott, Republican voters view him in a very positive and favorable light. He also has a bit of backup to the tune of 40 million. Super PACs supporting him announced yesterday that they planned to spend $40 million in television ads alone in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the three early voting states to promote his candidacy. So, that will almost certainly, with the combination of people viewing him favorably, give him a big boost.But, John, I think you're right. This poll is so fascinating. 37 percent support Donald Trump. Yes, it's better than anyone else, but that means six in 10 Republican voters want to look elsewhere. They want to choose someone else. So, this is not the strength that Donald Trump has nationally necessarily. So, there aren't many state by state polls like this. This is one reason. We know the Republican Party is indeed divided, but 37 percent is not really a good sign for the incumbent, which is essentially what Donald Trump is in this Republican primary. So again, one more reason we say it all the time, but we have to be patient and watch as this plays out. We do not know if these summer numbers will hold. But 37 percent, that is not a position of strength that Donald Trump would like to be, and at least in that early voting state.",

This week, Army Private Travis King crossed the demarcation line. U.S. officials say they believe he did it willfully. In other words, on purpose, and that he is in North Korean custody now.Today, we are learning more about what preceded the incident. The U.S. private was about to be administratively separated from the army and flown back to the United States because of assault charges in Seoul, that was in October. On July 10th, he was released from custody in South Korea. On Monday, he was supposed to fly back to America, but he went to the airport and never boarded that flight. Then on Tuesday, he went on that fateful tour of the DMZ, a private tour. We're learning from his mother, she talked to \"ABC News,\" she said, she's shocked and that she just wants her son to come home. CNNs. Natasha Bertrand is joining us now from the Pentagon.

And essentially, of course, what we know at this point is that he was on a tour of the DMZ and then he crossed that demarcation line into North Korea, willfully and voluntarily, according to the U.S. military.Now, in terms of what led up to this, it is, it is a very interesting timeline. So, he essentially was facing assault charges from assaults in South Korea back in September and October. And he ended up spending 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea doing hard labor. Then on July 10th, he was ultimately released from that detention facility and he was set to fly back to the U.S. on July 17th, where he was going to be separated from the U.S. army. He was going to fly back to Fort Bliss, and there, he was going to be essentially removed from the U.S. military. But he went to the airport with U.S. military officials escorting him, but they couldn't actually take him all the way to the gate, and they essentially lost him. He was supposed to board the plane and then he never did. And then, on July 18th, that is when he took that tour of the DMZ. And at some point, during that tour, he ran across that line into North Korea into, of course, the arms of North Korean military. Now, we have heard from his mother who spoke to \"ABC\" and said that she doesn't think that Travis would do something like this. And she is very surprised because just a few days ago, she had spoken to him and he said that he was planning to return to Fort Bliss. Now, of course, Sara, she's saying that all she wants is for him to come home.",

So, U.S. Forces Korea did release a statement yesterday saying that he -- that the U.S. military had been working with North Korean military officials to try to resolve this situation. However, the senior military commander in charge of the Pacific, he told a forum yesterday that actually they had tried reaching out to the North Koreans, but they have not heard back. And this is not atypical.The Biden administration has been trying to conduct diplomacy with the North Koreans since they took office, and the North Koreans have simply never responded. So, it appears that while they are trying to work with the North Koreans on this, they are still getting radio silence from them. And it remains unclear, of course, at this point, just where Travis King actually is, what his condition is, and if he will be released anytime soon, Sara.",

They're not using the word defect because, of course, they simply don't know what his motivations were for crossing this line. All they really know at this point is that he had been facing these assault charges and, of course, that he was facing further disciplinary action by the U.S. military. He was going to be removed from the army once he returned to Fort Bliss.So, there is perhaps a sense that he was trying to avoid that, that he was trying to buy time, that he was trying to escape any further disciplinary action. But there are no signs at this point according, again, to the senior commander in the Pacific who spoke publicly about this last night, that he had any sympathies for North Korea or that he was trying to defect, for example, in order to give them secrets, perhaps that he had learned from his time in the U.S. military. No signs of that as of now, Sara. But obviously, officials are still working on this and trying to get more insights.",
