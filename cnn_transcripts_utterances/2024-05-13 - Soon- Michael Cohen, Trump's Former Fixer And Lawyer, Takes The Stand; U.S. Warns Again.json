Why? They had -- they could have called him to establish the case. Did they not want to call him because he could corroborate the liar, Michael Cohen? So it's going to be very interesting to note, and I think the defense will ask for -- whether it's a missing witness charge or an uncalled witness charge, et cetera, it's going to be the subject of some dispute. Not to get to inside baseball but there's also a severance agreement that he signed before leaving the Trump Organization. Prosecutors arguing that agreement says he can't disparage. So we can't call him in light of this agreement. The defense saying we don't want that agreement admitted to explain anything. So again, very technical.

That includes 60,000 people yesterday alone. And the U.N. says there's really nowhere safe to go. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins me now.

Blinken, focusing on what comes later on. They're saying what would be more effective is to focus on what comes after this war to prevent Hamas from coming back and filling that vacuum.

But without people on the ground -- investigators on the ground, it is very difficult to make more specific determinations. At the same time, Blinken has said that Israel has very strict standards for keeping civilians safe that they have not always followed. They could do more to try to keep civilians safe. And very notably, he did say that Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas militants. We'll often talk about the estimates -- the numbers of people who have been killed.

KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHORTaking all of this in the broad sense -- it started with President Biden's warning to Israel against that major, major invasion -- a major invasion in Rafah. And you called that warning unprecedented. But along with that warning, Biden said this. \"We're not walking away from Israel's security. We're walking away from Israel's ability to wage war in those areas.\" Do you see a distinction there? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER UNDER DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:  There is no distinction. The Biden administration position is that Israel is entitled to some right of self-defense but not enough to achieve the objective of eliminating Hamas. It is permissible to engage in urban combat. The United States has done it repeatedly in our history, most recently in places like Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq. Studies of those two cities -- after- action reports by our military indicates the casualty ratio of civilians to terrorists was roughly five to one. The estimates of casualties civilian to Hamas in the Gaza conflict has been two to one, meaning Israel's performance is considerably more conservative than the American performance. If Israel is not permitted to destroy Hamas, Hamas will come back, as it already is on north Gaza, which the United States pressed Israel to withdraw its forces from. So I think the Biden administration assessment here is objectively pro-Hamas.",

What to do with Germany. What to do with Japan. Israel is not responsible for Gaza. It withdrew from Gaza 15 years ago. It's responsible -- its government, as is our government, is responsible for the self-defense of its own people. And there's plenty of time to worry about what comes next in Gaza after Hamas is destroyed.

This administration is showing weakness by its public split with Israel. You can argue about what the split is over.
