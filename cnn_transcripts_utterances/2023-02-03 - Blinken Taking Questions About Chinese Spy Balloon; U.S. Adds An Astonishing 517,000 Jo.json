And we've made that clear to China.Any country that has its air space violated in this way, I think, would respond similarly. And I can only imagine what the reaction would be in China if they were on the other end. And what this has done is created the conditions that undermine the purpose of the trip, including ongoing efforts to build a floor under the relationship and to address a broad range of issues that are of concern to the American people, I believe to the Chinese people, and certainly as well to people around the world. So, we took the step that I announced earlier today in postponing the planned visit for this weekend. Meanwhile, we are going to remain engaged with the PRC as this ongoing issue is resolved. The first step is getting the surveillance asset out of our air space. And that's what we're focused on. And I thought it was very important for the senior policy official in Beijing to hear this directly from me. It would be premature for me to weigh in on any other specifics as this surveillance balloon remains in our air space. As I said, job one is getting it out of our air space. We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important. Indeed, this incident only underscores the importance. That's why we will maintain them. That's also why, when conditions permit, I plan to go to China. But the most important thing right now in the moment is to see that this surveillance asset gets out of our air space and we'll take it from there.",

They said, derelict balloon adrift at 50,000 feet, only a 7,000-foot difference.They reported that not all that long ago, near the Kansas City, Missouri, international airport. What's also interesting here is the pentagon says the balloon was cruising at 60,000 feet. There's a question about whether or not this balloon is descending. Remember, airliners are typically at an altitude of 30,000 feet. So, the other big question here is whether or not this balloon will descend and have more of an impact on commercial air travel in the U.S. We have already seen that happen once before. On Wednesday, there was a ground stop and flights were diverted from about a 200-mile swath of air space between Helena and Billings, Montana. We know that lasted for two hours. Now the question is whether or not there will be more ground stops because of this. And how this balloon will descend to the ground, will it pop or come down gracefully?

We don't think that visit can now be as productive as we had hoped. That's why they're pulling down.We heard just now from the secretary of state saying the decision to take this action is detrimental on behalf of China. What that indicates is that the United States believes it was deliberate that China actually allowed or sent this spy balloon over the United States. Perhaps it was even deliberate that it happened right before this trip was going to go ahead, to test the United States. The other thing he said is that the United States right now is focused first and foremost on getting this spy balloon out of U.S. air space. What they're asking China to do, we really don't know, but he didn't count out any additional repercussions for China as a result of this, you know, violating U.S. sovereignty, other than pulling down this trip -- Jake.",

I've never heard the Chinese government expressing regret over its actions before, something akin to an apology right here. Basically coming out and saying, yes, this is our balloon and it's flown off course. They claim it's a meteorological balloon, which of course the Pentagon has challenged that description of this thing.But it is a far cry from the tone that we have typically heard in past years. This so-called wolf warrior diplomacy that's come out of the Chinese government and Chinese officials were aggressive and nationalistic and pounce on things. Instead here, there is acknowledgment that this is theirs. Maybe part of this has to do with the fact that Americans can see this thing with the naked eye. We -- just -- the Chinese government is very opaque, so what is the motivation for sending it up at this time? Is it deliberate? Is it, in fact, an accident that this thing blew off- course? But it is a huge symbol right now. It's not just affecting the U.S. China has summoned the -- sorry, Canada has had to summon the Chinese ambassador there because it flew through Canadian air space as well. So, it does look embarrassing, I could argue, for the Chinese government to have this giant thing floating around, especially when China makes such a big deal about infringements on its own national sovereignty and accuses the U.S. of this almost on a daily basis.",

Let's bring in Frederick Lawrence, the CEO of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and distinguished lecturer at Georgetown Law Center. Frank, welcome back. So, Ohio, like every state -- requires homeschooling instruction to include the basics, math, and reading and writing. It doesn't tell parents how to teach those things, right? Should that change?",
