      "sentences": "Well, exactly right, Jim. I mean, Donald Trump is being uncharacteristically quiet this week, spending the week at his golf course in New Jersey. And luck. Yes, he is attacking the president as well as the vice president. But for the most part, Donald Trump's team tells us they want this story and the hand wringing within the Democratic Party right now about whether or not Biden is fit to serve for another four years to take center stage.Now, I can tell you they're also watching with the rest of America what's going to happen. I think they didn't really anticipate how real of a possibility that Biden could potentially step aside was. I remember on Monday, I was getting frantic calls from all corners of Trump world asking, you know, is this a real thing? What's going to happen? Is he going to step down? So, they're very much, of course, into the dark and trying to plan how this impacts their own campaign. And when I talked to Trump's team, they say, you know, despite us, for months, arguing that Biden would likely have to step down at the convention, I think you remember that taunting that they've been doing from the former president himself, now, they actually are arguing that they're unsure if any other candidate would be easier to beat. They still want Biden to be at the top of the ticket. They also argue, though, that regardless of who potentially could replace him or what's going to happen with the Democratic Party, they still think that the same issues that they are running on, where Donald Trump polls higher than Joe Biden, the economy, immigration crime, all of those will still apply to whoever is on the ticket. But I think they're sitting back and watching with the rest of America. I can also tell you they're going to be watching Biden's interview later very closely and responding to that in real time.

Elena Treene, thanks so much for joining.Let's turn now to Donald Trump's remaining criminal cases. Today, we are learning more about how the former president's legal team is planning to use this week's, that's right, it was this week's Supreme Court immunity decision in their favor. His legal team is right now zeroing in on this particular part of the ruling. \"If official conduct for which the president is immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct, the intended effect of immunity would be defeated.\" Trump lawyers want to use that part of the decision to fight off all the criminal charges against him. Joining me now to discuss exactly how this would work in a court of law, former federal prosecutor Alyse Adamson. Alyse, good to have you on.",

Tell us about this particular line here. How does this impact the existing prosecutions of the former president?",

And essentially, what it's saying is that prosecutors are now precluded from introducing evidence of conduct that could be called an official act to prove a case. And so, that would be for conduct that was purely private. Any conduct that could then be considered an official act can't be used as evidence against the president. So, for example, in the hush money case in New York, there was testimony from Hope Hicks about conversations that occurred with the former president after he won the election. And so, now, the question is, would prosecutors have been precluded from introducing that? So, Judge Merchan, for instance, now has kind of a tough question to answer. And, you know, the opinions kind of ambiguous.So, was the conversation -- could that be considered an official act? Was it on the outer perimeter of his official duties? And if it was, would that have -- it would have been excluded, would it materially impacted the jury's deliberation? So, that is an extremely hard analysis.",

But then, they're not going to be allowed to be used as evidence. And like we were just saying with the Hope Hicks hypothetical, but answer is they're not going to be able to.How can they prove these cases? It's going to be very difficult. And I think that's what Jack Smith's team is grappling with right now. Because after the case goes back to Judge Chutkan, and I'm talking about the election subversion Jan. 6 case, even after Judge Chutkan makes the decision about which official acts are going to be struck from the indictment, which acts are going to be considered private and can stand, then the question is, how can prosecutors prove it if there's so much evidence that is going to be precluded? And I don't think there's a good answer to that question. And I can tell you, I worked at DOJ. When you are assessing whether or not to bring a case, you have to have enough evidence to prove it. And so, we have to wait for those rulings. Jack Smith's going to have a hard decision to make. Is there going to be enough admissible evidence given this extremely broad ruling for the case to survive?",

And many people are pessimistic about a path forward for him. And I think if this interview does not go well, the floodgates will start to open more publicly. I think we've seen a lot of people in private saying they are ready for the president to step aside.

And to be honest, I don't know that it matters that he has a Sterling performance or not tonight, because everyone saw that debate, everyone saw the various responses. And I would say Democrats are more alarmed at the responses to the debate now than they were to the debate itself, blaming it on 11-day old jet lag, or blaming it on Ron Klain or the staff or blaming it on a cold as opposed to just saying, no, that was a really alarming moment, everybody saw it and you have to address it much more forthrightly.",
