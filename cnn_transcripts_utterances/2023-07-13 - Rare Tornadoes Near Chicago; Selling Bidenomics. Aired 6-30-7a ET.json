We are not guaranteed to miss a recession at this point, but it does mean that the Federal Reserve might not have to do quite as much with interest rates, might not have to hit the brakes on the economy as hard as they otherwise would have to, to get inflation down, which definitely improves our changes of missing a recession.That said, I do think that for people at home there's still that concern hanging over their heads. And beyond that we still do have 3 percent inflation on top of 9 percent inflation last year. What that means is that prices are still going up. So they've already gone up a lot and they are still increasing, which I think is maybe why we're not seeing some of that relief in the voter and in the consumer confidence statistics yet. I still think for those at home that still have a concern, and beyond that, we still have 3% inflation on top of 5% inflation. That means prices are still going up. They've gone up a lot and they are still going up. That might be why we are not seeing that relief with consumer confidence just yet.",
