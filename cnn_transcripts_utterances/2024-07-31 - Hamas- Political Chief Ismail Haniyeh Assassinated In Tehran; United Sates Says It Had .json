The events of the past 24 hours with also that targeted assassination as well inside Lebanon in the southern suburbs of a senior Hezbollah commander. You are hearing from different capitals across the region. They are seeing this as a provocation. But there is no doubt that what we saw taking place is a huge embarrassment for the Iranian regime, for its security, for its intelligence apparatus, for the Revolutionary Guard. Israel has made no secret of its intentions to go after Hamas' leadership. They said that back in October, no matter where in the world they may be. So, how did this happen? And, you know, keeping in mind, well, of course, Israel has not taken responsibility for this assassination. Of course, assumptions are now that it was responsible for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. How did this happen? You know, considering this high-profile target, considering that Israel, in the past, has carried out attacks, assassinations inside Iran, how did they manage to carry out this brazen attack? And I think a lot of these questions will be answered when we know more about how this assassination took place in a country where information is very tightly controlled. We are getting very little information about the attack from the Iranians. They have said that it was an aerial -- an airborne-guided projectile that was -- that was the strike, but a lot of questions about how this all happened. But I think no doubt that this is a huge embarrassment for the regime, not only internationally, but also domestically. And, of course, the big question right now is, what do they do next? Because they are in a position right now where they are going to have to respond. Will it be Iran? Tehran responding? Will it be its proxies? What shape, what form that response is going to take is the big question.",

You concluded that the assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr and Tehran and Beirut demonstrate Israel's capabilities.

They are in love with this method and don't see the wider picture. I mean, it was impressive to have this intelligence both in the target in Beirut and the -- above all the target in Tehran. But what is the end game of Israel? And in that sense, I'm afraid that Israelis are becoming an addicted to assassinations because they don't see any other alternative. So if it is supplemented by other means to achieve wider goals, strategic goals, most of Israelis would approve it.

It's intellectually easy to look at it that way, but I would want to offer a different perspective. I know that it's not the conventional one, and I know that many people will disagree with what I say. But, you know, Israel, in the bigger picture, I think has Hamas on the back foot and has made significant gains, military against Hamas. Our biggest lack of achievement, so far, is that there are still 115 Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and it is Hamas that is refusing to agree to a ceasefire. And it is the same Ismail Haniyeh who now is being represented in international media as some kind of modern-day Muslim Mahatma Gandhi, who is a dealmaker and someone who is, no, this is a terrorist who was one of the architects and the enablers of the October 7 massacre. That is his legacy. He is not someone who was busy doing positive things. He is one of the reasons why there still isn't a hostage deal, because he and Yahya Sinwar have been refusing to hand over the hostages and end the fighting and to surrender and stop the fighting, And all the war could have ended if Hamas had, and of course, attacked Israel on October the 7th, then if they would have decided to say enough is enough, and let's save the suffering of the region, and let's return Israeli hostages, but they decided not to. And to close, I'll just say that, you know, this assassination, which I believe was done by Israel, but I cannot say so officially, I think may also drive home the message to Yahya Sinwar and what's left of Hamas leadership, that this train is only going one way. It either goes towards the fate of Ismael Haniyeh and Mohammed Deif, who are no longer going to be terrorizing anybody on this earth. Or you do a deal, and that is what the options that Hamas have currently.",

They're supposed to deliver Hamas and they're supposed to be conduits to a deal. And so far, they have not only not allowed access to Israeli hostages by the Red Cross and to deliver medicines, which they specifically said that they would take care of and they would provide medicine, life, crucial medicine to Israeli hostages hasn't happened. And so far we've seen Hamas' Yahya Sinwar playing hardball against Israeli demands, American demands. And what Qatar themselves have been telling Hamas, listen, this is the deal. Let's go ahead. And so far, Qatar is not delivering. And I think that's -- there are very - - it's an underwhelming performance. I'm happy that Qatar is not taking a more hostile stance when it comes to the assassination of Yahya Sinwar. But let's be clear, had it not been for Qatar enabling Hamas safe refuge in Doha offices and international standing and the facilities, Hamas would be in a totally different position and they wouldn't have the clout or the ability to do the October 7 attack and to threaten Jews and kill Jews. So I wouldn't, you know, treat the Qataris with so much respect. There are any interesting situations, but had it not been for them, their incitement through Al Jazeera and their support of Hamas leadership in Doha, the Middle East would be a much better place and Hamas wouldn't be as a potent of an enemy that it was before October the 7th.",
