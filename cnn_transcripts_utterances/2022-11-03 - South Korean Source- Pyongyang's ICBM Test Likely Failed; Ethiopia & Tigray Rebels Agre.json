That likely included two short range ballistic missiles.And according to a South Korean government source, one intercontinental ballistic missile that's believed to have failed mid- flight. And as a result, warning sirens were heard and residents were told to evacuate inside a building or underground on one South Korean Island and in three Japanese prefectures. Now in response to today's weapons test, the United States, Japan, and South Korea have all come out and condemned the launch, with the U.S. releasing this statement, saying, \"The United States condemns the DPRK's intercontinental ballistic missile launch. This launch is a clear violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and demonstrates the threat the DPRK's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose to its neighbors, the region, international peace and security, and the global non- proliferation regime.\" The United States State Department has also released a recent statement that said all attempts to talk to North Korea have failed. Now this most recent launch comes just one day after North Korea set a new record for the most missiles fired in a day when they launched nearly two dozen missiles, a combination of short-range ballistic missiles as well as surface-to-air missiles, along with 100 artillery shells that all fell into the waters around the Korean Peninsula. Now, today's recent tests marks the 30th time this year that North Korea has launched missiles. That is the most missile tests conducted in a single year in the country's history. And really, North Korea shows no signs of slowing down and a statement before Wednesday's flurry of missile launches Pyongyang once again warned that if the U.S. and South Korea attempt to use armed forces against the North, that they would carry out a strategic mission without delay and that the U.S. and South Korea would pay the most horrible price in history. And earlier this week, North Korea's foreign ministry warned of more powerful follow up measures if the United States doesn't stop its war exercises around the Korean peninsula. And the U.S. is most recent military exercises are ongoing. It's called Vigilant Storm and started on Monday and will continue through Friday. It's worth noting that this large-scale drill between the United States and South Korea was previously scheduled, John, and involves hundreds of aircraft and thousands of service members from each country with the U.S. recent releasing video of its fighter squadrons performing night operations.
