I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. What leverage does America still wield, whether in Israel, in Ukraine, or beyond? And is it as good as its word? There is a rising sense that the values America says it represents in the world are not reflected in some of its actions. In Gaza, the ongoing death toll and the heartbreaking images local reporters bring us every day have pushed the Biden administration into calling for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the flow of weapons from the United States to Israel has continued to pace. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, the government there faces almost the opposite dilemma, ongoing public support expressed by the Biden administration, but without sending the weapons and ammunition so desperately needed thanks to intransigent Republicans in Congress. President Zelenskyy couldn't have been clearer warning this weekend that, \"If Congress does not help Ukraine, Ukraine will lose the war.\" For decades, Wendy Sherman has been at the center of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, serving under three presidents and five secretaries of state. Sherman was Antony Blinken's top deputy until she retired last summer. And we want to welcome you back to the show from Washington. Good to have you with us. WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE:  Great to be with you, Christiane.",

And there's, as you know, a rising call, even inside the United States, to at the very least condition continued weapons deliveries and, in many areas, to suspend them. Why do you think this Biden administration has so little leverage with Netanyahu's government?",

What is the dramatic fashionthat you think, in which you think, policy might change? Because let's just be frank, nothing has changed in terms of Netanyahu's public response and maybe it's even his private response to the president about, let's just say, a counteroffensive on Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have been told by the Israelis to seek shelter. And the Biden administration says don't do it. There's a huge op-ed. In fact, I'm going to read a little bit right now from the presidents of Jordan, Egypt, and France in which they are saying, we warn against the dangerous consequences of an Israeli offensive on Rafah, where about one and a half Palestinian civilians have sought refuge. Such an offensive would only bring more death and suffering, heighten the risks and consequences of mass displacement of the people of Gaza and threaten regional escalation. So, in other words, everything that could go wrong and could get worse could happen if that offensive happens. And Netanyahu has said no force in the world will stop us. That is, I mean, thumbing your nose at your greatest ally who's actually supplying you with the weapons to continue right now.",

Security Council resolution as opposed to vetoing it, because we know that the world is just stunned by what has happened by the tragedy, the humanitarian tragedy, and the World Central Kitchen loss, which is heartbreaking, is one of over 200 aid workers who have lost their lives, many of them Palestinian aid workers. At the same time, let's none of us forget that there are still well over 100 hostages, hopefully, still alive that are being held by Hamas after the most brutal attack on Israel. So, I don't think there's anyone left who doesn't think there needs to be change here. The entire world is saying what was just said in that letter that you repeated, which in fact John Kirby and Matt Miller at the State Department have said as well, which is a ground advance into Rafah is not something that the United States supports. We do not support that kind of offensive. We understand that Israel wants to make sure that Hamas is never a threat to Israel ever again. But there are many ways to do that. Secretary Blinken said today that, in fact, we expect Israelis to be in Washington perhaps as soon as next week to talk about other ways to approach the concern.",

But everybody, especially in the western world, also agrees that there are rules of the road and that this Israeli offensive has stepped so far outside those rules that its greatest allies are very, very worried. So, given the fact that many people say your best friend should help you if you're drunk, take the keys away from you, do not keep driving, if you were the -- still the negotiator, still the point person, as you have been in many occasions, what would you say either to the Israeli prime minister or whoever's involved about how actually to fix this?

And again, talking about Israel, most of its allies -- of course, its adversaries don't care, but its allies believe that it is losing the moral high ground, it is incredibly isolated, it's what's caused Chuck Schumer, senior senator here in the United States, to call for new elections in a different way of prosecuting this war. So, you've talked about it a little bit. So, what happens, and what do you think is going to happen, when the next inevitable escalation comes, which is the telegraphed response that Iran says it will have to make for the attack on its diplomatic facility and the death of its individuals there? What do you think would be a proportional response, or a likely response, given your experience?",

So, there's a very dangerous road here. And Christiane, as someone who, as you noted, has worked for three presidents and five secretaries of state, one has to persist. We didn't have to be where we are. I was looking back, thinking about this interview, to the first time I was assistant secretary for legislative affairs, and watched as Rabin and Arafat were nudged together by then-President Bill Clinton to shake hands, and all the work that was done at Wye River in Shepherdstown and Camp David, how close we were, and now how far away we are.",

It should be about what it means for democracy, for our own future, as well as the future of Europe. None of us want to be back fighting any kind of a war in Europe, again a wider war in Europe. We would indeed -- I'm sure Putin's next objective might be a NATO country, which means under the articles of NATO, we would have to come to the defense of that country. And so, we would be all in with troops on the ground in a way that we are not. Most of the money, your viewers should understand, that goes to Ukraine, actually goes to the U.S. military industrial complex to build weapons, and very little of it goes to supporting the governing structure of Ukraine so that they can survive to defend themselves.

And seven weeks later, together they've decided they got to send Franklin to France because the country was broke. They're still in the middle of the war with the British. You know, their army is ragtag. They have no weapons, no ships and everything else. So, they sent Franklin to France to get their support. I mean, I found it so ironic that this new democracy would take one of the biggest monarchies in the history of world to support them. And that's the one question I'm going to have for you, you know, how did he even imagine that he was going succeed? And as Stacy's book's title says, \"The Great Improvisation,\" with all that his had achieved, he didn't know what the hell he was going to do. And so, he took his grandson, who he'd sort of nurtured with him, Temple.
