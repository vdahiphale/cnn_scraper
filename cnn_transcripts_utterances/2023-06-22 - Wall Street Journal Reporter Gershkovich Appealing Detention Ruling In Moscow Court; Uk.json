We know his parents, Ella and Mikhail, are also -- who emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1979 -- they are also there in the courtroom.And when you compare and contrast the pictures of him in detention in the courtroom now compared to when he was first put in the courtroom a couple of months ago, he doesn't look as tired, but he doesn't all -- he also doesn't look as if he's been allowed to have a haircut. He perhaps looks a little more relaxed. But there is no reason, of course, for him really to be able to relax. This is all about trying to get his three-month extra detention cut there. A month ago, when he was last in court, he was given three months additional custody before his case of espionage was going to be heard. There's been appeals against that. We heard from the deputy Russian foreign minister today saying the Russian Foreign Ministry is considering the U.S. request to have a meeting with Evan. We know that at least -- on at least two occasions, so far, that consular access has been denied. It's not clear if the Russians are being genuine when they say this. They seem to be dangling this out just on the very day when he appears in the courtroom. Though his physical condition looks OK, his parents will be there. They will be perhaps the best judge of that.",

Nice to see you this morning.Ukrainian officials say their slow but steady counteroffensive is making notable gains in the south, both in the eastern Donetsk and the southern Zaporizhzhia regions, but Russian President Vladimir Putin claims that Kyiv's offensive is failing because of heavy losses. We want to warn you about some disturbing video we're about to show you. CNN's Ben Wedeman reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An unknown Russian soldier lost his life here on a dirt road in this small village of Neskuchne. He was killed in Ukraine's counteroffensive which has at best, so far, put a small dent in Russian lines -- hardly the turning point so many had hoped for. WEDEMAN (on camera):  This is one of the villages that was liberated by the Ukrainians -- this one on the 10th of June. And clearly, the Russians were in a hurry. They left behind this blood-soaked stretcher. WEDEMAN (voice-over):  It's still too dangerous for civilians to return to these once tranquil farming communities and there isn't much left for them to return to. The mortar crew of the 35th Ukrainian Marine Brigade has moved into a house recently vacated by Russian troops. This afternoon they're busy piling up newly arrived American-made shells -- far better than the old Soviet ammunition, says Andri. ANDRI, UKRAINIAN 35TH MARINE BRIGADE:  (Speaking foreign language). WEDEMAN (voice-over):  \"It's amazing. They're just great,\" he says. \"They hit the bullseye -- my favorite.\" Throughout the day, shelling echoes around them. The Russians may have left the village but they're still nearby. Yuri's mortar training in Britain didn't prepare him for the front. This is only his third day in the line of fire. YURI, UKRAINIAN 35TH MARINE BRIGADE:  (Speaking foreign language). WEDEMAN (voice-over):  \"There are moments when I want to hide,\" he says, \"but I have to stay put and wait. Unit commander Oleksandr takes coordinates from headquarters. His men make the adjustments and prepare their rounds. WEDEMAN (on camera):  They're firing these rounds at Russian lines, which are four kilometers or 2 1/2 miles away. WEDEMAN (voice-over):  It's going to be a long, hot summer.

According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and The Athletics' Shams Charania, the Celtics trading Marcus Smart to the Grizzlies in a three-team trade. Boston is getting Kristaps Porzingis in the deal, while Tyus Jones goes to the Washington Wizards. The Celtics also got a pair of first-round picks in the trade from Memphis, including the 25th pick this year. It's after five conference finals and an NBA finals together. This deal ends the Smart-Jayson Tatum-Jaylen Brown era there in Boston. All right. Elsewhere, Florida is now on to the finals at the College Baseball World Series. This one was a nail-biter. TCU down to their final out. Brayden Taylor just smokes this ball to center, but Michael Robertson -- a great catch as he slams it into the wall. The Gators win 3-2, eliminating TCU and clinching a spot in that final for the first time since they won it all back in 2017. They'll now await the winner between Wake Forest and LSU. The Tigers staying alive thanks to a big third inning. Cade Beloso, the big three-run home run there. LSU would win that one 5-2, setting up a rematch for a spot in that final. That game is at 7:00 Eastern tonight. And finally, a night after the Rangers were hosed on a replay call that Bruce Bochy called the worst call ever, it happened to the Padres last night. Fernando Tatis guns down Blake Sabol here at the plate, but the Giants challenged it. And the umpires came back and said that Gary Sanchez blocked the plate. Therefore, the runner was safe. You see Sanchez just going to get the ball and make the tag. So that would have been the third out in the inning. Instead, the Giants score four runs and would win the game 4-2.

And it actually falls most heavily on people who are least capable of affording it in the sense that if a lot of your budget is going to food, and gas, and these necessities, it's harder to just pull back on those things when prices go up. So that's obviously an issue.But on the other hand, when you have a recession or a significant slowdown that's induced by these interest rate increases, people who lose their jobs tend to be very vulnerable people in society. And obviously, a job loss completely zeroing out your income for some time is even more significant -- more acute, perhaps, than increasing prices. And so, it's a very unpleasant trade-off but the argument that Chair Powell and his colleagues make is if you don't make that trade-off -- if you don't get the inflation under control, we just don't have the stable foundation for the rest of the economy to grow on and that can haunt you for decades.",

All of those European nations are much more exposed to the war in Ukraine than we have been in the sense that they had big energy price increases -- not as bad as expected but still pretty bad -- and those passed through to other types of goods and services.And so, I think that you just don't want to declare too much victory over inflation at a time when some of the reason inflation is lower here really does tie back to good luck rather than necessarily a policy success. And so, I think for the Fed, that's why you have to stick to the message that this process isn't over.
