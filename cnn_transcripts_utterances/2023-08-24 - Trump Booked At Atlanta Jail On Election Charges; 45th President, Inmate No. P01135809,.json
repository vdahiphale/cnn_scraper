We are sitting outside the Fulton County Jail, where Donald John Trump, the 45th President of the United States was booked, is inmate number P01135809, here, less than an hour ago. He has already departed. It is also the place, where he became the first former or sitting President, ever to have his photo taken, for a mug shot, a mug shot that you can see here, created during the booking process, for his fourth felony booking, his fourth booking, I should note. The vital statistics, on his booking record, read suspiciously Trumpian. He is listed as six foot three, 215 pounds, blue eyes. Hair given, as, and I'm quoting now, from the booking sheet, \"Blonde or strawberry.\" I should note that what we were told before he arrived here, by our sources, is that was going to be paperwork, aides filled out, not actually here, at the jail. Trump was in and out of the jail, in about 20 minutes, arrested, booked, photographed and fingerprinted. And then, he was released under a bond agreement, much like his co-defendants. He did not pay the full $200,000 (ph), one of the highest bonds that we have seen, in this entire case. Instead, he used a bail bonding company, called Foster Bail Bonds LLC. Another historic first. A short time later, Trump was on his way, back to his Bedminster golf club, after about an hour and 40 minutes total, here, on the ground, in Atlanta. So, you can see here, inmate P01135809, wheels up. I'm here, outside the Fulton County Jail, I should note, with Sara Murray. But now, also joining us is Anthony Kreis, an Assistant Professor of Law at Georgia State University College of Law. And thank you for being here. Of course, now that we have seen him go through this process, like the other defendants have, but with a few tweaks, what are you looking for next?",

And this state judge has been on the bench, as Jen said, less than a year. Now, he's a former federal prosecutor, a former state prosecutor, under the D.A. I think you make a good point about whether Trump, which trial judge he would prefer, as between state and federal. But I would be stunned if Trump does not seek to remove it to federal court, because, the counterarguments to me, the tactical advantages, for Trump, of getting the federal court, to me, vastly outweigh that. Start with the appeals court. Whatever happens, at the trial level, whatever decisions get made, whatever verdict, ultimately goes up to the appeals court. Federally, you have the Eleventh Circuit, which is very conservative. They've ruled against Trump, for sure. But if you're Trump, you want that conservative court. You're going to have a better jury pool, if you're Donald Trump, in the federal court. Fulton County, if it's state, 26 percent of Fulton County voted for Donald Trump. If you get into federal court, you're into the Northern District of Georgia. He got 68 percent in Cherokee County, one to the north, he got 65 percent, in Forsyth County, to the northeast. So, you'd much rather be there, for your jury pool. Also, and most importantly, if you get into federal court, then you can ask for a dismissal. Now, there's a little bit of extra legwork that you have to do. But if you can get that, as Donald Trump, that is the golden ring.

And it just underlines to me that a lot of what's going to happen, before these trials began, is going to pass essentially unnoticed, in the political realm. The real issue here is that one or more of the trials go to -- occur before the election, and then whether he's convicted or acquitted. And that's why I think this scheduling date, for Ken Chesebro's trial, in the Georgia court, in this case, is such a stunning development. I don't know what strategy his lawyers were following. I've seen it reported. People have said, on your show that he was -- that his lawyers were taking a gamble, that it was a bluff. If that's the case, they ought to be convicted of malpractice. They must have a strategy. They must think they've got some idea, what to do, here. And I think the consequences are potentially enormous. If Chesebro is acquitted, given his role, as the author, according to the indictment of the memos that laid out the alternate elector strategy, if he's acquitted, or gets a hung jury, which they will spin as an acquittal? I think that's going to have an unbelievable political effect. I think I had been looking simply at the Trump trial. But if Chesebro goes ahead, and is acquitted? It vindicates Trump's narrative.

[21:25:00] I think this is actually simpler, than a lot of the discussion, here. A President, who is running for reelection, is not just the president. He's also a political candidate. He has First Amendment rights, like any other political candidate. But he doesn't have a First Amendment right to commit a crime. None of what Trump did here is part of his presidential duties. Just like when Al Gore contested George W. Bush, in Florida? That didn't have anything to do with his vice presidential duties. He was doing it as a candidate, and he was permitted to do it, because he followed the legal path that Florida permitted. So, I think, actually, the case should not be removed, because what these defendants did? They did in a First Amendment capacity. And the notion that the Hatch Act was amended, to cover officials, in the Executive Office of the President, which Fani Willis has cited, in her briefs, I think, is unconstitutional.

And, to your point, about where he was headed, today, and how grim the circumstances are, and how grim the location was? They've done very little. They've had sort of descending appearances, and public statements, from him, since the second indictment.

He'll be great, in this case. I'm sure, he's certainly competent, and used to handling these larger cases, and high-profile cases, RICO-type cases, so that'll be fine. But there's no way that a lawyer can be ready on this case, having just got in it, in that amount of time, especially for what I would call the lead defendant, in a case. The Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to have an effective lawyer, not just a lawyer, but somebody that's effective. And to have that, you really have to have time to prepare. The lawyer has to have that time. And so, the judge is not going to hold him or anybody else to this October date. Chesebro wants it. And I think it was a good strategic move, frankly, by his lawyers, because it sort of throws down the gauntlet, and it says, \"Let's move forward. And if you've got a case on us, let's see what you've got.\" And I don't think it could have been a welcome thing, to the District Attorney's office. But that's the way the law is written. And there are certainly competent lawyers too, and know that. So, I really think with the multitude of motions, you're going to see, the likelihood of some interlocutory appeals, that this case is way, way down the road. I mean, it would shock me, if we see it at all, before the election. I just don't see how that's going to happen. I mean, again, think about just selecting a jury, we can go by what's happening in Atlanta, now, with a jury selection, in a RICO case, it's taken seven months, to pick a jury. And so, that's an issue. Getting it into federal court is not a bad thing, for the lawyers. It's a more structured process.
