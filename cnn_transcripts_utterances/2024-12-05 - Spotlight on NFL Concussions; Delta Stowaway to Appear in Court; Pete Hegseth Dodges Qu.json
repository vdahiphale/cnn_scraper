Are you going to be ready? And essentially what Hegseth said was he'd be ready at 3:00 a.m., he'd be ready at 3:00 p.m., and he'd be ready at any hour in between. Now, our Morgan Rimmer was pressing Hegseth as to what he was telling Republican senators about some of those allegations of drinking. Here's what he said.",

Hegseth maybe doesn't want to talk about what senators are telling him, but there's a moment where this is going to be a confirmation battle. These are going to be happening in a public setting. And Cramer reminded him last night in their meeting that not everyone on the committee is going to be -- and these are Cramer's words -- going to be as friendly as Cramer was yesterday in that private setting, and so just sort of reminding him what is at stake, what these meetings are going to feel like. Again, we are still weeks, potentially months from that moment as we are waiting to see Hegseth's nomination and whether or not it continues to hang in the balance -- Pam.",

The FBI says officials arrested her on Wednesday after she stepped foot back in the States. Joining us now to discuss this case is former TSA Administrator John Pistole. John, I'm so looking forward to your insights on this, especially after we learned from the TSA that this woman initially went through this line that's designated for airline flight crews and was able to slip through somehow and get on the plane to Paris and hide in the bathroom. How does that happen?",

      "sentences": "Well, right, Pamela.There's actually three points of failure in this instance, one, as you mentioned the airport employee at JFK there who is to check the credentials, the identity for flight crew. Some places, it's known as the known crew member lane. So they would go through that. And then at the document checker for TSA, and she was able to get in behind a family and not have her identity checked. And then, at the gate, as you mentioned, the Delta gate agent for whatever reason did not identify her, allowed her to board the plane, as we learned. And so those three points of failure are of great concern to each of the entities I mentioned. The good news is that she was physically screened by TSA at the checkpoint. And, as has been reported, I believe that there -- she had two bottles of water on her and those were detected, and she gave those up. And so out of the 18 million or so people the TSA screened over the Thanksgiving break, she was one who got by the identity check. So the bad news, she didn't have her identity checked. The good news is, she was physically screened, so if she was a putative terrorist, for example, that -- and had an underwear bomb or something like that, she would have been detected and not allowed to obviously proceed like that.",

Is there adequate training for all their employees? Was it a new employee at the gate?

      "sentences": "Well, this past weekend, yet another big hit in the NFL is spotlighting concussions.Jacksonville Jaguar quarterback Trevor Lawrence was taken out of the game after being illegally hit by a Houston Texan linebacker who has since been suspended for three games. And this has put the spotlight back on head injuries in America's favorite sport. So let's bring in our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who is a practicing neurosurgeon and deals with the head injuries like this in the operating room. So, I mean, Sanjay, just watching that hit, what did you think? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think, for most people, it was awful to watch. I think, if you're a neurosurgeon, it was horrific to watch. I mean, there are several things. We will just show this one more time. And I just want to point this out, several things happening. First, you see the hit on the helmet first and then there's a rotation, and then his head hits the ground. So just let me show you on this brain model for a second, Pamela. You're sort of moving -- the brain is moving within the skull, within the helmet accelerating, and then a rapid deceleration. That's the first hit,and then a turning of the brain and then that sort of hitting on the turf. So it was sort of in some ways three separate blows to the brain specifically that occurred within a very short time. But let me show you this other video quickly in terms of what happens after that, because this is the thing that I think most people from a medical standpoint really pay attention to. So, again, you see from a different angle the same hit, but watch what happens to him immediately after. Left arm goes straight up in the air and right arm is flexed. This is what -- this is a type of posturing it's called, the fencing position. And that's really concerning. I mean, that's a brain injury for certain, Pamela. And, again, just pulling out the brain model for a second, you have all these pathways from the brain that are eventually going into the spinal cord. You have the brain stem in between. When you see that sort of fencing posture that you just saw, that's an indication that there's been a disruption of some of these pathways. So, look, it's a really significant injury. We know that Trevor Lawrence was able to get up. He was communicative shortly after. That's obviously a good sign. But there are certain criteria that are what are called no-go criteria. It's always the question. Does someone come out of the game? Do they stay out of the game? The no-go criteria includes several things, as you might imagine, loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, but also that fencing response. So that's for sure someone who cannot return to the game for obvious reasons.",

There's no set return to play sort of timeline from an NFL standpoint. But the way they do it is, they basically start to introduce, in a graded sort of way, different levels of activity, trying to see if someone has any symptoms, so light activity at first, and then going all the way to full activity, but making sure he's not having symptoms, headache, or other problems, when he's doing these things.",
