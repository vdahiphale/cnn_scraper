In a filing leaked Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith blasted Judge Aileen Cannon for her handling in the case, arguing the judge's decision and tactics are ultimately stalling.

The judge in the hush money case basically dispensing with this kind of last-minute Trump attempt to delay the case there. But this stuff that's going on with Aileen Cannon, this sort of surprise filing from Jack Smith and now Ty Cobb racing - raising the possibility that she could actually get thrown off of that case. Can you help us understand - like, is that a possibility? How would that play out? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: It always could be. There are steps before you really get to that point. There's one thing that's outstanding still that she hasn't ruled on about releasing witness names that is in the position if she rules against what the Justice Department wants, which is to protect FBI agent names and witness names in this case. They already lost that once before her, asked her to reconsider. If they lose again, then that is primed to go to the appeals court. You can't always do this thing called mandamus. That's the legal term for it where you take an appeal out of line with the typical process. But there's a lot happening in this case that she just isn't ruling on. And this filing from Jack Smith says, move this along promptly. You're asking us to engage in thought exercises that just don't make sense. That's the position of the Justice Department, the prosecutors. And also, on top of that, it's been 34 days, not just not ruling on anything that's been fully briefed, but 34 days since both sides appeared before her and asked her to set a trial date and gave her proposed schedules. Nothing. Shermichael, what is your sense of - I mean this is obviously becoming very political, right? Yes.",

I think the Democrats need to be aggressive about not letting Kennedy go undefined and unchecked throughout the race. I don't think that President Biden needs to engage Robert Kennedy directly, but I do think this is the kind of thing they should be doing. They should be spending money on making sure that people know who Kennedy is, and also that they understand that there isn't a world in which Robert f. Kennedy Jr. is going to be president of the United States. He's not going to win enough electoral votes to be president.And so I think what the Democrats also have to do is help people understand, is run an education campaign essentially to help people understand that a vote for Robert Kennedy is a vote for Donald Trump. It's not a vote to put someone else in the White House. So, I think it's smart for them to do this. We know this is going to be a close race. We know third party candidates have the potential to swing battleground states. And so for them to sit back and just give Kennedy a free pass I think wouldn't be smart. It would be foolhardy.",

And those donors are Trump donors. And so whatever Kennedy says where - in his speeches, the money that is spent by that PAC will be spent - that super PAC will be spent to attack Biden because the people are funding it, the people are directing it.
