The hospitals will not be able to deliver lifesaving services nor keep the life-support machines nor the incubators on if they do not receive fuel that will help their generators generate electricity for all these machines.

International aid groups are warning that efforts to deliverbasic services to the 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza, are at the point of collapse. Officials from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency say they may be forced to shut down their operations completely in the hours ahead unless more fuel is delivered. The World Health Organization says six hospitals have already been forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel. Israel has so far refused to let fuel shipments into Gaza, fearing it could be used in the Hamas war effort. And there's rejected calls for a ceasefire that would allow more aid into Gaza overall, even as it steps up its air attacks there. Now, sources telling CNN that U.S. officials are trying to convince Israel not to launch an all-out ground incursion into Gaza that would imperil the lives of more Gaza residents as well as hostages. The U.S. is urging Israel to carry out only targeted raids inside Gaza, along with precision airstrikes. Now, a Syrian state media saying meanwhile that eight of its soldiers have died, and at least, seven others have been injured after an Israeli airstrike near the city of Dara. The Israel Defense Forces is confirming that it carried out the attack in response to Syrian missile launches, targeting Israel's Golan Heights region. Tensions in the Syrian-Israeli border are intensifying, even as Israel beefs up its military presence near the border with Lebanon. Israeli forces have been exchanging gun and rocket fire with Hezbollah and other groups there, avoiding a spread of the conflict to Lebanon remains a main goal of the United States. Jomana Karadsheh joins us from southern Lebanon. I was really grabbed by an image that we've seen of the leader of Hezbollah meeting with leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials, you know, so a very worrying scene, isn't it? For when -- many sort of politicians in the West. But also, I think the first time we've heard from Hezbollah on this officially.",

Many here don't want to speak to us on camera, it's the indignity brought by displacement. Amal barely made it out with only the clothes on her back when a neighbor sent her a photo of the damage her house sustained. \"We've endured the economic situation, stayed in our homes\", she says, \"in the land of our parents and grandparents, all that we've worked for. I just hope it calms down, and we can go back to our homes. We cannot take any more.\" Israel and Lebanon say they don't want another war, but with tensions this high and the  two enemies so close, everyone is preparing for the worst. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Earlier today we did hear from the Israeli military saying that their troops inside Israel were targeted with anti-tank missile. There were no casualties, but they say they responded with artillery and tanks. And you know, this is officially not a war yet, but Hezbollah has so far announced that 40 -- more than 40 of its members have been killed in the fighting over the past couple of weeks. And, you've had several civilians who have been killed on the Lebanese side, we know there have been casualties as well on the Israeli side, but they have not released those figures. So, the situation is very volatile, Max, especially as this -- as they continue to trade fire across the border. And I can tell you, a lot of people are really worried that it could take any miscalculation that could trigger an all-out war here. We've heard the warnings coming from Israeli officials to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran, saying that they need to stay out of this. That if they do escalate the situation, that Israel would respond with a force that would wipe out Hezbollah. But you need to keep in mind that they were not able to do this back in 2006 during that month long, devastating war for Lebanon, and Hezbollah of today is not that of 2006, these are now battle-hardened forces, there are troops who have -- there are fighters who have been in Syria for more than a decade. They do have more advanced weaponry right now, precision-guided missiles. And you know -- and also, we need to keep in mind that the people of Lebanon, that this country can't handle another war as you heard there, in our report. Max.",

So they're trying to improve their PR. But I must say, if one hostage was treated well, and I guess she was treated well, obviously, it was horrific, I mean, to be a hostage in Gaza is a horrific experience.

But the question is, what will they get in return? It will not be for free, I guess. And above all, we have to remember that the real struggle will be over the soldiers. And there are tens of soldiers, soldier men and soldier women as hostages. And the real tough negotiation or bargaining will be over those soldiers. And then, if I may guess, Israel will have to release thousands of Palestinian prisoners if Israel wants to see them released. I know, for many Israelis, it's a hell of a prize, not for me by the way, but that's OK. But this will be the real choice. Finally, we have to stand in front of this choice. Thousands of Palestinian prisoners, part of them serving decades in Israel prison, part of the political prisoners, part of the prisoners with no trial, and part of the terrorists, but this would be the real choice.

This fatigue as I said is very strong. I think one really interesting aspect of Johnson internationally is that, he is very opposed to aid to Ukraine. He's voted against aid to Ukraine almost every time it came up in the house. President Biden, of course, last week asked for $60 billion more aid to help Ukraine survive its onslaught from Russia over the next year, that's going to be a huge uncertainty if Johnson really does take the gavel and become a speaker.",
