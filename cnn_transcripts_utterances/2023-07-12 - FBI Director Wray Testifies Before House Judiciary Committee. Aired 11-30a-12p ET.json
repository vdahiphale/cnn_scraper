That's what Republicans claim. And also if it's been weaponized against conservatives.But some of the key things that we heard today is one, about whether Catholics were being labeled as extremists. That's part of that Richmond menu that the FBI later withdrew and is defending -- we heard Wray defend that today. We're also hearing about school boards and whether parents -- conservative parents, in particular, were targeted as part of an FBI strategy around some of their complaints with school boards. And again, as we both pointed out, censorship here. Whether the FBI has played a role in whether the government is censoring speech online, particularly as it related to the story about Hunter Biden's laptop. And these are all things that the committee have been investigating for months now. Not even just in the majority, which they've had since January, but even last year and last Congress when they were in the minority. They have been pulling together a lot of information. And so, it's all kind of led to this moment today with Wray in front of them. And as you all mentioned, it's become very political. We've seen a lot of these committee hearings become political in the past, but Director Wray is a top target for Republicans and Jim Jordan, the chairman.
