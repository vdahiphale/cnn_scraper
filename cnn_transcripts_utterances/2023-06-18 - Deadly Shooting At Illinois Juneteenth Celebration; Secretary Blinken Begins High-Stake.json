I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with what has been a violent holiday weekend all across the United States. Gun violence rattling communities from Washington state to Georgia. In Illinois, authorities are trying to figure out who opened fire at a Juneteenth celebration in the Chicago suburb of Willow Brook. That was overnight. One person died and at least 22 others were injured. Investigators say several of those who were hurt were trying to flee the chaos. CNN's Camila Bernal has been following the story. Camila, what more are you learning about the investigation?",

They're also saying and giving us essentially a better timeline of what happened.They say that this all -- the Juneteenth celebration started at around 6:00 p.m. and they say that law officers were present at the time and throughout the event, but it was at around 12:25 p.m. when they received a phone call, a 911 call that was reporting an alleged fight taking place nearby. So some of these officers responded to this fight. And as they're trying to figure that out, they hear the gunshots and so they immediately go back to the Juneteenth celebration. And of course it is chaotic. Witnesses describing just trying to get out of the area, trying to get themselves into safety. I want to you listen to some of these witnesses and what they had to say.

Another teen is critically injured after being trampled while running from the scene. Police say they recovered several weapons including an AR-15 style rifle. Right now they have a 17-year-old suspect in custody.And then to central -- excuse me Central Washington, where two people are dead and several others injured after a mass shooting at a campground near an amphitheater last night. The Grant County Sheriff's Office saying that the suspect shot randomly into the crowd and then walked away from the scene before they took him into custody. Authorities have not given any details on the suspect, on the victims or a motive. The amphitheater was hosting a two-day music festival at the time. Organizers now say that today's performances have been canceled. And then in Georgia, officials are investigating a shooting that happened outside a nightclub near Atlanta. That was overnight. Our affiliate WSB reports five people were shot but their conditions have not been released. Authorities are not saying what led up to the shooting or if any arrests have been made. These incidents all across the country adding to the more than 300 mass shootings in the United States just this year. That means almost two per day on average. Now, to a high stakes visit to China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with his Chinese counterpart Qin Gang for more than five hours today. The Biden administration says the trip is meant to thaw tensions between the two countries amid a series of setbacks between China and the U.S. China's foreign minister says relations between China and the U.S. are at the lowest they've been in decades. But he did accept an invitation to visit Washington soon for direct talks. CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood has more on this critical meeting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The readout from the Chinese Foreign Ministry is notable, I think, because of the tone. There are no accusations coming from Beijing.These criticisms that we've seen in the past, instead there is acknowledgment that the relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated to the worst that they've been since the two governments established formal diplomatic relations. And that it is not serving the interests of Chinese and American citizens, nor the international community. There are repeated statements about a commitment to improving these ties to ensuring that there are ways to work through crises, to try to get back to a spirit of some kind of negotiations that were established when President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met face-to-face in Bali back in November. And also a couple of deliverables. The agreement to receive an invitation from Antony Blinken to his Chinese counterpart for a visit to Washington sometime in the future to more people-to-people relations to increasing the number of passenger flights between the two countries. So clearly a shift in tone and perhaps an acknowledgment that the world's two largest economies do have to find some kind of way to deal with each other especially considering that they are huge trading partners -- Alex.",

And the question is, can colleges and universities continue to take race into consideration as a factor in admissions?The two plans before the court are having to do with Harvard and the University of North Carolina. And basically the schools here say we want to achieve diversity, diversity is important, part of the academic experience, and we have a compelling need for it. And they say, as Elena Kagan said during oral arguments that basically the schools serve as a pipeline to society so they want diversity, but the challengers here, they come back and say, look, this violates equal protection. It amounts to discrimination based on race and they contend that it thwarts the ideal of a color blind society, and keep in mind they are asking this court to once again overturn precedent, something that the court did just last year when it overturned Roe v. Wade. The courts also taking aim at the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan. This plan was meant to go into effect to provide relief to millions of borrowers in the wake of COVID. They were going to get up to $20,000 in some instances. And Biden had mentioned a lot of this on the campaign trail. But Republican led states, they pounced on this. They went right to the lower courts. They got the program frozen and they basically argued, look, the Biden administration does not have the authority to step in and erase billions of dollars of debt for a move that important, they argued, that Congress has to act. And at oral arguments, the conservative justices, they seemed really skeptical of this plan and that would be a big blow to Biden and it would come of course as the campaign season is heating up again, Alex.",

And I think that's something we try to stress tonight in this whole story hour, Alex, is that for those individuals, myself included, who go forward as participants in this retreat, for one, there's a pretty rigorous health intake process to screen to make sure you're not predisposed to certain mental health conditions. Could only worsen if you take psilocybin, according to some researchers.And then the other aspect is more personal. I mean, I met with my doctor before doing this, told her this is what I wanted to do, and after being evaluated, was given the all clear. But ultimately, what you look at from a bigger perspective is the potential here. And I think that's what's been so intriguing as we've been seeing the legalization, because this is not an if. This is happening, happening in places like Oregon, in Colorado, it's rolling out right now. And so it's looking at those benefits that you mentioned, the potential to help with PTSD. So think about veterans, the potential with certain addictions. And individuals that we were with on this retreat likewise suffered from some of those addictions and so their transformation, I think it's interesting to see how they approach this and also to distinguish, Alex, this from recreational. So it's very therapeutic. It's about preparation leading up to the retreat, a lot of group meetings, and then you take those two doses ceremonies, as they call it, and after that, it's integration. It's weeks of trying to apply it to your daily lives.",
