Asource tells CNN that, quote, \"We have a breakthrough on a potential hostage release but issues remain.\" Also, for a second night, Israel's military says it has conducted targeted raids inside Gaza. All this as Israel prepares for a ground incursion. And an urgent manhunt in Maine for the suspect in a mass shooting that left 18 dead. Investigators are now sending divers into a river to search for him. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. Welcome to ONE WORLD. There are potential signs of progress out of the Middle East today in what is being described as significant progress made towards getting the Israeli hostages back from Hamas. For weeks, the world has wondered about the fate of more than 200 Israelis including, women, children and the elderly who were kidnapped by Hamas fighters on October 7th. In recent days, four of them have been freed largely through the work of Qatar's government which has a close relationship with Hamas. Now, diplomatic sources tell CNN that negotiations to release many more of the hostages are going well, and that there may be a breakthrough. Our colleague, Becky Anderson, has been tracking these negotiations for us. She is in Qatar, live. And Becky, a U.S. official telling CNN that there has been progress made. I know you are reporting the same. But of course, this is still very touch and go. What are you hearing?",

Becky Anderson, you're going to stay on top of this for us. Thank you so much. Keep us posted. Well, for the second night in a row, Israeli troops have carried out what they're calling targeted raids inside Gaza ahead of an expected full-scale ground invasion. Video released by the IDF shows tanks and armored vehicles on the move. Israel says the raid focused on Hamas infrastructure with strikes on buildings and open areas. And it comes one day after the country's defense minister warned that Israel was preparing for the next phases of war. Hamas, meanwhile, is claiming responsibility for a rocket strike in Tel Aviv earlier that injured least three people. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins me live now from Ashkelon, Israel. And Jeremy, once again, a reminder, as effective as the Iron Dome is, some of these missiles still make it through, and this is coming at a time where we're hearing increased attacks in Gaza again. What's the latest that you're hearing?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's certainly the case, Bianna. Earlier today, we had not only direct impacts in Tel Aviv inthe center of Israel, which is pretty rare, but also here in Ashkelon, at least two rockets making impact. We went to the site of one of those that hit the ninth floor of an apartment building, shattering the balcony there. There were no casualties, though. But what we are hearing tonight now in the wake of that intense barrage of rocket fire towards central and southern Israel is perhaps the most intense bombardment of Gaza that I have heard in the nearly three weeks since this war began. Very, very intense, loud booms all the way here -- heard all the way here in Ashkelon, which is about 10 kilometers or so from the border with Gaza. And it's notable, of course, that this is happening right now, especially when you consider what we just heard from Becky, the reports that there is progress in these talks for hostages, and yet at the same time you couple that with the fact that we are hearing again, what I believe to be the most intense bombardment of Gaza, certainly in terms of what we can hear from our position here in Ashkelon. Now, as the IDF has said, they have made clear that in recent days, they would be intensifying airstrikes of Gaza and also increasingly carrying out these various raids into the Gaza Strip. And that is exactly what we have seen in recent days, not only infantry troops, but tanks going into Gaza. And last night also, we had a raid carried out by the Israel's equivalent of the Navy SEALs going in by sea onto land and carrying out strikes in southern Gaza. All of these moves intended to try and take out the tunnel infrastructure that Hamas has as well as other command centers. They are gathering intelligence. And really, what they are doing overall in the bigger picture here, Bianna, is that they are laying the groundwork for this ground invasion. They are preparing the terrain. They are seeing how Hamas responds to these various raids and they are also in particular focusing on that tunnel infrastructure which Israeli military officials have made clear will be a significant challenge for a ground force going in just because of the way in which it would allow Hamas fighters to potentially evade troops, but also ambush them, as well.",

But right now, we want totake you to the U.S. where hundreds of law enforcement officials are desperately searching for the suspect in two mass shootings that killed 18 people in Maine. Investigators say it's not even clear yet if 40-year-old Robert Card is still alive following Wednesday's massacre. Investigators plan to send dive teams into the Androscoggin River to look for evidence and possibly Card's body near a boat launch where his vehicle was found. Here's more on that investigation.

Mainly, this is the second day of the shelter in place order for much of this Lewiston area. Again, as a precaution, considering that police do not have this suspect in custody. But at the same time, they even acknowledged in the press conference that they are trying to evaluate on the daily, almost hourly basis, how to actually go about maybe ending that at some point so that people can actually get out into their communities and even grieve in some cases, have vigils things that you would normally see unfortunately as we have seen become habit too many times across this country. That said, as far as what we did learn, you laid out a little bit of what we are expecting to see from police but they also explained some of what we have seen. So, last night in particular there was a lot of law enforcement outside of one of the last known addresses for the suspect. FBI, other police were saying over a loudspeaker come out with your hands up as they had a spotlight trained on the house. Well, it turns out the suspect was not there and police even said that was more of their standard protocol for executing a search warrant. They say we are going to see more of that in the coming days, especially as they comb through and try to eliminate places where this person may be. We also heard, as you led -- as you mentioned, that divers will be in the river here that runs through the area, trying to see what they can find. But also, interestingly, that they've worked with the companies that run the dams here to lower the flow of the river to make it easier for these folks to search. And look, it's a multifaceted search from the air, from water, as I've mentioned, on the ground as well, at both the federal levels, from the FBI to the Coast Guard, and of course the local police, as well. Another question that was asked was is the family of the suspect, 40-year- old Robert Card -- is the family cooperating with investigators? And they said as a whole, yes, and we actually got a statement from the sister-in- law of the suspect who basically said, \"We are absolutely heartbroken. This is beyond belief. We are doing all we can with law enforcement giving all information that we can.\" Because, of course, while the manhunt is one thing, there is also another plane of investigations here and that is what caused this, what was the motive here. But also, what actually happened in the two venues where these shootings unfolded. One of them is just past the caution tape that's behind me here. This is the bowling alley, the first of two places where the mass shootings occurred. And police said they are still days away from processing everything in these places. They want to go through every square inch. They also got over 70 witness statements across these two places. So, a lot of things that they're trying to get into one digestible format to understand what happened and why. But then of course, on top of it all, trying to find this person as quickly as possible.",

You live in a state that's 80 percent wooded and you're surrounded by water, as well, as we saw that there are now divers searching the water near where he left his car. How much more does this complicate this investigation? Listen, everything complicates the situation depending obviously on the rural situation of Maine. You have lots of woods which he is familiar with. I think back to Eric Rudolph, the Atlanta Olympic bomber in 1998 when he became a fugitive from the FBI, 10 most wanted. He was on the run for five years in the woods of North Carolina. Very similar situation. He was adept to his environment. He knew the situation. He knew those woods. He remained on the loose for five years until a patrol officer just happened to run into him while he was digging through garbage. This situation is difficult. I don't think that the scenario of him going out into the open ocean is a very viable one because he needs gas to fuel his boat. And if he stops for gas, someone's going to see him and he knows this. I think also the dive teams looking for a body that he could have committed suicide, that's also very low on my belief factor but they have to cover those leads and say, okay, we washed that out. We know he did not commit suicide at the dock which I just don't buy that is possible, but it is still a lead that needs to be run out so that we could say, okay that's not a possibility. So, let's start focusing on the woods or possibly downriver or even worse, he got into another car and is now thousands of miles away.",

Short operations in and then out, some targets, some armor going in, infantry, and then leaving not to date a large-scale offensive that remains on the ground inside Gaza for some time. Now, does this increase in the pace of the airstrikes and the artillery strikes indicate that something greater, more lasting is in the offing? It's not clear, but there certainly has been quite public debate here about exactly that, and it's not been clear that the government has made a decision to do so. And there seems to have been some disagreement in the government on what scale to do so. And we also know that the advice from U.S. military officials and commanders who've been advising the Israelis, they're not involved, but they have been advising, has been to at least take a pause before you consider something on a grand scale, drawing on the U.S.' own experience in places such as Fallujah, that large scale ground operations inside urban landscapes is difficult and it's deadly.

All of this, Jim, just intensifies the situation because we are expecting some sort of ground invasion by the Israelis imminently.",

And there does appear to be some debateas to whether a full-scale invasion, even discussion of a reoccupation of Gaza, right, a debate as to whether that's a good idea, whether the leadership is fully behind that. So, it is possible that we see something short of, smaller than some of those predictions and perhaps more temporary, we don't know. To date, all we've seen have been temporary in and out operations, and it's possible that you see a collection of those as opposed to a full-scale invasion, but we don't know. We do know, certainly, that this country has mobilized more than 300,000 reservists. We do know that they have massed a great deal of armor, tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, as well as personnel along the border with Gaza. At least to give them the option to do so, right, Bianna. Then the question becomes really not just a military decision, but a political decision. Are Israeli military and political leaders behind a full-scale invasion, something short of that, a collection of smaller operations? We don't know yet. But to Nic's reporting, the intensity of those strikes, which typically come before a ground operation, is greater than anything we've seen so far.",

We know that there's been somedebate and we know, as I was saying earlier, that there's been some advice from U.S. military commanders. One, to pause or delay to allow for more chances to negotiate the release of the hostages, but also to consider the costs and danger -- the cost and danger of a full-scale ground invasion based in part on U.S. experience attempting the same in places such as Fallujah.",
