      "sentences": "Today, Donald Trump's initial pick for Attorney General, Matt Gaetz, who withdrew from consideration after facing scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, says he will not be returning to Congress next year. Just hours after Gaetz dropped his bid for AG, Trump picked another fierce loyalist for the position, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi has a longtime relationship with the President-elect. She represented Trump during his first impeachment trial and is one of the lawyers who promoted Trump's 2020 false election fraud claims.We're also told Trump is expected to now name former Georgia senator Kelly Loeffler as his new secretary of agriculture. He's also meeting with Loeffler this afternoon at Mar-a-Lago. We find CNN's Kristen Holmes not far from Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida. Let's start, Kristen, with Trump's new Attorney General pick, Pam Bondi. What are you hearing on that front?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Republicans that I'm speaking to, Boris, they say they are relieved that he came up with somebody who they think is confirmable. Now, it does also please his MAGA base because of the fact that she has said that she wants to dismantle the Department of Justice. She has also said that she believes you could use the Department of Justice for retribution. So she has echoed the same storylines we have heard from Matt Gaetz, the same narrative we have heard from President-elect Donald Trump.And Trump clearly believes that Pam Bondi is someone who will help him execute this plan. Just a reminder, Donald Trump wants to gut the Department of Justice and he wants to move it completely under the executive and completely under power of the White House and thus him once he takes office. He wanted somebody who would go along with that. So it's not all that surprising that he picked Pam Bondi because she has been such a loyalist to him because of what we have heard her say. Now, it was interesting today, we did hear from Matt Gaetz in an interview for the first time since he withdrew his name and since Donald Trump named Pam Bondi as the next nominee for Attorney General. He talked a little bit about why he withdrew his name. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ, WITHDREW AS TRUMP'S PICK FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL: And again, while our discussions were going well, I found myself having to do two jobs at one time, Charlie, and you got a front row seat to this. I had a full time job explaining to senators that maybe a tweet I sent about them was rash and not reflective of how I would serve as Attorney General. And at the same time, I was having to build out the Department of Justice with the right human talent, the right policy infrastructure. And Pam Bondi's confirmation won't have some of the sharp edges. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I spoke to a number of allies of Donald Trump's who believed that there could be more damning information coming out of that ethics report. They also believed that there were more witnesses than they had previously known about who had possibly talked to the Committee that would then be in that ethics report.And it became more and more clear every moment that he did not have the votes to get confirmed. So while he might have also had to defend some of his mean tweets, we know there were other things looming in the background.",

      "sentences": "It is. We knew unofficially that the sentencing wasn't going to happen next week because earlier this week, the District Attorney's Office said they would be okay with postponing the sentencing until even after Trump is out of the White House. But what they weren't okay with is dismissing this case.And just a few days ago, Trump's team made it clear that they're going to continue to try to get not just the sentencing delayed, but the entire case thrown out. They're going to argue that under the Constitution as president elect, Trump should not be subject to any state level proceedings. It's unclear if that is going to work, but they have other irons in the fire. They've also argued that the Supreme Court's recent immunity decision means that this case should be tossed because there was some evidence that came in during that trial, where Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records that they argue would be barred by the immunity decision because the Supreme Court said, not only can you charge people for official acts, you also can't use their official acts as evidence. So they're referring to things like Hope Hicks' testimony, but the judge has not ruled on that. But there were also federal level appeals trying to get this case tossed. So what we got today was a calendar for next steps. He gave the Trump attorneys until December 2nd to file their arguments. Now they had asked for a deadline of December 20th, and it's notable that they were given until December 2nd because that is also when Jack Smith, the special counsel, has said that he would reveal how he's going to wind down the federal cases. And Trump's lawyer said they wanted to see those arguments, the federal arguments before making their state case because they want to incorporate some of Jack Smith's reasoning in this argument. Clearly, Judge Merchan didn't want to give them a lot of time to contemplate that. So it looks like the judge is appearing to try to maybe make a decision before the New Year. But it's unclear what the fate of this New York conviction will be, if it will hang over Trump while he's in the White House or if Judge Merchan or even a federal judge might find grounds to dismiss it.",

I think that he would have been a horrible choice at the Department of Justice. He's barely a lawyer. He's never prosecuted anything. You know, he has a couple of hours in his - in a family firm down in Florida. His, you know, his sex with the underage - alleged sexual encounters with the underage young lady, the 17-year-old in Florida, and the threesomes, and The New York Times releasing, you know, the diagrams of how he paid off scores of these ladies allegedly with PayPal and Venmo is just a lowlife.I don't know, you know, how the president picked him. I will never know. Seems that it was an impetuous choice. You know, there are a lot in the potential Cabinet, Brianna, that are very controversial, but at least they are arguably competent. Not like this guy, this guy who tried single handedly to destroy the House of Representatives, you know, going off their, you know, the speaker, Kevin McCarthy. It's just, you know, it is a relief. And Pam Bondi and compared to Matt Gaetz is the best choice you could possibly make. I mean, whatever - the relative quality of these two people is profound and I wish her the best. I've known her for years, interviewed her many times. She was a regular on my at Large show on the weekends and often run into in the green room with Hannity. She's a real prosecutor, a county prosecutor, you know, with vast experience. Yes, she's controversial with Trump University and a bunch of other things that I've heard you mentioned, but she's the real deal.",

Tammy Duckworth, among many other veterans.Last week, you said of your former colleague that I think it would be a very, very steep learning curve for Maj.

I think that it certainly merits investigation, and people should ponder its significance in terms of his confirmation. But I go back to what I said last week. I don't retract that at all. I know Pete - Maj. Pete pretty well over the years, in Fox &amp; Friends Weekend and, you know, have socialized with he and his wife, Jennifer.And I think that he has to get enormous deference for the fact that he is a legitimate combat veteran, twice awarded the Bronze Star, one of the foremost advocates for veterans in our country. He's very popular among that community. Can he run a business with three million employees? I don't know. But I do know that everybody, you know, that has any center-right kind of feelings, believe that the Defense Department has gone too ordinary, too woke is the term that they use, too much with DEI and, you know, not enough with ferocity and lethality, and war fighting capabilities. So maybe Pete will inspires that whilst keeping, obviously, the care, the treatment of GIs foremost in his concern. My wife, Erica and I disagree with Pete on his opposition to women in combat. You mentioned Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a helicopter pilot who lost both of her legs in combat; Tulsi Gabbard, a colonel with combat experience, also combat veteran, she will be his colleague in the Cabinet if both are confirmed. So I think that Pete is wrong headed in some of these big issues, but I also think - I go back to what I said before - I think Maj. Pete is one of those guys, you know, Brianna, you just trust them.
