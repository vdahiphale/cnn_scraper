In that rare exit interview, he also revealed he hasn't decided if he'll join three other presidents in issuing preemptive pardons.CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us now. What did he say that sort of led him to run for a second term in the first place?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, President Biden has said that he was driven by the need to ensure that Donald Trump did not return to the White House. And in this interview with \"USA Today,\" he said that he still does believe that he could have won the election in November. But the president, the 82-year-old president, makes a very stark admission when he said that he does not know if he would have the stamina to serve in a second term.I want to read you a bit of this interview that he had with \"USA Today's\" Susan Page where Page asked, \"do you believe you could have won in November?\" The president said, \"its presumptuous to say that, but I think, yes, based on the polling that,\" and then she asks, \"do you think you would have had the vigor to serve another four years in office?\" Biden then says he was motivated to run in the first place back in 2020 in order to defeat Trump. But then he says about a second term, \"I don't know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\" Now, first, it's unclear what polling President Biden was pointing there in his argument that he could have won in November, as most of the polls around the time he dropped out showed a very close race, or potentially Trump as a slight leader in this - that race. But also, this is really the first time that we are really hearing Biden speak bluntly about the limitations of his age. It comes as many Democrats, many American people, had serious questions about President Biden's ability to serve in a second term. Polling even showed that before he made the decision to run up in 2020. And it comes at a time when there's also been a lot of Democratic finger pointing, blaming, in part, President Biden's decision to even run in the first place for why President Trump was reelected this November.",

And you'll remember in the first term he floated the idea of the United States buying Greenland. He's not the first president to do that. Harry Truman suggested it in the 1940s. Greenland said it wasn't interested in selling. And, you know, in most real estate transactions, at that point, you sort of go away and say, let me know if you ever change your mind.But he has not dropped this. He's expanded it. And now to the Panama Canal. And then with his jokes, which have now taken a more menacing sound, that Canada should become the 51st state. So, I wanted to explore the question of, is he willing to back this up? Now, you could interpret his answer two ways, John. One is that he's looking for negotiating leverage here, and the other that this time he actually does plan to use it, even though he did not articulate very clearly what the national security threat to the United States was.",

We control it, not China, not anyone else, and we maintain control over that. The situation with Greenland is actually quite complex because while Denmark is the sovereign over Greenland, Greenland also has its own government and its own self-government. So, those folks have been very clear in Denmark that the United States has no business interfering with the sovereignty of their, you know, control or their - their governing of Greenland.

I am skeptical. I believe that most corporations that stay true to what their core beliefs are do end up winning consumer trust.

Now, the challenge there, Sara, and where we're a little bit confused, TikTok did not address our questions about this, is that technically the way that the law is written, Lemonaid would also stand to be banned. So, it's unclear why they are doing this, why TikTok is allowing them to promote ads on its platform, encouraging creators to go there, and why Lemonaid is even bothering.

Stephanie, I'm sorry you got so sick. I mean this is a pretty typical course that you just described. It can be a pretty miserable few days. The answer about immunity here is an interesting one. So, the short answer is that you do develop some immunity because you got sick. The problem is that that immunity is pretty short lived. Weeks to months. And also there are many different strains of norovirus. Norovirus isn't just one virus, it's lots of different viruses. So, you may have some protection against the one strain, but there are other strains out there that are circulating. One thing also, Stephanie, you pointed out, you did a good job of staying hydrated. Every year there's about 900 people, roughly, who die of norovirus infections in the United States, primarily as a consequence of dehydration.
