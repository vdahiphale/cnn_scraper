But some of these other promises that were made were done through more of a handshake deal. And GOP leaders are insisting that there isn't an official master list, and that it wasn't some side deal. They tried to walk members through what some of those verbal agreements were, doing conference meeting, this morning. That includes tying the debt ceiling to spending cuts, which is a hard line, for Democrats, and could tee up a fiscal showdown. And there's also a promise to put more conservative members, on key committees. But some rank-and-file members still feel like they are in the dark. Take a listen to what Nancy Mace told our colleagues, earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): There are still some questions that I think many of us have about what side deals may or may not have been made, what promises were made, what handshakes were made. Are there any other side deals for chairmanships and committee assignments, we won't know until the Steering process is actually over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

DEAN (voice-over): Congressman Ritchie Torres and Dan Goldman launched their request, for a formal probe, into Santos' financial disclosure reports, on Tuesday. This, after a campaign watchdog group, filed a complaint, against him, with the Federal Election Commission. The group accuses Santos, of illegally using campaign funds, to pay personal expenses, and of concealing the source, of more than $700,000. That complaint also alleges Santos' campaign falsified how it spent campaign funds. Santos told reporters, today, he's \"Done nothing unethical.\" House GOP leadership told reporters, Tuesday, they would address Santos in private. REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): This is something that's being handled entirely. Obviously, there were concerns about what we had heard. And so, we're going to have to sit down and talk to him about it. DEAN (voice-over): All of this, as Santos faces international federal and local investigations, into his past, including a revived investigation, in Brazil, where according to documents, obtained by CNN, Santos admitted in 2010, to stealing a man's checkbook, two years prior that was in his mother's possession, and using it to purchase clothing and shoes. BRUNO SIMOES, VICTIM OF FRAUD (through translator): I was very frustrated. Being deceived is a terrible feeling. DEAN (voice-over): According to Brazilian authorities, this Rio shop clerk, at the time, was a victim, of Santos' fraud, losing over $1,300 U.S. dollars, when Santos forged the checks. Bruno Simoes recounted the experience, to CNN, in an interview, last week. SIMOES (through translator): Unlike being mugged, by someone, with a gun, who robs you, you might get angry. But being deceived, being fooled, someone acting in bad faith, to steal from you? To me, it's an even worse feeling. DEAN (voice-over): Santos told Police at the time he was an American, with dual citizenship, and confessed he forged the signature, seen on these checks, according to the documents. But after that confession, Police in Brazil say Santos disappeared. Unable to locate Santos, for nearly a decade, they suspended the investigation, and the statute of limitations, as a result. REP.

That's a key part of all of this.Now, one of the challenges for Biden is that he, in commenting on the Trump case, seemed to sort of say, \"I don't understand how in any way these documents can ever end up outside of where they ought to be.\" And I do think though, there is an argument to be made, that that at times, things can get mixed up, and people, as Van pointed out, can make mistakes. But there's a process, for dealing with that, which is to call the Archives, give those documents back, as promptly as possible. And I think Biden is going to have to answer, for those comments that he made, in the past. It's not going to be enough for him to say, \"Well, I didn't know that they were there.\" It is his responsibility, and that of his staff, to go through his belongings, and give everything back, when he leaves office.

After a fatal school shooting in 2000, a 6-year-old's uncle served two years, for involuntary manslaughter, after the child found his loaded gun, in a shoebox, on the bed. ARTHUR BUSCH, PROSECUTED UNCLE FOR DIFFERENT SHOOTING BY A 6-YEAR-OLD IN 2000: If you leave a gun laying around, it's pretty obvious, to most people, that that's a dangerous thing to do. The question is whether the parent could foresee that this harm would come. There is where prosecutors get into some tangle. TODD (voice-over): Experts say the 6-year-old, now being evaluated, under a temporary detention order, is likely too young, to be charged, or tried. SONNY STALLINGS (ph) JR., FORMER PROSECUTOR: He can't form a criminal intent to maliciously wound someone, which would be the charge. And two, he's not competent that age to understand the proceedings. TODD (voice-over): The teacher, Abigail Zwerner, is in stable condition.

Of course, that statute is well-known.In the event that you recklessly leave a gun, lying around, and it gets into the hands of a child, you certainly know that it could endanger others. But that's just the Class 1 misdemeanor. Virginia, not to get too technical, goes Class 1, 2, 3 and 4. And a Class 1, you're eligible for up to one year in jail, OK? So what, as it relates to a person, who has been shot, and in the stomach, by the child? That's the more serious issue. So, it's not just the misdemeanor, I think prosecutors will look to. I think they'll look to employ other measures, right? Other measures, for example, where you are criminally negligent, in another way, such that it raises the specter, of what the liability should be, as this happened, in other cases. And so, I think prosecutors will be very creative, about using other laws, to potentially get more criminal responsibility, beyond a Class 1 misdemeanor. It's much more serious than that. And I think a felony, which is something over a year in jail, should be considered, for deterrence value, when just the value in this happening, it should not have.",

What preventative and protective measures did you employ?\" So, it's not just the evaluation of the 6-year-old. It's the evaluation of all the surrounding circumstances.
