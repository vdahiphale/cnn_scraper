In the past four days, 69 have been released by Hamas.Now, the deal said over four days, 50 Israeli women and children were to be released. Some of them are dual nationals, like that young girl, Abigail Edan. She's an American citizen as well. So, that did happen. The 50 came out over the past four days. There were a couple surprises that we weren't anticipating. There were 19 others who came out at the same time over the course of those four days. There was a Russian-Israeli man who was released yesterday. He's the only Israeli man who has been released so far, and he was actually released under a side deal that was done directly between the Russians and Hamas. And that speaks to that growing relationship between those two parties, which is very interesting. And then you have 18 other foreign nationals. They're not Israeli. There are a lot of Thai nationals, for example, who work as laborers in Israel.",
