The House Oversight Committee plans to hold its first hearing next Thursday, days before the government will shut down if Congress fails to pass a funding bill.[04:05:04] The White House says Republicans are trying to avoid blame for that possibility. Spokesperson Ian Sams said extreme House Republicans are already telegraphing their plans to try to distract from their own chaotic inability to govern, and the impacts of it on the country while staging a political stunt hearing in the waning days before they may shut down the government reveals their true priorities. To them, baseless personal attacks on President Biden are more importance than preventing a government shutdown and the pain it would inflict on American families. The government's authority to spend money expires on September 30th. A small number of Republican hardliners are demanding massive spending cuts and new border security measures, and they're blocking attempts to pass a funding bill. The current Republican plan gives the hardliners some of what they've asked for. But the hardliners appear poised to reject even that. And even if it passes, it has no chance in the Democratic controlled Senate. So some moderate Republicans now are talking about the possibility of making a deal with Democrats to avert a government shutdown. World leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York will hold a high-level meeting in the coming hours to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The war dominated the opening session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy drawing vigorous applause in his first in person address to the General Assembly since Russia's 2022 invasion. He accused Russia of terrorism, genocide and weaponizing the global food trade. U.S. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, urged members to stand firm in their support for Ukraine. Mr. Biden says if Ukraine can be carved up, no countries independence is secure. More now from CNN's Kayla Tausche. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

For example, with oil and gas disruption from Russia. All of this really to make the point that this is something of a global concern and a lot of countries around the world should care and should be backing Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Now clearly the Western Allies' support is unsurprising. Biden also giving a very strong speech in support of Ukraine. But what is really coming next is the more difficult part as he moves on to DC and away from New York. Because there he is going to see a lot more division, a lot less unity. And the concern really is that because of the division in the House, the lawmakers are not decided on numerous issues in the United States, not just the war in Ukraine, a lot of domestic issues as well. But funding for Ukraine is one of the issues of concern. And as the U.S. government now heads potentially to a shutdown, funding for Ukraine, U.S. military funding for Ukraine could be disrupted and that really is a very urgent concern for Zelenskyy, particularly as we head into the winter months and the counteroffensive gets more and more difficult. Now clearly, a lot of this funding is already in Pentagon stockpile, so that is not necessarily going to be disrupted. But there is clearly a broader concern here because it's not just lawmakers. It's U.S. public support as a whole. Clearly there is now a concern that U.S. public support is declining somewhat for the funding of Ukraine, and if that is the case, it could change the counteroffensive and its future quite considerably.",

You heard the Prime Minister on the floor of the House on Monday making a very serious allegation, which of course, India has completely rejected calling it unsubstantiated. And going ahead and even calling it motivated. In their statement, they've also gone ahead and said that Canada is sheltering extremists and terrorists who've been involved and indulging in anti-India activities.
