      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.24 hours after the Supreme Court hit the brakes, on Donald Trump's federal election case, Jack Smith hitting the gas, on another, just proposed a surprising new date for the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. For Trump, his campaign, and his likely Republican convention, it could be quite explosive. Also, a split-screen playing out on the southern border, dueling visits by the current president and his predecessor, as President Biden is looking to turn around an area, where voters say he's the weakest, as Trump is really looking to sabotage getting anything done in Washington, so he can use it, to hurt Biden, come November. Also, a CNN exclusive, our conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders, who had some scathing criticism, of Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, and called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, and a lot more that you'll want to see. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we start, as we are witnessing the aftershocks, really, of that Supreme Court decision that has imploded the Trump legal calendar. Jack Smith is now suggesting that they move the start date, for that trial, in the classified documents case, down in Mar-a-Lago, a move that comes just one day after the justices slammed the brakes, on the case against Trump, in Washington, for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Late this evening, the Special Counsel's office filed this new motion that you're seeing here, asking for Donald Trump, and two of his co- defendants, to stand trial, beginning July the 8th. One other co- defendant, a little bit after that. The Special Counsel's team wants to get basically at least one case heard, before Election Day, in November. Trump's legal team responded with a now-familiar retort, saying that \"A fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.\" I'm quoting them. But they did offer another date, this year. And the judge, who has been mired in some controversy, in this case, Judge Aileen Cannon, is expected to hash it out, in a hearing, tomorrow, in Florida that could be critical to the future of the classified documents case. I'm joined, tonight, by an attorney, who used to represent Donald Trump, in the classified documents case and others, Jim Trusty. Great to have you back here, Jim. In this, when you look at it, what Jack Smith is asking for is for Trump, and Walt Nauta, and Carlos, to go to trial on July 8th. The three defense attorneys want Trump -- excuse me -- want their trial to start in July, want another one to start in August. What do you think this likely ultimately lands, based on what Jack Smith wants, and what the defense attorneys are arguing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm going to go with none of the above.What's happening? I mean, you talk about this judge being, quote, mired in controversy. She's actually taking a very incremental approach, to everything, when it comes to scheduling. And that's what you normally see in federal court. It's talking to the parties, where are we on discovery? Where are we on classified documents? You've got five motions to dismiss pending, right now. You've got 10 DOJ attorneys entering their appearance on the case. This is not a quick and simple matter. And so, Jack Smith, I think, the approach he took was desperate to try something against President Trump, before the election, which is really the wrong paradigm, for DOJ to take, for Jack and the Attorney General to take. And of course, the other side is saying we can't possibly do this before the election. Yes, there's some blame to be had, perhaps on both sides, for taking kind of extreme positions. But as a former prosecutor, 27 years, I can't get over the fact that DOJ is admittedly making this a political exercise. They're basically saying, we've got to do this before the election. And that's just not what you normally see, in a white-collar case for a non-incarcerated defendant. So, I think we're going to chug along, for another month or two. We might see some really fascinating motions hearings, in Florida, I think, very important ones. But I suspect that trial's not happening this summer, for a variety of reasons.",

That would then be able to restart the case in D.C., technically. But if this classified documents case is scheduled, is that a way to kind of box Judge Chutkan in, by the Trump team, by saying, well, sorry, we've got the classified documents case now that we have to deal with, and there's no time for the federal election case? TRUSTY: Yes, I mean, good question. I don't know for sure. Because the judge, in D.C., has been very strong-willed about scheduling, and that has fed into Jack Smith's desire to try that case yesterday. So yes, there is this tug-of-war between who's going to have the scheduling priority. But frankly, the case, in front of the Supreme Court, could easily have a significant effect in Florida as well, and could lead, believe it or not, and I hate to even say this out loud, but to additional litigation, about whether or not certain activities were within the scope of presidential responsibilities, a little bit like when you have executive privilege litigation. So, we could be at round one of a Supreme Court exercise on immunity. If they rule generally, in favor of the President, then you could end up having more litigation and more Supreme Court before anybody ever thinks about a real trial date.",

So, it's not really the king can do no wrong, period. It's he has absolute immunity, if the actions are related to specific duties, even the outer perimeter of the presidential duty.

Circuit Court of Appeals, I do think that's where the Supreme Court is going to be wrestling, which is, do we afford immunity, to act within that exterior, that outer perimeter of presidential responsibilities?

Some of those individuals jumped on top of those aid trucks, grabbing bags of flour, and whatever else they could take. But within minutes, we're told that the Israeli military then opened fire, on that crowd, sending people running in all directions, and propelling the drivers of those trucks, to hit the gas, running into that crowd, killing dozens of people in the process. Now, Khader Al Zanoun (ph), a local journalist, who has worked with us before, tells us that about 20 people, he believes, were killed by the initial gunfire, but that the majority of those people were killed in the ensuing chaos. Now, the Israeli military offers a very different timeline. They say that there was first, a stampede, and those aid truck drivers running over people, and that it was only after that happened, that Israeli forces nearby fired on another group of Palestinians, who they say were approaching them, in what they describe as a threatening manner. Now, the Israeli military says that it will investigate this incident. But those accounts, by the Israeli military, obviously contradict what we're hearing from witnesses on the ground. The bottom line, though, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says that at least 112 people have been killed, in this incident, more than 760 people injured, adding to this grim death toll that we hit on Thursday, of more than 30,000 people killed. And it's also very clear that if this situation continues, in particular, in northern Gaza, where people have very little access to food, very few aid trucks are making it through, that more people will die, not just by bombs and bullets, but also by starvation, as the World Food Program warns that about half a million Palestinians are on the brink of all-out famine. Now, this could also complicate those negotiations that are happening for a temporary ceasefire. President Biden warning that it will complicate those talks. Kaitlan.",

That's why my next guest, the new Uvalde superintendent, is in Washington, pleading with lawmakers, to do more, to help their community. And Ashley Chohlis joins me now. Ashley, it's great to have you here. You just assumed this role, as Superintendent, about three months ago. You're in Washington, right now, for a reason, because you're talking to lawmakers. And I was struck by something you wrote, in a recent Op-Ed, where you said the money and the heartache that it takes to recover from these tragedies is far greater than the money that districts need to prevent them. Do you think that message broke through, on Capitol Hill, today?",
