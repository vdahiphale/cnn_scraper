Well, the New Year is off to a successful start for Ukraine's military which is claiming yet another major attack on Russian forces within its territory. The general staff of the Armed Forces says around 500 Russian troops were killed or wounded. This time in the town of Chulakivka in the Kherson region. Moscow has not publicly commented on the New Year's Eve attack.But it comes as Russia is revising the death toll up to 89 in a separate attack on a barracks in the Donetsk region. Ukraine claims hundreds of Russian troops were killed. And Ukraine's military has shared video of what it says is a strike on an ammunition warehouse in the Luhansk region. The head of the regional military says they watched for weeks as the Russians brought in weapons and vehicles until \"bam, there's no more enemy warehouse.\" So, let's go live now to London and CNN's Clare Sebastian. Good morning to you, Clare. So, what more are you learning about Ukraine's claims of another 500 Russian troops killed or injured or New Year's Eve near Chulakivka?",

But this happened on New Year's Eve near an enemy equipment and troops stronghold near the town of Chulakivka which if we can pull up the map again is just across the Dnipro River from Kherson.An area that is occupied currently by Russia where Russian troops actually sort of retreated and refortified after withdrawing from the city of Kherson in November. Russia, it should be noted, continues to repeatedly shell and bomb the city of Kherson. This may be a motive for Ukraine to try to target concentrations of troops and equipment in that region. The death toll that Ukraine is estimating around 500 appears to be approximate. It might be difficult for them to verify that given that this is Russian-occupied territory. But if true, this would signal that Ukraine is clearly stepping up its efforts to target concentrations of troops, ammunition equipment, depots, things like that in an effort to weaken Russia as it brings more recruits to the frontline. And as those frontlines have remained pretty stagnant for several weeks.",

Many thanks.Back in the United States and on Capitol Hill, a growing feud within the Republican Party is threatening to overshadow its new majority in the House. On Tuesday, a band of conservative hardliners blocked Kevin McCarthy from securing the 218 votes needed to become Speaker of the House. And that's after three rounds of voting. It's the first time in 100 years the House has failed to elect a speaker on the first ballot, making this an historic humiliation for McCarthy. During Tuesday's voting, McCarthy's opponents nominated Jim Jordan of Ohio to be Speaker of the House during the second and third ballot. But Jordan says he doesn't want the job and he's backing McCarthy. Meantime, McCarthy vows to keep fighting for the speaker role and has no plans to step aside. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Members are talking we're walking through. I think we'll find our way to get there. And this is a healthy debate. It might not happen on the day we want it but it's going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is the first order of business in the new congress, the first order of business in 118th Congress. And after three ballots, Kevin McCarthy simply could not get there. It is the first time in American history in 100 years that an American speaker, a U.S. House Speaker could not be elected on the first ballot.And how many bells will it take for Kevin McCarthy? Nobody knows. Can Kevin McCarthy get there? Also, uncertain. Will there be another candidate who emerges? Also, another major question. And this is not just a simple question about who may fill a key leadership position. This is someone who will drive the agenda of an institution of congress could help set the shape of policy, matters that could affect the lives of millions of Americans. Also, someone who will drive the party strategy heading in the 2024 elections. All key questions unsettled because of this very chaotic fight between McCarthy allies who now number more than 200, but also a growing number of detractors. In McCarthy's math, he's the real problem here. Right now, the House Republicans and their new majority will occupy 222 seats. That means McCarthy cannot afford to lose more than four votes on the House floor. Four Republican votes. He has lost 20 so far and McCarthy and those in the camp of 20 are pushing, pushing hard to grow their numbers. They believe they can get up to 20. 25 republicans to vote against him and ultimately forced McCarthy out of the race. Now McCarthy told me on Tuesday night, he is not going anywhere. He plans to dig in, force the opponents to essentially wear themselves out and essentially concede, give him the speakership. He believes he's given them enough concessions, a lot of things they won, just to have more power in the incoming Republican Congress. That he says is plenty of concessions going forward. That's still not enough for some of these members. But there are also other issues that he simply can't resolve. Personality conflicts, some people who just simply just want him out of the race altogether and say that they will vote against him for however long it takes. So, all this is happening as democrats on the other side are sitting back watching this happen, not planning at the moment to bail Kevin McCarthy out in any way as he struggles to try to finally claim the speakership and he's fought so hard to get, but he simply doesn't have the votes to get the gavel.

And, you know, China's ability to import and export in other countries, they needed to also bring goods into the country, as well, and get that consumer spending, which is really key here for China, is to kind of implement and to get moving their middle class to start spending so that they can continue to get that growth back to where they wanted to see.

Which by the way, a lot of these rules are not completely ending until this coming Sunday on January 8th. But here's the thing, even some outside analysts and experts say, they may have a point about the newly imposed China specific measures may not be constructive or effective given the transmissibility of the virus, as well, as the lack of proof so far of a new variant or subvariant emerging from the latest China outbreak.But the Chinese really have no one but themselves to blame because of their lack of transparency. Because even their own experts have acknowledged in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, some 70 or even 80 percent of the population have been infected. But when you look at the official data, not only the number of infections, but especially when it comes to deaths, these numbers -- these numbers are just ridiculously low, and they don't match the reality. And that's why the WHO has requested a behind a closed-door meeting with their Chinese counterparts who seek more data and more clarity on the true picture of what's going on in this country. But from my vantage point, here on the ground, it continues to be a picture of dichotomy, that is, on one hand, you see medical facilities across the country from fever clinics to ICUs overwhelmed by people seeking medication and treatment, especially from the most vulnerable segment of the population, that is senior citizens with underlying conditions, not to mention, bodies piling up at crematories in major cities across the country. But on the other hand, you are seeing crowds and traffic congestion returning to big cities, and mostly mobbing younger folks who have recovered from their infections, flocking, not only back to their office buildings, but also to restaurants, shopping malls, and other tourist destinations. And that is a side of the story the government and the state media here trying to highlight, while downplaying, or even ignoring the other more grim side of the story. But the biggest concern right now, of course, is the mass migration of millions of Chinese around the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. It's going to be the first time in almost three years you see this kind of mass travel across the country. That is likely to bring the virus from major cities to the country's countryside, where the healthcare system is a very fragile, or even nonexistent.

But its alarming climatologist, just four days into the New Year, and Europe has already broken a number of heat records for the month of January. On Monday, one town on the Czech Republic reached a balmy 19 degrees Celsius or 67 Fahrenheit. That's one of the -- one of at least eight European countries, which have set new records for their warmest January day ever. So, let's turn to our meteorologist Britley Ritz, she has been keeping a very close eye on this. Shall we get used to this?",

But it does start to feel like early spring when we get these above average temperatures. I mean, we hit New January national records all across the Europe. Example, Abed, Denmark, where we hit 12.6 degrees. Now, temperature is all relative, of course, keep that in mind. But Germany, record temperatures over the entire country. The last three days, 980 plus, yes, locations, by the way. Record warmth for the Ukraine. Kyiv, top down at 13.2 degrees. Now, right now, temperatures are roughly about seven degrees in Milan. And Frankfurt, six Degrees. London at 13. Now, tomorrow's forecast highs are going to be climbing up to 12 degrees in Milan, Frankfurt 11 degrees, and London, expect a high of 13.There's the cold front I'm talking about. The reason why we're so warm, we've got this massive area of high pressure sitting over Central Europe, pushing in more of that southerly wind, keeping temperatures well above where they should be, almost double. And so, with that being said, the precip which typically comes in the form of snow this time of year, not so much. We're dealing with quite a bit of rain. But then, we mentioned that cold front, temperatures will drop a bit. Look at this, Milan 12 degrees on Thursday. Six degrees is our typical high this time of year. Will drop with the cold front but again, still staying above average. Friday and Saturday, Milan expect highs at nine degrees. Rosemary?",
