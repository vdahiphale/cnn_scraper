      "sentences": "Good morning, and welcome to a special weekend edition of CNN This Morning. I am Kasie Hunt on this Sunday, where we are covering breaking news, the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.We just got new video of the moment that people at the rally spotted the shooter. A warning, what you're about to see in here is graphic. Really difficult. Early this morning, FBI officials identified the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. This appears to be the shooter lying on the roof of a building close to the rally after he was shot and killed by Secret Service. He was from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. It's about 35 miles from the site of the rally in Butler. As for the victims, investigators say they identified a rally-goer who was shot and killed. Two others who were critically injured. They are not yet revealing their identities. One man covered in blood told CNN crews at the scene he tried to comfort one of the victims seconds after the shooting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We are learning more also about the 20-year-old gunman's background this morning. Crooks is a registered Republican in Pennsylvania, but he apparently also made a small donation to a Democratic-aligned group in 2021. CNN's reached out to Crooks' father, who declined to comment until speaking with police, but he did tell us he was still trying to, quote, \"figure out what the hell is going on,\" end quote. A CNN analysis of the scene shows the roof where the shots were fired and that it's about 150 yards away from the stage where Trump was speaking. CNN's Danny Freeman went to the scene. And he's got more on just how wide the scope of this investigation is going to be.",

The FBI confirming overnight that they are officially investigating this as an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump's life.Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania State Police, they say that they are also taking the lead on the homicide investigation of one of the rally goers at this Trump campaign event and also the shooting of two other campaign rally attendees who are now in critical condition. Let's get to the biggest question of, of course, how in the world could this have happened? Really, we did not get a lot of answers from this press conference overnight. I asked the FBI specifically, was this a failure of security? And the FBI representative here said that they are still assessing where there may have been failures in the security process for this particular Trump campaign event. But a lot of the questions that reporters were asking during this overnight press conference were referred to the U.S. Secret Service. But the challenge was, Kasie, that Secret Service did not have a representative at this press conference to take some of these questions. The other thing I'll note, Kasie, though, is that, again, just to explain and really put a point on the massive scale of this investigation, the FBI, Pennsylvania State Police, other law enforcement agencies are asking the public, please, if you have any cell phone video, any information about anything that may be related to the shooting that happened at this Trump event, please, please hand it in, because they will be looking at all of that as they continue to figure out exactly what led to this horrific and tragic moment on Saturday.

We don't have a domestic terrorism domestic statute, but we certainly have a federal law that would cover this attempt.So that's why the FBI has stepped in and is taking lead. They will look at sort of two lanes of possibilities or two lanes of inquiry at this stage. One is, of course, is the shooter who is now dead, is -- were there any others involved? Could this potentially be a conspiracy? The early reporting suggests no, but you still have to determine whether there's an ongoing threat. The second is, of course, to motives. Yesterday I was on explaining a variety of motives. People want to assume things. I think we ought to be very careful about that. This seems like a mixed motive assassination attempt that may include support for left-wing causes, support for the Republican Party, and also maybe nothing having to do with politics. We will learn more about that at this stage relatively soon. So that's where the FBI is going to start its inquiry. And then I have to say there will be a separate investigation, of course, about the Secret Service. There will be an after-action review. You cannot sit here and say that wasn't a security failure. There's too many pictures at this stage that suggest that people knew what was about to happen and it took way too long.",

We can put together from, you know, the next day -- you know, later in that day, a narrative that fits into, well, obviously, Trump was about to get killed or an attempt on his life was about to be taken, and why didn't they shoot him? We simply don't know. So that after action, which may expose some liability for the Secret Service suggests why they were not there. They were not prepared to answer them. We've gotten statements from the head of the Secret Service, as well as Secretary Mayorkas, the head of the Department of Homeland Security. But that's -- that's all at this stage. It was very unfortunate. I don't -- I have to say, given the seriousness of what happened, we cannot forget what happened yesterday. It was a -- it was an assassination attempt against some one of two people who is likely to be the next president. The FBI essentially saying, well, we don't know why it took so long. We don't -- we can't explain the Secret Service is not a good look for federal law enforcement.

Can you kind of let us into how you would think about this on a presidential campaign and how that's honestly changed over the years?Because I mean, you and I first got to know each other covering the -- when I covered the Romney campaign back in 2012. You obviously worked on campaigns going forward from there in 2016 as well. And I mean, look, I remember talking to some of my mentors on the campaign trail who had started out covering Ted Kennedy in 1980, when this was something that was very, very present for the Kennedy family. But it's not something that we -- I had to grapple with in this kind of very front and center way or that we as a country had to grapple with in the years leading up to now. But the climate has just changed so dramatically. MATT GORMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: You're right. And look, this was full scale Secret Service, essentially nominee protection. Trump's had that for about a decade now. But there's a time and Trump had it, too, before you have that where there isn't that sort of protection, right, where it might be a, you know, security guard or someone who's hired for that or some team. And, you know, there is a volatility and it's evolved right now in today's day and age, I would say in the last, you know, five or so years, it is something that campaigns have to actually think about from day one. And let's face it, too. If you're running for president, you're some sort of national political figure. You're likely already getting some sort of consistent threat, unfortunately. It's kind of in today's politics. And so those have to be taken into account. I know Tim was a sitting senator. So, of course, you're going to get that sort of thing. Governors that I've worked for, too, the same sort of thing. And so it's always in the front of your mind.

The real impact, I think, is toward the kind of the social question, like the assassination of the 60s kind of made us wonder where we were headed as a society. And I think that this attempt really brings that into light. As I said, we have seen, you know, an attempt to kidnap and kill a Democratic governor, a shooting attempt at a shooting of a House Republican, threats against local officials. This is being woven into the fabric of our political life in a way that really is unprecedented in its breadth, except perhaps for the 1850s, when we had, you know, canings on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

He was shot and paralyzed. 1981, Ronald Reagan. There was an attempt at assassination. So assassinations and violence have always been part of American politics, even though we don't like to say that's a pretty pervasive part of our history.

And I'm very interested in seeing, you know, as we kind of talked about and reported that Donald Trump will probably emerge on the first night of the convention and introduce the vice president. I wouldn't be surprised, I have no background information, but if he gives remarks and his first words on this, does he say something Monday, does he wait until Thursday?And, you know, I think we heard from Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles that will, I think, likely inform his speech in a lot of respects. I would be surprised if it differed in a large part from that. And I will say this, it's going to move very quickly, right? So today is the last day before the convention. He'll roll out his vice president likely tomorrow, and then he's going to have his own speech on Thursday. This is going to be a very fast-moving news cycle, so to speak.",

He says the central premise of the Biden campaign is President Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination. I'm noting that because of the significance of his position inside and around the campaign. He is very, very high profile.And the reality is we're seeing less responsible even things from other members of Congress at this point in terms of the back and forth. And I think it's important that we note that the motive here is not clear in that there seem to be contradictory indicators about who this person was. And we have so much to learn from the investigation. But, you know, our colleague -- our former colleague here and now at \"Politico,\" Jonathan Martin, he notes the reality of the ecosystem in which we live means that this stuff explodes so much faster. There are already quotes from, you know, there was a congressman that was at the rally talking about, you know, political motivations for this.

And how does that, again, how does that affect, you know, kind of what they talk about? And I'm very curious. And we don't know the answer to that. We don't know how this is going to affect the campaign moving forward. But does this change any messaging from either side? I'm interested to see that in the days ahead.",

You are watching CNN's special coverage of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump here on CNN This Morning. We do have new details at this hour. A witness tells CNN affiliate KDKA he told police he saw the gunman moving from roof-to-roof moments before gunshots started. We have video of the moment people at the rally spotted the shooter. A warning, what you're about to see and hear is graphic. Early this morning, FBI officials identified the shooter as 20-year- old Thomas Matthew Crooks. This appears to be the shooter lying on the roof of a building close to the rally after he was shot and killed by Secret Service. He was from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about 35 miles from the site of the rally in Butler. Overnight, police blocked off the area of the neighborhood where he lived. As for the victims, investigators say they identified a rally-goer who was shot and killed and two others who were critically injured. But they are not revealing their identities yet. One man covered in blood told CNN crews at the scene he tried to comfort one of the victims seconds after the shooting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
