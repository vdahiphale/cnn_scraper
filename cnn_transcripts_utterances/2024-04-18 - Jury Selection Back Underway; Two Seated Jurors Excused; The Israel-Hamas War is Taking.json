Former President Donald Trump sitting as a criminal defendant, listening to the men and women who could make up the jury that decides his legal fate. It is day three of jury selection in this trial. So far, it has been, to some degree, one step forward, two steps back. Tuesday night, we had seven jurors seated. As of now, that is down to five after two jurors were dismissed today for two different reasons. One, who said she could no longer be impartial, telling the judge, \"Aspects of my identity have already been out there in the public. Yesterday alone, I had friends, colleagues, and family push things to my phone, questioning my identity as a juror.\" So, five impaneled, seven to go, plus six alternates. When this trial gets underway, these jurors will consider 34 felony charges against Trump over alleged hush money payments. Following it all for us, CNN -- for CNN is Zach Cohen. So, Zach, right now, I believe another group of 18 potential jurors being questioned. How is that questioning proceeding? We saw it move pretty quickly on Tuesday. We should note. How is it moving today?",

Defense attorneys will then have 30 minutes after the prosecutors are done asking questions to -- ask their own questions of these jurors.And it is moving along, as you said it did on Tuesday. You know, the questions are largely the same. Prosecutors want to know, does the fact that the defendant in this case is Donald Trump, does that -- in the minds of these jurors, potential jurors, does it make it so the prosecutors have to prove more the standard of proof be higher because the defendant is? We've got a variety of answers so far as they're making their way through this group of 18. But nobody has said no unequivocally. So, no dismissals yet from that line of questioning. But jury selection still moving forward, inching forward as we do try to fill out the rest of that jury and add those potential -- or those remaining alternates that need to be added as well. And look, Judge Merchan did say on Tuesday that he was hopeful opening statements could begin as soon as Monday. But as you said, one step forward, two steps back, losing two jurors. And we have not added anymore. So, it'll be interesting to see if that timeline does hold or if it's pushed back by some of the challenges of filling out this jury.",

And she raised concerns about her ability to be fair and impartial because she said that there were indications that her anonymity had been compromised, that she was getting calls and texts from friends, families, colleagues who were asking her if she was a member of this jury. So, the judge saying that because she felt her -- she could no longer be impartial, she could be excused from the case.Now, the second juror to be dismissed today was juror number four, formerly juror number four. This was the juror who had previously told prosecutors that he found Trump \"fascinating and mysterious.\" Upon -- after being seated on Tuesday, though prosecutors did a little bit of their own due diligence and came up with evidence that he may have been arrested back in the 1990s for tearing down political ads. There's also some indication that somebody with his same name was married to someone who was involved in some sort of corruption inquiry and it reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan D.A. So, it's not exactly clear if those are the reasons why juror number four was dismissed because that conversation was happening in private. But the reality is, is we are two jurors down, back down to five from seven where we started the day.",

And that is that they're brave enough to stand up and say guilty if they believe that someone has been, in fact, proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So, I think there is a counter production that can happen here.I think that to the same extent that's why we have six alternates that are going to sit here because things happen in long trials. People get sick, they have problems at home, whatever it may be, and you certainly don't want the mistrial when you're halfway through the trial. You just want to be able to put another juror in there. So, there's a lot of things that can happen. I'm not surprised that a couple of them have dropped off already.",

You're looking at who is going to side with who back in the deliberating room. So, there's a number of dynamics at play. The jurors tend to surprise you. And I think that at the end of the process -- by the way, I wanted to agree with the professor. I think that -- certainly, as a defense lawyer, I would be asking for more peremptory strikes, given the level of self-identification as being unfair or they can't sit that we've already seen.

And we commission freelance journalists inside of Gaza to try to film and record there what's happening, because -- and this is really simple and we cannot say it enough, because the Israeli government won't let independent international journalists like ourselves into Gaza. For more than six months they have absolutely, point blank, refused to do it. Not countenance it, not give us the opportunity.

This comes as the threat to his speakership looms larger than ever. Before with his right flank up in arms over his latest attempt to push through a foreign aid package with much needed money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Melanie Zanona is on the Hill with the latest. Melanie, you and I have talked about this countless number of times over the last several weeks and months. It looks like this aid bill might finally get through. I almost don't want to say it out loud, but is that what you're hearing on the Hill?",

He's worked hard. He's now reached that point.I think he recognizes the threats that people have made toward him. But he's committed to these objectives and he's completed two of the three.
