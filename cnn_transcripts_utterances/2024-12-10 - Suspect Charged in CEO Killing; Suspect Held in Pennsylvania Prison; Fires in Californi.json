One friend telling us that they never got the impression that this was someone who was going to self-destruct. And if you look at all of his social media accounts, it really paints a picture of someone who grew up in a prominent family in Maryland, went to some of the best schools in the United States, and lived a pretty good life. You know, his social media shows pictures of him on his travels, hanging out with friends.We know that until recently he was living in Hawaii. And he was part of a co-living space. And he was actually head of their book club. He enjoyed to go on hikes. But really until about this last summer, it seems that he sort of dropped off. We see people tagging him in accounts asking, you know, are you doing OK? Your family is worried about you. There was a person who questioned, is he still going to honor the RSVP to that person's wedding. So, it is - appears something switched. Now what that switch is, is what investigators are trying to answer. Now, we have learned, based on those accounts, his X account, it has a picture of a spinal x-ray with some hardware in it. And we have learned that he moved to Hawaii. He had some chronic back pain. He took a surfing lesson and then was bedridden for about a week. Does that exactly point to the health care industry and a motive toward carrying out this act? It's hard to say. But certainly investigators are going to work to connect the dots. I want you to hear from someone who - who knows him in Hawaii about that back pain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) R.J. MARTIN, SUSPECT'S FORMER ROOMMATE: Before he moved in, I remember he said he had a back issue and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii. When he first came, he went on a surf lesson with other members and, unfortunately, just a basic surf lesson. He was in bed for about a week. We had to get a different bed for him that was more firm. And I know that it was really traumatic and difficult. You know, when you're in your early 20s and you can't, you know, do some basic things, it can be really, really difficult. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What did - what caused, rather, Mangione to commit allegedly this act. And that's what investigators are trying to ask.

I'm stunned that this - this young man, who apparently planned every step of this - of this horrible act, this assassination. And, you know, he's clearly not a professional, but a very kind of meticulous person. Likely, you know, tried out each step of the process of escape to ensure that he could get away with the least possible, you know, raising as little attention as possible. And yet he carried that gun on his person. I mean, that's basically like putting a sign in your pocket that says, I did it.

That, of course, being one of them.There's a thousand places he could have gotten rid of those IDs and that pistol, as he was making his escape out of New York. And had he done so, the case against him would be very different. He would essentially be able to put on a defense claiming it wasn't him. If he hadn't left DNA and had those items of evidence on his person when he was arrested, he would have had a pretty good argument saying, it's not me. That guy looks like me but it's not actually me. In a case that would have founded on, you know, a reasonable doubt. Now, really, there's no doubt whatsoever. Why he did that, it's harder to figure out. He's clearly, it seems, the - the narrative we're getting from his social media is he's somebody who is, you know, not - maybe going through a hard time in his life mentally, maybe struggling emotionally, disappearing from his friends and family, suffering with some sort of illness that might have been the source of his animus towards the health care industry. So, it's hard to say exactly why he was so good in some respects and then in other respects made just really obvious mistakes that led to his capture.",

That's going to help firefighters just a little bit here because they've been operating in total darkness. Even us, we've seen the glow of the flames on the hillside and firefighters all scattered throughout these neighborhoods. But it's been pitch black because the power is out. I don't know if you can see a little bit behind me, the glow from some of the fire right behind us. What's so tricky about these wildfires, especially in these canyons, is they - the embers will travel and then they'll create these big bursts of flames, it'll die down and then the flame can travel up to a mile and go somewhere else. And so these firefighters have really been chasing this fire through the canyons. Where we are right now is on a stretch of the PCH with the very high- end restaurants and businesses that line here. The Malibu Pier, the iconic Malibu Pier is right down the street from us. And right behind us here is Nobu Malibu, very high-end restaurant. And some firefighters just pulled in here to kind of monitor all of these restaurants here. There's also many, many houses scattered throughout here. And then just on the other side of us up here we saw a lot of flames in this neighborhood. These are homes that are overlooking the ocean. The activity with firefighters has died down in this area for now because the flames have jumped to a different part of the canyon. Demir (ph), if we can just move over just a little bit more, perhaps we can see some of the flames here from the distance. But again, these fires in these canyons are very difficult because these are two lane roads that go up into the hills, making it very difficult for firefighters to get an access to these neighborhoods. And then there's also all of these residents. This is a fire that blew up in the middle of the night. So, we have seen many residents here along PCH just sitting and watching, not evacuating, even though there are evacuation orders. We've also seen a lot of people rushing out. And then we've heard of stories of animals because they're, you know, deep in these canyons, too. There's a lot of farmland. There are people who, you know, have livestock. They have animals up there and had - having difficulty getting those animals out. We did see a horse trailer racing past a couple of hours ago. So, our goal is to get into the canyons after this live shot to see if we can get better access to see what's happening up there with homes, what kind of damage there is. But it's been very hard for us to tell because it's been so dark. So, we've seen a lot of flames. But from this vantage point, we cannot say for certain if there are homes that have gone down and are, you know, demolished at this point. John.",

An issue that he is now trying to clarify.It is probably an issue that's going to come up again with Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins. But again, this all comes as Pete Hegseth began the week last week really embroiled in controversy and ended it with a lot of Republican senators not closing the door to his nomination. So, this is a - yet another critical week for him. But it's just important to point out that the majority of Republicans in the Senate next Congress, it's going to be very narrow. So that means that Pete Hegseth has very little room for error. He can only afford to lose three Republicans. If he loses four he cannot get through as the next leader of the Pentagon.",

And I think, you know, it's clear that she wants the process to move forward and to see it through, which is good. She should listen to him. But the things that he has said and the things that he has done and the allegations that he has have got to be extremely troubling to especially somebody like Senator Ernst, who is a sexual assault survivor, a combat veteran herself, and we've known what Hegseth thinks about and has said about women in combat, and she is somebody who has fought to allay misconduct allegations or misconduct - sexual misconduct in the military. That is her legacy. We've seen Steve Bannon, Don Jr., and other MAGA extremists go afterher, not just publicly, but privately, essentially saying to her, if she doesn't support Hegseth, they're going to find somebody to primary her and she is up for re-election in '26.
