Their customers are waking up to, you know, to alerts essentially telling them that they don't have service, as well as were hearing reports that emergency services are down.I want to tell you the most likely explanation based on the evidence we have so far. And because it's hitting multiple carriers, so it's not like it's an attack on 18 only or that it might be some insider threat, someone in there trying to muck things up, is essentially solar activity. It's not very sexy, so to speak, but, there's - there's sunspots and solar flares and other things that can impact the capacity of there to be connectivity between cell lines, cell satellites, and your cell phones. There's these things called coronal mass ejections. I apologize for the terminology. It's CME for shorthand. Essentially they're flares that can disrupt the distribution of services. So that - if I'm in the room right now, I'm thinking that's the most likely explanation if I'm hearing that other carriers have it. But we always have to be worried about attacks on critical infrastructure, in particular ones that impact our communications. And so you would also be looking at that possibility.

And as we know, Russia does not recognize the American part of that. So, she is fair game.And I think what they're doing is a couple of things. Number one, they're collecting a bunch of people that they can use as hostages, therefore that's why the United States State Department is saying, don't go to Russia if you are an American. And then also I think they're sending a message to the rest of the world, and especially to Russians who are outside of the country, there are millions of them right now who fled after that -- after the invasion of Ukraine.

So, I think it's really pretty transactional here. They want to trade these Americans for people that they want.
