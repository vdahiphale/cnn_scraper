We're going to have the Eastern Conference versus the Western Conference.

Now, according to Abbott, the base will help them consolidate and it will give them that flexibility and that speed because of its proximity to the border.

The states can support it.They can't create their own immigration or foreign policy, which is essentially what Governor Abbott is doing by restricting the movement of federal officials. I think people don't quite understand that. He's like basically saying, well, the feds can't come here as if he were a sovereign state. And one way to think about this outside of the politics of this divided nation is imagine a liberal governor in California deciding to open up all the borders in California, right, with Mexico. We would not tolerate that. That would be also viewed as an unlawful assertion of state rights. So here's how I view what Abbott is doing. It is posturing, it is expensive, it is a waste of time, but it is a way for him to change the narrative from law, which he's losing in every court case to, well, I'm tougher than the Biden administration.

Their mission is ill defined and Texas Tribune has been reporting about the increase, even in suicides of Texas National Guard members. Because, you know, you don't just deploy people who -- this is their part time job for an indefinite period of time for a mission that's nebulous.

So, that gives them a sigh of relief.That said, Joe Manchin has said he's not running for Senate, which hurts Democrats chances of keeping the Senate. Now, what we know from our reporting is Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, has been urging Manchin to switch to independent and run as an independent in West Virginia, still giving them a chance to keep a Republican out of that seat. It seems unlikely that Manchin will do that at this point based on his public statements, but I think some Democrats are still holding out hope of a Manchin run in West Virginia.",
