That small military base is located near the border with Syria. The attack marks the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas. Mr. Biden is blaming Iran-backed militant groups for the attack, while in Iran, state media reports Iran's permanent mission to the U.N. denies the country had any involvement.

And you can imagine in those discussions a talk about how to respond in a way that would deter these attacks from happening again, but also the imperative to prevent this conflict from spreading even further. And at the end of the day, President Biden does have quite a consequential choice to make here. He is coming under pressure from some Republicans to respond directly in Iran to some of these attacks, but certainly the imperative inside the White House has been to prevent this conflict from broadening. And the fear among American officials as these attacks had proceeded on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria is that it would eventually result in fatalities. Now that that fear has been realized, the decision President Biden has is how to respond so that it doesn't happen again. And certainly, he will be making that decision over the coming days. But in a statement, President Biden saying that the three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest sense. And their ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation. Together, we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families. Now at the same time, the president is dispatching his top intelligence official, Bill Burns to France for talks with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel on these hostage negotiations. Certainly, the hope among American officials is that these will be fruitful in securing the release of all of the remaining hostages in Gaza paired with a prolonged cessation of hostilities. And really the hope had been that this pause in the fighting could cause some space for American officials and Israeli officials along with their counterparts in the region to come up with a plan to end this conflict permanently. And certainly, the death of the American soldiers in Jordan will lend some urgency to these talks as the U.S. continues to try and come up with a solution to this conflict and eventually result in lasting peace.

And it does then get complicated in terms of our response to their response to our response to that response, and so on. And you can go on and add an item.But I think that the Iranians could certainly retaliate. One of the concerns would have to be that they could lay mines in the key maritime checkpoints and in the key maritime straits. They could do cyber attacks, not only in the Middle East, but also globally. They have a strong cyber warfare capability. And they could do further attacks with their own missile capabilities against U.S forces. And as I said, taking down the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy would be an important step for the U.S. because that naval capability held by the IRGC is optimized for swarming attacks on vessels, where hundreds of small craft laden with explosives streak out and attack a vessel at sea. So I think that the Iranians have a number of options, we have to counter those options as well as sending a message to Tehran to continue, not to continue these attacks.",

But in fact, when you look at what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea, what the Iranians are doing in Iraq and Syria, there's no real definitive response there to, by Iran to Israeli actions against Hamas. And even if the U.S. could influence Israel to wind back its operation and cease all military operations against Hamas, that doesn't guarantee that either Hamas wouldn't continue to strike at Israel or that Iran wouldn't continue to strike at U.S. forces in the region.

We'll go more into that in aminute. But it's one thing to have prices rise gradually. It's another thing to see an individual supermarket staple like eggs go up some 60 percent in a year even more in some regions.
