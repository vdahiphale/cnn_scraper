      "sentences": "So, the top line here is that the judge has ruled that the district attorney, Fani Willis, can continue on this case against former President Trump and over a dozen other defendants. But he does address this issue of an appearance of a conflict because the big question here is whether there was an actual conflict. The defendants were alleging that Fani Willis, you know, not only that she had this romantic relationship with the lead prosecutor on the Trump case, but that she also benefited financially. And he had to decide -- the judge had to -- had to sort of do this analysis, is it enough that this just looks bad, that there's an appearance of a conflict, or did they need to prove -- did the defendant, Trump and his co-defendants, need to prove that there was an actual conflict.Now, again, I say that DA Fani Willis can stay on this case. But it also appears that the judge is saying that this appearance issue needs to be addressed before this can go forward. So, this appears to be a pretty nuanced ruling, but the headline is that the district attorney and her office can stay on this case. But we continue to read to learn more about exactly what the judge is saying about how you need to address the appearance of impropriety.",

It sounds like the judge has found there was not an actual conflict of interests, not a provable financial conflict of interest.Important to keep in mind, the defendants, Donald Trump and the other charge defendants, they're the ones who bore the burden of proof here. They had to prove there was a financial conflict of interests. And apparently, based on our initial readings of this ruling, they have not carried that burden. Now, we'll see if the judge has some other sort of measures that he suggests. We'll see if he has any harsh words for Fani Willis or her office. But yes, the bottom line is, the DA stays on the case, hence her office stays on the case. Hence, it can continue to move forward. And as we said before, they don't have a set trial date yet. The DA has asked for a trial in August. I don't think that's remotely realistic, but it will continue. It will not be put into this sort of suspended animation that otherwise would have gone into.",

He's saying, look, \"without sufficient evidence that the district attorney acquired a personal stake in this prosecution, or that her financial arrangements had any impact on the case.\" So there he's addressing the fact that they didn't really prove that she benefited from Wade being on this case when she was in a romantic relationship.He said, \"the defendants' claims of an actual conflict must be denied.\" So, he's like, look, you didn't prove that she had any sort of benefit that she received from the money Nathan Wade was making from this case. But, he said, \"this finding is by no means any indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the district attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing. Rather, it is the undersigned judge's opinion that Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices.\" So, this is pretty significant. I mean he is suggesting that she -- or he is saying that he had -- she had a tremendous lapse in judgment, that she was unprofessional when she testified. Remember, she was getting pretty contentious, pretty fiery with the defense attorney, insisting that she was not on trial when, in fact, they were asking her questions because the judge was assessing whether she needed to be disqualified. And then also saying here that she made bad choices. And look, even though she's going to stay on the case, all of this, especially this language from the judge, and we're just skimming the opinion right now, I'm sure there's -- there's likely more, it's really a gift to former President Trump and his co-defendants because they're not only going to fight this case on the merits, they fight it in the court of public opinion. Optics here matter. He has tried to undermine trust in the justice system. And if you have a judge who's overseeing a case, calling the prosecutor, again, unprofessional, saying that she made a bad decision, she had a lapse in judgment, that is a lot of ammunition for the former president and his co-defendants.",

And this, frankly, will -- it is a gift to the defense, I believe, as they will use this as they talk about whether or not the case has merit or whether or not it was brought for other reasons, whether or not it's a professional prosecutor and all that. We're going to hear all that down the road. But we're also going to hear, I expect, comments from the Georgia legislature as they have moved forward with their panel inquiry into her conduct. We're going to hear now this finding echoed around the halls of Congress by the likes of, you know, people in -- like Jim Jordan and things like that. So, I -- you know, this is not a good day for the state and it's not a good look for the state. But remember, this could have been remedy as we go through the order now.

It doesn't of Fani Willis has prosecuted it or -- you know, or the -- some -- some prosecutor from -- from -- that's appointed from wherever. This case is not going to move forward in way.

And if you remember, at the end of the last hearing, you heard from the DA's office, they were defending against this motion to disqualify Fani Willis and the entire team. This question of, well, is an appearance of impropriety, an appearance of a conflict going to be enough. Most people are accustomed to hearing about the quote/unquote \"hint of impropriety.\" We were talking about a judge attempting to recues themselves. Here it was. Has there been enough of a conflict or can I have an appearance of a conflict such that it would rise to the level of not allowing a defendant to have a fair trial? That is the crux of any decision surrounding this. And this judge was very clear. He said, as Nick Valencia pointed out,it wasn't that he condoned what he thought a lapse of judgment, but instead that the Georgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making, he says, bad choices, even repeatedly. But here is the crux of the entire thing as well going forward. Nothing in that trial, nothing in those hearings had anything to do with the underlying facts as alleged. There were allegations from the moving parties trying to get her disqualified, that her statements at that church event somehow prejudice the jury pool more broadly, tried to play the race card and beyond. But when it came to the actual allegations in the indictment, those were untouched in this particular hearing. But the jury is what is top of mind for this judge. The judge believes, and had the statement saying, look, as the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit for the DA, or even whether their romantic relationship has resumed. And so we talk about this a great deal, Sara, and everyone else, that a jury is going to be looking at this and wondering, well, hold on, rather than the facts before them and the evidence as presented, what's going on here. The ultimate distraction, the ultimate sideshow, no prosecutor wants to walk in any courtroom and have people wondering about their personal life. Prosecutors are fungible. They are interchangeable. To such an extent, I remember when I was pregnant and I said to the judge, I can't have a trial date on this thing, it's my due date. They said, really, is the entire government pregnant? They think of us all as fungible, interchangeable. And so anytime you're walking in, you want to be that blank slate. You want to be the government. The Fulton County people. You are on behalf of them. And so having this singular focus on one's relationship is highly problematic. Finally, when you look broadly at what is at stake here, this is the only case that really touches on all of the co-defendants. We've talked a lot about Donald Trump, Mark Meadows, and the other cases involving a few other co-defendants particularly in Mar-a-Lago. This was a case in Fulton County of a broad scope with extreme gravitas because it touches on the electors scheme and beyond. And so had this case gone away, it wouldn't just have impacted Donald Trump or even a Mark Meadows, it would have had the more than a dozen remaining co-defendants. And who in their right professional minds gearing up could have been the next team to successfully get up to speed, let alone prepare for a trial anytime within the next year.",

And the judge essentially says, the evidence wasn't clear enough for me to decide. But then the judge writes this at page 17, \"reasonable questions about whether the DA and her hand selected lead prosecutor testified untruthful about the timing of their relationship further underpin the finding of an appearance of impropriety.\" I mean you're -- this is the DA. She is the chief law enforcement officer of that county. She is held to a different standard. I was a federal prosecutor. If you are the lead, I was never a lead DA, you are held to a higher standard. And to have a judge say there are reasonable questions about whether this person lied on the stand is a big deal.

We've talked about this. And when a judge says, I didn't find the defendants, witnesses persuasive. He doesn't find Fani Willis particularly persuasive either, but it's the defendant's burden, that's the kind of thing that an appeals court will not overturn.

The jury pool is well versed in what this news will be.But remember, there was no guarantee that Fani Willis herself would actually be the one to personally try this case, or even Nathan Wade. You can look at other cases, for example, like with Jack Smith. The likelihood of him actually going before a jury, standing there as representative on behalf of the people of the United States was highly unlikely. And so this might be the office that is more broadly tainted. But here's a really important part of this opinion that I am focused on. How big of a role did cash play here? Remember about how much cash she had, whether she was reimbursing him or not, the principle of going dutch, whether they were taking trips. Who paid back who? The judge goes to the heart of all of this and actually says, more broadly, that whole theory that the defendant -- that the people bringing this motion wanted to raise is that, look, there was a financial incentive here supposing that these two, Nathan Wade and Fani Willis, were in some sort of a romantic relationship and looking to prolong it to, one, capitalize on the income generated, and, number two, to be able to have some cover for their relationship. The judge did not buy it. On more than one occasion the judge points of his notion, on the one hand about financial incentives, that neither party, Nathan Wade or Fani Willis, typically came in as destitute was the word they used. The idea of having to prove that the pool of money that was coming in was the only source of income to be used to these different adventures was something the judge took issue with. Also that the defendants argue that the financial arrangement created an incentive to prolong this case, but, in fact, there is no indication of that. And he says that indeed the record is quite the contrary. Think back to that moment that we all remember when Fani Willis first decided that she was going to make public this case and going forward. Remember how long she said she wanted till a trial date? She said six months from now. People almost gafad (ph) in the room thinking, is she insane, she's going to have a six month from now trial date on a co-defendant case that includes Donald Trump? Well, that actually innerred (ph) to her benefit here. The judge saying, if she wanted to prolong it, then why would she have asked for all of these quick turnarounds? Why has there been the diligence to do this so quickly? And why has the focus been on bringing this case to trial various swiftly. So, in reality, you got to go back in time, not just to the last couple months of this trial and these hearings, but all of the cumulative aspects of her efforts as a prosecutor. And remember, although at the trial, the prosecution will have the burden of proof. In this instance, it was the defense attorneys bringing the motion. The judge did not feel they met their burden.
