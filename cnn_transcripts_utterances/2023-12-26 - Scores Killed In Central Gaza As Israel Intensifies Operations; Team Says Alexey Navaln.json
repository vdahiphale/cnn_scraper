      "sentences": "As Israel's military offensive on Hamas ramps up and the death toll in Gaza soars, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a second wartime visit to the Palestinian territory, urging Israeli troops to stay the course.Warning now, some of the latest images from Gaza may be disturbing for some viewers. In Central Gaza, dozens of white body bags left outside Al-Aqsa Hospital as family members mourn and prepare the dead for burial. According to the Hamas controlled health ministry, at least 250 people were killed in 124 hour period. That includes at least 70 killed by an Israeli airstrike at a refugee camp. CNN though cannot independently verify any of the numbers released by the health ministry in Gaza. Meantime, Netanyahu warned of a long fight to come and one source tells CNN he has dispatched a senior official to Washington to discuss the next phase of the war with the Biden administration. Here's more now from the Israeli Prime Minister speaking with IDF troops in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): If someone tells you and they say it all the time, I hear it outside that we are going to stop the war, that the war is over. The war is not over. It will end in total victory. No less than that. October 7th is not over. It is not over. We have to make sure that it never happens again. This requires what each and every one of you is asking for, just to continue until the end, until the end. And I'm just proud of your determination. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a statement which was posed by the Likud party, he promised to stay the course in Gaza. \"It will be a long fight. And it's not close to ending. We don't stop, we keep fighting, and we deepen the fighting in the coming day\".You know, the Israelis expect the high intensity phase of this war, at least privately to continue for at least another month. So, will that timeline be determined by Israel alone? Is that likely to change because of domestic and international pressure, especially from the White House?",

That's where the Hamas leadership is believed to be holding itself up inside some of those bunkers and underground tunnels alongside the 129 hostages, or those who are still alive and are being held inside the Gaza Strip.So, Israel wants to keep that going, because they have yet to bring about the toppling of Hamas's regime. However, we know that the Americans want Israel to wind down that high intensity stage. And I think that this is what the conversation is about right now. How much more time can everyone be on the same page about, how much more time does Israel have for this high intensity stage? And also, what is the next stage look like? What is the Israeli presence in Gaza look like at that stage? What is a buffer zone, a potential security zone? Is Rwanda alongside its borders? So, there's a lot of coordination going on right now between Jerusalem and Washington exactly on those questions.",

Destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza, de-radicalize the whole of Palestinian society. That's a pretty big list even though it's only three preconditions.He also rules out any role for the Palestinian Authority for a post- Hamas Gaza. And again, that puts them at odds with the White House. So, out of all of that together, it seems Netanyahu is essentially spelling out what will be long term occupation of Gaza.",

And families of the hostages staged a protest at the Knesset as Netanyahu was delivering a speech. What they're chanting is now, now, bring them home now. So, when it comes to prerequisites for Gaza in that op-ed, of the 655 words that Netanyahu wrote, not one of them is the word hostage.",

And Netanyahu would obviously and I think all of Israel would obviously prefer there'd be no hostages, it would make the operation simpler and easier to implement and to carry on.However, we have the presence of 129 people who are still being held in the Gaza Strip. And that is partly due to a failure of his government, and a failure of the Israeli security forces. And this is a breach of the social contract between the states, its country, and our people, the people who were taken, they have to be retrieved. And that has to be one of the top goals and objectives of this -- of this war. Netanyahu was trying to continue this Gaza operation, while on the one hand, he pays lip service to the hostages, you are right that in that op-ed, there was no mention of them. And that is something that is of great concern to those families who feel that their loved ones are being neglected and are being left behind. And I think that the government has a responsibility to better articulate what it is doing for those hostages to try to reach a deal that might include another pause like a few weeks ago that brought back 100 hostages, we would do again to bring back these hostages, there has to be a plan in place. Because if we end this war, John, with those hostages still being held in Gaza, it would be viewed internally in Israel as a failure.",
