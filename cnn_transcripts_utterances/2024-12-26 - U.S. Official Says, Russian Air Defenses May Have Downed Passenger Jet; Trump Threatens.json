And the plane, the pilots appeared to be fighting for control with some sort of hydraulic issue.The video, Wolf, ill from inside the plane showed the oxygen masks had dropped, which indicates that the pressurization of the plane had been penetrated.

And, look, a lot of these leaders are either pushing back very aggressively on what Donald Trump is saying or kind of trying to allow him to just, you know, say this and not give so much response to draw more attention to it. For example, we saw Panama's president today, Jose Mulino, say essentially that, you know, Panama, the Panama Canal is not up for grabs. They are not considering selling it, and also pushing back on Donald Trump's claims that Chinese soldiers are controlling the different ports in Panama. So, that's one president weighing in very clearly and directly on this. He said this at a press conference. But then also when you look at his claims about trying to make Canada the 51st state of the United States, trying to absorb it into this country, I mean, it's clear that Justin Trudeau is not considering that. I would note, though, that this also comes after Trudeau had flown to Florida directly to meet with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and they had dinner, following Donald Trump's other threats about saying that he would put a 25 percent tariff on Canadian goods if Justin Trudeau did not crack down on crime and drugs coming over the northern border.And then as for Greenland, we've heard from Greenland's prime minister, I'd note that Greenland is a Danish territory, saying that Greenland is not for sale. It wasn't for sale either back in 2019 when Donald Trump had first pursued this desire of his and this, you know, idea of trying to purchase Greenland, all to say, a lot of what Donald Trump is putting out there and floating, and some of this is also just direct taunting, I'm told, especially as it relates to Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it's not going to happen, but this is a way for Donald Trump to try and kind of assert his dominance, I'm told, over some of these foreign leaders and try to show that he's coming in from a position of strength and really with this idea of wanting to force them to the negotiating table as it relates to trade and tariffs and other things that we know are at the top of his agenda.",

So, like I said, when I talked to Donald Trump's advisers about this, I mean, I spoke with one adviser who tried to give me his interpretation of some of these posts, and essentially said, this is a way to try and force some of these foreign leaders to the table, particularly on issues where Donald Trump believes that the United States is being taken advantage of.I want to talk about Panama specifically. That is something that Donald Trump is clearly, we've seen it this week in a number of posts, fixated on. But it's also something, I'm told, sources close to Donald Trump tell me, that he has been fixated on for several weeks. We know he did an interview over the summer where he mentioned this, that he thought that the former president, Jimmy Carter, and the treaty that essentially gave control of the Panama Canal to Panama, that he thought that was a mistake and that he believes that the United States should be getting a better deal. When I talk to these advisers, they say this is a way to try and open up a line of negotiation to see if maybe we can lower prices for American vessels in the Panama Canal, again, just one interpretation of maybe some of the things that he is saying. All to say, though, I think a lot of this as well goes back to what Donald Trump really wants to do as it relates to his power on the global stage, particularly as it relates to our foreign adversaries, like China and Russia, and some of the power that they are wielding abroad, Donald Trump wants to try and kneecap some of that.

HILLARY SCHOLTEN (D-MI):  Well, given what we've seen in terms of the chaos on the other side of the aisle, at least in the U.S. House of Representatives, I have my doubts. Listen, I'm here to work with the president, to accomplish goals that are good for the American people. But, you know, so many of the things that you mentioned there, when executed improperly, can have devastating consequences, particularly when you think about some of the immigration policies, you know, the mass deportations that Trump wants to enact. This is a lovely time of year. You know, folks are with their families, but it's also a terrifying and uncertain time for so many as well. You know, it's important to keep two things in mind about immigration in particular when there is nothing wrong with enforcing our immigration laws. In fact, we have to do it. We have to do more of it. But the problem with these blanket deportations is that they can catch up so many innocent individuals, including U.S. citizens, you know, in the fray or individuals who are lawfully entitled to be here, like students, you know, returning from abroad. And it can just have devastating consequences.",

I've been talking with cabinet level officials, you know, even up until a few days ago about things that we hope to accomplish in the remaining duration. I know one things for sure.

CNN media analyst Sara Fischer is with us right now. She's also a senior media correspondent over at \"Axios\". Sara, thanks so much for joining us.

Of course, you're going to want to try to get as many viewers as you possibly can, but overall, it's actually great for both leagues that they both had such great viewership on Christmas day.

We were about two hours without one, but were looking at them. And these storms are still rotating out there. It's like, when is the next one going to be issued?Well, now the northern parishes of Louisiana really are under the gun. So the red box here is the tornado watch. That means conditions are right. But Houston, you're out of that watch now. But the warning on the next map, the pink area up here, this is the warning. This means that they're seeing rotation on the radar enough to think that a tornado could come down to the ground. So all the way from Shreveport, all the way down still to east of Houston, this is the threat tonight. But then we move ahead. Lets just fast forward all the way to Saturday, when a lot of people are going to be getting on the road, and on Sunday as well. All of a sudden, the rain is in the big cities all the way from New York down to D.C. and Atlanta. Now, we'll take the rainfall down here. It's been a huge drought down across the south, so you just have to be careful what you wish for. You want rain, but you don't want it to come with severe weather. Back out to the west, the next storm system that is just piling up snow in the Cascades and all the way down to the Sierra. Significant snow out here, significant wind with it as well, even the potential even for some avalanche danger here. But one storm after another, there will be four by the time this weekend ends. This will be one, two, three, four with snow coming down. And many of these areas, Wolf, are picking up 2 to 3 feet of snow with every one. So you need to be careful if you're traveling here, because there will be some closed roads, or at least some may require chains. And you know how hard those are to get on.",
