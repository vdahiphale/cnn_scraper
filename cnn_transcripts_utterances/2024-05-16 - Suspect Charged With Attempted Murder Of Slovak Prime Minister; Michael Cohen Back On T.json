He is back on the stand now, court resuming. This is the second crucial day of cross- examination from Donald Trump's defense team. Michael Cohen, of course, Trump's former fixer, onetime attorney. Today's questioning is expected to really focus in on Michael Cohen and the alleged lies that he's told, the admitted lies that he has -- those lies he has admitted to as well. The defense, we're told, is really going to hammer this home. It's what's being referred to as the \"liar, liar, pants on fire\" day of questioning from the defense. And just a reminder here. The reason we are talking about this, the reason Donald Trump is in court are these 34 felony counts. He has pleaded not guilty to all of them. But this is a case not really about sex with a porn star or a hush money payment. It's about the alleged cover-up of that payment and the falsifying of business records to hide it and the timing of that. Jessica Schneider back with me this hour, our CNN justice correspondent.

Bodyguards rushing him into a car. The alleged shooter still just feet away, tackled by police. Fico was shot multiple times and immediately rushed to the hospital, then airlifted to a major trauma center.

He won a third term last year by running on a campaign to end military support for Ukraine, making no secret of his sympathies for Russia.

Again, yet another key optic in this broader picture of mutual respect, mutual admiration between these two nations, which is a big part of this visit. Not only is it about this relationship between these two men but this no- limits partnership between China and between Russia. As far as how this will progress, a big part of this meeting has been to discuss some of the hotspots in the world; obviously the conflict that we're seeing in the Middle East but also the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's war with Ukraine. It is interesting how Beijing is really trying to take a neutral position in all of this, saying that it's a neutral party. Xi Jinping is denying accusations from the West that it's helping the Russian war machine indirectly through defense support. It's also of note that China is saying that it is not necessarily condemning this war. If Xi Jinping Russia has not condemned this war. And that is very telling. Some remarks today, in fact, suggested that Xi Jinping may be looking to be a peacemaker. Let's take a listen.

But that actually is not a great number historically, right? I mean, that is well above the pre-COVID rate. The reason why it was good news is because we were talking about 9 percent inflation two years ago and 4 percent to 5 percent a year ago. So the market has celebrated the progress on the inflation fight. But that doesn't mean that the cost of living is still not a problem. It is. And we've seen that in survey after survey, the Consumer Sentiment Survey out just a week ago showed that consumer sentiment plunged last month -- or actually to start this month -- by the most in years to a six-month low. And that does reflect frustration with how expensive life is, right? It's obviously food and gasoline, both of which, by the way, have improved. But it's the cost of shelter, of owning a home, of renting a home, of day care, of baby formula, of fixing your car. And so all of those frustrations are real political liabilities for President Biden and his White House. But I got to tell you they would be much happier to talk about a market milestone like 40,000 than being in a situation where the markets were in turmoil.

But more than half of U.S. households, they do own stocks in some way, either directly or in their 401(k) or retirement accounts. So really this is something that benefits many people. And there are political implications too, because actually within just about five minutes of the Dow hitting 40,000, the Biden campaign sent out an email, an email blast, celebrating this milestone, saying that, under Joe Biden Dow crosses 40,000 mark. Market set record highs and pointing out that, years ago, Donald Trump warned that the market would crash if Joe Biden became president.
