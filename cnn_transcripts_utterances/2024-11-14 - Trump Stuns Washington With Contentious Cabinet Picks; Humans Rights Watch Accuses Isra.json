And let's get right to the news.At this hour, the political earthquake of President-elect Donald Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, is still sending aftershocks through Washington. It is the ultimate loyalty test for Republican senators. Do they back a right wing firebrand with limited legal experience, someone previously under DOJ investigation himself to be the nation's top law enforcement officers? Senators, many stunned by the announcement, began to weigh in today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  At the end of the day, you got to have the votes and you better have the resume. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  He chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee and he will be asked hard questions and we'll see how he does. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  The president is entitled to choose his cabinet and I presume I'll support them. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX):  I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One person close to Trump told us that this appointment, causing shockwaves, said, quote, people being in a state of shock was the goal. That's exactly what MAGA wants. And Donald Trump believes that after last week's election, he has a mandate to execute the vision that he laid out quite explicitly during his campaign. He made no secrets about his plan to dismantle the Justice Department, to get rid of Christopher Wray as FBI director, and to root out the deep state. And Matt Gaetz is the person he is going to put in charge of that effort. Now, the question remains, can he get 51 votes to confirm Matt Gaetz in the Senate? You've already heard some trepidations that many people have. Obviously, there have been several individuals who have been outspoken on the House side who do not like Matt Gaetz, but they won't have a say in this fight. And the pro-MAGA bent of the Senate is quite more substantial than it was eight years ago, when Donald Trump first emerged as president.",

Now, again, it's not just the congressman's appointment. It's what it portends for the Justice Department at large. As you said, Trump was pretty clear on the campaign trail how he wants to use the Justice Department. He wants to use it to go after his political adversaries. That is something that former Congressman Gaetz appears to be willing to do. And that's something that is very concerning to many people who work inside the Justice Department. Most of the work in there, right, it's going after elder fraud, a tax fraud, examining antitrust cases. There's a lot of really serious work that goes on at the Justice Department and there's a real concern that that might be in jeopardy if this is the kind of person at the helm.",

He said and I'm quoting, everyone else looked at the A.G. as if they were applying for a judicial appointment. They talked about their vaunted legal theories and constitutional bullshit, again, quoting here, Gaetz was the only one who said, yeah, I'll go over there and start cutting f-ing heads.

He believes that it has to be overhauled, root and branch. He believes that the deep state has to be forcibly removed.And so, he's not looking for someone who sort of knows the ropes and wants to tweak things around the edges. He really wants to overturn the whole way of doing business of this massive federal agency and, beginning, you know, eliminating the traditional independence of the Justice Department from the president is only the first step as far as he's concerned.

And he has always sort of relished that image as -- as a sort of chaos agent uh, but it means that he doesn't have a lot of allies when it comes to something like this, where he is going to need friends on Capitol Hill.

Now, on the military to military communication, some initial progress was made, but then it took months before that communication actually reached the theater command level and it took a call between Biden and Xi to actually get that in place. So, clearly, there have been some hiccups in the relationship even since that bilateral meeting. And it's unclear what, if any, deliverables or progress could come out of this meeting given that many China experts expect that President Xi will withhold any potential bargaining chips that he has for the incoming president, President-elect Donald Trump who is sure to launch a bevy of new tariffs against China and try to open up trade negotiations with China once again.

When you look at the bleachers, they are pretty empty. And that speaks to this really impressive perimeter that the police forces have put in place.

It was relatively small, but after the events here in Paris last night, which has seen many people turn to the streets, not just pro-Palestinian voices, the usual suspects that you see come out of these times, but moderate Israeli voices as well, and certainly pro-Jewish French groups worried about Israel's policies in the Middle East. They too had turned out to demonstrate yesterday on the sidelines of an event that was held to raise funds for the IDF, and in support of Israel. So it's an important reminder of how high tensions rise here in Europe, Jim, over events in the Middle East. They were underlined by what we saw in Amsterdam last week, that violence that was meted out over the course of the Thursday night against Maccabi Tel Aviv fans who had come to support their side in that here in Paris. So far, the point of Parisian authorities has been to keep any pro-Palestinian protesters away physically from anyone who might have come as far as Paris to support Israel. And remember that the Israeli authorities have urged fans not to leave Israel not to travel away for football fixtures, and that might have something to do with the few numbers we expect here tonight, Jim.",

Individual countries here in Europe have already either restricted or banned arms sales to Israel. But you're seeing growing calls that this should happen in the European level. So much greater calls, even amongst the political classes, that something can be done to hold Benjamin Netanyahu's government to account for what -- how the war has been prosecuted and still a steadfast support on the part of the French state against antisemitism in all of its expressions, Jim.",
