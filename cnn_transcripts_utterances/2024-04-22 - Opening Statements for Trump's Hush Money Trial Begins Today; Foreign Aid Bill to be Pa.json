The defense will then have the option to give an opening statement. By New York law, they're not required to give an opening statement.

And eventually, at closing arguments, the prosecutor is going to be able to argue, look, Michael Cohen, he said what he said. Yes, he has his baggage, but he can be believed. Why?

Prosecutors knew that in order to get to the bottom of this crime, they needed information from David Pecker. Now, that non-prosecution agreement, the immunity agreement, is going to allow David Pecker to give the full story of what actually happened without any repercussions of him possibly facing jail time. But instead, he'll be able to lay everything out for the prosecution.

But when it comes to President Zelenskyy, you know, this was really a call to action. He's calling for long-range artillery. He's saying that, you know, the F-16s that were promised a year ago still haven't materialized. On the U.S. side, they are saying that speed is possible.

The question now though is exactly how long those protesters will be allowed to remain on the Columbia University given that it was just a few days ago that university officials called on the NYPD to make their way onto campus to clear out that encampment which resulted in well over a hundred arrests and some student suspensions. The question is are we bound to see that yet again? Now over the weekend I had an opportunity to visit that encampment and things were peaceful as security looked on and really university officials not really intervening at this point. But also over the weekend a separate vein in which there are now growing concerns among Jewish students and some Jewish students attending Columbia University. Many of them saying that they feel unsafe coming to school because of these ongoing pro-Palestinian protests. So much so that Rabbi Ellie Buckler with Columbia University's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative reached out on Sunday morning to well over 300 Jewish students saying that it is best that they simply stay home until Columbia University and the YPD do more to make sure that they feel safe. Now the university for its part released a statement over the weekend saying that they are acting on these concerns and they also added that students do have the right to protest on campus so long as those demonstrations do not interfere with campus operations and also that they do not intimidate any of their fellow students.
