      "sentences": "You know, Jake, it's interesting because I covered Trump round one and now seeing the differences in round two is notable. And one part of what happened the last time Trump took office is some of the people that he had put in his cabinet, either at the beginning or later on when he fired people, because obviously there was a lot of turnover at the Justice Department, at the Department of Homeland Security, at the Pentagon, at these key agencies that we're talking about right now, is when Trump would put someone new in or suggest a name, often if there was a lot of blowback or negative coverage, it could shift his view of that person.And he also often did not want someone who was attracting negative attention. He wanted his picks to be praised and lauded and what's different this time around after having conversations with a lot of people in his orbit over the last 48 hours, Jake, specifically around the Attorney General pick and his Pentagon pick Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth, both respectively who are having their own issues when it comes to whether or not they are going to get Republican senators on board with their nomination or at least enough to get them confirmed. Trump does not seem as bothered by the blowback this time. He is very much still behind both of them. What I've heard is he has not wavered on either really or made questions about whether or not he should have picked someone differently. Now there are some in his inner circle certainly who have raised those questions themselves. But the former president and president-elect now has not raised that, Jake, and I think that's notable just given -- it really does showcase and highlight how Trump is approaching this the second time around and how he's viewing it and also how he's viewing Senate Republicans because essentially the thinking in Trump's orbit has been they're daring them to try to defy him certainly on these picks that he cares the most about like the Pentagon and the Justice Department.",

And as of this morning he had still not made a decision.Now we're waiting to see any moment we could get one from him, but essentially the picks that he had been looking at, Scott Bessent, who was certainly one of them, a name that was seen here down in Palm beach and doing those interviews. And also Howard Lutnick, who is the transition co-chair that, that I've interviewed that is leading the personnel side of this, but then also began pitching himself for the Treasury role. The fighting there became so bad and so bitter essentially between the two of them that Trump started exploring other options. He was looking at names like Mark Rowan, the Wall Street billionaire, Kevin Warsh who is a former Federal Reserve governor is someone who has also struck his fancy in recent days. Jake, that's someone he actually almost considered naming as the Federal Reserve chair back when he picked Jay Powell, a decision that he later came to regret. And jake, the reason that Trump is taking so long on this position I think is because he realizes how crucial the treasury position is going to be. How he has seen, how the stock market has done, he doesn't want anything he does with the treasury pick to affect that. And so that is still a lot of battling happening behind the scenes. But as someone described to me earlier with, you know, Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, it could end up being kind of a murder suicide where one tried to push the other out of contention, but then in the end, neither of them get that position, Jake.",

Scott Jennings, let's start with you. Farm industry officials and economists tell CNN that if Trump indeed goes forward with this mass deportation plan and rounds up the millions of undocumented immigrants who are working in our agricultural sector, they say high grocery prices are only going to get higher.You know, obviously getting rid of people who have committed crimes beyond coming into the country illegally is one thing. But deporting people who are paying taxes, keeping the food and agriculture industries running, doing jobs that Native-born Americans don't want to do or are not willing to do, won't this actually hurt the Americans who are already so frustrated about high prices in grocery stores?",

And so some people are watching this going, thank God, a politician whose planning to follow through on their promises. Number two, there's like 1.3 to 1.6 million illegal immigrants who've already received deportation orders from a court. I think you could start there.Number three, there's another population of people who are violent. You could also go there before you ever get to people who are sort of working in industries and maybe during the course of all that time, maybe, just maybe, the Congress and the White House could figure something out about how to balance our illegal immigration crisis with the need for agriculture labor. Final point, I don't remember anybody having these kinds of meltdowns when Barack Obama deported five million people. It is not uncommon for the executive branch to deport illegal immigrants. It happens in every administration. Obama deported more than most and I don't remember any of this kind of meltdown and the crisis has only gotten worse so I think Donald Trump's doing the right thing and most Republicans would agree it is a national emergency.",

I think CBS News conducted it, indicating that a majority of Hispanic-Americans wanted Donald Trump to do mass deportations. That they had come here, they had gone through the legal process, they had become citizens, and they didn't like the idea of huge scores of illegal immigrants coming across every day.Look at some of the counties in Texas along the border that are majority Hispanic and the changeover from Biden to Trump. It is a crisis in the Hispanic community, the people who have come here legally, the people here are following all the laws and all the rules, they're living in some of the communities that are the hardest hit. And so I agree that they also believe in Donald Trump's economic message because most Hispanic-Americans are working class Americans and the working class did flow towards Donald Trump. They're living in the communities that are the hardest hit by illegal immigration and the societal and governance impacts that it brings. And so I think they want him to do something about both.

If you ask the question open- ended, should undocumented immigrants be deported, you're going to have a lot of people who are going to say yes.But the fact of the matter is, is that when you offer Americans a choice between mass deportation and giving undocumented immigrants, especially those that have been long settled here for 10 years, 20 years, the ability to have and find a legal pathway so they can continue to work on our economy, the vast majority of Americans choose that balanced common sense solution and that's not what Donald Trump is offering.",

So our immigration system is broken. I don't think most people would argue that. We have to make sure that we have security at our borders. As you mentioned, I sit on the Committee for Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party. We know China has been pushing some of the precursor chemicals to fentanyl up through our southern border. We have to have security there. We have to have better processing. No one should wait in detention for months and months as they are waiting to see a judge.

They occupied that area of western Russia and the Russians now with the help of the North Koreans are trying to get it back. And so U.S. officials believe that this could be an effective way for them to basically have an advantage over the Russians and the North Koreans there as the Russians have launched this major offensive. But importantly, the U.S. also is really keen for Ukraine not to lose Kursk because that, as Jim mentioned, could be a really important bargaining chip for the Ukrainians if and when peace talks actually begin. The Russians want to take Kursk completely off the table because they do not want any Russian land, of course, to be part of any future negotiations.

Here with us, Ronan Farrow. Ronan, good to see you. Congratulations on the new docs.As spyware companies say that their programs can help authorities prevent terrorism, fight criminals. But critics also warn that spyware can violate civil liberties. And you have first-hand experience because you've been a target of spyware because of your reporting on Harvey Weinstein. Explain all of this.",

And it opened up a world to me of just how commonplace this is. And what we've seen in recent years, Jake, is the world already knows that under repressive regimes, this happens all the time. We saw the prominent example of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was murdered. And there was an allegation that on the phones of people around him, this very powerful spyware, Pegasus, was found.Pegasus can turn your phone into a listening device. It can, without you ever knowing, crack into your photos your most personal data. And we've seen a string of those examples around the world. But now we've seen it happen in Western democracies over and over again. Part of this film is set in Spain where we document one of the largest clusters of political dissidents, opposition politicians, activists, civil society members, all being hacked. And we've seen similar scandals in Poland, in Greece. So part of the message of this film is it could happen here. And that we've seen the beginnings of that under the first Trump administration there was the purchase of this same technology, Pegasus, the FBI said only to test, but the New York Times later reported they came very close to operationalizing it. And in recent months, Jake, we've seen ICE, for instance, purchase a similar powerful Israeli spyware technology from a company called Paragon. So you now have Donald Trump coming in with campaign promises including mass deportation and technology that could really transform the way that those promises are executed in a way that civil liberties experts and privacy law experts tell me everyone should be afraid of, whether you're in a vulnerable category, like a journalist or an activist or someone awaiting an immigration hearing or not. Because once you start using this without guardrails, what we've seen in all of these cases around the world is democracy falls away, and suddenly people who don't expect to be on lists are being targeted, and it's a basis for them being intimidated.",

And what can I do? What can our viewers do to try to make sure that this doesn't happen to them, other than not clicking on unfamiliar emails and texts?",

Daniel Penny is the 26-year-old Marine Corps veteran who is facing manslaughter charges for the fatal chokehold on a New York subway that killed Jordan Neely in May of last year. This case has sparked nationwide conversations on vigilante justice and mental health and homelessness. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is outside the New York courthouse. And Gloria, the prosecution is done. What's the biggest obstacle now for the defense team? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTbe the testimony of the city medical examiner, which wrapped up today after near six hours of questioning. She testified over and over since Friday that the reason why Jordan Neely died was because of the chokehold that he was placed in by Daniel Penny. Now, why is this so significant? Because the defense had said in its opening statements that they would prove to the jury that it wasn't the chokehold that killed Jordan Neely, but rather all these other complicating factors, including the fact that Neely suffered from sickle cell disease and that he had sickling event during the struggle between him and Penny. But over and over today, during cross examination by the defense and redirection by the prosecution, Dr. Cynthia Harris said that the reason why Jordan Neely likely had that sickling crisis was because he had been placed in the chokehold in the first place. So this is a critical piece of the defense that has now fallen apart after this medical examiner's testimony. Now, over the last three weeks or so, we've heard from witnesses, including some who testified that they were afraid and that they feared for their lives when they saw Jordan Neely get on the train and start screaming about not caring if he would go to prison that night. And we've heard from some witnesses who said that they were relieved that Daniel Penny took action. Now, remember, this case is about whether or not Daniel Penny simply went too far. That's what the prosecution is trying to say, that he had good intentions, but that by placing him in that chokehold and holding him for six minutes, he went too far. Now, they rested their case this afternoon, and now the defense is up to present their case. And they have started by calling two character witnesses, including Daniel Penny's older sister and a close childhood friend. Both of them testified about their close relationships with Daniel Penney, talked about his desire to serve in the Marines and his reputation as an honest and calm person. Jake.",

And he said today that he felt the defense was desperate by putting on family members and close childhood friends of Mr. Penny just to try and show that he was a compassionate person when the character of Mr. Penny is not really what's in question here is whether or not he made that maneuver, went too far, and ultimately ended up killing Jordan Neely on that subway.",
