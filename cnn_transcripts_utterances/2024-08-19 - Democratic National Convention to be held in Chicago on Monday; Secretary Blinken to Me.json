And we are just hours away from the start of the Democratic National Convention where the party is hoping to build on the momentum sparked by Kamala Harris and her dramatic rise to the top of the ticket. Delegates from across the country have gathered in Chicago for the four-day event. The theme of day one, \"For the People.\" President Joe Biden, the man who many once thought would be accepting the nomination, will deliver remarks on opening night. Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, are expected to address the convention Tuesday. On Wednesday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz will deliver his speech. And on Thursday night, Kamala Harris will accept the Democratic nomination for president. Harris spent Sunday on the campaign trail in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania alongside her running mate, Tim Walz. During one stop, she appeared to call rival Donald Trump a coward without mentioning him by name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  This campaign is about a recognition that, frankly, over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest -- which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. Anybody who's about beating down other people is a coward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But President Joe Biden will arrive here in Chicago and deliver something of a valedictory, talking about his accomplishments and his record in office before turning the page and literally passing the torch to his vice president. There is no doubt this party is in an entirely different place than it was just one month ago before President Biden made that difficult decision to step aside. But after he addresses the convention on Monday night, he will take his leave and this will be Vice President Harris's party, her convention. She's campaigning across Pennsylvania on Sunday, making her way here to Chicago. She talked a bit about her speech and called herself an underdog in this race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's talking, for example, about how he's better looking than Kamala Harris or how a magazine cover didn't reflect her. It looked more like his wife.So he is giving her this honeymoon period. I think she may have seen a slowing of that had he actually given her some competition. At the end of the day, you're right, Rosemary. She has really bounced. I mean, three weeks in the polls, five out of seven key swing states. She is ahead in national polls. She's finally pulled ahead enough that she's out of the margin of error. But she's right. She's an underdog. There are many pathways to 270 for both Donald Trump and for Kamala Harris.

U.S. officials have expressed extreme optimism around this deal. They have said that it is in its end stages and at an inflection point, and some have even suggested a deal could come together this week. Now, Blinken is here for difficult conversations with the Israeli government, urging them to take the deal to make sure that this can come into fruition. Now, the U.S. optimism comes in contrast from things we're hearing from Hamas, for example, who has suggested that the deal is too beholden to Israel, as well as the prime minister's office, who says they are not going to go to the demands of the Israeli government. So we will be watching closely what comes out of Blinken's meetings here in Israel.
