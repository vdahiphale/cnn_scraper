It is her fourth birthday today.We have team coverage this morning from Doha to Tel Aviv to the West Bank, tracking all of these fast-moving developments. And let's begin with Becky Anderson, who joins us in Doha. Becky, walk us through how the hostage release will go. BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: And it was here that that deal was mediated, of course. Qatar absolutely central in getting this deal arranged and then across the line. So where are we at? Well, we are now some hours into this truce. And despite the fact that over Gaza, we saw some activity, some smoke right at the beginning, the first minutes of this truce. We see now nothing to suggest that there isn't anything but calm. So that is a good thing. The second sort of time baked into this deal is 4 p.m. local time, which is 9 a.m. Eastern Time. At some point after that time, the deal agrees that Hamas will organize for the release of the first 13 of the 50 hostages that it holds at present. So at some point after 4 p.m. And look, you know, let's be quite clear. Things could slip. Certainly, the truce was on sort of within minutes of the scheduled time. And that was 7 a.m. this morning, midnight Eastern Time. But this -- this 9 a.m. Eastern Time scheduled start for the hostage release is a sort of movable feast, to a certain extent. So let's be quite clear about that. There will be, agreed, 13 women and children released by Hamas into the hands of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent. There is a proof of concept for this. Two sets of hostages have been released in the past 48 days: an American lady and her 17-year-old daughter, and two elderly civilians -- Israeli civilians. So we know that there is a proof of concept. We know that this operation can work smoothly into the arms of the ICRC and then routed through Gaza. And as we understand it, whichever way is the easiest, and that will depend on where these hostages are, of course, through either the Egyptian border and then back into Israel to the South, or through possibly the Arretz (ph) or one of the borders, the -- the crossing in Israel. So that's how things are supposed to work. This is four days, 13 hostages on the first day. 50 by day 4. And if Hamas -- this goes smoothly and Hamas is willing to release another 10 per day, this truce will be extended by an additional day for every 10 hostages. That is where we stand today. This is the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since this conflict began. This has been a tough negotiation, but we are where we are. This is, everybody hopes, just the beginning, of course. CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward joining us from Shahida Hospital, children's hospital in Petah Tikva, where as I understand it, Clarissa, child hostages may arrive after their release. What are you seeing and hearing there?",

      "sentences": "So this is one of five designated hospitals, Becky, where, if everything goes smoothly -- and as you mentioned, there are a lot of moving parts to this. People don't want to get their hopes up too much, but this is the hospital where most of the children, provided they don't have very serious life-threatening injuries or any kind of medical condition that's very serious, will actually be reunited with their families.The first step, as you mentioned, the Red Cross will take possession of the hostages from Hamas. They will then be handed over to the IDF. The IDF will conduct a search first to make sure that they are who they are supposed to be, identify them. They will carry out a brief medical check to make sure what condition they are in. They will then allow them to have a video or voice call with family members. Now the IDF has been given pretty sort of comprehensive guidelines from the Israeli Ministry of Welfare, telling them basically how they should try to deal with these young hostages, many of whom have no idea what has happened to their family members. Obviously, they have experienced a real trauma. And so they issued these guidelines. I want to read to you one part of the guidelines that they've been given. They're told, \"Children will ask questions such as 'Where's Mom? Where's Daddy?' Soldiers should not answer these questions, even if they know the answers. Any questions should be answered along the lines of 'Sweetheart, I'm sorry, I don't know. My job is to bring you to Israel to a safe place where people you know will be waiting for you and will answer your questions.'\" They've also been told not to pick up the children without asking their permission. And after those first medical and identity checks, those children and women, those hostages will be flown to one of five sites. This, as you mentioned, the Schneider Medical Center for Children. We have been talking to some of the staff inside, Becky. And as you can imagine, they are trying not to get their hopes up too much, but they are incredibly excited. They are very nervous. They told us they have not been sleeping. And they are doing everything they can to ensure that they have the warmest, calmest, safest welcome possible back to their homes -- Becky.",

We don't have concrete reporting right now on what measures the IDF has taken to make sure people don't go from South to North. We are trying to lock that down, and we'll have that as soon as -- as soon as we have it reportable. But that's the IDF's perspective, is that the North remains an active war zone even with the pause in the fighting. Of course, nearly 80 percent of Gazans are displaced, so you can see how they would want a pause in the fighting, which certainly they recognize, even if they don't know specifics of the agreement. They would want to go back home and see if there is anything left of their home. But the IDF actively warning them not to do that right now. And it doesn't look like they'll be allowed to do that any time over the pause of this fighting, because both the IDF and Hamas have said, Look, there may be a pause here, but this is still an active war. And that war will resume when this agreement runs its course.",

Thirteen of them from Hamas into Israel. And that is set to begin just hours from now after more than six weeks in captivity with more to come in the days ahead, if this truce holds. Joining us now is former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. Ambassador, thank you very much for your time. You have been concerned, and you have said that you fear that Hamas may exploit this deal. Do you think it wasn't worth it? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: I can't say it's not worth it. It's not, you know, and/or. It's yes, I think the deal is worth it, but Hamas might exploit the deal. And keep in mind, that's why the Israeli families have been totally informed about who's on the list, because the list could change. Hamas is not just a terrorist organization that attacks us physically. It attacks us emotionally, as well. And it's -- it's playing with the emotions of the Israelis, particularly of these poor families. So to the last minute, until the hostages are actually released in the hands of their loved ones, no one is going to actually make a positive, positive statement about the -- about the identity. So it's -- we've got to be very, very careful. One thing they will exploit. They will exploit the ceasefire. Hamas will exploit the ceasefire to move terrorists from the South and the North into the South, where they're embedded among the refugees. They will use it to booby-trap further all of Gaza and move equipment around, and which will cost us, ultimately, in terms of our soldiers' lives. It was a terrible decision that the Israeli government had to make. It's hostage life versus soldier life. And -- and that's apart from the strategic difficulty of resuming the fighting once the ceasefire ends.",

You know, Hamas has been underground for six weeks now. And they -- they don't really come out and fight. Their terrorists will come out and fire an RPG or an anti-tank missile at our troops. Then they go back down into those 300 miles of tunnels underneath. So Hamas is in a difficult situation. The more Israel applies the pressure, I think Hamas will be more in a position to negotiate. And whether it's the form of of three, you know, Palestinian terrorist prisoners for one hostage, will that continue? More or less. Keep in mind, you know, when we released Gilad Shalit -- this is now a decade ago -- an Israeli soldier who was kept for five years in -- as a hostage in Gaza, Israel released over 1,000 terrorists --",

Right now, among those being released by -- by Israel are not people who actually committed murder. They may have been an accessory to murder, but they're not -- they're not actual murderers themselves. That's very important, because in Israeli society, you have to go to those families of those victims and say, Listen, the person who killed your loved one is getting out of jail. It's very difficult. But here's the bottom line. The bottom line is the end of the day, Hamas will not release all the prisoners, because the prisoners are their \"Get Out of Gaza Free\" card. And -- and they know that they release all the prisoners, all the hostages, Israel will flood the tunnels and basically kill Hamas. So there may be a deal out there, similar to that which the PLO reached with Israel in 1982 in Beirut. I was there. And the idea is PLO evacuated their armed ships to -- they went to Tunis. Made another deal out there down the line where Hamas will say, OK, here are the rest of the hostages. Let us get out of here. And we'll got to Algeria or something. And I think this -- I'm not saying -- I'm not representing the state of Israel, but I would think that Israel, the majority of Israelis would go for that deal.",
