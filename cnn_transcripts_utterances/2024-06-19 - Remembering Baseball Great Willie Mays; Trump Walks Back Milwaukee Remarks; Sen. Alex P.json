He - Willie Mays entered Major League Baseball in 1951, which was only four years - four years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. So, Mays was coming into a league and a country that in many ways still did not want to accept him. And there were places when they would go to Chicago where he couldn't stay in the same hotel as other members of the Giants because, of course, of his race.And to think what he did over the course of two decades in terms of not only the amazing play, you know, one of the greatest, if not the greatest. You had to watch everything he did. Five tool player. Whether he was running the bases and his cap falling off, tracking down that Vic Wertz flyball over the shoulder in the 1954 World Series, at bat, 660 homeruns. Everything he did was spectacular. And he was bringing America along with him, saying, whatever you thought of someone like me before, you are going to have a different view now. That was remarkable. And I have to tell you, as a girl growing up in Toledo, Ohio, I'd played baseball with the boys in our neighborhood. And it was at the end of Willie Mays' career. But when we were up at bat, Manu, we were there -- Mickey Mantle, maybe a little bit of Al Kaline because Detroit was so close, but also Willie Mays. So, he had such an impact on kids around the country who would never see him play in person but just wanted to emulate this amazing baseball player.",

So, he came to Americans, whether it was the radio, or, as you said, TV, he came to Americans on the - on the - you know, the great platform of Major League Baseball and this incredible passion we had for the game, often played during the day. You know, the World Series games, kids bringing transistor radios in to listen in study hall. Those were different days for baseball. And so I think we're very fortunate that way. And a very, very cool little statistic, or a little anecdote. One of his teachers at Alabama was Condoleezza Rice's mother.
