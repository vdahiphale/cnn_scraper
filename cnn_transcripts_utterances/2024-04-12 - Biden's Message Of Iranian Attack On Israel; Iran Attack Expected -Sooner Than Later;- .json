It would be seen as a second priority or even a nuisance value. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Data from UNRWA, the U.N.'s main agency in Gaza, shows that Israel has steadily allowed more aid into Gaza since opening up humanitarian crossings on October 21st, with the exception of February, when the number of aid trucks dropped to less than 100 per day, before slowly increasing again in March. But those numbers are all well below the 500-humanitarian aid and commercial trucks that entered Gaza every day before the war. The impact of insufficient aid has been obvious for months. It is marked all over the emaciated face of little Leila Junaid (ph). Barely three months old, she is among the 30 percent of children in Northern Gaza who are suffering from acute malnutrition and who desperately need more aid now. (END VIDEO CLIP) DIAMOND (on camera):  And while we've started to see Israel follow through on some of the commitments it made to the United States about allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, some other steps like the opening of the port of Ashdod have yet to happen. And also, Israel's commitments in terms of better coordination with those humanitarian groups to deconflict between those aid operations and military operations, a lot of that still remains to be seen to what extent Israel will follow through and to what extent it will actually improve the situation in Gaza.

You know, if you look at kind of the big picture ofthis election, Donald Trump right now has a very large lead over President Joe Biden over who can best handle the economy. Biden can probably close that gap somewhat, but he's not likely to eliminate it, Julia, by election day, which means that ultimately, he has to convince some voters who think that Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway on other grounds. And abortion rights and democracy, the kind of complex of issues around rights and values and democracy clearly is his best opportunity to do that. And if you look at some of these swing states, what we saw in 2022 in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Arizona, was that there was a clear majority of voters who want to keep abortion legal in that state.

His lawyer said he was planning to have that anyway. You mentioned 37 pages. You know, a number of very interesting parts of that. As you mentioned, he was allegedly impersonating Shohei Ohtani with bank officials. Also, some fascinating exchanges on text between the interpreter and the bookie. In one, the bookmaker -- and this was last fall, clearly when he was worried about getting paid. The bookie texted the interpreter and said, I am in Newport Beach right now. I am watching Shohei Ohtani walking his dog. And if you don't get in touch with me, I'm going to go up and speak to Shohei Ohtani and ask him for a better contact number for you. There was another one from March 20th when all this was sort of breaking in which the bookie asks the interpreter, obviously, you didn't steal from him. And the reply from the interpreter is, well, technically I did steal from him. It's all over for me. Meanwhile, Shohei Ohtani is playing very, very well at baseball. He has actually setting some career records for himself. The Dodgers are doing really well. So, clearly, he has not been troubled by this. And the other thing that's clear in that 37-page complaint is that Ohtani really had no idea what was going on here. But the sums of money are staggering. So, apparently, over about a two-year period, this guy, Ippei Mizuhara, won $140 million betting on sports. He lost $180 million betting on sports. So, he was in a $40 million hole. Now, right now, we're told that he stole $16 million from Shohei Ohtani. Unclear where the other 24 million is. But anyway, he's going to be back in court in a couple of weeks.

The world waiting to see how Iran retaliates against Israelfollowing that attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus last week. U.S. President Joe Biden telling reporters Friday he expects an attack happening, \"Sooner than later.\" For months, there have been fears that an attack by Iran or one of its proxies like Hezbollah could end violence already heightened by the war in Gaza. And just hours ago Hezbollah militants in Lebanon fired dozens of rockets toward Israel. Now, for more we're joined by Alex Vatanka. He's director of the Middle East Institute's Iran program. Alex, great to have you on the show. I think Iran has telegraphed that they feel like some form of retaliation or response is required. But the challenge is finding an option here that doesn't create some kind of trigger for a wider conflict in the region, something that Iran has spent decades trying to avoid. Is there any reason to suggest that Iran has changed their stance in that regard or they still want to avoid that?",

Because if you fight these Israelis directly head on, you are going to eventually risk to have to fight the Americans, which the Islamic Republic has no desire to do because it kind of knows the outcome of such a conflict, and it would risk the survival of the Islamic Republic. And the other thing that has happened in recent months after the attack by Hamas on the State of Israel and the Israeli intervention in Gaza is that the Iranians are reading this situation in the following way. That time is on their side. Israel is undermining itself. That public opinion in the region, perhaps internationally, is turning against Israel. So, why risk it? Why do anything radical like regional war when time is on their side? Having said all that, the attack on 1st of April under -- the embassy in Damascus was very different.
