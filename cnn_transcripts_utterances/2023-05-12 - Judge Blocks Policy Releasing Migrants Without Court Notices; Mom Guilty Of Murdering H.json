Now, city officials just wrapped a press conference about an hour or so ago and they said that they have decommissioned a school where they have 150 migrants that are being sheltered, but they have another school that they have ready to go. They could have more than a thousand shelter beds available and they don't need them right now.They also have a migrant center that they could open. They're not needing those resources right now. The point that they're trying to make is that they are ready for whatever is happening on the ground. Now, the best way for me to explain this to you is visually. And I want you to see these pictures because the video was taken yesterday. That video was taken yesterday and it's of the area where I am right now. It's the area where migrants gather and border patrol agents pick them up, they transport them to processing facilities. So that video from yesterday, you can see that there's a very large group and I want you to take a look at drone video that is live right now and you'll be able to see the difference. There are - if - and I don't have a live picture of this. So I can't see it myself. I can't tell you exactly what you're looking at. But I know that at last check there were very few migrants there, perhaps one or two family units, but that was it. Now, that is the picture that we're seeing right now. Now, from that drone, I also want you to look a little closer. You might be able to see the concertina wire that's right by the Rio Grande. Now, the reason why I point that out is because there are gaps in that concertina wire. Now, I did an overnight embed with the Texas National Guard and learned from the commander as they were deploying that concertina wire that they left gaps, not for migrants to come into the country, but because of the lifting of Title 42. As you know, Boris, it means that Title 8 is now being used to process these migrants. It has legal consequences. And the message from the Texas National Guard that they were going to be telling migrants is there's a way out. Boris?",

This is a case that the prosecutors describe - that's about power, greed and money. And quite simply, this was all about Lori Vallow's manipulation to receive money. Apparently, she was angry because her ex-husband had changed her as the beneficiary on an insurance policy that they had. They changed - he changed her name to his sister's name and I guess she vowed for that to never happen again. So she kills her children to collect Social Security payments. At least that's the argument that the prosecutors made and these juries accept - this jury accept it in finding her guilty on all four counts. [15:15:02] KEILAR: Yes.

Today, we have new showing what it's like to be on the front lines there for Ukraine. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Ukraine. And Nick, we've seen an uptick in a whole range of activity in recent days.

It's also fair to say, I think, over the past couple of weeks, we've noticed and even heard from pro-Russian officials in occupied areas and even Ukrainian officials themselves of multiple things which would potentially constitute part of the shaping operations.The strikes on Luhansk today extraordinary in their size and their depth inside occupied areas, seeming to hit factories in one case. That is certainly an example of what shaping operations do, target key parts of infrastructure, key parts of supply distribution. We've also been seeing there over the past weeks' fuel supplies, infrastructure being hit quite clearly as well, command hubs as well. So a real sense over the past weeks that we've been beginning to watch this build, perhaps going up a notch, though, in tempo over the last 48 hours. It's possibly fair to say the pressure around Bakhmut particularly important. It's really inflamed the extraordinary disunity amongst Russian ranks between the Wagner mercenary group headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin. He's been ranting, frankly, furiously at the top brass of Russia over the past week. But that seems to translate it today into a loss of territory. He said that five square kilometers outside of Bakhmut were lost to the Ukrainian military. That was essentially backed up by a Russian ministry of defense statement and by the Ukrainian military too. So, yes, what we're seeing ahead of this counteroffensive, which Ukraine's president's clear hasn't begun yet, a rise in the shaping operations, these targeted strikes over weeks, that's fair to say.
