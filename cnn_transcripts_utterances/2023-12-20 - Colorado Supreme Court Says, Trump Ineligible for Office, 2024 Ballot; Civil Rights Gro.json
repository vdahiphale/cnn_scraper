His campaign, of course, though, is calling it un-American, as you heard there in Lucy's report.But, really, what we feel is essentially the same playbook that we've seen throughout this year. Even his Republican rivals, from Chris Christie, to Nikki Haley, to Ron DeSantis, essentially are siding with Donald Trump. They're saying that the judges in courts should not weigh in on this. So, what this reminds me of virtually exactly are the first indictments we saw earlier this year, the Alvin Bragg case in Manhattan, and then it is followed throughout the year. So, very, very similar feeling to the Republican wagons are being a circle around the former president, even from some of his rivals. So, as we sit here in Iowa some 26 days before the voting begins in this presidential campaign, Donald Trump seems stronger than ever, at least for now.

Section 3 tells us no person shall hold any office who shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion. Makes sense, fairly straightforward.But it gets a little more complicated when we get to the question of how does this work? If we jump ahead to Section 5 of the same 14th Amendment, it tells us that Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article. Congress here means the federal United States Congress. They can pass laws to enforce this, but they haven't done so in 150 years, which leaves us in a little bit of uncertainty. Nonetheless, the Colorado State Court has a state law proceeding under Colorado law that they can use in some circumstances, not specific to insurrection, on election questions.",

This was a four to three ruling, four in the majority. Their ruling was Donald Trump engaged in overt, voluntary and direct participation in the insurrection. And, yes, president does count as an official. Therefore, the majority in the Colorado Supreme Court said, he's out, he's off the ballot.The dissent here, I think, is also really interesting. Again, this was a four to three ruling. I think this is a really important quote from the dissent. One of the justices wrote, even if we're convinced that a candidate committed horrible acts in the past, dare I say, engaged in insurrection, there must be procedural due process before we can declare that individual disqualified from holding public office. And it's important to get sort of the landscape here to understand why the Colorado decision that we saw yesterday is an outlier. If we look at the entire United States, there are a lot of these challenges. Colorado now stands alone. It's the only state that's thrown Donald Trump off the ballot. Six other states have rejected outright this type of challenge, and then in a dozen or so other states, colored yellow here, the plaintiffs, the people who've sued, have pulled back, withdrawn their lawsuit.

If, and it appears now to be when Donald Trump goes to the Supreme Court, it's all on hold until they decide. So, at the moment, nothing is final. The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly going to take this up. And I think the crux of the focus here is going to be, do we know the process was a proper process followed? I don't think the Supreme Court's actually going to get into the question of did he engage in insurrection or not? I think they're going to be focused on due process.",

There are grand juries who have studied this exact question, and they've rejected it. And so to then go around the country and have a whole bunch of state courts, state Supreme Courts, come to their own independent conclusions, that's something where you're going to have a significant split of inconsistent verdicts. You're going to have some states that say, oh, he's disqualified, and so therefore, he's not on the bout. Some that say, oh, no, this was not an insurrection.And if you read the Colorado Supreme Court decision, they're saying that he is ineligible to be president. And let's say that this decision stands, but the other 49 states go the other way. And let's say he's elected, even though he isn't on the ballot in Colorado. Does this decision then empower the Colorado governor to say, well, he's an illegitimate president and so the federal government has no power over the state of Colorado? It's a problem.

January 6th case, I think that that one is already well on its way because of the Supreme Court, not only the Supreme Court potentially taking up the interlocutory issue, but also examining the applicability of the obstruction charge related to the January 6th case. Certainly, the Mar-Lago case, that one is going to get pushed out. You got to remember, most criminal cases in the federal court, they take over two years to get to trial. The idea of trying to jam them all into an election season is something that is in and of itself unprecedented, and trying to jam multiple in is really a very unique circumstance. So, I think that, really, what you're going to see is all of these aspects of the legal team is they're going to try and push things out past November. The challenge is going to be, if they come straight out and say it, as they have in the past, of let's adjourn this thing for over a year because we want to wait till after the election, that's going to get rejected. But if you instead go to the judges and you say, look, these are all the things that are going on, this is what our bandwidth is, this is how many documents they just gave us, we're not able to be prepared for trial and the defendants rights are going to be substantively impaired by forcing them to go to trial before he's ready, that's something the judges will buy and they'll push it out a piece at a time.
