      "sentences": "Well, welcome to \"First Move\". This Thursday and a reminder of today's top stories including what you were justhearing the Minsk mystery the President of Belarus telling CNN, the Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is in Russia, not Belarus, raising all sorts of questions about the Wagner Group's future and the deal that ended Prigozhin's rebellion. And a Russian -- was Prigozhin ever in Minsk at all, Russia also allegedly raiding Prigozhin's home and allegedly finding wings, weapons and more. And that's include China's challenge U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arriving in Beijing for talks, paving the way I think everyone hopes for a future President Xi President Biden's Summit. But serious trade issues divide the economic superpowers and expectations once again for the trip a relatively low. And a Thread to mega day for Meta has Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter like challenger debuts some 10 million users have apparently already signed up Thread's butting heads with Elon Musk, but is it a social media platform contender or a pretender we'll be discussing. And from Threads to reds, oh dear U.S. Futures falling and European markets losing more than 1.5 percent across the board there for the majors. As you can see, after a major U.S. jobs jolt, employers added almost half a million jobs last month. That's according to ADP that should be great news. It was more than double expectations but of course, the numbers now fueling fears of a further rate hike by the Federal Reserve later this month. And tied to that we also saw an immediate jump in bond yields benchmark U.S. 10 year yields shooting about 4 percent for the first time since March. The big question now is will Friday's U.S. jobs report confirm this apparent strength. Though the Federal Reserve has a big challenge, it's still on their hands. OK, let's move on now to a world where artificial intelligence can help us tackle some of the most pressing humanitarian challenges. That's the vision behind the AI for Good Global Summit currently being held in Geneva. It brings together AI experts and 40 agencies from the United Nations including the World Food Programme, to showcase just how technologies like AI can help and already are? Already in use is SKAI a tool that assesses damaged needs and resources after a disaster and can coordinate a swift response. And the mission for the World Food Programme is clear and critical with 345 million people facing high levels of food insecurity this year. Just to give you a sense, that's more than twice as many as back in 2020. Now joining us to discuss is Bernhard Kowatsch. He's Head of the Innovation Accelerator at the World Food Programme. Great to have you on the show Bernard! Let's just start by discussing what the innovation accelerator is and does?",

Like, you can actually choose where your money goes, you can say, like, I want to support, like, providing emergency aid in Ukraine, or like, support women's empowerment in some way like, so there's different things you can do. As Innovation Accelerator, we also raise our own funds. So like, we are relying on governments, with the German government, the U.S. government, but also like large corporates like Google, or the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that support us, including individuals that, you know, they say we believe that innovation is the way to help people in need, and like using this private sector investment logic to also then move to the next level of impact.",

What SKAI does, it uses satellite images and AI to detect buildings and damage assessments. And we can do this within 48 hours now instead of previously this would have taken two to three weeks of people manually looking at satellite images. Now, imagine the impact that this could have that, you know, now we have with much greater precision. Like two weeks earlier, we have data that informs us, you know, where do we need to bring the food? Where will we find more people who are actually suffering from hunger in immediate needs? And like, so this is something that I'm really, really excited about? Because it just shows the power of artificial intelligence, not only because, yes, it's faster.

And the team is actually working on now forecasting food security, including other indicators that we're seeing, like in terms of drought and other things. But you know, even in our portfolio for the Innovation Accelerator, we have a startup called ignition, they are actually offering the same precision agriculture information that large scale farms in the U.S. might have to smallholder farmers in developing countries. And they already have 2.6 million customers, smaller farmers in developing countries that now can improve the yield up to 20 percent purely because of AI satellite images in making the knowledge more accessible and democratize the access to this kind of knowledge.",

But also like, how do you actually bring in community groups, governments, like people who are currently not having access, or maybe not even having access to internet right now, or electricity, or running water? I think this is an element of when you're starting to look into this, how to leave no one behind in that.

Now, Meta today unspooling, a new social media app that Ed hopes can take on Twitter. Threads, already turning heads with some 10 million people signing up for the service in just the first few hours. But hey, that's still a far cry from Twitter's audience of around 300 million active users. Can Threads, thread the needle and one day match Musk? Here to have a go at answering that Sara Fischer joins me now. I'm great and I can't wait to hear your insight on this. The key difference between them is that we know Instagram already has what 2 billion active users and they've made it very easy to transfer between one and the other.

And there are so many similarities, I think in the use of it probablypurposefully to allow people to switch but I guess one of the questions I would ask is, the audiences are different. Those that use Instagram is different I think, from those that use Twitter and the kind of information that you get from Twitter. And Elon Musk have hinted at that on social media, when he tweeted out about the Threads launch and suggested that you know, he'd rather have, I think I've got it here. He said it's infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulging false happiness of hide the pain on Instagram. He has a point it's sort of a point about moderation, perhaps, and the differences there, but also the kind of use of this platform. Sara, what do you think?",

One is that when you converted your profile over from Instagram over into Threads, if you are already verified, you become verified, again on Threads. Now the difference is that with Twitter, the people who were commonly verified or people like journalists, public officials, people in government, municipalities on Instagram, the people who are verified are like artists, creators, and etcetera. And so they might have to tinker a little bit with that. But one huge advantage here, I'd say, Julia, is that when I imported my Threads account from Instagram, all of my privacy settings, all of my safety settings automatically switched over. Right now with Twitter, it's so hard to even be able to tell what are the rules, right, like, what's good to see what's not? What are the limits for what I can tweet, what's not because they're changing all day under Elon Musk, at least with this new app Threads? For the first time in a platform like that, I actually felt like I had some consistency. And that's what users have been craving under the Elon Musk regime, but they're just not getting it.",

The consistent thing has always been we're going to capture your attention and sell ads around it, that's always been the business model. And so that's going to be the business model for Threads, we're going to get a lot of user engagement, we're going to put ads in around it and Meta is very good at that copy paste strategy. When they imported stories from Snapchat years ago, they were very quick to input vertical video ads that you saw on Snapchat into Instagram and Facebook. And by the way, they did it so well that they were the ones that got ad agencies to really adopt the format, not Snapchat, which had invented it. And so I think that you're going to see a large advertising push out of Meta around this product. The only question, Julia, is can it get enough mass user adoption for Meta data think it's worth it and not sunset it. If you go to axios.com, this morning, I have a huge long chart of every single feature that they've ever created, whether it was a clone of the Cameo app or the neighbor's next door app. and a lot of times after like 20 months, they sunset the app because it doesn't have a user engagement. I will say when it comes to Threads. Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday that they had over 2 million people that have registered in fact, if you take a look at the conversions on the app, it looks like it's probably over 3 million right now. A lot of the apps that I highlighted that were sunsetted (ph), Julia. They only had a few 100,000.

But it's not just greenhouse gas emissions we're also removing the source of air pollution. A study from Stanford came out last week that says that the gas ovens and gas hot water heating systems and gas heating and air conditioning systems in American homes produce nitrogen dioxide, they produce methane, they produce benzene, they produce so much benzene that that cooking with this equipment in your home is actually worse than breathing in secondhand cigarette smoke. And so we educate customers and building owners about not only the impact for the planet, and the impact for saving money on their high fossil fuel, oil and gas bill costs that we pay on a monthly basis for energy. But we also educate families on the threat that burning fossil fuels in your home poses to the health and well-being of your children. These devices, these fossil fuel equipment, they leak benzene and nitrogen dioxide even when they're not on. And so when our children are sleeping, the Stanford studies are showing us that we're all breathing in this toxic pollution from burning fossil fuels in our home. So we explain all of that to our customers who own and operate buildings. Second, we've worked with Jeff Bezos and his philanthropy to build a digital model of 125 million buildings across America. The U.S. Department of Energy under President Biden and Jeff Bezos has funded our work to build a digital twin or a digital model of every building in America. And so we can use machine learning and statistics to analyze and understand the electrification and sustainability possibilities in each and every building across America.

So even if you have the owner of a building on board, and they've got loads of tenants, it's a logistical nightmare to make a lot of these changes. How much time does it take to convert a building and who finances it? Is it just a case of saying, look, this is going to pay dividends in 5 years, in 10 years, you just have to suck up the cost because at this point in time, particularly for building owners in big cities, spending any kind of money is a tough choice, even if it's for the good of your tenants.",
