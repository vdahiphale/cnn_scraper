Israeli forces remain both, quote, inside and in the vicinity of Gaza's largest hospital. Several Middle Eastern nations and humanitarian groups have questioned this operation as hundreds of patients, thousands of civilians are known to be sheltering in the hospital complex. There is this new video released by the IDF showing weapons they say were found inside the hospital during the raid, also promising more evidence of Hamas' presence will be coming.

They're finding is recommending to the Justice Department for further investigation. Remember, George Santos has already been indicted in a separate case by the Justice Department. He's pleaded not guilty to that. But this separate probe, House probe, threatens his future as a member of this body. Now, what this -- I'm going to read you some lines from this report that just came out. It's more than 50 pages. We're still digging through all the evidence. But the top lines are absolutely devastating for the New York Republican. It says, Representative Santos sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit. He blatantly stole from his campaign. He deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to his campaign, but were, in fact payments for his personal benefit, he reported fictitious loans to his political committees to induce donors and party committees to make further contributions to his campaign and then diverted more campaign money to himself as purported repayments of these fictitious loans. It goes on to say he used his connection to high-value donors and other political campaigns to obtain additional funds for himself through fraudulent or otherwise questionable business dealings. And it also adds, and he sustained all of this through a constant series of leans (ph) to his constituents, donors and staff, about his backgrounds and experience -- it says constant series of lies, I should say, of his constituents, donors and staff about his background and experience. Now, the House Ethics Committee chairman, Michael Guest, told me yesterday this would not recommend any course of action for the House to take. He said that members will have to make that decision themselves. But this will add significant pressure on those members who are on the fence about whether to expel George Santos from the House. That would require two-thirds majority to do that and we expect that vote to happen, probably when they come back from recess. They left town for Thanksgiving holiday. They're going to come back at the end of the month. Expect another vote at that point. It would be a two- thirds majority that would be required to kick him out of the House. There's already been an effort to kick him out. That failed because a lot of those members wanted to wait for this report. And if Santos is expelled from this chamber, he would just be the sixth member in American history to be expelled from the House, the first since 2002 when James Traficant was expelled from the chamber after being convicted. We'll see how members come down because he has not been convicted in a court of law. He has pleaded not guilty. He has not yet responded to this report but just came out. But, really, this bipartisan committee detailing really conduct that a lot of members will be very concerned about how they vote, that's going to be a question in the days ahead, Sara.",

Look, I mean, that is one of the things that the committee sometimes does, as it investigates how to proceed, whether to go ahead and refer things to the Department of Justice for further investigation.Remember, he has already been indicted. The question is going to be how much additional evidence has this panel uncovered that perhaps the Justice Department did not include in the indictment? We'll have to dig into that. And I had a chance yesterday to talk to some of these members, including the chairman of the Ethics Committee, who explained why it would not have an explicit recommendation for expulsion, as well as some of the members who are ready to kick George Santos out of the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL GUEST (R-MS):  If we were to make, the Ethics Committee were to make recommendations as to sanctions, it would have been a much longer process, carried out probably well into next year, maybe even until the end of next year. And so we are not going to make any recommendation to the House. That will be up to each individual member. REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX):  I think the people of his district need representation, and they're not getting that right now. Clearly, he has a lot of issues and he needs to go home and solve it. REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY):  I will take whatever comes my way the way it comes. I have no concerns, and I don't have any premeditated feelings on this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll see.But just we're just learning so much more about this report as we're digging through it, as our team is digging through it, I just want to read you one more line. It says, Representative Santos sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit. In the indictment from the Justice Department, it said that he allegedly took donor credit cards to try to essentially buy personal goods for himself. He has pleaded not guilty to that offense.

I was just listening to what Manu said and this is, you know, this, I think this will be enough for them to begin the expulsion process. I think members will look through this. You know, they don't have a trial date scheduled until next year. I believe it's September 2024. I think that outrageous a lot of members on the Hill. I think you'll see the New York delegation, the Republicans who tried to expel him recently, I think they'll come back and say, look, this isn't -- you know, there's enough here. He can have his day in court. But as a member of Congress, his tenure should end now. And I think, you know, just the allegations here are pretty blatant and that he did not cooperate at all. He was -- it says here, he was given an opportunity to, you know, speak to the committee or the investigative subcommittee, the special investigative subcommittee inside Ethics that does this, that they appoint members to do this, including two members who aren't on Ethics, and he didn't do it. And I think that's going to be enough to convince a lot of members. Yes, he had his chance. He didn't take advantage of it. We should take a look at expulsion now.",

We have been talking -- we've seen this horrific video from October 7th, but there are also horrible images coming out of Gaza, in particular the hospital there, the Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital complex there.Have you heard anything from doctors in Al-Shifa Hospital today? DR. OMAR ABDEL-MANNAN, FOUNDER, GAZA MEDIC VOICES:  Thank you, Sara, for having me on the program. So, we have been in constant communication with doctors, surgeons, nursing staff within many of the hospitals in Gaza since the 10th of October when we set up Gaza Medic Voices. What I can tell you is the last few days it has been extremely difficult to be in any communication with anyone in Al-Shifa Hospital. The last proper communication we had was yesterday morning. I haven't been able to contact anyone within the hospital since. And on Friday, before the Israeli Defense Forces started to attack and enter and storm Al-Shifa Hospital, we had messages that were desperate from doctors inside saying that there are snipers shooting at the windows. There are doctors and nurses that are being shot and they are concerned that all of them will perish as well as all the babies and all the children and all the patients in the intensive care units that are still left behind. There are still, as far as I know, 200 to 300 patients that were still inside Al-Shifa at the last count. What I can say is that you know these videos from the 7th of October are deplorable and horrific. As you said rightly, this does not excuse the loss of civilian and human life to the number of almost 12,000 people that have died in Gaza and disproportionate amounts of children are there being killed. We are seeing children that are losing limbs, that are losing their lives, that are losing their parents, that are losing the whole generation of their family, and many of them are being disfigured or being burnt with, you know, extremely toxic chemicals or toxic weapons that are being used in munitions. So, the situation there is frankly apocalyptic. And what we must not lose sight of is this is the Hall of Gaza. So, the Hall of Gaza is an open air concentration camp and it is being bombed indiscriminately. We are seeing loss of lives to a level that we have never encountered. The monthly average number of deaths of children in Gaza in the last four weeks is 4,000 children. The nearest conflict that had in the last 10 to 20 years that had numbers of children being killed was 200 children in four weeks. That was in Yemen and in Syria. So, we are talking about a magnitude of death and destruction that is beyond anything we have witnessed frankly since World War II, in my humble opinion.",
