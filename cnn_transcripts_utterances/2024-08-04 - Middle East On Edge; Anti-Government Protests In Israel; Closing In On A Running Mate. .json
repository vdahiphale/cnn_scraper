      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers watching Around the World. I'm Lynda Kinkade, and this is CNN Newsroom.Coming up, Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants and Lebanon exchange in new round of strikes, as the Middle East braces for a widening conflict in the region. Israel's government faces backlash from families of Hamas hostages. We'll speak with one of them. And who will Kamala Harris choose to join her on the U.S. Democratic ticket? The latest on the high stakes search for a running mate now in its final stretch. We begin in the Middle East, which is on edge amid fears it could be on the verge of a full scale conflict. Several hours ago, Israel said it had intercepted a barrage of 30 projectiles coming from Lebanon, but they didn't cause any damage or casualties. Hezbollah said it was responding to multiple Israeli strikes in Southern Lebanon earlier Saturday, reportedly going after Hezbollah targets. A Lebanese news agency says one teenager was killed and six civilians wounded. And as tensions grow, more countries are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon as soon as possible. The U.S and Britain did that Saturday, while Canada advised its citizens against traveling to Israel, Lebanon or the West Bank. And that's happening after Iran threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killing of Hamas political chief in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for that assassination. For more, we're joined by Nada Bashir, who comes to us live from London. Nada, let's start with how Iran may respond. We've already seen Hezbollah firing rockets into Northern Israel. But Iran certainly warning the worst is yet to come.",

Whether or not this is a direct response from Iran, as we saw, perhaps in April, where we saw Iran launching missiles and drones directly targeting Israeli territory or whether we might see a larger, more complex response, as put by one U.S. official, where we would see perhaps more coordination with other Iranian-backed proxies in the region.Now, of course, we have seen that continued exchange of fire by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon and the Israeli military carrying out strikes across the region parts of Southern Lebanon and, of course, Hezbollah, again, carrying out rocket attacks around Northern Israel. This has been ongoing since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. But tensions are certainly ratcheting up. There is a huge amount of concern, particularly from the international community that the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political, leader earlier this week in Tehran, has put the region on a knife's edge, that we could see a further escalation. And, of course, both Hamas and the Iranian regime have accused Israel of carrying out this assassination, though Israel has neither denied nor confirmed responsibility for Haniyeh's killing. But, again, this is a deeply tense moment for the region, real questions as to how far Iran will go, how far Iran's proxies may go. We've heard from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. They have vowed, in their words, blood, vengeance. They have said that a severe punishment of Israel is certain and that they are focusing on when and where this will be. But, again, this is definitive. There will be a response. And as you mentioned, we have been seeing members of the international community responding, already preparing for what could be a further escalation in the region, multiple nations now telling their citizens in Lebanon to evacuate as soon as possible, including the United States and the United Kingdom. And now, of course, we are seeing that the United States is bolstering its military preparedness in the region, moving warships and aircraft carriers into the region. This is perhaps the largest movement military movement by the United States that we've seen since the beginning of the war in Gaza. So, certainly a huge moment of concern for the region.",

This was a school, two schools rather, that the Gaza Civil Defense says had been sheltering civilians. This was an area known to be sheltering civilians, dozens more injured in those strikes. And according to Gaza's Civil Defense, following an initial strike on the schools, this was followed by three missiles or at least three missiles, so a double-tap attack by the Israeli military.We've seen the distressing video coming out from the aftermath of this attack. Again, bodies lining the area surrounding the school, so hugely distressing. The Israeli military has claimed that it was targeting terrorist infrastructure that they believe they were targeting what they have described as a Hamas command and control center. But, again, we've heard this rhetoric from the Israeli military before, particularly when it comes to areas known to be sheltering civilians. And, again, that is a significant civilian toll that we've seen in this attack. And then overnight, yet more strikes targeting an area near the Al-Aqsa Marty's Hospital, just outside the Al-Aqsa Marty's Hospital, actually, in Deir al Balah, the tents in the area where civilians had been sheltering on the courtyard. And as we've seen over the course of the war, many have flocked to schools and hospitals in the hopes that these will be safe zones, but, clearly, that is not the case. Gazan authorities say at least five people have been killed, and we've seen, again, dramatic video emerging of these tents engulfed in flames. The Israeli military has told CNN that they are currently looking into these reports.",

Nada Bashir in London, thanks very much.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is denying a report that he clashed with his top advisers over a possible deal with Hamas. Israel's Channel 12 says they pressed him to accept the latest hostage and ceasefire deal at a meeting Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu reportedly refused and angrily accused his team of not knowing how to negotiate. CNN couldn't independently corroborate the story. Mr. Netanyahu's office later said that the report had given a false impression to the public and that the prime minister agreed with the outline of the plan, but it's Hamas who is undermining it. Well, protesters across Israel rallied against Netanyahu and his government Saturday, calling for a hostage deal. Several cities saw demonstrators, including Tel Aviv, where organizers say tens of thousands of people came out to support the families off the hostages. Some of those family members joined the protests and issued a statement calling Netanyahu cruel and heartless. Now, to get some perspective from one person who has a personal stake in resolving the hostage situation, I would like to welcome Sharone Lifschitz. Her parents were kidnapped by Hamas. Her mother was later released, but her father is still being held by the militant group. Lifschitz joins us now from Tel Aviv. I appreciate you joining us today. Thanks so much for your time.",

LIFSCHITZI think that Haniyeh, I have no sympathy for him. He is the mastermind of October the 7th, but I don't see the point of killing him now, personally. I think it's a huge achievement for the people who carried it out, but we are desperate. We are in the last hour, it feels, off this round of negotiation. This must come to good.

Josh Shapiro is getting a lot of buzz, governor of Pennsylvania, probably the most critical swing state in this election. So, people focus on that, where they focus on picking up a key group that the V.P. might belong to, a demographic group, for instance.And that's not really how we find that running mates matter. The main consequence of choosing a running mate in terms of the election is to influence how voters think about you, the presidential candidate who picked them. Because, hey, you could have picked anyone, right? What does it tell me that Donald Trump, you pick J.D. Vance, or Kamala Harris, you pick Josh Shapiro or Andy Beshear or Mark Kelly or whoever it may be.

Remember, this is the person that's a heartbeat away. If something should happen to the person in the White House as president, whether that's death, could be temporarily as illness, could be resignation, impeachment, removal, any of those circumstances, this person who could take over. Even short of that, there's still someone giving critical advice in the White House, often referred to as the last person in the room on major decisions with the president.So, the American people expects one who is up to the job. And if that sounds obvious, you know, I don't know that it always is because people talk so much about just gaming the election, trying to pick off a state here, a bloc of voters there, and often they, they stretch things, so they start talking about people who really are not the most credible vice president. I would say, by the way, J.D. Vance holding his first political office now, he was only sworn in early last year as a senator, a year-and-a- half of service. I'm not sure the American people are seeing him or will see him as a credible V.P. six months from now. That's the first test that Kamala Harris has to pass.

These videos of J.D. Vance that we're seeing right now, they're not being, you know, unearthed from some surprising sources. These are things that were out there during the campaign. This is part of how J.D. Vance campaigned for office heading into the 2022 primary and then election in Ohio.So, they should have caught these things, had months to do it. Donald Trump knew early on the spring or late winter, early spring that he was going to be the nominee, and so they had time to prepare and go through this intensive vetting process. The Harris campaign doesn't have that luxury. They have an accelerated vetting process, you know, two weeks, if that, to find out everything they need to know about these potential V.P. candidates. And I can tell you what, things that don't come out during the vetting process. They're going to come out later. Things get discovered, especially as the other campaign, their opposition research teams, are trying to find out everything they can, whether those are public statements or private statements, these things are going to be found out. So, the Harris campaign has to find them out now. Hey, everybody has their weaknesses. Everybody has, you know, some kind of skeleton in the closet. They just need to be able to price those things in before the selection say, could we live with it if that came out? If so, fine, but, you know, they can't miss anything.",

And so they're really trying to work on what works with the crowd, what is the energy in the room when he delivers those types of attacks, and we saw that on Saturday night. Now, I will note Donald Trump did argue that he found Harris' speech and rally earlier in the week also in Atlanta, Georgia, not even just in the same city, but at the exact same venue, he criticized that she had celebrity performers, like Megan Thee Stallion perform. He said that he thought that was phony. That is a line I can tell you from my conversations with Trump's team that he is planning to use in the coming weeks in an effort to frame her. He also tried to tie her to his former political opponent, Hillary Clinton. He said he would never forget that Clinton also had celebrity entertainers, name dropping Bruce Springsteen and saying that he has a bad trait. He only likes people who like him. Now, another thing I want to point out that I found interesting was that he repeatedly went after Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, as well as the state's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. Remember, they were both key to trying to deny reports of fraud during the 2020 election. Trump repeatedly called them disloyal. And I also will note that Kemp, meanwhile, even though he said he wasn't supporting Donald Trump in the primary, he did ultimately say he would support him in November.

This on my head is measuring brain blood flow. Here is measuring skin temperature on my leg. They're going to be looking at cognitive functions, like how is my decision-making affected by the heat?
