You are talking more than a dozen states likely to see impacts from this system.This is a look at Cleveland. Now, sunrise should be happening just a few moments from now, but we've got a snow squall moving through. So, you can see that visibility is very limited. You can see even a few white caps right there on Lake Erie. Now, this is not from the main system. This is actually still from lake effect snow that is continuing across portions of the Great Lakes region. But the next system that's going to be coming into play, that's the one where we're really concerned about it. It is going to present a huge swath of concerns over the next 48 to 72 hours. You are talking very difficult travel in some of these areas, and likely some widespread power outages, especially in the orange red and even the purple color there, indicating that extreme potential there. Now, when we talk about snow, look at this wide swath here. This is what we are talking about how many states being impacted. You have got a very wide swath of at least about four to six inches. But all of this pink area here, you are talking at least a foot of snow could end up coming down. Now, you may say, OK, well, some of the southern areas here, that's not too bad, there is only a couple inches there. But what you have to understand is, on the southern flank of this system, here is also an ice component. So, you're going to have a layer of ice come down first, and then you're likely going to have snow on top of it, which makes it even more difficult to see if you are out driving on the roads, to not know how thick that snow could be. Some of these areas, you're talking a quarter to even up to a half of an inch of ice, thick on those roadways, on those bridges and overpasses that you'd have to deal with. Here is a look at the low. It really starts to take place -- or take shape and develop later on today, by late or by very early into the day Sunday. We're really starting to see some of those impacts over the central U.S. by late Sunday, now spreading into the Ohio Valley, portions of the Midwest. And then, once we really get into Monday, that's when things really start to take place across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and even spreading into the northeast. It finally does push out over the water. But even then, by Monday evening, the bulk of the system may be offshore, but you still have some of those lingering snow showers across the Mid-Atlantic that could last even into very early Tuesday. So, not quite over yet. We also have the southern component to this system, most areas just getting rain, but also the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms. You are talking damaging winds, yes, even the potential for a few tornadoes, especially around areas of northern Louisiana, Western Mississippi and southeastern portions of Arkansas. So, again, this is a huge storm with a lot of different elements here. So again, the snow is really going to be the focus on the top tier. In between, you are going to have that wintry mix, where it's part snow, part ice, even some freezing rain and sleet, and then the severe thunderstorms. Guys, that are the component along the southeastern side. So, a lot of impacts for a lot of people in the coming days.",

Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a warning that alcohol consumption can increase our risk of cancer, and Dr Murthy called for new warning labels on alcoholic beverages. DR.
