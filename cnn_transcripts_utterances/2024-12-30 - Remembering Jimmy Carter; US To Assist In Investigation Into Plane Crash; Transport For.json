Ahead on CNN Newsroom, the world is morning and honoring former President Jimmy Carter who has died at 100 years old. He served just one term in the White House, but he redefined what the post-presidency life could actually be. Plus, my guest served as deputy cabinet secretary to President Jimmy Carter and calls his global legacy moral clarity.And desperate for news about their loved ones, some relatives of the 179 people killed in Sunday's South Korea plane crashed are camping out in the airport where it happened. His time in the White House was short, but the impact he made both during and after his presidency is one that will live on for generations to come. The death of former US President Jimmy Carter at the age of 100 is being mourned worldwide today. Carter was surrounded by family when he passed away Sunday at his home in Georgia. The former peanut farmer became the 39th president of the United States, winning the 1976 election over Gerald Ford. He lost a reelection bid four years later, but embarks on a post-presidency really dedicated to serving others, including but certainly not limited to his volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity. The White House says an official state funeral will be held in Washington on January 9, a national day of mourning. US President Joe Biden honored his longtime friend, calling him a statesman and a humanitarian. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing and homeless for the homeless with his own hands.

But 1994 was his big year of high profile peacemaking. In September, he went to Haiti. Raoul Cedras, the Caribbean nation's unpopular leader, was holed up in Port-au-Prince. Carter convinced him to step down, quite literally, as the US 82nd Airborne troops were inbound aboard Black Hawk helicopters ready to remove Cedras by force. Carter won the day, saved lives. The US troops landed as de facto peacekeepers.And later that year, Carter went to the dark heart of Bosnia's violent ethnic civil war, met the nationalist Serbs in their mountain stronghold parley tried to stop their bloody, murderous siege and shelling of the capital, Sarajevo, bring an end to the killing that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives during horrific ethnic cleansing. Success came slowly, in steps, Carter helped initiate a short Christmas ceasefire, and by his presence push the horrific conflict toward greater international attention.",

Here's the photograph, you know. And this is something that really hit Begin hard. This is going to affect generations to come if they could reach some sort of agreement.

The World Health Organization says that Northern Gaza's last remaining major hospital is now out of service after Israeli forces raided the facility and forced everyone to evacuate, including critically ill patients.The hospital's director was detained. Israel says Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia was being used as a Hamas command and control center, but did not provide evidence to support that claim. A hardline critic of the West has been sworn in as president of Georgia after disputed parliamentary election. Mikheil Kavelashvili was the only candidate in the running after opposition parties boycotted the process to elect a president, saying that it was illegitimate. The far right former lawmaker and ex-professional football player was chosen by parliament instead of the popular vote. His party has suspended EU secession talks, triggering weeks of protests. The president of Azerbaijan is accusing Russia of accidentally causing the plane crash that killed 38 people in Kazakhstan last week, but then covering it up. The country leader told state media \"no one can deny Russia shot down the plane,\" adding, \"we are not saying that this was done intentionally.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for what he called a tragic incident that he stopped short of taking responsibility. And South Korea is mourning a deadly plane crash that killed 179 people on Sunday. Flags are at half staff as the country grieves for the victims of the Jeju Air crash. Officials say the pilot reported a bird strike minutes before the deadly landing. South Korea's acting president now ordering an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations systems. A team of US federal investigators will assist in the investigation. CNN's Mike Valerio reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Earlier, US President Joe Biden unveiled nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance to Kyiv, and what the White House says in an attempt to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position as Russia steps up its attacks.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said the US has made available $3.4 billion as well in direct budget support. It comes as Donald Trump, who has been a vocal critic of US aid to Ukraine, is set to take power in just a matter of weeks. CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us live now from the Pentagon. So, Natasha, of course, I was going to say you can't really ignore the timing of all of this. When Donald Trump steps into the Oval Office on January 20, we don't know what exactly he's going to do when it comes to Ukraine. So just in terms of how much this additional age -- aid rather can actually impact the battlefield and Ukraine's position, albeit temporarily, what can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, yes. I mean, look, President Biden has about three weeks left in office and the administration is under no illusions about just how much or how little the next administration is going to be providing to Ukraine, given that President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants this war to end really within the first few months, if not sooner of his administration.And so, it remains to be seen whether the administration under Trump is going to continue to surge this kind of assistance to the Ukrainians. But in terms of what this administration is trying to send as quickly as possible now to Ukraine, it involves essentially drawing everything possible from the administration, from the Defense Department stockpiles that they can actually take, which is available, and sending it to Ukraine on such an expedited timeline. Whether or not that makes a real difference in Ukraine's battlefield situation remains to be seen, because the administration has been surging equipment to the Ukrainians over the last several months. Yes, they are in a final sprint now, but still we are seeing the Ukrainians lose a significant amount of territory in the Kursk Region that they took back in August. And it remains unclear at this point whether they have enough manpower to actually sustain offensives against the Russians. And so that is the big question at this point. So while the administration is trying to use up in its waning days all of this money that Congress had appropriated, had given to the administration earlier this year back in April, you know, they are still going to run short. And that is because they don't have enough equipment in those stockpiles to actually send to Ukraine immediately in terms of the munitions that it needs, the tanks, the rocket systems, all of this that would be coming from, you know, US stockpiles needs to also be replenished at the same time. And so, they're doing as much as they can, as quickly as they can but still, you know, ultimately this is going to come down to what the next administration decides to do over the next year, four years of their of the Trump administration. And it's completely unclear at this point, including to the Ukrainians, whether or not they're going to continue that support, Zain.",
