We know that the AFL-CIO said that they back him. And it's the earliest time that they have backed a presidential candidate in their history.

And a similar thing happened between a Chinese jet and U.S. spy plane in recent weeks.There is at this point in time no hotline between the U.S. military and the Chinese military. The Chinese stopped taking our calls back when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. So, in the immediate moments the Pentagon wants that line back open. The concern is that one of these minor incidents could lead to the kind of -- could spark the kind of conflict that could lead to some all-out armed confrontation. Now, I know that sounds extreme, but things can snowball from a direct confrontation. When it comes to the wider strategic side of the relationship, basically, Blinken wants to start getting -- bring down the temperature, bring China away from this forming relationship with Russia, Iran, this kind of block of countries that it feels like China is forming within the U.N., vying for African and Latin American countries to side with them as opposed to United States and the West. We see that with things like Ukraine.

Los Angeles country club finally starting to play like a U.S. Open after some records start to the tournament.Shot of the day, you have to check this out. From last year's runner up in world number one, Scottie Scheffler. He has a finance degree from the University of Texas. He's six back of the lead on the 17th, but then from 197 yards out, money. Scheffler getting the eagle. And he followed that up with a birdie on 18. And all of a sudden, the 2021 Masters Champ is just three back headed into today's final round. There is a tie for the lead currently. Southern California kid, Ricky Fowler, seeking his first-ever major title. He set the two-day scoring record. And then on the 13th yesterday, he sank a 69 foot putt for birdie, putting him at 11 under. But he did bogey the 18th, finishing at 10 under, and even far on the day. And that left the door open for 29-year-old Wyndham Clark, seeking his first major as well. The club spin right here on 18. You know it's a good shot when you do that. His motto is play big. His words from his late mom, Lisa, who passed from breast cancer 10 years ago. She said play for something bigger than yourself to inspire someone who's watching. We've putt there for birdie on the 18, taking some momentum in today's final round. Six career major appearances for Wyndham. He's never finished better than 75th. That's about to change. Keep an eye on him and on Rory McIlroy, just one shot back as he tries to snag his first major in almost a decade. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RORY MCILROY, FOUR-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: It's been such a long time since I've done it. I'm going out there to try to execute a game plan. And I feel like over the last three days, I've executed that game plan really, really well. I just need to do that for one more day.
