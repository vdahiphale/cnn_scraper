He says that the federal law enforcement officials are offering assistance to state and local authorities. But what we are also hearing from President Biden is once again, a call to action. A call to enact the kind of common-sense gun reforms that President Biden believes are necessary. And he's also making clear who he believes is responsible for the inaction on those efforts in Washington. Saying in a statement, quote: Too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables. Republican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug. Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough. Once again, I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, enacting universal background checks, requiring safe storage, ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe. And President Biden in this statement, also says that he believes the country has made some progress in addressing the issue, pointing to his signing of that bipartisan Safer Communities Act that is meant to incentivize more red flag law in the country and mental health resources. But he also makes clear that he believes that despite the nearly 2 dozen executive actions he has signed on this issue, he believes he's now reached the limit of his executive authorities. And he says that the burden now rests with Congress. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
