Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. is now able to say that they have seen thousands of North Korean troops go from North Korea to Russia. The quick question is, of course, what are they there to do? The U.S. has said that Russia is suffering 1,200 casualties in Ukraine each day. That includes both killed and wounded. And that speaks to the need that Russia has for more troops. Now the question is, are these North Korean troops going to Russia to get training to fight in Ukraine? Well, that would mean that the largest land war in Europe now involves the Far East as well. And that's specifically what the U.S. is looking for. Here is Austin earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [13:35:00] LLOYD AUSTIN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: If the co-belligerent's intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is very, very serious issue. And it will have impacts not only on -- in Europe, it will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In other words, what is North Korea getting in exchange for sending its own troops to Russia, perhaps, to fight on behalf of Russia? And that's a key question here. The answer may be that North Korea is looking to develop its own nuclear and satellite capabilities. And those are two areas where Russia could certainly help them.

And they could then potentially use that in a possible future conflict with South Korea. So the South Koreans are right to be concerned.

That's according to a senior administration official.Does that in itself signal anything to you that this is different than just special training? LEIGHTON: Yes, absolutely. Because the volume indicates that there's a degree of intent there. And when you have so many different French troops, if there are literally thousands going over -- the Ukrainians had previously reported somewhere around 6,000 initially going to the front from the North Korean side. That would indicate that they are fulfilling at least a brigade-sized unit obligation. And that's a pretty substantial number when it comes to ground warfare. And especially given the numbers that we're dealing with, with Russian troops Ukrainian troops right now, either having a significant impact on what could potentially be going on in this war. It could potentially mean that the Russians are trying to get out of the war of attrition that they're currently fighting with the Ukrainians.

We could then potentially see Ukrainian forces or other forces like that coming into the Ukrainian battle space.

Now, McDonald's is saying that they have removed those ingredients from stores and infected -- in affected states. And they are trying to reassure folks that it's safe to eat at McDonald's. Here's what their U.S. president said this morning.

If there has been contaminated product within our supply chain, it's very likely worked itself through that supply chain already.
