Here are some of the top stories we're following today.Right now, search and rescue efforts are underway in Tibet following a powerful earthquake that killed at least 95 people. That's according to Chinese state media. Authorities say the shaking could be felt as far away as Nepal and northern India. The U.S. has now transferred 11 Yemeni detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Oman. One human rights organization said at least one of them was never charged with a crime and has been in custody for more than 20 years. 15 detainees remain at the Gitmo detention facility, with three eligible for transfer. Now take a look at this rare glimpse of the most vibrant natural phenomena. NASA astronaut Don Pettit captured the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, as the International Space Station orbited over eastern Canada on Sunday. He says it felt like, quote, we've been shrunk down to a miniature dimension and inserted into a neon sign.",

O'SULLIVAN: That's what got him arrested, basically? J. REFFITT: More or less, yeah. O'SULLIVAN: What effect has that had on your family? J. REFFITT: It's destroyed it. O'SULLIVAN: Was there a moment where you thought I know my dad has done all this stuff, but I don't want to report him? J. REFFITT: Yeah, I still feel horrible. Of course. Like, I, I can't get over it, but I don't regret it. O'SULLIVAN: When was the last time you spoke to your dad? J. REFFITT: Five months ago, it was the first time I talked to him and it was just a crying fest for the first 10 minutes, and that was great. And then, I brought up the fact that I'm worried about him getting out and he was almost puzzled, you know, like he was confused as to why I thought that. O'SULLIVAN: Are you overreacting? J. REFFITT: No, I get death threats daily, hourly at this point. NICOLE REFFITT, JACKSON REFFITT'S MOTHER: Unbeknownst to us, it was our 18-year-old son who turned his dad into the FBI.",

That's incompatible with Catholic teaching. So already being quite clear that he is going to speak out. It's also interesting that Cardinal McElroy was chosen. Cardinal McElroy is very much in line with Pope Francis. Not all leaders of the U.S. Catholic Church support Pope Francis. Some of them also quite sympathetic to Trump, whereas Cardinal McElroy is someone very much in line with the Pope. I also expect Cardinal McElroy not just to speak out but also to try and bring people together. He is a learned man. He has a doctorate in political science from Stanford University. He's an historian. So I expect him to try and deal with some of the ideological divides that are in the U.S. political culture.
