At least two videos posted online show the apparent beheading of still alive Ukrainian soldiers. CNN has made an editorial decision not to air those videos because they're simply too graphic. But a warning, you're about to see still images from the scene. If children are watching right now, it would be best if they leave the room. These images again show just still shots but many will find them disturbing. They were taken from video posted on a pro Russian social media channel last week and is now at the center of yet another war crimes investigation by Ukrainian authorities. It appears to show the bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed military vehicle. On the video, one person is heard laughing then saying in Russian, someone came up to the soldiers and cut off their heads. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described whoever could do this is beast. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This video shows Russia as it is. What kind of creatures are they? They don't care about a human being, a son, a brother, a husband, someone's child.

I think it's clear that there is a systemic process here that's ordering these rapes and these murders, and the torture and the kidnapping of children. I think we need to throw that in there.

Joe Biden arrived in the Republic of Ireland and was greeted by cheering crowds in County Louth, birthplace of his great grandfather.In the coming day, President Biden will meet with the Irish president, no relation, and the prime minister also have no relation and address parliament. In Belfast, a bilat between the U.S. president and British prime minister was downgraded to more of a by latte (PH). Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak chatted over a cup of tea. Both call for Northern Ireland's main political party is to end the political dysfunction, which has gripped the province for a year now. The Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended since February last year, with one of the main political parties refusing to enter a mandated power sharing arrangement. At the center of this dispute is a post-Brexit trade deal. The power sharing arrangement is seen as being at the heart of the Good Friday Peace Accords, which ended decades 25 years ago, and Joe Biden marked while he was in Belfast.

The NPT (PH) is seems to be suggesting it's kind of like a family vacation. So, how does the White House justify this? KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Well, the White House was asked about that yesterday, and they make the point, you know, the Good Friday Agreement, certainly a legacy of American involvement overseas, something that President Biden was very eager to proclaim when he was in Belfast. And here in Dublin, you know, he is meeting with government leaders. He's meeting with the president, with the Taoiseach. He's addressing the parliament. So, there are government matters, official matters that he will be discussing while he's on the ground here. But it's hard to separate that from the optics of the president traveling around this island visiting some of his ancestral homes. It's something that previous Presidents have done as well, including President Obama, of course, President Kennedy in the 1960s. But certainly, President Biden really relish his Irish identity far more than perhaps any president since Kennedy. And you saw that on full display yesterday when he was in County Louth. Thousands of people came out to the streets, three and four deep on the street in the pouring rain to see the president walked down the street. He visited a pub, he visited a little market place, really relishing his ancestry here in Ireland. And in fact, he even said, I don't know why his ancestors even left, it's so beautiful. Of course, they left because of the famine. And he acknowledged that later in the day, he took a tour of the Carlingford Castle, and he was able to peer out from the -- to the port of Newry, which is in Northern Ireland. And that is where his great, great, great grandfather Owen Finnegan departed for the United States in 1849. So, so much of this trip is really about the past. Today is really more about the present, present day (PH) Ireland, which really bears no resemblance to the Ireland that his ancestors left. It really doesn't even resemble the Ireland that JFK even visited in 1963. This is a much more progressive country. It's one of the top economies in the entire European Union. [00:15:03] Of course, Ireland past referendums, legalizing same sex marriage and abortion really sort of throwing off the weight of the Catholic church that had been such a part of this Ireland's identity for so many years. So that's part of President Biden's identity as well. So today, it will really be about more the present day Ireland before he gets back to his past, his ancestors, his roots on Friday, John.",

Wave of suspected poisoning at mostly girls schools have swept across Iran in recent months. Iranian politicians have suggested hardline Islamist groups could be targeting the girls, while activist believes school girls are being poisoned because many have been active in antigovernment protests. Muslims around the world are mocking the holy month of Ramadan, for those who are able, that means abstaining from food and water from sunup to sundown for the entire month. In fact, he said the custom is even more challenging this year because many families simply cannot afford the food to break their fast at the end of the day. Sophia Saifi has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN PRODUCER (voice over): They lineup in their hundreds, men, women and children waiting in the spring heat for a free bag of flour. Many have empty bellies as people across Pakistan observe daily fasts through the holy month of Ramadan. This year, a desperate food shortage means an evening meal is not guaranteed. 20-year-old tech worker Wakas Chaudry (PH) has been standing in this line since the early morning. He says it's the first time in his life he's had to rely on charity. Everything has become so expensive, he says, that it has become incredibly difficult just to survive. Few in this nation of 200 million had been spared by an economic crunch that is now hurting people across class divides. Acres of farmland lie under water after catastrophic floods last summer. Food is scarce, prices have skyrocketed. In just one year alone, the cost of flour, a staple of Pakistani diets has increased by over 100 percent according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. The government's attempts to wrangle a billion dollar bailout package from the International Monetary Fund has stalled since November. The sheer number of people lined up here is unusual and speaks to the seriousness of Pakistan's food shortage crisis. Wakas follows the line as it winds its way from the busy road into a dark musty basement. On the floor flower gathers like dust. It will be hours before his done. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a relief package early March, offering a bag of free flour to the poorest of the poor during Ramadan, Wakas never thought that would mean him. In the past month, close to two dozen people have died in Pakistan while waiting for food, desperate women and children dying in the crush for a meal. Pakistan's Commission of Human Rights accused the government of mismanaging food distribution. Charity is always a big part of Ramadan. Each year, soup kitchens layout free Iftars, the meal each enough to sunset to end the daily fast. This year, the number of people relying on goodwill has doubled. There is little to celebrate for many. We can't pay our children's school fees, this man tells me, we break our fast which is water and a date. Other delicacies are only things we can dream about right now. The economic despair here won't end with a bag of flour, as so many in Pakistan go to bed hungry this Ramadan.

In that memoir, if you remember, he talks about a desire to sit down with senior members of the royal family. We don't know whether that's going to happen.
