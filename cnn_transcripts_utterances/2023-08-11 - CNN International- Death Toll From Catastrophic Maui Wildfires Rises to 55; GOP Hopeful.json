It was imported from India and planted in front the town's courthouse back in 1873 and it's been a national historic landmark for more six decades now.Lawyers for Donald Trump are set to make their first appearance before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan today. She scheduled a hearing on the handling of the evidence on the case against Trump for plotting to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel is asking for jury selection in that trial to start in December with a presentation of evidence beginning January 2 of next year. Trump's attorneys are expected to push back given all the former president's other legal entanglements. They include fraud, defamation and hush money cases in New York, plus charges that Trump mishandled classified documents after he left the White House. Judge Chutkan also said that she could have something to say today about Trump's recent attacks on special counsel Jack Smith. The former president has repeatedly called him deranged. And on Thursday he lashed out at the proposed January trial date posting on social media: Only an out of touch lunatic would ask for such a date one day into the New Year. The trial should only happen, if at all, after the election. Meanwhile in Florida, Trump's co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira appeared in court. Nauta pleaded not guilty but De Oliveira, is arraignment was postponed. And in Michigan, all 16 people charged in the fake elector scheme have now pleaded not guilty. They each face eight felony charges including multiple counts of forgery. His legal problems notwithstanding, Donald Trump will campaign at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday and so with almost everybody else. But if any of those Republican challengers hope to catch Trump, they still have a very long way to go. We get more now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He will be here at the state fair on Saturday. But several others are as well. But his former Vice President Mike Pence was visiting the fair on Thursday, was asked a very pointed question about his actions on January 6. He defended them like this.

I mean, the American presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone.
