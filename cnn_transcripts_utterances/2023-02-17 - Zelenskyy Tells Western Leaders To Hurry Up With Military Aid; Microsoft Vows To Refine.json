Those are the markets and these are the main events. The debate over military aid to Ukraine taking center stage in Munich. President Zelenskyy urging the world to hurry up, while the German Chancellor warns against hasty decisions. Microsoft's AI search engine says some unsettling things to reporters. And Court filings reveal the private thoughts of Rupert Murdoch after the 2020 election. Live from New York, it is Friday, February 17th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Volodymyr Zelenskyy tells allies to hurry up as they discuss support for Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference. The Ukrainian President warning Western leaders that in decisiveness and delays also threatens their security. That message echoed by the French President Emmanuel Macron, he said Ukraine needs help launching a counter offensive and said that now is \"not the time for dialogue\" with Russia's Vladimir Putin. The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, shirking a more cautious note. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): We will continue to strike a balance between providing the best possible support for Ukraine and avoiding an unintended escalation. After all, the path we've embarked upon together runs through uncharted territory. For the first time in our history, a nuclear power is waging an imperialist war of aggression here on European soil and there is no blueprint for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are all topics that get discussion here this weekend, are of concern, because if Russia was to upscale, it doesn't need to invade NATO partners and allies, but if it can upscale its cyber threat, and it has reenergized that this year, that can be a threat to NATO, without it being military, this asymmetric warfare that NATO has been preparing for, for a number of years, so that is one of the things that gets discussed in the backrooms. But you know, Zelenskyy's point was, give me the heavy weapons for the fight now. The hope and belief is if that can happen, that this, as Emmanuel Macron said, we are not about regime change in Russia, but we are about forcing Putin to come to the negotiating table on Ukraine's terms. That means arm Ukraine to win the war or put it in a more decisive position. So I think the calculation at the moment is where everyone stands today, despite those worries about walking a tightrope, the way forward is arm and equip and that really seems to be where the drive is at the moment.",
