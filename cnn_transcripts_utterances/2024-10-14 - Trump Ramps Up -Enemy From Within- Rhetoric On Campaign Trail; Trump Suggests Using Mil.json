GEN. MARK HERTLING, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Some of those comments yesterday, Boris, they are not only troubling but also very disturbing to say that people who have different ideas, who might express their beliefs in different ways, which is something our constitution says all Americans should be able to do and to say that these are radical left or they are dangerous people on the inside. To me, it's just anathema to what we believe as Americans, and the rights and and kind of value systems that we live by.",

The Miami star suffered four documented concussions. One is a college star in Alabama, and three the past three NFL seasons, the latest in week two of this season against the bills.Remember, in 2022 the league changed its concussion protocols in response to the Dolphins handling of another troubling on-field hit, never diagnosed as a concussion. Tagovailoa has been on the league's injured reserve list after the latest head injury, but he's eligible to return in less than two weeks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And I just wanted to talk to you, because I would never have known three months ago before this happened to me, that the nicest just pleasantries hit very differently when you're in the middle of grief than they do to just regular people. There's a real divide.For instance, one question is, how are you? We all ask each other that every day, and it's so interesting. My teenage daughter told me last week that she now sees that as the most personal, vulnerable question you could ever ask someone, because for someone who's grieving? The answer is really complicated, and it's ever-changing. So is there a right way to ask that of someone in grief?",

So thank you so very much for putting this together from your own personal pain and triumphs also. But I would say that when we ask someone, how are you that person is in such grief, in such crisis. How do they answer that question?I mean, they are going through an existential change in their lives, and that's the last thing they want to be questioned about. I think we can be more specific when we reach out to someone and asking them, well, how are you doing with regard to making arrangements, or how was your particular meal the other day? Or how has it been for you to get through this particular day instead of asking such a broad question when someone is going through that kind of pain and may be confused and may be in shock?",

But I didn't mean to make anybody feel guilty. I asked, I myself, asked these five questions that now set me off. I asked them of friends for decades. I didn't know they can be -- you're so raw in grief and you're just, you know, an exposed nerve ending walking around, but I didn't know simple questions. The next one was, how can I help? And that one is very hard to answer for grieving people. Why is that?",

So I think it's really important for people to just, instead of asking, How can I help, just make a very small gesture, bringing a meal or offering to take someone shopping, or saying, well, listen, I'll just sit with your children while you are out taking care of other things around funeral arrangements or whatever the case may be.So it's just a little gestures. And I agree with you, Alisyn, your article, and I tell people all the time, it's not that people are doing the wrong thing. We don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water. It's that in these very personal times, it's important to come in a little bit better equipped, you know, with some things that are tried and true in helping someone who is grieving. So, you know, with no finger-pointing here, no blame game. It's just that, how do we come together in a more substantial way during these difficult times?",

If you can't imagine what I'm going through, then I must really be alone in this. And so one of the things that I think we can do is instead of using those particular words or maybe following it up with something like thinking about some of the grief that you have experienced in your own life. That's how we develop empathy, and that's how we develop validation for what it is that the person is going through. We don't have to try to say words that accidentally isolate them morethan anything else. Sometimes it's good just to sit there with them and not say anything. Just be the rock. Just be the person to let them know that they're not alone.",
