And she was boosted by Sean O'Brien, who is the president of the Teamsters Union. Which, you know, Sean O'Brien, he spoke at the RNC and declined to endorse in the presidential race, which really angered Democrats at the time. But now we're seeing that sort of paid dividends in the sense that he was able to help influence Trump to pick somebody who, as you said, Republicans are probably not, maybe not excited about, or are surprised to see Trump nominate somebody who is so pro-union.

And we have heard from watchdogs and Democrats alike sounding the alarms about threats to national security, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wrote some of those ethics in transition laws in a new letter to the Biden administration saying that Trump is quote, undermining his own ability to effectively manage national security emergencies, urgent public health and safety threats and corruption risk as he prepares to take office. Now, the Trump team insists they are not concerned and that they will be ready on day one to hit the ground running, but President-elect Trump has also started to receive his initial intelligence briefings since being elected. But Trump is going to inherit a number of key crises at home and abroad, that is escalating war in Ukraine and of course, that conflict in the Middle East, and U.S. allies are watching very closely to see how he plans to handle those key issues.

High Point, New Jersey, topping out just under two feet of snow. Pennsylvania, New York, several of these areas getting at least a foot of snow in just the last 24 to 36 hours.And that system is not yet done. It's starting to wind down. You don't have quite the significant amount of snow left, but you've got some rain and snow across portions of western Pennsylvania and into West Virginia, also into portions of New England. You're still seeing it raining in Boston, for example, and also some snow up in the White and Green Mountains. But a lot of that snow, if not most of it is really going to melt in the next couple of days because temperatures will be on the rise. Now, you'll start to see those temperatures begin to upswing as early as Sunday across the Midwest, even down to Memphis going from 58 today up into the low 70s by Monday. Now, for the northeast, as well at Mid- Atlantic, it's going to take a little longer. You'll start to see those temperatures really jumping Monday into Tuesday of the upcoming week. Outside of that, if you have some travel plans today, the best spots are really going to be the southeast and pretty much entire central U.S. No issues there whatsoever. The only other spot where we could have some issues is going to be out west. We're still wrapping up that system. Again, the bomb cyclone is gone, the atmospheric river, however, is still going to funnel a little bit more moisture in for the day today, especially the Pacific Northwest and Northern and Central California. But by the end of the day today, that atmospheric river begins to shift. Until it does, though, you've still got several more inches of not only rain and snow to get through.

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, it's interesting because since we have heard talk of this ceasefire proposal being a viable option, we've really seen an escalation in the violence and certainly we've seen an increase in the ground operation on the Israeli side.The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about that just yesterday and said they were expanding it because in southern Lebanon along the border, he says, that they have discovered what he called an underground strip, speaking of the underground tunnel network that we know Hezbollah has in that area, saying that they are every single day discovering more of it, it is massive and that at the very least they have to destroy that before they can start to move tens of thousands of Israeli residents back to northern Israel. So, what we're hearing from the Israeli side is not really a suggestion that this ceasefire is imminent, but what we did hear from the U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, this week is that they were close, that it was within our grasp, but ultimately the decision of the parties. So, at the same time as we are hearing these positive sounds of a ceasefire proposal, potentially being agreed upon by both sides, we are hearing that there is an escalation in airstrikes and also we are hearing of many rockets hitting into Israel as well. The IDF says some 16,000 have been launched by Hezbollah since October 8th of last year. Now, when you mentioned this central Beirut airstrike, there are more or at least 11 killed, dozens injured. It's significant that it is in central Beirut, that is an escalation in itself. Before it was really restricted to the Hezbollah stronghold of the southern suburbs, but in recent weeks we are seeing this become more commonplace. So, we are seeing this juxtaposition of an increase in attacks at the same time as there are suggestions that the ceasefire proposal could be going ahead and could be fairly imminent. We're not hearing anything publicly about that since really mid-week, but it doesn't mean that these talks are not ongoing behind the scenes. Victor, Amara.",

The second concern is that if the agreements aren't signed, we'll never know who's funding this transition. Those agreements establish caps on the amount of money that can be donated to the transition team, as well as requiring public disclosure of who those donors are. If we don't see those agreements signed, we'll never know that information and I think many people would worry about that.

The medical examiner called Neely's death a homicide after authorities say Penny held nearly in a choke hold for about six minutes. But a forensic pathologist testified for the defense disagreed. That pathologist testified that Neely died from a mix of factors, including synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, and from being restrained.",

This comes after several well-known athlete's homes were broken into in recent weeks.The NFL says thieves appear to exploit team schedules to target athletes' homes on game days, and security officials with the NBA say the FBI believes the burglaries are tied to transnational South American theft groups. With me now is CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI director Andrew McCabe. Andrew, good morning to you. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. Tell us more about the South American transnational theft groups. I was quite taken by just how sophisticated and coordinated they are with their thefts.",

The NFL has been fairly quiet about what information they passed on to their folks, but the NBA has been fairly detailed about what the FBI told them. They said that the FBI indicated these words you mentioned, transnational, likely from South America theft groups, organized, deployed, essentially, teams of people committed to conducting the surveillance and the operations necessary to pull off these robberies. They believe they are identifying some of their victims by analyzing the sport schedules to know when athletes are out of town, or at least, playing during a game, therefore not at home. They have utilized surveillance techniques, incorporating things such as drones, posing as delivery men, jogging through neighborhoods to establish what we in law enforcement call a pattern of life, and understanding of how life and people and vehicles and things like that move in and out and around the target location. And then, when they have decided the time is right, they are choosing residences to go into where alarms are not being used, dogs are not present, and they can typically gain access from a first or second floor window or door that's been left open.",

So, if you want to put those sorts of things on social media, do them after you've returned to your residence, things like that. And, of course, the guidance about using security systems and having people stay in your house when you're not there. It's just --it's very simple, very obvious, but really could be enough to thwart someone from breaking in. Burglars are typically looking for the easiest access they can. So, even just one step like that that's going to put an obstacle in their way, might be enough to send them down the street to the next target.",

Prices have been on the rise for two years, demand has remained steady, and the avion flu is spiking right now.And there is an increased demand for eggs around the holiday season. One grocer said egg prices have been out of control. The average price for a dozen eggs in October was $3.37, and of course, it depends on where you live. In Connecticut, one grocer told me he was selling a dozen eggs for $5. In New York City, one grocer said, north of $6. But prices across the border up 30 percent from last year. An egg production is down 2.6 percent. The avian flu has been plaguing farmers and has killed 75 egg laying birds over the past two years. And last month, there was a spike which killed 2.8 million egg laying birds in three states, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, most of where our eggs are produced and come from. So, that's created an even lower supply ahead of the holidays. And of course, we use a lot of eggs around this time, so, demand is putting even more pressure on low supply, raising prices. But what's interesting is commodity eggs, basic white eggs, are now just as expensive as organic eggs in some markets. So, many people are now choosing to buy organic, which in turn, could put an unexpected strain on that market. And just to show how important eggs are, think about all the items we make, we eat that have egg in them, mayo, pasta, those prices are higher now because of the last spike in avian flu cases.

That farmer also unfortunately lost his home. This farm here lost 270,000 seedlings. These are baby trees that would have eventually gotten planted to become those bigger trees that often get cut and sold for Christmas time. But when the flawed waters came in, it contaminated all of these trees with that pollution and root rot, and these are just not viable anymore. A lot of these were also supposed to go to other farmers in the industry, and that's just a loss for them this season. Christmas trees take seven to 10 years to grow, so it is possible that we really won't understand the impact of healing on the Christmas tree industry for another decade.

They, you know, still might end up doing that, but they got to get healthy and turn things around first.

So, this season, I just wanted to be consistent with my work and trusted throughout the whole way. So, Rookie of the Year is definitely one of my goals. SCHOLES (voice over): All right.

Rockets blew out the Blazes, 116 to 88. Houston is now on seven of eight. They are 12th and five on the season. All right, we saw the 16th pick in the draft in McCain and the third pick in Sheppard. How about next year's number one overall pick, Cooper Flagg, the 17-year-old Duke freshman, just dominating once again. He had a game I, 24 points in the Blue Devils' game -- win over 17th ranked, Arizona on the road. Flagg doesn't even turn 18 till December 21st.
