The visit, it kicks off in Paris today, where Xi Jinping will meet with one of his toughest critics. He is set to meet with the E.C. president, Ursula von der Leyen, along with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Now, von der Leyen, she's the one who called on the E.U. to de-risk its supplied chains away from China. Also to investigate the influx of cheaper subsidized Chinese E.V.'s into Europe. Macron, meanwhile, he is also seeking protection from Chinese overcapacity, from cheaper Chinese products like E.V.'s. And he has also tried to influence China to pressure Russia over its war in Ukraine. Xi's visit, it comes at a time of an historical moment, marking 60 years of diplomatic ties between France and China this year. And in a statement that was released upon his arrival in France, this is what Xi Jinping said. Let's bring it up for you. He said, quote, \"I hope our two countries will light up our way forward with the torch of history, open a brighter future of China- France relations, and make new contributions to world peace, stability, and development,\" unquote. But analysts say that this visit is about much more than that. This is part of China's strategy to exploit differences inside the E.U. And this is what CNN heard from an analyst, Noah Barkin. Let's bring up his statements. He's a visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. He says, \"China is seen increasingly as a multi-faceted threat in many European capitals. But there are divisions within Europe of how fast and far to go in addressing concerns about China, both in the economic and security spheres,\" unquote.

Huge crowds turning out to protest an attack on a German member of the European Parliament.Matthias Ecke was a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling SPD Party; was hit and kicked as he put up posters in the Eastern city of Dresden. The SPD blamed the rise of the far right in Germany. It's the latest in a string of similar incidents, with official figures showing the number of attacks on politicians in Parliament has doubled since 2019. Australia is a country under siege, both on land and under the sea. Fires and floods destroying homes and habitats, while the Great Barrier Reef is being cooked by warming water. Senior CNN international correspondent Ivan Watson embarked on a journey across the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

These were horrific forest fires across long stretches of Australia.And on that particular island where I was, Kangaroo Island, half of the island was burned down. More than half of the koala population was killed. And this one koala, fortunately, survived. What I saw in Australia was that this country, this continent, is very much on the frontlines of climate change, where scientists, residents are saying that the cycle of fires and floods are getting more unpredictable and more extreme. On top of that, I got a good look, with my team, at the Great Barrier Reef, this sprawling marine habitat that's the size of Italy, where we saw the beginnings of a mass bleaching event that was later confirmed by the Australian government, where record high ocean temperatures are quite literally cooking coral and killing it. It's part of a planet-wide phenomenon that's been witnessed over the course of the last year. So all of these changes that are impacting Australia are not only devastating natural habitats, but they're also impacting cities and towns and even prompting some Australians to consider leaving some of these more vulnerable communities.
