The nation is commemorating 22 years since the attacks of September 11th. Across the country, Americans are pausing to remember and reflect. It remains the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil. It's also an important moment to honor the nearly 3,000 lives lost on that day.",

I do want to mention that we don't even want our cameras on out of respect for what is happening behind us. So, that is why I'll get out of the way right at that 9:03. But before then, let me give you a sense of where we are. We are right by the south reflective pool where the south World Trade Center tower once stood. And all morning long we have been seeing family members and service members coming to this area and placing those flags that you can see in the etched names of this memorial, as well as flowers. You can see there are family members who are sitting there. And this space right now, Ground Zero, it is reserved only for family members who have this time to be on this hallowed ground and to remember those nearly 3,000 people, those lives that were lost. As you guys mentioned, the names are continuing to be read of those people who we've lost. And it's just so heart wrenching to hear these people talk about the 22 years, the people that have been born since then, all those people that they remember and who they've loved as they call out those names of the people that they are missing. One thing I want to note to you guys, as you listen to this throughout the morning, you'll see children reading out some of these names. And what they told me is that this is to signify that there are generations of people who weren't even alive when 9/11 happened, and this is a way to get those generations to remember about what happened here on -- at Ground Zero and across, of course, the world that was changed forever on that date. So that is something to keep an eye out for. The ceremony is going to continue until about noon today. We know there are dignitaries here, including Vice President Kamala Harris and, of course, many New York City dignitaries, as well as the mayor. And then there are alt (ph) service members as well. We have the NYPD Honor Guard and the FDNY as well. And we'll take that moment of silence.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, at this point we know, and have confirmation from both the Russian and the North Korean side, that Kim Jong-un is going to be in Russia. We know that Vladimir Putin is already in Vladivostok, in the eastern part of the country, where he is expected to meet with Kim Jong-un. He's there for an eastern economic forum. We know that it will be in the coming days, according to the Kremlin. But beyond that we don't have a specific date that they are telling us.What we do know is it is a meeting that neither Washington nor Seoul wants to go ahead. We have heard from U.S. officials, and it's been backed up by South Korean intelligence as well, that there is a belief that the two sides, the two countries, are moving closer towards an arms deal. Now, we know that Russia is looking for ammunition. We know that they would like small arms. And this is something that North Korea has a vast production capability of. And when it comes to what North Korea could get out of this deal, because everything is transactional and the relationships are transactional for Pyongyang, they could get, for example, satellite knowledge and technology from Russia. They have tried a couple of times in the past few months to put a military satellite up into space and have failed. They could also get nuclear submarine technology from Russia as well. So, clearly, both sides stand to gain militarily. And it is something that the U.S. and South Korea, Japan, allies in the region certainly don't want to see happen. U.S. officials have said that there would be repercussions. Now, of course, there's a political angle to this as well. It is showing Kim Jong-un's political ambitions. He is pushing closer to Russia, a country that he was not particularly close to for much of his reign. In fact, he met Vladimir Putin for the first time and the last back in 2019. He has been far closer to China. But we have seen over recent months this relationship developing. The Russian defense minister, for example, back in July was invited to Pyongyang. The red carpet treatment was given to him. He saw a military parade. He was walked through an arms expo. And it really had all of North Korea's weapons capabilities on display. And that is of great concern to Washington. Sara.",

And in a war of attrition, he needs to restock on both. He's got his armament factories, some of them working 24/7 to produce artillery shells, which are absolutely vital for him in the fight to hold the Ukrainians back. It's mines and artillery shells that are doing the most damage on the front lines to Ukrainian troops. And Kim Jong-un and North Korea uses similar types of weapons systems, similar caliber weapons. Indeed, they're interoperable Soviet era type weapons. So, they're connected by a railway network. North Korea, through Russia, all the way to the front lines in Ukraine. Putin if he can do this deal with Kim Jong-un, can potentially get the type of armaments he needs to keep the fight going, stop him losing ground in the places that he's losing ground. It's an existential threat for him. So, there's a huge amount at stake and, hence, therefore, the concern about the technologies he might give up in order to acquire the weapons for this battlefield.",

They are specialists with interventions in the past (ph), in Congo, in Jordan, in disasters around the world. None of them ever expected really to end up being deployed in a disaster of this scale in their own country. But that's exactly what's going on.There's even a gynecological unit here because there are people that are coming in from very long distances, a lot of them cut off completely, unable to use any kind of vehicular transport. So they're coming down on foot or using donkeys and other traditional means of transport because the roads have been blocked by this massive earthquake. Now, the death toll is sitting at about 2,500, similar number of severely injured. But that death toll -- and we really don't know one way or the other whether it will go shooting up because the Moroccan authorities are still trying to get to the more remote areas using helicopters, again, mostly military helicopters, in order to establish what the situation is in these very much more remote areas of the Atlas Mountains. But I've been speaking here to the professor who's also a colonel in charge of this, and he said it's a very, very emotional process for all of them, especially the emergency workers here, because they never expected to have to do this kind of thing in their own country. But also the psychological effects of this earthquake, he's very concerned there are going to be felt -- those aftershocks are going to be felt in this country long after the immediate emergency response is over, Kate. But that emergency response now is getting underway. It is in the last few hours, if you like, of the sort of 72-hour window of opportunity to -- where there -- hope can be really vested in trying to get people out when they're trapped underground. After that it tends to become a body retrieval process. And that is also going to take some time. Kate.",

Police put out these new images you see right here. These come from a Ring camera of Danelo Cavalcante, noting that he does look different now from the mugshot you'd seen before, cleanshaven specifically.Police also say that they believe he has slipped through their perimeter as he was spotted 20 miles from where they were looking. They say he managed to steal a van and then dump that van as well. CNN's Danny Freeman joins us now from Chester County, Pennsylvania. He's got the very latest on this. Danny, what happened this weekend? Where do things stand right now? DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kate, just a tremendous amount of developments over the past 48 hours. And the reality is, this weekend was a major setback for the manhunt for Danelo Cavalcante. But to understand exactly why, I've got to bring you back to where we were Friday and Saturday. Remember, just a few miles away from where we are at the command center, pretty much the whole area was shut down. Police said it was the largest police presence they had had in the manhunt at the time. And we saw troopers searching the backs of cars, searching trunks of basically every car that was coming near the perimeter. That was the environment that Cavalcante was able to slip away from. So, here's what we just learned yesterday. Basically sometime on Saturday most likely Cavalcante slipped that perimeter. He stole a van from a nearby dairy farm. And, Kate, that van he was able to take because the keys were left inside of the van. He then drove north of 20 miles north of the area to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and that's where he was caught on camera because he was trying to enlist the help of a former associate of his and that Ring camera you saw, that's where we saw the new images of Cavalcante, now clean shaven, wearing a green hoodie, different from the initial photos from trail cameras in the woods that we had seen earlier last week. Then on Sunday morning police found that dairy van. It was abandoned. Cavalcante nowhere to be seen. But, Kate, I want you to take a listen to an interview that one of our CNN affiliates did with the former roommate of Cavalcante from not that long ago. Take a listen to his perspective.
