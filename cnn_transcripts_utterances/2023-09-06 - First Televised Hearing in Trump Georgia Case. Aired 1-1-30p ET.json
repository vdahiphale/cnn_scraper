Unlike a federal courtroom, we're going to actually see a lot of this unfold. And we will get the demeanor of the judge, what his take -- does he -- is he going to scoff at the notion of having 19 people try it together or not?Can Fani Willis us give us some indication of whether or not her discussions about the movements to have a speedier trial, will that be all of them? And, remember, keep in mind, all this can happen, even though we don't yet know what the fate of Mark Meadows' motion to move to federal court would be. It's very easy to be able to look at this through a vacuum. But, remember, there's already a motion right now to say, can I get some of these cases into federal court? This is all considering and assuming that's not going to happen, because, without Mark Meadows or others, it would be not 19 people. But this is going to be a very interesting hearing to get the room, the temperature of what's happening there. And, also, what is the preparation like right now for Fani Willis? Is she really ready to go? And are those defense counsels who asked for an earlier trial date, were they calling a bluff or will their bluff now be called?",

They wouldn't be surprised if he succeeds. What does that mean for the other defendants? We have seen Jeffrey Clark, who, again, is another defendant in this case, a former Justice Department official, already argue in court filings:  I should be in federal court, and everyone else should come along with me. So the federal judge is going to have to weigh that. And, frankly, it's going to be up to the federal judge in a lot of ways to decide that, to litigate that.

And, at some point, if we're going for a week or a month or however long the trial is, I don't want the baby to get thrown out with the bathwater. That's why I'm emphasizing we are charged with sort of the intellectual part of this case, right? We wrote some memos talking about how the ECA and the 12th Amendment works, and that's a separate motion we filed that we will need to take up in the future about those issues. And then, specifically, in Georgia, we sent two e-mails to the head of the Republican Party as alleged. That's it. And the RICO count -- in RICO count, there's 160-some-odd overt acts. As the court knows, there's an overt act which doesn't have to be a crime, and there's predicate acts. We are not labeled as having committed any predicate act in the RICO conspiracy in this case. We then have six substantive counts, all that deal with whether the electors are fraudulent or not and whether they filled out the paperwork was forgery or not. That's essentially all of it. With her, you don't have that. You have got what happened in Coffee County as far as, did we have computer fraud, computer trespass, did we intimidate people, were we suppressing the vote, things like that, that I have read about and I have seen the public atmosphere, which is going to come up. That has nothing to do with us. Our whole point is, we were 1,000 miles away from here. We wrote intelligent memos based on our experience in the Gore v. Bush campaign, which we also worked on, and we basically said, if there is a valid underlying offense, then the ECA and those arguments that I'm making could be valid. We had nothing to do with the actual shenanigans, allegations, whatever, in the state of Georgia necessarily themselves. And that's where I'm trying to distinguish it, because you could very easily say, it's just two defendants,so there may not be a confusion of who's what, but you're essentially running two trials simultaneously in here. And so I don't think giving limiting instructions and me objecting to all of it is fair. And I think that's what Zafiro and some of the other cases talk about. And I brought those up because, even though they ruled against us and everything, the analysis was relatively sound. And in the end, it says, you can do what you wish because there is no specific X, then Y situation. So that would be my argument with regards to Ms. Powell.",

What I'm saying is, yes, there's going to be separate evidence going up against Ms. Powell, but, at some point, the sheer volume of it all, there's going to be sort of a connection. We're sitting at the table together. And that carries a lot of weight. Your Honor is one of the very few judges that's done a ton of trials as far as that goes, and you know the impact that's going to have as far as that goes. There's just a reality. I don't know if there's a legal theory that says it out there, but you and I both know that's going to happen.",

It's completely different, and I'm sure there's going to be a ton of it, from what I have seen in the TV coverage and the public media as far as people speaking out on Coffee County, whereas, on our side, we will have intellects talking about, is the ECA constitutional? Is it not? What is the 12th Amendment? I mean, frankly, judge, prior to this case, I didn't know what the 12th Amendment was because I'd never even thought about it. I don't know if anybody in this room had really thought about it, or the ECA. It was just people vote and somehow it all works out. And so I have had to learn a lot of that stuff. It's just a completely different trial. I think you can see that in sort of reading just the indictment in itself. And that's the fear. At some point, do we just sort of mix it all together and stop paying attention? I don't know. And then how many limiting instructions are you going to give in this case? Is it going to be ahead of every witness that comes up against Ms. Powell, which, of course, I will have to object to as not relevant to us and impeaching and all these kinds of things. And so I just think it'd be easy to have a clean trial. It will be a much shorter trial, in my opinion, as far that goes. So that would be my position. And I will let Mr. Rafferty address it.

If there's multiple murders or multiple drug deals, you sort of block it out. I don't know how else to phrase it, except for maybe a severance of counts. We have seven counts. I get it. I don't necessarily think they're related, but I'm not going to challenge that, because the law is weak on those issues. The 34 other counts involve a total of 13 defendants that we're not affiliated with. Our counts are involving six total people. But the other 34, again, as Mr. Grubman said, are multiple conspiracies within the conspiracy. And I don't see how that's relevant or even admissible in this case. It's not similar transaction material. So I'm just asking it to be redacted, I guess, if that's the correct word, because we're not being judged on those counts.
