And Brianna, here in Treasure Island, the concern over human life is enormous. It is extremely dangerous where I am right now.In case in point, officials are closing this Barrier Island on the Gulf Coast of Florida at 07:00 p.m. tonight, in large part because this area was hit by Hurricane Helene about two weeks ago, a Category 4 storm. The outer bands came through here and left a mess that two weeks later is still out on the ground. You see debris of all kinds. There's plasterboard, wood. I saw appliances earlier. There's glass. I spoke to a resident here who essentially said that when the storm comes, all this stuff will turn into a countless amount of missiles. Keep in mind, this is a Barrier island and you've got a pile of trash that is about 20 feet high. And this is just one of so many scenes that we've seen throughout Pinellas County where you're talking about piles and piles of trash that officials have not been able to clean out. And this is the specific part of the problem in this area. You've got a bay on one side, the water there already at level. You're going to see about a 15-foot storm surge at its highest point in this area. On top of that, a foot of rain and forecasted winds of up to 125 miles an hour. If you look right over there, that's where the beach is. We want to give you a live look at our CNN air drone that captures just how dangerous it would be to be standing in this area. The neighbor who mentioned the dangerous aspect of this trash and these projectiles was a man named Matt (ph), who said that he rode out Hurricane Helene here. He's not taking any chances. He is getting out. But I have spoken to some neighbors that are still considering staying. Actually, I want to go straight to the Deputy Director of the National Hurricane Center, Jamie Rhome, who joins us now live. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. We just got an update on Hurricane Helene. I understand that as of right now, it's only two miles an hour shy of being a Category 5 storm. I'm wondering what that means for residents that are still weighing whether to stay or not in a place like this on Treasure Island.",

What we want them to make the decision on is the impacts they are going to experience when it ultimately moves across the Florida peninsula as a powerful hurricane. That's the bottom line message. It's going to move across the Florida peninsula over a densely populated portion of the Florida peninsula as a powerful hurricane. And with it, bring a wide swathe of damaging and destructive winds that will cut across the Florida peninsula. You're looking at widespread power outages, impassable roads, and just, you know, generally really unpleasant conditions. That's just the wind.Now, if we talk about the storm surge somewhere in this purple area, not everywhere, somewhere in this purple area, he had the potential to get 10 to 15 feet of storm surge, to put that in perspective. You know, some of the areas in here got about six or seven feet of surge during Helene. That would be about double the surge they experienced in Helene.",

And this growth in size will more than compensate from this weakening because it's all about the amount of power, right, the amount of force that these storms bring.And we saw this with Helene. Because it was so big, it just brought so much power and brought it farther inland than people are used to seeing. So that's why we think, and we're forecasting, it's going to retain its hurricane strength as it treks across the entire Florida peninsula. That's not something you hear me say often, retain its strength across the entire Hurricane peninsula, spreading these damaging and destructive winds over, you know, densely populated portions in here, near and to the south of the I-4 Corridor.",

You had a hurricane -- it wasn't even a hurricane, it was a tropical storm at one point. And then 24 hours later in the warm waters of the gulf, transforms into one of the top 10 most powerful hurricanes we've ever seen in the Atlantic.

That was about two weeks before the election, even closer to an election. And part of the reason why this matters is that in these moments, you expect to see your leader show up. And if you go back to 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, George W. Bush, was maligned and attacked by the left, and the media, and everyone else because he spent, I think it was about three days or so until he went down to visit the hurricane damage. It took even longer for President Biden and Vice president Harris to go down and actually visit and meet with those officials on the ground.And so what it did is it provided this opening for folks who are looking for guidance and leadership at these times more than ever because they've lost livelihoods, homes, fortunes, family, lives, looking for leaders to actually go down there. So I will say this. I'll give President Trump credit for being down there and actually visiting things immediately down in Georgia, he was down there. He's meeting with local officials. It shouldn't have taken President Biden and Vice President Harris, as long as they did, because at those moments, it's really the leadership from our elected officials we're expecting.
