You know Jeffrey Clark, a former Department of Justice official during the Trump administration, he agreed to a one-hundred-thousand-dollar bond agreement, as did Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the same amount applies to him too. And those are two pretty bold-faced names in terms of the defendants in this case.And Jeffrey Clark is probably a little bit lesser known. He's a former DOJ official but he was an environmental lawyer by trade. He was -- but he was one of the only officials at the Justice Department who was willing to entertain Trump's you know various plans and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He wanted to investigate a variety of voter fraud claims that have never been proven to be remotely true. And Trump even considered making him acting attorney general at one point when Justice Department leaders refused to go along with his pressure campaign to investigate voter fraud. So, just -- Jeffrey Clark and Mark Meadows both agreeing, and that sets them up to surrender as well to the Fulton County Jail sometime before the new deadline tomorrow.",

A number of onlookers have been sort of gathering around here to try to see what they can see.And again, for normal defendants, this is a long painful process, turning yourself in at the Fulton County Jail. It takes hours to be processed. We're not expecting that from the former president. This should be a pretty quick visit, but one that's very different than his previous arrests. We've previously seen him show up at a courthouse and be processed there. That's not the case. This time he's showing up here at the Fulton County Jail. And what we've seen from other defendants is that, you know, they're searched, they go through medical screening, they are fingerprinted, they get a mug shot. We don't necessarily know that the former president is going to have to go through all of these steps. It's very likely his team has taken a number of steps to try to smooth over the process and that frankly, the sheriff's office wants him in and out of this jail as quickly as possible. But the sheriff has been adamant that the defendants in this case, all 19 of them, are going to be treated as close to regular defendants as possible and has suggested that fingerprints and mug shots are going to be ready for all of them. Again, that's different from what we've seen in the previous three arrests. Donald Trump never got a mug shot in any of these cases and we're waiting to see if he does this time around.",

He didn't feel that there were any breakout stars. But of course, when it comes to actually going to Atlanta, and by the way, this is something we know that Donald Trump does, he compartmentalizes, this is not something that he wants to be doing. He does not want to be involved in this. He does not want to be charged. He has made that clear. He spent some of the day and much of the day yesterday lashing out at Fani Willis, the district attorney there. We do expect him -- to see him fairly soon. He will be headed to Atlanta where he will be processed in that jail. And I'm told that this is the product of multiple negotiations back and forth between Trump's team and law enforcement with the same goal, trying to get him in and out of the city of Atlanta as quickly as possible. And that is how they ended up with that late evening timing for his surrender and for his processing. Now, of course, there are still a lot of questions as to what exactly that processing will look like. Some of his own team don't seem to know all of the details and how long it's going to take. But again, we are told they want to make this as quick as possible, not just Trump's team, but the law enforcement on the ground as well. And one other thing I want to point out here is that we are told that they are preparing for Trump to make remarks after he is processed to the reporters traveling with him. But of course, as we know, ultimately this will be his decision how he is feeling after he is processed. And as we have seen, these are not times that he feels good.

Sources tell CNN that Drew Findling, the man here on the left is now out. Taking his place, Steve Sadow, a defense attorney with a record of highly interesting cases in other high-profile clients.Trump's source said the switch had nothing to do with Findling's performance, but another source familiar with Sadow called him \"the best criminal defense attorney in Georgia.\" So, here's what we know about him and the clients he's had in the past. Back in 2000, he represented one of NFL Ray Lewis's co-defendants, Joseph Sweeting, in the high-profile Buckhead murder case that followed a night of post-Super Bowl partying. Sadow secured Sweeting's acquittal in the stabbing deaths of two men in that case. He has also represented the rappers T.I. and as well as R'n'B Star Usher and Rick Ross. Sadow also has experience in high-profile racketeering cases. That is notable considering Trump is now one of 19 defendants in a racketeering or RICO indictment. So, to that point, more than two decades ago, Sadow rep this man, an Atlanta strip club owner Steve Kaplan in a big RICO case. Kaplan accused then, of funneling profits from The Gold Club to the Gambino crime family in New York. Sadow secured a plea deal for Kaplan, in which he had to plead guilty to one count of racketeering, forfeit five million dollars. He spent three to five years in prison. Sadow at the time called it a very good deal for all concerned. More recently, just in December of last year, Sadow secured a plea deal for the rapper, Gunna. This in a high-profile racketeering case again, also brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Gunna pleading guilty in that case against YSL or Young Slime Life, the rap group founded by Young Thug. Gunna had to admit that YSL was also a criminal street gang. He was sentenced to five years in prison, was released after one year when the sentence was commuted for time served. The rest of that sentence was suspended. Fast forward to today. After he was named Trump's new Georgia attorney, Sadow released a statement that says in part and will quote here. \"We look forward to the case being dismissed or if necessary an unbiased, open-minded jury finding the president not guilty. Prosecutions intended to advance or serve the ambitions and careers of political opponents of the president have no place in our justice system.\" But notable, Brianna, in the past in racketeering cases, some of his clients have had to plead.",

His defense is that he was just doing his job as the chief of staff for the president of the United States, doing what the president wanted him to do. There's also another version of that, which is what he was doing was trying to fix an election. So, I think he is a key witness here, very, very important.

I just can't imagine them not sitting around the table going was this worth it? Was it worth it, to take these steps into -- and to really work for somebody that just took this in a different direction and now looks like an illegal direction?And look, this is -- this has got to be difficult personally for each and every one of these individuals. And I think just you know as cynical as it looks like for different times for mug shots and different times of the day and different vehicles they show up in, I think there's an even bigger picture to this. It's going to be what their legal strategies are, right? Is it going to be blaming the attorneys? Is it going to be blaming Donald Trump? Is it going to be blaming, you know Fani Willis? Nobody's really blaming the fact that nobody's listening to the facts. The big box of secret evidence has never shown up in two and a half years.
