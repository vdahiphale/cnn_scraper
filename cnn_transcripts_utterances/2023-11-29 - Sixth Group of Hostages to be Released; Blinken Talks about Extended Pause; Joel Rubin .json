They are now free.Still not among that group was two American women who were kidnapped in the October 7th terror attack as well. The White House, though, now says that they are hopeful that these women may be on the list of hostages to be released today. Now, according to the Israeli prime minister's office there are 161 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, 126 of them are male, 35 of them are female. And of those who are still kidnapped, ten of them are 75 years old or older, four more are between the ages of 18 and 19 and another four are just children under the age of 18 years old. This morning there is new optimism and an important note from the Qatari foreign ministry which has been key to broker all of these agreements, even saying that they could be announcing another truce extension in a couple of hours. Let's get over to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. She has more on this from Tel Aviv. And, Kaitlan, you spoke with the Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson just a few minutes ago and he offered and important update on this.",

And so this is a crucial update that we heard from the Qataris earlier today because this comes amid conversations about what could happen next here. We know that we are on day six of this agreement right now, but everyone wants to know what happens on day seven because this temporary truce and it's 48-hour extension is set to expire tonight. And we know all parts have been talking about what that could look like going forward.We just asked the Qatari spokesperson what he expects to happen. This is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, ADVISER TO QATARI PRIME MINISTER: We are hopeful that within a couple of hours we will have the release of the final batch, but also we'll be able to announce an extension. We are working on an extension that would be guaranteed by the same provision that guaranteed the previous two days, which is that every day would have to include at least ten hostages coming out and 30 hostages - sorry, 30 prisoners from the Israeli prisons, and we are very -- we are very optimistic that we will have good news to share today.",

      "sentences": "So, under the terms of the agreement so far we expect ten more women and children to be released and, at least according to the last few days, we expect that to start playing out over the course of the next few hours. It has, in the past, been delayed. Sometimes even delayed by several hours into the middle of the night. But we do expect it at this point to continue.We certainly haven't seen anything like yesterday's exchange of fire that risked to derail the agreement. So even if this doesn't go forward in the next few moments here, it is expected to continue. Ten Israeli women and children released in exchange for 30 Palestinian women and children released from Israeli prisons. One of the key questions, will there be any Americans on this list? We saw four-year-old Abigail Edan released a couple days ago. Now the question, are the other two dual national Israeli American women set to be released? That is a key question for the Biden administration. Then, as you pointed out, one of the other major issues here is how much longer can this continue? According to the Israeli prime minister's office, there are 161 hostages who remain in Gaza. That number has gone up and down as certain hostages have come out. The Israeli government has adjusted that exact number. But of those, according to the Israeli prime minister's office, 35 are women. Crucial to note that some of those might be foreign nationals. But there is a limit on how long the current truce can be extended. And that's something to keep an eye on because the current truce is only for women and children. That essentially a ratio of one Israeli woman or child released for three Palestinian women and children in Israeli prisons to be released. To go to the next stage of that, elderly men or soldiers, that could require a whole nother set of negotiations, an entirely separate framework. Keep in mind, Kaitlan, it took weeks to work out the beginning of this. And even if there's a basis you can build upon, these are two sides, Israel and Hamas, that completely distrust each other. Even with all of the international pressure, getting to the next stage of an agreement might remain incredibly difficult even if the Qataris are optimistic about the next 24 hours.",

Also we're seeing on the ground in Brussels this morning for the NATO foreign minister's meeting Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He did confirm he will be back here in Israel in the coming days. He's made multiple trips since October 7th, this time focusing on extending the pause in the fighting that the White House would like to see extended for several more days at least. CNN's Arlette Saenz is tracking all of this from the White House this morning.

You also have the special envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, who will be in Israel to work with Blinken, as well as meet with the families of American hostages and Israeli hostages.And then there is CIA Director Bill Burns, who yesterday was in Doha meeting with Qataris, Egyptian and Israeli officials to talk about a way forward towards a possible truce. Now, earlier today Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the goal of any extension of a truce is to further get hostages out and get more aid in. Take a listen to what he had to say.

Officials believe that there are enough women and children who still need to be released from captivity and that that could allow for a possible two-day truce, but that's something that they will be working towards today.And it comes at the same time as officials are also looking to what happens when the truce ends, when fighting resumes. Senior administration officials have said that they are urging the Israelis to be more precise, more surgical as they are going after Hamas to try to avoid civilian casualties. They have pushed to be careful with operations in the southern part of Gaza where many civilians have been fleeing. And it comes as the president back here at home has also faced political pressure, including within his own Democratic Party, to call for a further ceasefire in the fighting. So, these are all things that the White House will be watching in the coming days. And, of course, today they are keeping their eyes on whether either of those two American women being held hostage will be released by Hamas.",

So, the White House remains hopeful that this could happen. They've also noted that they don't necessarily know where exactly all of these hostages are being held. And that could be a contributing factor to some of this. But they, ultimately, are hopeful that those two American women will get out.

But everybody's on a hair trigger right now, so the pressure is only increasing for there to be a further extension.But it really depends upon Hamas' good will. And that's a very difficult place to be because Hamas does not engage in good will. Hamas is engaging in a very strategic maneuver right now to release individuals, release kidnapped Israelis in order to get a pause in military action that has been waged against it by Israel. So, for Hamas the calculation is, is do they need more time? And I think that's why we're seeing day by day agreements rather than the larger sort of chunk that we had at the beginning of four full days. That uncertainty will continue and I think Hamas likes it that way, but then, of course, they also have their internal difficulties with identifying where people may be because we know that they are spread about potentially with criminal gangs and other terrorist organizations inside Gaza. So, this is just a very tenuous situation, I can't emphasize that enough, depending on Hamas' decision-making to determine how much longer we're going to have this truce for.",

This trade potentially of Israeli soldiers, in the past we saw a soldier released, Gilad Shalit, over a decade ago. He was one single Israeli traded for 1,027 Hamas fighters. So, the price is probably going to go up. That's my fear.We've seen this three to one ratio of Palestinians who are in Israeli prisons being released for one kidnapped hostage. That -- over women and children. That ratio is likely going to change significantly, and I think that's where we're going to hit the real road blocks and then we're going to see the Israeli military pressure reassert itself. You know, we have to make sure that all the women and children get out. Just think about it, babies are still kidnapped and in captivity. What's the purpose of this? It's only about keeping Hamas in a safe space and away from Israeli fire. But I think it's going to be very difficult to envision a three to one ratio exchange for those men.",
