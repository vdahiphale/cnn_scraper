And with it, a job that no juries ever had before, deciding whether or not to convict a former President of the United States, and current candidate for the Office again, of as many as 34 felonies. Today, it was the final chance, for both sides, to persuade them. We're talking about it tonight. Joining the panel, retired New York City criminal judge, George Grasso; and jury consultant, Alan Tuerkheimer. Judge Grasso, it is great to have you with all your experience here. What do you make of closing arguments, tonight? I mean, five hours, two and a half, three hours, is that?",

So, I think each side, they did OK, they did a good job. But they missed delivering stellar closings. Now, the defense, I think, did what it had to. It raised some questions about fraudulent intent, on the part of Trump, regarding the invoices, surrounding the payments. But they were a little gratuitous with some cheap shots, at Michael Cohen and a little gimmicky. Prosecution, I think, was a little more streamlined. They give a timeline, laid out the elements, and the actual verdict questions jurors are going to have. But the State also took a long time. So, at this point, it's about deliberation advocacy. And I would guess that of the 12 jurors, maybe four of them are pretty firmly convinced of guilt or innocence, and then another four are leaning in one direction or the other.

He lies to Federal Judges.A little bit later, he said, it's like what people, when they talk about with athletes like Michael Jordan as the GOAT; Tiger Woods as the GOAT; Tom Brady as the GOAT, these athletes are the \"Greatest of All Time,\" the best among their peers. Michael Cohen is the GLOAT. He's literally the Greatest Liar of All Time. And then, the prosecutor, Josh Steinglass, later said, we didn't choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn't pick him up at the witness store. The Defendant chose Michael Cohen to be his fixer, because he was willing to lie and cheat on Mr. Trump's behalf. In this case, there is, literally, a mountain of evidence of corroborating testimony that tends to connect the Defendant to this crime; from Pecker, to Hicks, to the Defendant's own employees, to the documents, to the Defendant's own Tweets and rallies, and his own words on that recorded conversation.
