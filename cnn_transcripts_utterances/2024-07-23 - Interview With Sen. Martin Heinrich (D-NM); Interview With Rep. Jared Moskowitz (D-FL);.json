Congressman Jared Moskowitz is a Democrat from Florida and a key member of the House Oversight Committee. He was at that hearing yesterday with Cheatle. And, as you heard, he publicly called for her to resign. Congressman, what's your reaction to Director Cheatle now taking this step and resigning? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  I mean, good. I mean, you're talking about a former president almost being assassinated live on television to the world, for the world to see on her watch. Look, when you take these jobs, -- and I was a former director of emergency management in the state of Florida. When you take jobs like that, you know that, if disaster happens on your watch and you don't do a good job, OK, you're going to be held accountable. When we had a bad response to Katrina, the FEMA administrator resigned. When we had January 6, the head of Capitol Police resigned. And she is doing the right thing. She has to be held accountable. And so I'm glad it happened. The hearing yesterday was a complete disaster. She was not prepared. She may, Wolf, have had too many Wolf Spritzer before she came to that hearing. But this is the right thing to do. I support the task force that the Republicans are trying to create. I hope to try to get on that task force. We got to do an after-action review to figure out all the things that failed, so that we can fix them, to make sure that this never happens again. And so that, I think, you're going to see us work on in Congress on a bipartisan basis.",

The SRO didn't go into the building. Police waited outside at his direction. But there were lots of things we didn't know that failed in the building, training, all sorts of things. And so I think that's why the task force is necessary. And then we will know whether we need procedural changes, process changes, structural changes, training changes. We're going to find out probably that there were massive comms failures between when the perpetrator was seen and getting that information, that threat level up to the Secret Service between local law enforcement. We found that different police departments in Parkland couldn't even talk to each other because they had different radio systems. And so we're going to find out all sorts of different inoperable issues once we start digging into the failures of just 10 days ago.",

So we got to reinstill morale within the Secret Service, and then someone who's going to pledge to obviously get to the bottom of what happened.
