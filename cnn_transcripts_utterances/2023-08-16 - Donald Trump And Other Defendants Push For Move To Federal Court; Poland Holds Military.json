Donald Trump's former chief of staff makes a play to get his racketeering charges dismissed and indications are the former U.S. president might be plotting a similar move. More than 100 people are now confirmed dead following Hawaii's wildfires as U.S. President Joe Biden defends himself against critics of his disaster response. And three people arrested in the U.K. allegedly for spying. The clock is ticking here in the U.S. state of Georgia where Donald Trump has less than 10 days to turn himself into authorities. The former president has been charged with 13 counts in a case alleging he and 18 others schemed to subvert Georgia's 2020 presidential election results. While Trump is expected to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail according to the sheriff. In the meantime, he's announced a \"major news conference next Monday to present a report from his team on his own allegations of fraud in the case\". While Trump's former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is wasting no time attempting to have the Georgia case move to federal court. According to new court filings, Meadows argues he's entitled to federal immunity since the Georgia charges stem from his time serving the sitting president. CNN's Paula Reid walks us through the latest developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Mark Meadows, the former Trump White House Chief of Staff and now criminal defendant has just asked to move this state case to a federal jurisdiction. Now, Meadows and his attorneys believe that if they can get this case move to federal court, that they will be able to successfully get it dismissed. Now, even if Meadows was able to get his case move to the federal level, it doesn't mean that the entire 19 defendant conspiracy case will move to federal court, this will be something that will happen defendant by defendant. And we know that other defendants including Rudy Giuliani, who said in an interview Tuesday that he too will try to get his case remove to federal court and former President Trump are going to try this as well. Now, even if these cases are not dismissed at the federal level, if they are tried at that level, there is one advantage for the former president and his allies, and that would be the jury pool. Here in Fulton County, the jury pool is heavily Democratic, but if you move to a federal jury pool, could be better for those defendants. So, of course, ultimately, the case rests on the facts. And right now, these facts in this case remain a state matter. And all of these defendants have until next Friday at noon to surrender to the court. Now, usually, this is something you do with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, typically involves a mug shot, fingerprints. It's unclear if something different will be negotiated for former President Trump. And then a judge will set a date for his initial appearance. Paula Reid, CNN, Fulton County, Georgia.

And there is a provision of law that allows for a state case like Fani Willis's case against Donald Trump and Mark Meadows and the other defendants to be taken from the state case to go to the federal court. And we do that under the law Section 1442. When you have a Federal officer who's performing an official duty.[00:05:08] The problem for Mr. Meadows, who's asking the federal court to remove the case, it doesn't happen until the Federal Court decides to do so. The problem for Mr. Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff is that the com -- the indictment alleges that he was essentially engaged in a political election interference. That's political, not official. It says allegedly and there's powerful evidence that he was part of an attempted coup following the election of 2020 and of course, that's contrary to the Constitution and our laws if true, so it can't form a basis for removal. It seems that he will have a pretty tough struggle to persuade the federal court that it this case belongs there, but we'll see what happens.",

And again, the evidence suggests that there was nothing official about what the former president was doing. If you look in the constitutional job description of an American president, nowhere in there will you find attempting to hang on to power after you've lost an election as a political candidate. That's political, not official, and it's beyond the outer penumbra. So, like for Mr. Meadows, perhaps even tougher than his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is the row that Mr. Trump will need to hoe if he wants to achieve immunity or to remove the case.

More now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A massive show of force in central Warsaw. Poland gearing up for its annual military day parade just as tensions in the country's border with Belarus NATO's eastern flank are rising. Russia and Belarus are increasing the pressure on our borders, the Prime Minister says, they are increasing the number of provocations and we have to be aware that that number will continue to rise. Poland claims Belarusian helicopters recently violated its airspace even though Minsk denies this. But Warsaw is also concerned about the presence of Russian mercenaries from the Wagner private military company fresh from the battlefield in Ukraine now inside Belarus training the Belarusian military in some cases just a few miles from Poland's border. In a meeting with Vladimir Putin Belarusian strongman Aleksandr Lukashenko claiming the fighters want to invade Poland. The Wagner Group guys are starting to stress, he says, allow us to go west. I said why do you need it to go west? We're silently watching what is going on. We'll go for a sightseeing tour to Warsaw and Chechnya. That may be typical bluster from Lukashenko but Wagner Mercenaries are some of the toughest and most successful troops on Russia's side. Fighting hard during the battle for Bakhmut while taking immense losses, the U.S. says. Poland is reacting saying it will send around 10,000 troops with tanks and other heavy armor to the eastern border to support the border guards already on duty there. We have to be ready for any scenario, the defense minister says, we do not exclude any and that is why we decided to move the army closer to the border with Belarus to strengthen the border and scare away the aggressor. Poland's eastern border has been a flashpoint for at least two years. In 2021, Belarus lured thousands of migrants mostly from Iraq to the area falsely promising entry into the European Union and kicking off a major crisis. Now, Russia says it will beef up forces on its own western border blaming Poland. Poland has become the main instrument of the United States anti-Russian policy, the defense minister says, these threats to Russia's military security require a timely, adequate response. Poland prides itself on being a strong ally of the U.S. on NATO's eastern flank, one that won't back down in the face of threats from Belarus or from Russia. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: The London Metropolitan Police has issued a statement offering some details on its arrest of three suspected spies, the statement follows a Tuesday BBC report claiming three people were arrested earlier this year in the U.K. on charges of spying for Russia. The BBC says all three are still being held in custody. The Mets confirmed the names and ages of the people listed in the BBC report, but said only that they were charged with possessing false identity documents with improper intention. The Mets did not say if the charges were related to Russia. Bob Baer is a former CIA operative and he joins me now from Colorado. A very good day, Bob. There is so much we don't know.

Also saying that Travis King had told the North Korean officials that he wanted to seek refuge either in North Korea or a third country, saying that he was disillusioned with the -- with the American army. Now, of course, this is what North Korea is saying, we have to treat it as such. We have not heard from Travis King himself and U.S. officials have actually said that they can't verify King's alleged comments at this point. But it is significant because it's been almost a month, almost a calendar month since Travis King ran across the military demarcation line at the DMZ. He was on a civilian tour of the Joint Security Area and broke away from the group and then crossed that MDL into North Korea. We understand he tried to go through the front door of the building on the North Korean site, it was locked. According to officials he went around the outside, was bundled into a car by North Korean officials and that is the last that U.N. Command or U.S. officials saw of him. So, this is going to be a relief certainly to his family who have not heard anything of Travis King up until this point. We have heard from Travis King's mother through a spokesperson saying that she appeals to Pyongyang to treat him humanely, saying that he -- she would appreciate a phone call from him as well. Now, of course, it's fairly unlikely that that would happen. It's certainly not been North Korea's way of dealing with those Americans in their custody in the past, there have been some high profile cases. Of course, Otto Warmbier, the student who was arrested in recent years and who came back to the United States in a -- in a vegetative state shortly after, he did die.

The technology is modeled to the brain scans of individual participants. And researchers say it has a long way to go before it can read the minds of the general public. But if mind reading does one day become a reality, they want to make sure private thoughts are protected.",

KINKADE (voice-over): Still, the scientists are optimistic that mind reading A.I. can be used for good: to help people control artificial limbs, or if they're unable to speak, communicate using only their thoughts.",

Scientists in Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands are learning how A.I. can make sense of our brains. The research is a new frontier, as artificial intelligence starts to turn science fiction into reality. Lynda Kinkade, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
