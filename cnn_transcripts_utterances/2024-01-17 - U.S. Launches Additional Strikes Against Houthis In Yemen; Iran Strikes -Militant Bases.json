The questions have been raised over how effective those strikes have been.

This time U.S. Central Command says they went after anti-ship ballistic missiles that were preparing to be launched and posed an imminent threat to international shipping lanes. The U.S. has tried to limit and disrupt the Houthis' ability to target international shipping lanes because of the effect that's had on international shipping, forcing many of the world's largest carriers to go around Africa adding thousands to international shipping routes.The U.S. has tried to degrade the ability of the Houthis to launch the sorts of missiles, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones that they have used to target shipping, but they have not completely destroyed that ability. And several hours after the U.S. strike, the Houthis launched an anti- ship ballistic missile at a Maltese flag carrier. They struck that carrier according to U.S. Central Command doing minor damage. The ship was able to continue on its way but it shows you the threat the Houthi still pose and that's on top of a missile on Monday to damaged a U.S. owned and operated vessel the Gibraltar Eagle, that vessel to suffered minor damage, no injuries and was able to continue on its way. But it's because of this ongoing threat that the U.S. transportation department has recommended that U.S. flagged or U.S. own ships for now avoid the Red Sea. This is an upgrade of a warning or a recommendation they made last week which was supposed to have an end date on it. Now that recommendation to avoid the critical waterway is at least as of right now indefinite. So although the U.S. with the stress that it conducted with the U.K. was trying to restore safety and security to the Red Sea. You can see the turbulence there. You can see the threat still post international shipping and the fallout from the Houthi attacks on one of the world's most critical waterways. Oren Lieberman, CNN in the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, according to the IDF, Hamas fired about 25 rockets into southern Israel Tuesday are the largest barrages in weeks which comes despite Israel's military offensive now into a fourth month. Israel's Iron Dome air defense system intercepted most of the rockets and no injuries were reported. The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility.

The end of Gush Katif, a cluster of Israeli settlements in Gaza dismantled by the government in 2005. Thousands of settlers forced out of their homes under the disengagement law that saw an end to Israel's presence in the Gaza Strip. But after nearly two decades of yearning for return, the movement to do so now appears more emboldened than ever. Among no less than Israeli troops themselves. Social media is now awash in images like these, one of Israel's most popular musicians to the cheers of troops sings about that return. And moving the Nova festival scene of a Hamas massacre to Gaza's beaches. From inside Gaza, soldiers proudly displaying the orange color of protest against the 2005 disengagement.

We were getting radio intercepts where we could hear their infantry shouting that the Bradley was coming and they couldn't do anything against it. They've come a long way since Ukraine's failed counter offensive this past summer, when Bradley's and other Western vehicles were often bogged down by minefields and Russian artillery barrage is unable to unleash their firepower. Now, it often looks like this, Ukraine's 47 mechanized brigade provided us with these videos of what they say is Bradley's firing at Russian infantry positions. They also provided several videos purporting to show a Bradley beating Russia's most capable main battle tank the T-90 in a duel. The Bradley fire salvos at the Russian tank.

A little bit above targets, but still some of the worst economic data that we've seen in about 30 years. Why is this happening? Youth unemployment is high, there Is this real estate crisis, and then this population decline. The number of people having children in China has declined yet again, declined about 2.2 million. China still has a very big population, more than a billion. But it's part of this downward cycle that we have seen. So why is this taking place? Well, for one thing, young people want some freedom. They want some autonomy. You know, in the past, China did have this policy where families could not have more than one children to try to control the population. But now it's this reverse situation. It's an issue that came up recently in Shanghai during a matchmaking event for single people. Take a listen to what one person had to say.

But the area of contention has moved. Very quickly. Your study, again, just focus on YouTube, which appears, this is according to your study, to be making what about $13 million a year from these new denial type of videos. And the company tells CNN, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stopped showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties. Well, the clip we saw earlier has advertising.

What we've said to them is a, you need to fix, you know, you need to improve the quality of your enforcement on the old denial, but you should also include the new denial as another new and vital form of climate denial, because Google claims to be a green company, but you cannot claim to be a green company and at the same time, profit lavishly and amplify broadcast climate denial to billions.",
