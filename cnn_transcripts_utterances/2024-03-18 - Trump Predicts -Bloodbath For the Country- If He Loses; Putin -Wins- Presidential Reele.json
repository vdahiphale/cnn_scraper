Thanks for waking up with us. I'm Kasie Hunt.So the last time that Donald Trump left office you may remember there was an insurrection. If he loses again this November, he is using the word \"bloodbath\" to talk about that. Now, the context is important here. He was talking about the auto industry but, still, listen to the former president at a weekend rally in Ohio. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line and you're not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected. Now, if I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole -- that's going to be least of it. It's going to be a bloodbath for the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They said Trump, quote, \"...wants another January 6, but the American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge.\" President Biden heads to Nevada today for a campaign stop. Joining us now, Gabby Birenbaum of The Nevada Independent, along with Mariana Alfaro, politics breaking news reporter for The Washington Post. Ladies, thank you very much for being here this morning. These remarks obviously have sparked -- you know, Republicans are defending Trump in a somewhat predictable way. Democrats are saying hey, look, you should believe what the guy actually is saying. Listen to his words. I think we have a slightly longer version of that clip of what Trump said about bloodbath that we can play just because I do want to make sure that we have the whole context so our viewers can just watch it and decide for themselves, and then we can talk about it. Take a look at the longer version of the clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he's spoken about acquittal (INAUDIBLE) before. He's reminding people that if you don't vote for him the country is not going to look like the way you're used to seeing it. And that's a lot of the whistles that we've been hearing again for years. It'll be interesting to see how the Biden campaign continues touching back on these comments he's made because they try to do that contrast, right, between, like, Trump issuing all these, like, remarks that are very incendiary and hurtful to a group of people versus Biden being the uniter. We saw this happen last week, too, when he was making fun of Biden's stutter.

And I think there's increasing recognition among senators that if Trump wins they're going to have to work with him on a whole host of issues. A lot of them are interested in 2025 when a lot of the Trump tax cuts expire. They're going to have to renegotiate a lot of policy in that arena.

And because it's so lopsided, people think do I want to risk my life for something that's a hopeless gambit? It's also a way to figure out who is loyal to you, right? It's a loyalty test both for the lieutenants who are senior in the government and also for ordinary citizens to force them to publicly display loyalty to you. So dictators aren't trying to fool that many people. No one really believes, in Russia, this was actually a competitive election.

And then saying that he would basically release them upon becoming president. I mean, you have to sort of give him an unbelievable benefit of the doubt every single time he does this. It's part of his strategy. And he already inspired a violent mob on January 6, 2021, so the risk of violence around this election are enormous and Trump is pouring gasoline on the fire constantly. I mean, he started this reelection bid in Waco, Texas on the 30th anniversary of that attack.

That maybe if the joke hadn't been written, maybe Trump doesn't get angry at Obama and maybe he doesn't make a sort of rolling back of Obama's achievements -- the center of his presidency and so on.But also, that evening, Obama was ordering the special forces to go into Afghanistan -- into, rather, Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden and gambling his presidency on it. And that could have turned out slightly differently depending on some arbitrary, slightly random forces. So we have this narrative that we apply to history and to politics that everything is this neat and tidy story. And a lot of times jokes matter, and personality matters, and arbitrary forces matter. And I think we're living with some of that today with Trump's presidency and the total chaos that was embedded within it.

It's always fun to brag that I did that.But if you want to win your bracket pool it's all about trying to find that champion, right? And there's a stat that can help you do that. It's called KenPom. It measures a team's offensive and defensive efficiency. And every single champion since 2002 has been top 40 in offense and top 22 in defense. [05:55:03] So who qualifies for that right now? You've got Houston, UConn, Purdue, Auburn, Arizona, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Marquette. Those are the only eight teams as of right now that could win the national title. You're like, Andy, there are some good teams missing, right? Well, let me tell you why. Creighton just missed out. They're not good enough in defense right now. Iowa State clearly not good in offense even though their defense is spectacular. Kentucky -- their defense not even close to being able to win a title, according to KenPom. Duke -- they are close but as of right now, according to KenPom, could not win. So what are some other trends we look at? The last 19 champions have been the top 12 in the week six AP poll. Kind of a quirky stat. But who's not here? Auburn. They're not there. Now, UConn -- they're the top overall seed, the favorite to win it all. But since 1974, these are the only two teams that have been able to win back-to-back titles. Duke in the 90s; Florida in the 2000s. Winning back-to-back tournaments is a very hard thing to do. Can Dan Hurley and the Huskies do it? They could but you might not want to pick them just because of how hard it is. Now, if you lost your first conference tournament game, they've never gone -- a team that's done that has never gone on to win the national title. That happened to Tennessee in the SEC Tournament so you can cross them off. Take a look at this map. Look at this line down the middle of the country. Every single champion since 1997 has been east of that line. Arizona -- they're on the wrong side. So what can we do with all this information? Let's do some cross-offs, Kasie.",
