With this in the backdrop, what do you think black men are leaning, and why do you think they're learning more towards Donald Trump than any other Republican candidate in the past?REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY): Well listen, clearly, this man is unfit to be president. You know, sometimes when you look and make your decision you should also judge a person by their character. Dr. King said you look at someone by the -- by the -- by their character, not by the color of their skin. And so, here is a man who clearly continues to talk about Black men in a negative way. That's all he's ever done. Just look at his history. His history is from the beginning -- not renting out to Black people. How many Black men has he ever hired in his business, ever? Look at his personnel. All he's done is the people that he's ripped off. The few people -- the few minority individuals that he might have done business with, most of them at some point lost money as a result of him because he is a guy who himself has gone bankrupt six times. So I think that what Black men is looking and asking for, and I think that the vice president has correctly said is they're asking questions. You know, more Black men will vote for the vice president than anybody else other than Black women. So they're asking questions, and I think that the vice president is answering those questions and talking about what she has done and what she will do, which is what any voter should be doing. So I think that in the end you'll see that Black men will vote in huge numbers for the vice president of the United States.",

And I'd be surprised if that's not what comes through in these interviews she's doing today because their goal is to remind voters of the negatives of Donald Trump, because we see in a lot of polling that a lot of voters remember the positive sense of the economy or having more money in their pockets. And they, the Harris campaign, believes a second Trump term could be far more dangerous, and they want to remind voters of that as they go into the voting booth.",

The three most important states in this election, a whole day with just two weeks left, I want to play a little bit of sound from that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, (R-WY) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  I certainly have many Republicans who will say to me, I can't be public. They do worry about a whole range of things including violence. But they'll do the right thing. And I would just remind people, if you're at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody.

If you kind of look at these three states that fell out of the blue wall in 2016 and Biden put them back in in 2020, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, key to his improvement there was that he ran better than Hillary Clinton did in the big suburban counties, the four suburban counties outside Philadelphia, the wow counties outside of Milwaukee, Dane County, which is Madison, as well as Oakland County outside of Michigan -- outside Detroit. That's where she was in.And in 2022, John, it's important to note the Democratic gubernatorial candidates generally ran better than Biden did two years earlier. That was the first election after the Supreme Court rescinded the nationwide right to abortion. So I'm just back from Oakland County myself. I think if you look at these places, they are the community he is where Harris is most likely to improve on Biden's 2020 performance, particularly with college educated white women, maybe also some of the non-college white women in those communities. And the Cheney appearances, I think, was precisely targeted to try to increase the permission structure, to slice away a few more points of those votes, maybe some among people who identify as Republicans, but certainly among independent voters who had previously voted Republican, mostly on economic issues, but find Trump a threat to their rights, their values, and are receptive to the message that he is a threat to democracy itself.",

And what that means is that the non-college white voters who are the cornerstone of the modern Republican coalition, especially in the Trump era, have continued to decline by about two points as a share of eligible voters, replaced equally by an increase of about a point each among college whites and people of color. What's really significant to me is that in Michigan and Wisconsin, two of the former blue wall states, the decline in non-college whites as a share of the vote exceeded the national average, replaced mostly by the college whites, or the kind of voters that Liz Cheney and a Kamala Harris were focused on yesterday. But in Pennsylvania, the change was less than the national average. And that could be a critical distinction in a race that looks like a butterfly effect race, where like kind of what any flutter in the environment might be enough to change the dynamic between these two coalitions that are utterly antithetical in what they want for the country and almost exactly equal in size.",

Former President Trump, potentially President-elect Trump depending on what happens on election day in the days afterward, he's going to be sentenced in New York on those 34 counts of falsifying business records in November, all of the lawsuits about the election need to be wrapped up by December 11th. All of the counting issues that's kind of the date that Congress decided after the 2020 election. They put this hard date, December 11th, for this -- they call them Certificates of Ascertainment to be finalized, and that sets up the electors, the people who actually do pick the president in our weird system of government, those people meet on December 17th in state capitols.

And what we essentially see is right now the leaders electoral vote total is 276 electoral votes based upon the polls. If you go back since '72 and try and find the closest years, if you go back to 2000, which of course was a historically close election. At the end of the campaign, the poll leaders electoral vote total was just 281 electoral votes. That's where Gore was in the final polls of that campaign. You go back to 2004, George W. Bush was at 296 electoral votes.
