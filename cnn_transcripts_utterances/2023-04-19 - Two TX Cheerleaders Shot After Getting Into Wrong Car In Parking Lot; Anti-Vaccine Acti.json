      "sentences": "Now, to a pair of disturbing back- to-back shootings involving teenagers who made innocent mistakes. One involves a wrong address. The other, a wrong car. Let's start with what happened with the car.Elite cheerleader Payton Washington is recovering this morning just outside of Austin, Texas after police say a man open fire on her and a car full of her teammates after practice. Police say one of them had accidentally gone into his car. CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now live with more on what happened. What a disturbing scenario. ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Oh, no question. Trying to make sense of the senselessness is really difficult for all of the people very close to these four cheerleaders. We are told by the cheerleading coach that these four girls would travel from the Austin area to the Houston area where their team practice. It's a 300-mile round trip. They would do this three times a week. They would go together. And that's why they were coming back so late at night. They're arriving at this parking lot of a grocery store in the town of Elgin, Texas, just outside of Austin, when one of the girls got out of the car to get into her own car. But by mistake, she says she got into the wrong car. When she noticed that there was someone else in it, she got out and got back in her car. But that man got out of the car, came around to where the four girls were. The young woman said she started trying to apologize for making that mistake. And then the man opened fire on them. One of the girls was not very severely wounded. She was treated and released. However, the young woman by the name of Payton Washington, who was a senior in high school is in critical condition. And her coach shared some stunning details about what an impressive young woman, it says Payton Washington was born with only one lung. And despite that obstacle, she says -- her coach says she has rise to -- risen to the top of her sport here. In fact, she had committed to perform with the Baylor Acrobatics and Tumbling team next year in college. Her coach says she's an inspiration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The suit will also include the Memphis Police Department and the individual officers involved with Nichols' death. The 29-year-old black man was brutally beaten by officers during a traffic stop earlier this year. Police body camera footage revealed the violent encounter while Nichols was already restrained. CNN's Nick Valencia is covering this. Nick, what do we expect to happen today? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hey, good morning, John. This has been called a landmark lawsuit by civil rights attorney Ben Crump and it's expected to happen in just under two hours from now, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. Civil rights attorney Crump will be joined by his co-counsel Antonio Romanucci, as well as a retired magistrate judge from the city of Memphis. And all three attorneys cite intentional infliction of emotional distress for lying to Tyre Nichols' mother. If you remember it was shortly after Nichols was taken into custody that officers showed up at Nichols's mother's home to say that he was a suspect in a DUI arrest despite there being no evidence to back up that claim. If you remember, in fact, the police report was riddled with inconsistencies and misleading information. Those five officers involved in Nichols' deadly arrest had been charged with second-degree murder. All of them have pleaded not guilty. There's been so much fallout from Nichol's arrest, including the disbanding of the so-called Scorpion unit. That specialized crime unit. There's also been multiple police reforms passed by the city of Memphis. This press conference is expected to happen at 1:00 p.m. Eastern with this lawsuit now announced. No word yet -- just yet, John, on just how much money the family is seeking. John.",

It's happening on this stage. You can see right behind me. Of course, we should note that Biden has not yet officially launched his reelection campaign.Robert Kennedy hails from one of America's most well-known political families. He is the son of former attorney general, senator, and presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy. The nephew of President John F. Kennedy. It is worth noting though, that Robert Kennedy has not received resounding support from his family. And that's partly due to his history of controversial statements. He has long promoted vaccine skepticism. He authored a book he called \"The Real Anthony Fauci.\" And he came under fire last year for invoking Nazi Germany in an anti- vaccine speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., ANTI-VACCINE ACTIVIST: Even in Hitler's Germany, you could -- you could cross the Alps in Switzerland. You can hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.

I would just also note, his cousin, Caroline Kennedy is serving as a Biden ambassador, as is his aunt, Vicki Kennedy, Ted Kennedy's widow is serving as an ambassador in this administration. And Joe Kennedy III was -- we just saw a went over to Ireland with President Biden. So -- and he's part of -- he's a special envoy for the Biden administration.

I'm not sure they amount to the same thing, in fact, I know they don't, of votes and delegates and the way in which you win a nomination. But I do think sort of the inside game is on display of how DeSantis is playing it, and Trump is playing it. And right now, DeSantis is being a bit outplayed by Trump.So, members of the Florida congressional delegation were endorsing Donald Trump, not their fellow former House member Ron DeSantis -- their current Governor Ron DeSantis, in the days leading up to DeSantis's trip to Washington. The Trump campaign when they were working the phones, they understood they could make some hey, if they could get some Florida Republicans on board with the Trump campaign in advance of this visit, and they did. Listen. Ron DeSantis is known to have on his to-do-list here getting better at sort of the retail personal politicking, backslapping that goes on here. That's not what he's known for. And when you heard from some of his former fellow House members in this meeting, it's not that he was dazzling. In fact, one, Congressman Gooden came out -- a Republican of Texas, announced his support for Trump after he was sitting through the DeSantis meeting, John. So, it was definitely not the trip DeSantis had planned, but I don't think we should read too much into it in thinking that DeSantis before even gets into this race can't mount a substantial challenge.",
