But Duda has presented this, drawing a straight line from Reagan and the fall of the Berlin Wall alongside two very distinguished Poles, as we remember the union leader Lech Walesa, the Polish Pope, John Paul II who together along with then Gorbachev were responsible for the end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union, and all the way to today, decades later, to President Biden, who is, as Duda says and many have pointed out, who is taking that fight to the modern day, protecting all these years later democracy against this rising autocracy and dictatorship.",

Those of us who believe in the rule of law, international norms, human rights, international humanitarian law, sovereignty, democracy, territorial integrity, all of that is at stake right now. And to be frank, as President Zelenskyy has said himself, right from the beginning, those few days before the invasion when he was last at the Munich Security Conference, and I spoke to him on stage back then.He basically told the world that this is not just our fight, it is your fight. You give us the weapons -- this is now what they're saying, give us the weapons to fight your fight. You don't need to put boots on the ground, we will fight it. But it's not just about us. It's about everyone around the world, including you know civilians around the world, citizens who believe that democracy and territorial integrity is the path to follow. And so, we're here one year later, after President Putin has tried to put an end to that. And let's not mistake Putin's goals. It's not really about NATO. It's about anything that strengthens any of his neighbors' approach to the West and to values that are not being upheld inside Russia itself.",

You were there watching as President Biden was there sending that significant message yesterday by making that trip to Ukraine. Obviously, this is something you know, Russian state media has said that Putin is not going to watch Biden's speech, will pay attention to the main themes of it. What are the Ukrainians wanting to hear from President Biden at this moment?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the Ukrainians will be wanting to hear more of what they heard when President Biden was visiting here on this unexpected visit, a doubling down on support, a strengthening of this alliance. They're obviously watching very closely, not necessarily expecting it to come out in this speech, but in the discourse in the coming weeks to hear more about this issue of heavier weaponry, which is something that they have been pushing for, for quite some time. And time really is of the essence now, Kaitlan, with this war grinding on, particularly in the eastern city of Bakhmut where the situation is getting fairly desperate. Russian forces losing a huge amount of soldiers, but also, the Ukrainians are taking many casualties.And there's a growing understanding here that this could turn into something of a stalemate if they don't get the sort of weaponry that they believe that they need to try to finish this off more quickly and to try to actively engage in some kind of a spring offensive. A lot of speculation that they might try to push into the Southeast, and your Melitopol, put pressure on Crimea. These are all lofty ambitions, but they require a lot of ammunition and a lot of weaponry. So, beyond the symbolism of this visit and the importance of the gesture of visiting here, I think they will be constantly looking forward as we go ahead on sort of actual tangible deliverables in terms of promises of heavier, more advanced weaponry, Kaitlan.",

And he portrayed this as a David versus Goliath battle, and that David had to win. But in his words, the sling needs to be made, you know, tougher and stronger. David's sling needs to be you know amplified. And so that is what they want.And look, the West has admitted we are, you know, running short of -- or running out of ammunition.",

You see President Biden, I believe, we're waiting for him to come out on stage any moment now. In this audience, we saw American flags, we saw Ukrainian flags, we saw Polish flags, really an entire group here as they are prepared to hear from President Biden. Phil, when we talk about the support at home and Republican lawmakers, some of them -- not all of them, of course, but some of them who say they want to stop funding Ukraine. They don't want them to get as much support as they've been getting. How much of it is that part of who President Biden will be speaking to tonight?",

Kaitlan, as you know well, the White House officials are cognizant of it, even if they're very firm in their belief that is not representative of the broader Congress. Most importantly for them from a domestic perspective is that the American political support in terms of the country writ large is maintained. Their biggest problem will be when those polls which have started to sag a little bit still well above a majority start to dip significantly.10, 15 Republican --House Republican lawmakers, those do not drive decision-making. They aren't in committee chair positions. They certainly are not representative of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, even House Majority Leader -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but they understand that they need to talk to a domestic audience to get them to understand the why. And I think part of -- while the President will certainly be speaking to European leaders will certainly be speaking to the world writ large, that audience at home will also be a piece of this, making sure people understand, Kaitlan, the stakes and why it is so important, why they've been so willing to do so much over the course of the last year and as you know, very well are going to have to do significantly more in the months ahead.",
