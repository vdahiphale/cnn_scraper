He was involved in an 18-day manhunt for a convicted killer who escaped a Pennsylvania prison back in 1999. I appreciate your time. I'm trying to get a sense right, given these fast moving developments, the suspect now being armed with a weapon, how does that change the dynamic for law enforcement? SCOTT DUFFEY, INVOLVED IN A SIMILAR MANHUNT IN SAME AREA IN 1999:  So that changes everything. And good morning to both of you, Phil and Poppy. So what we had before, and it lasted about 11 days, was a dragnet. So he escaped prison. He didn't get very far. He got into a wooded area in that Chester County, Route 152, that Longwood Gardens, a very different difficult terrain for law enforcement to be able to get eyes on him, right, other than these trail cams that were popping up and giving law enforcement indication that he was still in perimeter. And then after about 11, 12 days, he breaks that perimeter. It's not shocking. It's disappointing. But it is part of the fugitive game where it's a cat-and-mouse game. And so the chase is on.",

And so when you have that short term game plan, and now retrieving a gun, he doesn't look like he's trying to flee the area, otherwise he would keep making a north-south, whatever he believed was a way to continue to escape law enforcement. But now breaking into a house or a shed, wherever he got this gun, and arming himself, it's -- it appears to me that his game plan is now to fight.

That really saturated the ground, and then they get another seven inches from this month, and just within the past day another five. So that just set the scene for flooding. This is what was really the peak of the rainfall event near Leominster, Massachusetts, in Worcester county. The storm system responsible for it is exiting the New England coastline. We are in a bit of a break.But look at this. This is yet another cold front that's going to bring more rainfall to the area tomorrow. So the potential for flash flooding does exist there. Fitchburg, Massachusetts, just in a one- hour period, approached three inches of rain. The storm total even higher than that, exceeding a half a foot, even nine inches in some locations, including Leominster. You can see rainfall totals highest across Providence into Rhode Island, central and northern Massachusetts. The good news is the flash flood emergency that was in place across Worcester County has expired at 8:00 a.m. local time. We still have a flood warning in effect, the resulting effects from the ongoing rain that has taken place overnight. But that has come to an end. There is the break. But again, additional rainfall in store with a cold front approaching from the west. There's our flash flood threat for the day tomorrow. And then, Poppy and Phil, we need to focus on what's going to happen to Lee. Will that bring rainfall to Massachusetts, potentially New England?

North Korea is a pariah state. It's been under sanctions for years and years and years. At the very most, it has ammunition to give to Russia or whatever. Nobody believes that what it gives to Russia if it does, will dramatically affect the status quo on the battlefield in Ukraine. It also points out how stretched Russia is that it would need to reach out in that kind of way. Obviously, North Korea is probably the one coming in hand for whatever it can get from Russia. But what you have, as you just said, is a group of countries, Iran as well, where Russia is trying to get drone technology and the like, that Russia is now having to rely on, all of which are under sanctions. Any such deals would be a violation of international law.

On the other hand, a huge responsibility given CNN's massive and important platform and its reach. But I feel that you know, it's a cliche you really do have to shine that light in places where many don't go. Iran has always been a pariah. I'm half Iranian, you know ever since I started work, I've sort of had to juggle and straddle this position, having empathy for those who are victims of that regime, including wrongfully detained Americans. And so, when I got the chance, for instance, to interview Siamak Namazi, I jumped into it. I did not know what the consequence to him would be. That was my biggest fear, What would the consequence be to him? Nobody has ever done that before. Called out that he had phone privileges by virtue of being in there for eight and a half years. He had moved from harsh solitary confinement into a better, less harsh and with other fellow Americans. But, as you say, the Balkans. That taught me what it means to tell the truth, that in the Balkans when there was a clear aggressor, the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic. A clear victim, the Bosnian state that had just declared independence wanted to be democratic, and pro-Western. It was the first war in Europe since World War II. Not Ukraine and Russia, that was it.
