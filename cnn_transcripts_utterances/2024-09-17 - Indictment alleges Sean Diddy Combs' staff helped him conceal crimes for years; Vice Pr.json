This morning, New York prosecutors laid out a sweeping indictment against the celebrity rap mogul, accusing him of racketeering, sex trafficking, and other crimes dating back decades. Prosecutors say Combs used his entire organization to force women to perform sex acts with prostitutes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S, ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Combs allegedly planned and control the sex performances, which he called freak-offs. And he often electronically recorded them. The freak-off sometimes lasted days at a time, involved multiple commercial sex workers and often involved a variety of narcotics such as ketamine, ecstasy and GHB, which Combs distributed to the victims to keep them obedient and compliant. (END VIDEO CLIP) KEILAR: Authorities showed some of the items that they say were seized from Combs's properties, including three AR15s, one with its serial number obscured. CNN Correspondent Kara Scannell is outside the federal courthouse in New York. Kara, what are we expecting to happen during this appearance?",

Now, this main question here today, this issue before them, is whether he will be released on any bail. And a prosecutor said that he should be detained because they said not only is he a flight risk, but he also has a long history of violence toward women, all laid out in that indictment. They also say he has access to weapons, some of those that you mentioned and that ties into that. And that he also, as part of these charges, has tried to intimidate some witnesses, telling them to come up with a false narrative if they were questioned by prosecutors.But then one of the main things that they laid out here was also his access to money. What prosecutors wrote in the court filing was that Diddy has access to dozens of bank accounts, some personal and many under corporate entities, which contain millions of dollars. The defendant's vast resources make him a flight risk even without a passport, private plane, or multiple residences. Now, Diddy's lawyers have offered up a bail package of about $50 million that would be backed by some of his homes, including a mansion in Miami. That will all be up for the judge to decide. Now, his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, we caught up with him before he walked into court today. He said that if his client is asked to enter a plea, he will plead not guilty to these charges. Here's more of what Diddy's attorney said.",

In other words, it's possible that federal prosecutors could come back with additional charges against Routh. Now, DeSantis, at a news conference this morning, said that the state of Florida has jurisdiction to file some these charges in at least two counties, one here in West Palm where the incident took place, and another up in Martin County where the accused was taken into custody.

How a man was on that property adjacent, so close to the golf course where the President was golfing. It is stunning. It is shocking. It is sobering. I'm on the task force, as you know. It is a bipartisan task force created and mandated by Congress in a unanimous vote, 416 to nothing to get at the truth.So when I hear the former President make statements, sweeping statements, without any evidence as to who is to blame, I ask for caution. I am so thankful that he was not injured, that no one was injured in this case. But we must not leap to conclusions. It is our words that matter. And it is words that can incite violence. There is no place for political violence. And there is no place for naming people as guilty of something when you have absolutely no evidence.

My district, my constituents, care desperately about this upcoming election cycle. And as you say, if 10,000 votes are tossed out, it could be a problem.For example, in 2016, Mr. Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes across the entire commonwealth. In 2020, Mr. Biden won by 80,000 votes. So that is just a few votes per precinct. So every vote counts, and I want every correct, by correct, I mean legitimate vote to be counted.
