And then as we finish out the weekend and start the early next week, you're going to start to see a lot of that heat begin to spread into the northeast, as well as into the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.Take for example a lot of these cities, Omaha, Green Bay, and Chicago, all looking at temperatures in the 90s over the next several days. And they're not the only one. Minneapolis, for example, the average high this time of year is 78 degrees. The forecast on Sunday expected to reach triple digits. Now, not only will that break the daily record of 97 set back in 1925. It could also end up being only the second time ever in recorded history for Minneapolis reaching the triple digits in the month of September. The previous is all the way back in 1931 when they hit 104 degrees. Now, that's one of the few spots that are going to end up reaching records. In fact, we're looking at over 100 possible records, not just in the Midwest but also spreading into the northeast and the mid- Atlantic just over the next several days. Looking at the northeast, for example, New York. Looking at the next several days all with highs in the 90s. The average right now is 81. Washington, D.C., 90s the next few days, likely to top out at 100 by the time we get to Tuesday of the upcoming week.

Speaking of blackouts, the local power company is reporting that 9,300 households are already having blackouts. And in addition to that, two people were injured. There were a couple driving a van, the van was hit by a tree, and the van was severely damaged. They were sent to a hospital. Fortunately, they are OK right now. Now, air transport. The Taoyuan Airport in North Taiwan, that's close. Southern airport, Taichung Airport also close. So, 226 plus domestic flights are canceled, plus 41 and more international flights are canceled. So, if our viewers are seeking flight to transit here in Taipei or destinations Taiwan, you have to check with your travel agent. This flight is definitely affected. Now, Kim, I must mention this.

And every American rightly expects FEMA to show up when they are needed to help in disaster.

But later, DeSantis' office told reporters that that would not be the case. Now, officials have maintained that the Biden administration, as well as the governor's office had worked together to plan for the visit and they mutually agreed on a location. But instead, DeSantis toured other parts of the state on Saturday. Now, when asked about this, President Biden said that he was not disappointed but he did call for Republicans and Democrats to come together in Congress for additional funding. Just this week the White House added another $4 billion to their request for FEMA's disaster relief funds after already asking for $12 billion last month.

He was just having a great time. Free concert in someone's backyard. I don't even know who these people were. We got done at -- and we went to go home finally.

He said quite simply, Ukrainian forces are moving forward despite everything. And no matter what anyone says, we are advancing and that is the most important thing. We are on the move.Now, the what everyone says is a clear reference to, clearly, comments he's received. Criticism, perhaps of how slow this counteroffensive appears to have been moving. And I think that confidence, really, that insistence that he's having there is perhaps because there has been some progress. There have been some marginal gains on this southern frontier, this front line that we've been talking about. Robotyne, a village in the Zaporizhzhia region, they recently recaptured from the Russians. That is a clear success for the Ukrainians. And they have been moving further, progressing further on south and east, eventually heading towards the Sea of Azov. But it's worth noting in your reference there earlier about the Donetsk region that they are also targeting other areas, but the Russians also are, too. We talk about Donetsk, there was also some shelling by the Russians as well. Some Ukrainians injured overnight. And it's a reminder of the civilian toll of this conflict that while Ukraine is targeting this one particular area of the front line, there is a very long front line with the other areas also still receiving a lot of Russian attacks.

And what we've been since Russia then withdraw from this deal earlier this year is that there have been a lot of accusations of Russia targeting this port infrastructure, targeting areas where this grain is produced, including warehouses. And what we've seen in the early hours, is yet again this port infrastructure in Odessa being targeted. You can see there was fire as a result. Ukraine says that firefighters were quick to distinguish it but it did result in two people wounded as well as a result. So, clearly these kind of drone attacks are going to continue.

Since Sudan's basketball team is going next year's Paris games as the highest ranked African team, that's by a virtue of their win over Angola in the basketball World Cup, and Egypt's lost to New Zealand. South Sudan has been an independent country for just 12 years.Meanwhile, Paris is also getting set to host the Paralympic Games next year. And the French capital is already being transformed to be more accessible for athletes and those attending the competitions. CNN's Jim Bitterman checks out the makeover and the stumbling blocks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BITTERMANN (voiceover):  With less than a year to go before Paris hosts the next the Paralympics, officials have been showing off how much work has been done. With President Emmanuel Macron having promised 1.5 billion Euros. To assure the accessibility of the competition to athletes, visitors, and tourists. But accessible is a word scoffed at by some disabled like Franck Maille. Though for a tour with Maille, a Paralympic medal winner himself, in Paris' most accessible public transport systems and you see the problems which face the 350,000 disabled visitors expected to attend next year's games. When Maille comes into the city for instance, he uses a renovated trainline equipped with elevators, making it accessible but he points out not accessible without help. And while there are elevators, they're sometimes hard to find or not functioning. As of disabled British visitor, Fera Dell (ph). FERA DELL (PH), BRITISH VISITOR IN PARIS:  All of the lifts were broken, every single one. BITTERMANN (voiceover):  And if the most modern subway line has problems, the 13 other older lines are the famous Paris metro, a simply impossible for disabled users.",

And most of the stations are like this one, not accessible to anyone who can't go up and down the stairs. The metro system is gradually making improvements. Officials don't believe that more than 14 percent of it will be wheelchair accessible by 2024 in the Olympic games. Just by comparison, Tokyo's system was 90 percent accessible for the last Olympic games.BITTERMANN (voiceover):  Even the mayor of Paris admits there are problems. ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS MAYOR (through translator):  The metro, which is very ancient, cannot be made totally accessible. BITTERMANN (voiceover):  But the mayor quickly pivots to the brand-new tramways, built at ground level which shouldn't be a problem for those in wheelchairs. And she points out the buses which are being renovated and equipped with ramps. But the disabled who actually use the buses say, it's not that simple. FRANCK MAILLE, APF FRANCE HANDICAP (through translator):  Because, for example, sometimes the extendible ramp doesn't work or the drivers don't know how to use them. BITTERMANN (voiceover):  While the mobility issue remains a priority, there are others. Housing for instance. The tens of thousands of hotel rooms and short-term apartment rental and the city's historic buildings, only a tiny fraction are fully usable by people in wheelchairs. And there is the further question of access to the bars, the bathroom in small businesses, they're a part of the Paris scene. Despite the challenges, Maille is still a big supporter of next year's game. MAILLE (through translator):  What I'd say to people is come. Come to see Paris, that's clear. Don't be surprised that Paris is not more accessible, that it's not the best of the best because there's still so much work to be done. BITTERMANN (voiceover):  Maille and other disability rights activists were hoping the games could transform, not just infrastructure, but also attitudes toward the disable. Yet with less than a year to go before the games, they say, that looks increasingly doubtful. Jim Bittermann, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
