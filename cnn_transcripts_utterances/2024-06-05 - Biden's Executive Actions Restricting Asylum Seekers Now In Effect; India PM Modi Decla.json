So first two, for starters, right out the gate, we saw Republicans slamming this effort by the Biden administration, essentially saying it's A, it's too little too late and accusing the President of making a purely political move. Of course, because we've seen in all the polls, that immigration is the top issue, that voters trust former President Trump over President Biden to handle the issue of immigration.So they're saying that this is totally a political thing. Speaker Mike Johnson calling it, quote, weak and window dressing. So that's been the general consensus among Republicans. Democrats have been formed more interesting in aftermath of this executive order because they've been pretty split. We've got progressives and liberals who are sounding off on this executive order, arguing that it goes way too far. We've seen especially folks from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus saying that an enforcement only order is not the way to do this. There needs to be some sort of path to citizenship, and again, accusing the president of making a purely political move. But then we've seen some more centrist and moderate Democrats who are in those tough races running against Republicans, running against Republicans in districts that maybe are a little more purple or lean a little bit red, who are saying that this was a good move by the president. Clearly, the situation at the southern border need to be addressed, this issue cannot be ignored. The president did it in a in a good fashion while noting that this is, we got to this point because Republicans were not allowed that bipartisan border deal to progress through Congress.",

I imagine will be successful this time round.Look, I think that former President Trumps statement, right there is just emblematic of the political importance that is the issue of immigration and the situation at the southern border in the lead up to November. Republicans know they have the upper hand on this issue. They know they're leading with it. They're running away with it. It's a true vulnerability for President Biden. That's why they didn't want to hand him a win when the bipartisan border deal came up in the senate, both in February and last month. We're seeing the same thing right now. Republicans don't want to praise this policy, even though they may actually agree with it. You know, it is something, it is putting some sort of limit at the border which obsessively you would imagine they would be in favor of, but they don't want to say that because they don't want to give President Biden credit on this very important issue when we just really around the corner from the election.",

MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  It was a surprised, because the polls really showed that there was going to be a landslide. He's seen as a very powerful figure, the opposition have been a weak in previous elections, but bounce back a bit this time. And this is where he really went down in history. So he's going into a third term only in Nehru has done who was seen by many as the founding father of a modern India. So he's seen as this very powerful figure who didn't quite swing it in the way he had hoped. But we have to remember he did win his BJP party is still very much in control. But the challenge now is finding an alliance partner. There are about five kingmakers I was told by an engine expert earlier today that he'll have to work with to make it work long term.

And we take a look at some of these high temperatures. Yes. Places like Phoenix, Vegas do get hot and were headed into the summer heat season. But even for them, this is dangerously hot, this early in the season. Your average high in Vegas this time of year is 96 degrees, but it could be candy, some of their earliest 110 degree temperatures on record, same thing for Phoenix, your average is around 100, but we're looking at temperature is getting up to 110, 115, Palm Springs as well at temperatures of good 10 degrees above average. So you can see these temperatures are 10 to 15 degrees above average from Sacramento to Vegas and Salt Lake City. As we go through Thursday and Friday as well as this heat just continues to sink. So, we're looking at major too extreme impacts, again from southern California through parts of Arizona, even stretching into southern Texas. It's dangerously hot for early June, making people more vulnerable to heat sickness, were not I really acclimated to this type of heat yet. So you want to check on children, elderly, and pets. Now, take a look at this. It has been 25 years since Las Vegas has hit a daily cold low temperature 25 years, they have had so many more records for heat than they have for cold. And that is because the summer season is hotter in Vegas, a 5.6 degree fever since 19 70, they have nearly 40 more warm days in summer -- Kasie.",

It's day three of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial in Delaware. Court began yesterday with the jury hearing opening statements. Prosecutors and defense attorneys battling over the one fundamental issue, whether the president's son lied about being an addict when he purchased a gun in 2018. Prosecutor Derek Hines telling the jury, quote, we would not be here today if he was just a drug addict. He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied during a federal background check. Addiction may not be a choice, but lying and buying a gun is a choice. Biden's central defense in the case that he did not consider himself an addict at the time of the purchase. Biden's defense attorney reminding the jury, quote, what's common to all three charges is the requirement that prosecutors left off their slide. They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law. During witness testimony, prosecutors used Hunter's own words against him, playing several passages from the audio book for his 2021 memoir. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",
