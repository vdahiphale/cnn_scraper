Mass graves are uncovered across Syria revealing the brutality of the Assad regime.Russian officials are vowing revenge after a top general was killed by a hidden bomb. And the man accused of murdering a healthcare CEO is indicted in New York. We'll have details on the charges. We begin in Syria where civilians who fled the country during its 13- year-old civil war are beginning to return home after the fall of the Assad regime. The United Nations refugee agency says 1 million Syrians are expected to return in the first half of next year. And that's not including the many refugees who have already spontaneously returned to Syria from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The UNHCR has released a plan seeking $310 million to address the critical needs of the refugees going back to Syria and the more than 7 million people internally displaced in the country. The U.N. says Syria is still facing humanitarian challenges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEIR PEDERSEN, U.N. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR SYRIA: The second challenge is the sheer scale of needs. Syria's economy has been ravaged by this dreadful conflict, its infrastructure destroyed, 90 percent of Syrians living in poverty. Let me just stress that these are enormous challenges that will require all of our support. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of the first images emerging of what are believed to be mass graves that may have been used by the regime to bury some of those who were first taken to the detention centers and then tortured to death.One at Qutayfah, which is on the outskirts of Damascus, not very far from the Syrian capital, where one advocacy group has been speaking of the truckloads of bodies that were brought each week. What we understand is that four tractor trailers carrying 150 bodies each were brought twice a week between 2012 and 2018 to this particular site. Now be the subject of a search for some of those bodies in the hope that some may be identified. Another site in the southern province of Dira, also now believed to be another of those mass burial sites as Syrians try and establish the identities of some of the 150,000 people who've disappeared to try and figure out if any of them may lie in these sites. That's according to the International Commission on Missing Persons. Still, many relatives frantically searching for their loved ones and their hopes that they might be alive. But these are the clearest indication yet, the first tangible proof of what we've long heard about from outside of Syria during the Assad regime of the brutality of its secret services, the brutality of its detention centers. With many of those bodies now no doubt beyond recognition, it's unclear also for the time being how many people may have been buried there. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That four tractor trailers would come to this specific Al-Qutayfa mass grave site twice a week, each of them having at the very least 100 bodies, most of the time 150 or more.They would come every week from 2012 until 2018. The number that I actually, you know, in my conversation with Reuters, was very conservative, you know, saying 100,000 at the very, very least. But if you look at the numbers and you look at these witnesses that work these mass graves, dug them, pulled the bodies in from these trucks that were coming in twice a week for, you know, quite a few years, you can see that we're looking at 300,000 bodies or potentially more.

The excavator driver wanted to dig a hole, but the intelligence officers, the security officers of the Assad regime said, no, leave them out for a while and then we'll figure them out later.

We need international experts, we need governments to go help the new Syrian government secure these places and then help us figure out, OK, well, then how do we go about preserving evidence, preserving the chain of evidence, having DNA tests, giving people closure that are still looking for loved ones that may be already buried in these horrific mass graves?",

Top officials from the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt are all touting progress in the negotiations. The Biden administration believes a deal is closer than it has been, but says there are sticking points that remain between Israel and Hamas. A group of former Israeli hostages who were released last year say they fear for the safety of those still held captive in Gaza.

      "sentences": "Well, Hamas now becomes the latest party to these negotiations to express some optimism about the prospects of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release deal. We have heard optimistic comments over the course of the last week from U.S., Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials and now Hamas is joining the fray.But as with the others who are expressing optimism, Hamas is also adding a note of caution to their comments. In their statement, they are making clear that, quote, Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions. And that if is indeed that note of caution that they are raising, suggesting that Israeli negotiators are making an additional demands as this negotiating process moves forward. A second Hamas source said that they view the current state of negotiations as, quote, positive and optimistic. And it is important to note that amid this optimism, we are also seeing a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region. The U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, just last week traveled to Israel, Egypt and Qatar to try and advance a deal. He said he hopes that he can put the conditions in place to reach a deal within the next month. And that is indeed the target here appears to be to try and reach a deal before President Biden leaves office on January 20, and President-elect Trump will then be inaugurated. And we know, of course, that the Biden administration has also been closely coordinating with the Trump administration over this deal, as incoming Trump advisers have also been traveling to the region and coordinating closely with the officials who they will soon be replacing. It is important to caution, though, that as we are seeing this momentum, as we are seeing this optimistic language, the reason why we are also hearing notes of caution from all of the parties involved is because we have been this close in the past. We have been very close to a deal. And ultimately, talks have collapsed and that possibility still very much looms. But Israeli and American officials who I've spoken to have pointed to a new set of conditions in the region in terms of Hamas being increasingly isolated. Israel having accomplished a slew of military achievements in Gaza, including the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar then might make them more willing to reach a deal. Now, all of this pointing us in the direction of a potential cease fire and hostage deal. But again, the deal isn't reached until it's done. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Electors in Texas gave Mr. Trump the victory when they awarded the state's 40 electoral votes Tuesday in Austin. The nationwide tally is a constitutionally-required formalization of the November 5th vote, where Donald Trump won 312 electoral college votes and Kamala Harris took 226. It takes 270 of the 538 electoral votes to win the White House. The electoral tally is now sent to Congress, where lawmakers will meet in joint session on January 6th to officially declare Donald Trump president. Mr. Trump is taking a new shot at what he perceives as left-wing media bias against him. He's suing pollster Ann Selzer and her firm, along with \"The Des Moines Register\" newspaper and its parent company, Gannett. Selzer's poll, published days ahead of the November election, showed Kamala Harris with a surprising lead over Trump in Iowa. That lead never materialized, and Trump ultimately won the state by 13 points. He says the news coverage of the poll was intended to artificially help Democrats, and that Selzer committed election interference. The Federal Reserve is set to hold its final meeting of the year in the coming hours. Investors are watching for predictions about the incoming Trump administration. And they are waiting to see if the Federal Reserve follows through with an expected interest rate cut for the third time this year. More now from CNN's Julia Chatterley in New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent in their final meeting of the year, making it a nice round one percentage point of cuts to borrowing costs for the year. But then comes the tougher part, which involves communicating some kind of plan for 2025. And that includes what's widely expected to be a pause in the cutting cycle in January. Why? Well, it's a few things. And actually a lot of it's good news, including solid growth, tracking up more than 3 percent annualized. We can then add in a stronger than expected labor market plus a U.S. consumer that's actually increased spending into the holiday season. Then there's rising prices that actually have cooled a lot, but not enough. And then comes the bad news. Plenty of geopolitical risk, whether that's the Middle East, Ukraine or the potential impact of tariff policy from President-Elect Donald Trump. Now, the decision to pause rate cuts though would be far more, I think, about the relative economic strength, at least in my mind, than future policy decisions like tariffs that may not in fact materialize. So first comes their updated economic projections and the so-called dot plot of where they think cuts in rates can come next year. Now, if you remember back in September, they were thinking four rate cuts next year. That could very likely be reduced to just three cuts based on what they see today. Though, let's be clear, as we've seen this year, nothing is set in stone. And Fed chair Jerome Powell will likely be keen to emphasize the degree of flexibility when he speaks on Wednesday. And that leaves the Fed with a core message that they've cut rates a full percentage point, that the economy is doing pretty well and that they do remain data dependent and that they can't react to things like tariffs until they get them. And then they'll see how things progress between now and the January meeting. Julia Chatterley, CNN -- New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The commentary that you just heard about the large -- largest earthquake and the most shocking results of an earthquake in the Pacific is very true. And the population is very shocked and saddened by what has happened. The main focus of efforts at the moment is on that search and rescue in the downtown area of the capital of Vanuatu, Port Vila. A number of buildings collapsed and people have been trapped in those buildings with the search and rescue efforts being absolutely phenomenal and a lot of effort is going into that. But there has also been major infrastructure damage to the wharf from a landslide, to the main hospital that has no active operating theater at the moment. So there's an outdoor triage area that has been set up to assist people. There's still quite a bit of confusion, but certainly the efforts for search and rescue are the primary focus of what's going on at the moment, as well as assessing damage outside of the capital in community areas to understand what the situation is there.",

Communications have been restored, which is great. Step by step, we're seeing improvements there hour by hour. But getting those goods out is tricky. Certainly the Red Cross warehouse suffered some damage.

Both these assassination attempts were foiled, the Pope said, by the U.K. intelligence services and by the Iraqi police. Now, of course, Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was under the control of Islamic state from 2014 to 2017. In his autobiography, the Pope says he was advised strongly against visiting Iraq due to the security risk and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Pope said he was determined to make the trip to a country that is rich in biblical history, and of course, is home to one of the world's oldest Christian communities that has faced extensive persecution in recent years. Whilst in Iraq, the Pope was also able to have an historic meeting with the Grand Ayatollah Al-Sistani, a leading Shia authority in Islam. The news of the assassination attempts against the Pope came as Francis marked his 88th birthday, making him one of the oldest popes in the church's history.
