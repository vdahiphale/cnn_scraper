Nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. Trump's defense lawyer says it's called democracy. The prosecution claims it's a criminal conspiracy. We'll wrap up the fifth day of the Donald Trump hush money trial. Columbia University in crisis. The school moves to virtual classes amid simmering tensions. Student protests spread to Yale University, where pro- Palestinian supporters are arrested. President Biden condemns antisemitic attacks. And TikTok strikes back. The Chinese-owned video sharing app talks action ahead of moves to ban it. That conversation is coming up. But first, the historic criminal trial against a former U.S. president. In Monday's opening statements, prosecutors said Donald Trump tried to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election by preventing damaging stories about him from becoming public. Now, they told jurors, in part, \"This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up. It was election fraud, pure and simple.\" But the defense team tried to discredit the point, saying, \"Trump fought back to protect his family, his reputation, and his brand. This is not a crime. There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\" And speaking outside the courtroom, the former president said the case is keeping him off the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is what took me off and takes me off the campaign trail. Because I should be in Georgia now. I should be in Florida now. I should be in a lot of different places right now campaigning. And I'm sitting here. And this will go on for a long time. It's very unfair. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If other issues arise with the main 12 jurors, you know, there need to be at least 12 jurors at the conclusion of this case to deliberate or else there would be a mistrial.

They took notes throughout the openings and testimony so far. But, you know, it was just a short day today.

Primarily focusing on a key witness, Michael Cohen, who is a controversial witness as well. The government, however, found themselves in an interesting situation when the defendants put on their opening statement, where they went into areas that had already been ruled by the judge to be out of bounds. And so, they objected to, which you don't like to do in an opening statement, but they objected to several areas that the Trump attorney went into in his opening statement, and that objection was sustained by the judge. It was primarily had to do with Michael Cohen and characterizations of whether or not Trump had -- was implying attorney advice had guided him through this, when indeed that was not a legitimate defense and had been ruled out. And the other area was whether Michael Cohen had lied and in what form.

All U.S. employees, all your data is in the U.S. But they're still owned fundamentally by ByteDance. And this is the problem.

The first time theprosecutors have ever presented a criminal case against a former U.S. president. Manhattan prosecutors and the Trump defense both presented their opening arguments to the jury in the Trump hush money case, and the first witness, took the stand. I want to bring in our Alice Stewart, a CNN political commentator and Republican strategist. Really good to see you, Alice. And a reminder, you and I have been parsing Trump politics now for nearly nine years, and yet, neither of us would have ever envisioned anything like this historic day. I want you to help us be clear on the political impact. It's true, right, even if convicted, Donald Trump could still run, he could still win, and he could still serve his full term as president? ALICE STEWART, U.S. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, he absolutely could. And you're right, Paula, who would have ever thought we would be having this conversation when we first started talking many years ago. But look, legally, if he is convicted, which is an if, yes, he could certainly run for president, and he could certainly serve as president. But the question is politically. And I think there's three different camps to look at. One is Republicans, his base. Look, they're looking at this trial. They're not going to change their mind. They think, as he does, that this is weaponization of the Justice Department. They look at this as trying to silence President Biden's biggest opponent, and they believe with him that he is a victim of the justice system. And they would much rather have his policies in the White House, then Biden's policies in the White House. Then you have the Democrats who look at this certainly as an opportunity to point out that Donald Trump has done some things wrong and you do the crime, you do the time as, as they say, and there are consequences for his actions. And they certainly don't want him in the White House and are going to do everything they can to stand against him. Paula, as you know, we're now in a general election. Those votes are not what's going to decide this election. It is the independent voters in America and the late deciders and how they're looking at this trial. They're looking at this, in some regards, in a passing fancy in terms, they're looking simply from the standpoint of this is a charge right now, and he's not been convicted. The question is, they don't see this as anything to doom his campaign at this point. But if he's convicted, it could certainly change the perspective and change their mind and change the game. So, that's what they're looking at. The other component of this, Paula, as you know, if he's acquitted, if he is found not guilty in this case, that could raise a lot of questions about, well, maybe he is a victim. Maybe he is being unduly targeted. So, that does raise a lot of concerns. But, Paula, I travel across this country. I was in Nashville, Tennessee over the weekend, and I can tell you, voters here in America are looking at what's impacting them. They're looking at the economy. They're looking at the border. They're looking at safety. They're looking at this important national security issues. Certainly, what you just spoke about with regard to Ukraine, and they're seeing whose policies help me better in that area. And the polls right now show that Donald Trump is ahead of Joe Biden in many of the battleground states and that bodes well for Trump. They're not focused on this trial.

Trump is also on track to receive another 36 million new shares in Trump Media if the stock price stays above a key target of $17.50 a share at the end of trade Tuesday. Trump Media ended Monday session, in the meantime, you can see it there, more than 2 percent down. But hey, well above that key level. Now, I asked Axios senior media reporter Sara Fischer about the outlook for Trump's media stock. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is essentially a startup, but even inthat definition, it doesn't have any really strong revenue targets that it's making or anything like that. What do you see happening to the stock? Because the people who run it still continue to say it can be turned into a big media company.",

And so, investors were optimistic that they could one day convert that huge will engage user base into revenue. Truth Social, not only will they not tell us how many users they have, but all third-party proxy metrics would suggest that they have barely any users, right? Maybe a few million. And so, if retail investors -- remember, a lot of the people who are buying into this stock are not big institutional banks. They're everyday people trading off of Donald Trump's brand. If retail investors one day can get past the fact that this stock is not performing alongside its financial reality, then they're going to pull away. If they continue to ride the coattails of Donald Trump's popularity, they'll continue to stay engaged. But we've seen historically with every meme stock, whether it was Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or GameStop, that the momentum does typically fall. Eventually retail investors get out because they've recognized they're going to lose money. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

STU ZAKIM, FORMER SENIOR VP OF COMMUNICATIONS, AMERICAN MEDIA INC.: Pecker and Trump have been friends since magazines really ruled the roost in New York City in the '90s. You got to remember, David Pecker launched George Magazine with JFK Jr. So, at that time, when Trump was on the rise as a real estate mogul in New York City, logically, he went after a media owner who's going to help advance his career.
