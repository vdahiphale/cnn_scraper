And, so that's one of the reasons why I expect we haven't heard anything about it, from the Kremlin's side. They don't want to point to the failings of their own Military infrastructure. I think one of the other important issues, though, is that what we've learned, over the past couple of days, is that the de-confliction channels, between the United States, and Russia, are, in some ways, operational. [21:05:00] The Russians told the United States, according to U.S. officials, that this ICBM test launch was going to take place, so they gave them a heads-up, just like the United States, according to the U.S. National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, informed the Russians that Joe Biden would be walking around, in Kyiv. And so, despite all this bluster, between the two sides, and we had more of it, today, from the dueling speeches, of the Presidents of Russia and the United States, there are still communication channels that are open, Wolf.",

There is no clear end game, at this point in time. There is a long road ahead.And that was a driving force, behind President Biden's remarks, here, in Warsaw, trying to steel, a coalition that has been remarkably durable, that has been able to stick together, more than two dozen countries, across continents, with countervailing pressures, on the economic side, on the domestic side, sticking together, through the course of nearly a year. And they know that they're going to have to stick together, for even longer. When you talk to White House officials, they acknowledge that reality. They acknowledge the amount of work that lies ahead, and they acknowledge the fact that on all countries, defense industrial bases have certainly been winnowed. That will be something that will need to be addressed. New weapons packages, will have to be sent to Ukraine. New funding will need to be developed and drawn over as well. But more than anything else, what you've heard from the President, what you heard from White House officials, in recent weeks, but most certainly, over the course of the last dramatic 48 hours, was that they need to steel for what's ahead. And part of what the President's message was tonight was about the importance of doing just that, and the stakes, and just how broad and wide-ranging they are, far beyond just Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, but for freedom, for democracy, and for a fight that has a generational tent, and perhaps could be more than anything else in the years ahead, Wolf.",

Russia and the United States have 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads, according to the Federation of American Scientists, with Russia estimated to hold a moderate numeric advantage, although of course every single nuke is a serious matter.The New START Treaty says each country is limited to just over 1,500 deployed warheads, ready to be used, immediately. For example, researchers estimate Russia has 812, on land-based ballistic missiles, about 576, on submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and possibly 200, at heavy bomber bases. Modern thermonuclear weapons are much, much more powerful than the atomic bombs the U.S. dropped, on Japan, in World War II. In Hiroshima, an official U.S. estimate says perhaps 200,000 people died, from the blast, and related sickness, over five years. Now, some scientists say a single big nuke, dropped on a major city, could kill more than a half million people, instantly. What's more? Some nukes are designed for very specific purposes. For example, researchers say, a Russian government document indicates their long-range nuclear torpedo, known as Poseidon, could travel thousands of miles, underwater, to strike harbors, creating, quote, \"Areas of wide radioactive contamination that would be unsuitable for military, economic or other activities, for long periods of time.\" And none of this even addresses the idea of Russia's shorter-range nukes, designed for battles, like those, with Ukraine. Treaties to control or limit all of this date back to 1963. And the latest extension of the New START Treaty, signed by the U.S., and Russia, in 2021, was supposed to last five years. But now, Russia, while not officially pulling out of the deal, is suspending its participation, even as some nuclear control advocates say, there is no provision in this deal for a suspension. Russia either fulfills its duty or breaks its promise. Wolf?",

Such is the sympathy and compassion that he has evoked. He has been a truly inspirational war leader. And in one crucial respect, he has successfully mimicked Winston Churchill himself, because it is clear from what Joe Biden had to say, this afternoon, that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has mobilized the United States of America. And when America comes in, on the side of freedom, as America is today, in Ukraine, in my view, there is only going to be one outcome. This is a war for independence. The Ukrainians are fighting, for their independence. And history teaches us that Wars of Independence only end one way.

DUDA (through translator): The difference of potentials between Ukraine and the Russia is huge and obvious. Everybody actually expected that it would take 72 hours, at the most, the defense of Ukraine. And after 72 hours, Ukraine would fall, it would be captured by Russia. On the 23rd of February 2022, I was in Kyiv. I talked to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, just a couple of hours before the Russian invasion. And, at the last moment, actually, we made it to the Polish border, because we traveled by car, back then. So, across the border, and right after that Russian missiles struck. So, I remember, when I said goodbye to Volodymyr, Volodymyr told me, \"Andrzej, I don't know whether we would see each other again.\" That was a very powerful moment, a moving moment. And then he told me, \"If Putin thinks that he would control Ukraine, conquer Ukraine, just as they used to, as they did with Crimea, in 2014, then he is mistaken. We have got 80 years of combat experience, and thousands of people, who were fighting on the front. We are going to fight till the end, till we drop.\" And that is what has happened, and they are fighting until today. So, first of all, what they need is weapons, because the difference is huge, in terms of quantity. What Russians have got today is old equipment, very old equipment. They are taking tanks, from 1960s, from their stocks. But they have those tanks. And they're crushing. They've got this advantage of steel, of the mass, and they are crushing Ukrainians. There're 140 million Russians and less than 40 million Ukrainians. So, this shows you the mobilization potential, of Russia, and the mobilization potential of Ukraine. So, it's enough to look at this clear data, to understand that under normal circumstances, unless Ukraine gets support, it has no chance, of defending itself, on its own, against Russia. That is why Ukraine needs this support. It's indispensable. What kind of support can we offer to Ukraine, as allies, what the United States is doing, what we are doing, as Poland as well? We have donated to Ukraine 300 tanks, from our stocks. Right now, we are providing more tanks to Ukraine. At this moment, we are sending the state-of-the-art tanks that we have, Leopard tanks. We are providing a company of Leopard tanks. We have organized an allied collection, so to speak, of tanks, for Ukraine.

Roosevelt's 1940 Fireside Chat, an effort to rally support, for the British, in the lead-up to World War II. 83 years since FDR's speech, President Biden echoed that same sentiment, earlier today, at a time, when polls show American support, for providing aid to Ukraine, is softening a bid.For historical insight, I want to bring in Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Presidential Historian, and the Author of the really important book, \"Leadership in Turbulent Times.\" Doris, thanks so much for joining us. I know you pointed out the connection, between these two historical moments, two presidents trying to rally support, at home, while also sending a strong message abroad. Do you think President Biden accomplished that today? DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, AUTHOR, \"LEADERSHIP IN TURBULENT TIMES\": I think what he was able to do was to a rally for Ukraine, for the allies, and for the American people, and really the world. And if you couple that, with the surprise visit, yesterday, which captured the imagination, of the people, and the world, I think it's a double whammy, in a certain sense. But now, the challenge comes. As Roosevelt's speech suggests, Roosevelt was facing an isolationist mood, and he used that wonderful metaphor after the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" speech that we need to, if your neighbor's house is on fire, you're going to lend them your hose, so that their house can be saved, and your house can be saved, at the same time. And that's the kind of language, I think, somehow he's going to have to come back here, and still use the bully pulpit, because support is diminishing. Maybe what he should do is take a page from Roosevelt, and figure out how to talk, in those terms, maybe a page, from Lyndon Johnson, and bring those bipartisan leaders, who are now supporting the war, to a dinner, at the White House, to talk about the trip, and to keep that support going. Because it's essential, as this war goes on and on that, that support remains, as high as it was a year ago.",

And then he got more fighter weapons, and just as Biden is being challenged to do, send more and more, so that the England could survive, which saved us 18 months, really, before we got into the war. And Ukrainian survival is important. So, he's got to figure out. And this is what must keep him up at night, \"How far can I go to send the next weapon along that they need, right now?\" One of the things Churchill kept saying is \"Give us the tools, and we will do the job.\" But then he oversaw, personally Roosevelt did, to make sure that those weapons got there. He went and made sure that the railroad tracks were free, so that they could get to the depots, made sure that they got off on the ships, make sure that they got over to England. It takes that kind of leadership, to make sure it's getting where it needs to go.",

It's what must keep President Biden up at night. So, you're trying to figure out how far can we go without crossing that line? And I think that's the calibration he's been making all along the line. So, I think, it's a very sobering moment, even as we feel that great sense of enthusiasm, and excitement, about what Ukraine is doing, and the resilience that they have, and the desire that people have, for them, to win this war, because it's a war for democracy, as well as it is a sobering feeling that we could be on the verge of something larger than that. The hope is that China understands that they have enough problems of their own, that not to get involved in this, at this time. But I don't know enough about that. I'm just hoping that history tells us that it's not what we saw, in World War I, not what we saw in World War II. And hopefully, our imagination has only taking us there, but not the reality.",
