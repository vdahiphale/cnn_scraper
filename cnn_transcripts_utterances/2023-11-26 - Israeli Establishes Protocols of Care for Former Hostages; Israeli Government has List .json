And the Israeli government now has the names of the hostages who will be freed by Hamas on Sunday, day three of the delicately poised truce between Hamas and Israel.That's after day two of the four day truce came to a rocking but successful conclusion late on Saturday with the release of 13 Israelis and 4 Thai nationals, who'd been kidnapped by militants on October the 7th. After preliminary medical checks all of the former hostages were whisked away to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. Israel's Health Ministry said one woman 21 year old Maya Regev was treated for a moderate injury and is in stable condition. Also among the second group is 9 year old Emily Hand whose father had initially been told she died in the October 7th terrorist attack. And the Israeli government wants to know why 13 year old Hila Rotem's mother Raaya wasn't released with her daughter. And Israeli official says that under the agreement, mothers and children are not to be separated. The fragile deal also called for the release of 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Saturday for several tense hours, though. Hamas stilled on releasing the hostages in a dispute over aid to Gaza and over which Palestinians the Israelis were willing to release. Qatar has played a pivotal role throughout the process, including resolving Saturday's dispute. The government has clearly stated it would like to extend a truce if it can be done. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We are hoping for, is that momentum that has carried from the release of these two days and from this agreement of four days with allow us to extend the truce beyond these four days and therefore get into more serious discussions about the rest of the hospitals.

And for them at this stage to try to break the news to their children to their loved ones, to their relatives about what happened on October 7th, because crucially, many of the hostages have no real sense of the full scope of what took place on October 7th.And that's why so much care has gone into ensuring that the media is kept at a distance that there's a degree of privacy but also that the appropriate staffing and psychiatrists and social workers are in place. And also a lot of guidelines that were given to the IDF in terms of how they handled the hostages when they first were there during that initial handover from the Red Cross. They did a cursory medical search and checking their identities. They were told not to answer questions such as where's mommy, where's daddy to ask permission of any children before trying to pick them up. And so every possible care has been taken here and also at the Schneider Children's Medical Center where we were last night to try to minimize any sort of re-traumatizing, particularly of these children as they return home. And many of them no longer have homes but return home to Israel for the first time in seven weeks.",

This is the four that have just been released that I'm talking about. But previously, we know that 10 other Thai nationals were released. The team at the hospital spoke to the CNN team as well, and told us that they were stable, but not healthy. And they reported a lack of nutrition. So that might be one of the areas that they're being covered for. We also know that the one Filipino who was released in the previous batch. He was undergoing emotional tests as well. And I think just thinking there about what Clarissa was reporting. There is going to be a journey of healing many of these hostages. The ones who have just been released have seen and heard and experienced trauma over the last few weeks, and it's going to take time for them to work --",

Joining us now is Aaron David Miller, a Former State Department Middle East Negotiator and Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace always good to see you sir.The delay on Saturday, everything finished up all right. But it did show how precarious the process can be? How delicate a truce is and exchanges like this? I mean, it's a four day process initially, what could scuffle it? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: Well, first of all Michael, thanks for having me. It's day by day. And look, you've got a situation in which there are no direct negotiations between Israel and Hamas. You are aligning now almost exclusively on the Qataris as mediators and in this case the Egyptians as well. You have not -- just you have no trust or confidence. In a matter of days, it's clear that Israel and Hamas may well be back to trying to kill one another. So there's no trust and confidence. There's no direct negotiation. The Qataris have a huge, huge lift in order to try to secure and minimize friction. Today's example I think is -- I won't say its par for the course is an extraordinary situation. But it should surprise no one. I think it was Samuel Goldwyn Mayer, the great Hollywood mogul, who said that an oral agreement isn't worth the paper, it's written down. And if you want to get to the bottom of this CNN should try to get a hold of the six page document which is a result of weeks of negotiations between the U.S., the Israelis, Israeli intelligence, CIA -- the Qataris, the Egyptians. There is purportedly a document which spells out in pretty precise detail what the terms of this deal really are. So it's really hard to know today what deleted questions that Hamas has over the Palestinian prisoners. The Israelis are really seeing disappointment that more aid isn't surging into Gaza. There was even one report that Hamas was objecting to the fact that the Israelis were preventing Gazans from returning from the South to Gaza City. So any number of things could have derailed it.",

And by the way, we're talking not just about live hostages I'm sure Hamas grant dead bodies as well.Because they know that Israel puts an extraordinary premium on the return dead or alive of their people on the battlefield.

CNN estimates that 15 of those former prisoners were serving sentences mostly for attacks on Israelis, but most of them 24 in all were being held in so called administrative detention practice that a member of the Palestinian Parliament strongly condemned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI, PALESTINIAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Administrative detention means that Palestinians are kept in jail for unlimited period without charges, without due legal process, without even knowing why they are in jail. And that includes at this very moment, more than 2200 Palestinians, including about 200 children. They are arrested and they are put in jail without even charging them. This is totally unacceptable in two ways. First of all, administrative detention itself shouldn't be accepted and arresting children and keeping them in jail for long time is unacceptable.

Here's a look at the 13 Israelis that Hamas released on Saturday. They include seven children the youngest is three years old. That mystery surrounds the release of 13 year old Hila Rotem. This is Hila reunited with her uncle but her mother was not released with her. And Israeli official tells us under the deal, mothers and children were not supposed to be separated so where her mother is and why she wasn't released is unknown. Palestinian humanitarian officials say they have delivered the largest aid convoy to Gaza City and Northern Gaza since the war began. The U.N. and the Red Crescent confirmed that 187 aid trucks made it into Gaza Saturday with food, water, fuel and medical supplies. 61 of those trucks reached Northern Gaza where the need is desperate. Since October 21st nearly 2000 trucks have made it through the Rafah crossing.

That's the first thing.The second thing is that we desperately need first of all, more funding coming in for housing repairs and for temporary solutions. We also need restrictions to be lifted on what materials can come in, because as of now, there are restrictions that are preventing some of the materials that would help provide temporary shelters from being -- from entering.

The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts in South Korea and Japan all condemning the launch. South Korea calls it a clear violation of a U.N. resolution that prohibits the North from using ballistic missile technology. CNN's Will Ripley is in Taipei with the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As if the world doesn't have enough to worry about, rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea claims big progress in its satellite program. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un appearing triumphant in state media posing for propaganda cameras with a team of North Korean scientists and engineers celebrating and apparently successful third attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit, two failed launches earlier this year. Pyongyang promises more satellite launches in the near future. Satellite is crucial to improving the accuracy of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile program. A program banned by the United Nations Security Council possibly perfected with the help of Russian rocket scientists acting on orders from President Vladimir Putin. Kim and Putin's September Summit at this Russian Space Launch Complex, signaling Moscow's growing support for Pyongyang's space program. A partnership believed to be providing Putin with badly needed North Korean weapons, arming Russian soldiers on the battlefields of Ukraine. Putin told state media reporters at the time Russia would help North Korea, launch its own satellites and rockets saying that's exactly why we came here.

The South Korean military says less than 24 hours after this satellite launch, a ballistic missile was launched from the North Korean capital area, but they believe that missile failed just minutes after taking off. Now in the meantime the big question, the unanswered question is whether this satellite is actually able to conduct reconnaissance. We know that it's in orbit, but can it actually surveil U.S. military installations in places like Guam or Hawaii or Japan? That remains the unknown question. Will Ripley, CNN Taipei.",
