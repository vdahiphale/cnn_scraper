In Gaza, meantime, the United Nations warning everyone in the north of the Enclave is at risk of dying. And Iran vowing to respond to Israel's weekend attack, but says it does not seek war. Two candidates, two very different closing messages as we enter this final week of the U.S. presidential campaign. Kamala Harris telling voters she wants to find common ground and build coalitions as she canvases the key battleground states. Donald Trump upping the ante on his anti-immigrant message at a rally here in New York on Sunday night, going all in, featuring a number of speakers who echoed that dark, fear-filled rhetoric. Before taking the stage, a host of Trump loyalists unleashed demeaning, vulgar, racist rants, including this one from comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe where he went after the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.

It's important because the Vice President has been trying to shore up Latino votes, but especially among young Hispanic men. So certainly, the campaign seizing on these comments and the split screen, even though it was one they didn't necessarily anticipate what unfold yesterday.

Israel has said its forces hit military targets in response to Iranian attacks on Israel. Of course, earlier in the month. CNN's Jim Sciutto joining me now from Jerusalem. Jim, good to see you. So, when we look at this, right, there is some question about what happens now in this period of escalation? Is this, in fact, putting a pin in this chapter? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: The short answer is, we don't know, right? Israel's strikes overnight on Friday did not go to the extreme end, right? In terms of attacking oil facilities or nuclear facilities which the U.S. had been pressuring Israel not to do, because the U.S. as -- or others was concerned about expanding the war. So, Israel stuck to military targets, though still quite a significant strike. And while Iran is vowing retaliation, they've also publicly downplayed the effectiveness of these strikes to their own public, right? In terms of state media coverage, et cetera. So, it may be that in the near term we've gotten through the worst period. But big picture, we should keep in mind that now it is open season, in effect, between Israel and Iran, that these two countries that had been attacking each other via proxies, or, for instance, when Israel carried out strikes in Iran, certainly didn't publicly advertise them. Now they are taking shots at each other with some regularity, right? Two major Iranian missile strikes on Israel in the last year. Now, this strike, as well as the killing of the Hamas leader Haniyeh inside Tehran by Israeli intelligence, it is presumed. So, it certainly allows for the possibility of further strikes down the line. And there are some here in Israel who talk about this strike on Friday as being one wave that might proceed other waves of attacks, really, it just remains to be seen. So short term, probably the answer is yes, the worst has passed but, you know, medium to longer term, we're in a new period in this region.",

The fact that it's open season also means now that former red lines have completely been washed away and there is a struggle now to establish new ones. From the Iranian perspective, part of the reason why you're seeing a bit of a shift in the public discourse there, which early on, as Jim correctly pointed out, try to downplay this. You're seeing some indications that they're now shifting away from that. Part of the reason for that is because if in this new open season, so to say, it is becoming normalized for Israel to strike Tehran without any significant consequences, then that's a very negative development for the Iranians. That would put Iran in the same situation as Beirut and Damascus, which the Israelis regularly strike without causing any headlines anywhere, at least not in the West. That's not something I think Iranians will accept. And as a result, you're starting to see an impetus for some form of a response. The challenge they have, of course, is, how can they respond without risking a war that they don't want but that they think the Israelis want?",

We're not likely going to see a change. I don't expect that before the election.
