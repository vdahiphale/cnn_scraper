It was a little abnormal in the sense that the northwest quadrant was stronger than the northeast quadrant when we were there. A lot of rain focused on the north side. The southern side wasn't as large of a storm when we were there, but these storms change literally every hour, hour and a half, they have their own attitude and personality as they develop and go through Iowa regenerations and their life cycle changes.So, they're never the same for more than about an hour or two until they reach, you know, a strong Cat 5 and they become established and stay that way. And this one luckily has been spinning back down. It's falling. That's (INAUDIBLE) a lot of what the forecast is said it would.

It's been interesting that not many Democrats have openly said that the president should drop out. We've, of course, seen one or two of those, there was a statement last night from Seth Moulton, who's a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts. Occupies, I think, one of the old districts of roughly equivalent to what John F. Kennedy district was near Boston. And he walked right up to the edge of saying that the president should cede the post to another candidate.But I think they want to give the president time to get there himself. I think this interview that's got coming up tomorrow with George Stephanopoulos is viewed by the White House as a critical part of trying to restore confidence.

SANGER:  Well, I think there are two elements to it. I've been in the past two weeks in Britain, in Brussels, and in Berlin and basically heard versions of the same thing. This was both before and after the debate. So, the closest U.S. allies view the Biden presidency as a great relief from Trump era because at least the alliance was steadfast. And, you know, during that time NATO countries did step up and contribute a lot more to the alliance in large part because of Ukraine and because they see their concerns about what Vladimir Putin might be doing next. On the other hand, while they are very apprehensive about the possibility of a return to a Trump presidency, I think they were truly shaken by what they saw in the debate, including a failure by the president at that time to make the case for how he had rallied the world on Ukraine, which is something he has done routinely at many other -- in many other times. I think they're pretty nervous, and we're going to get a real dose of this next week, because Tuesday is the long planned 75th anniversary of NATO in Washington, with 32 national leaders roughly in the capital. The president's going to be meeting with many of them, and they're going to have a moment to take their measure at this period where they feel the U.S. is sort of right on the precipice.",
