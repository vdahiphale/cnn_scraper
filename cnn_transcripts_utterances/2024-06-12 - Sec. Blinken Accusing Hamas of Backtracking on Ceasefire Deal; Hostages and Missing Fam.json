The U.S. secret of state, Antony Blinken, accusing the terror group of backtracking on the Gaza ceasefire deal terms. Unfrozen funds? President Biden lands in Italy as the G7 leaders agree to a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using Russian assets in the West, according to sources. Beijing backlash. The E.U. raises tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. China says the move raises tensions. And deep-water diplomacy. Russian Navy vessels and a nuclear-powered submarine arrive in Cuba. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, to the Middle East, where a ceasefire and hostage deal is hanging in the balance. Top U.S. diplomat Antony Blinken is in the region to push for an agreement on the Israeli proposal from almost two weeks ago. Speaking in Doha after days of talks with key players, Blinken said it's time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to begin. He also questioned whether Hamas is acting in good faith by requesting a number of changes to the proposal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  A deal was on the table that was virtually identical to the proposal that Hamas put forward on May the 6th. A deal that the entire world is behind, a deal Israel has accepted, and Hamas could have answered with a single word, yes. Instead, Hamas waited nearly two weeks, and then proposed more changes, a number of which go beyond positions it had previously taken and accepted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, as you can imagine, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum is urging mediators to do whatever they can to ensure their loved ones are brought home from Gaza as soon as possible. It comes as we hear more from the four hostages rescued by Israeli forces last week. Now, one of them is Andrey Kozlov. He was working as a security guard at the Nova Music Festival on October 7th when he was kidnapped by Hamas. Paula Hancock spoke to his family about his rescue and also what his recovery will involve. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When the Israeli military launched Saturday's rescue mission in Gaza, one of the hostages thought they had come to kill him. Andrey Kozlov shouts his name in terror to the troops. His family says the Hamas guards told them for months, the sounds of war they were hearing were Israel trying to target them as they were causing trouble for the state. His brother, Dmitry, tells me he didn't understand why the IDF came. He was afraid they came to kill him. It took some time to realize they had come to rescue him. Psychological abuse coupled with frequent punishments marked Kozlov's captivity, according to his family. They were trying not to leave marks, his brother says, because eventually it is their reputation, but they would still punish him this way or the other. He has told us there are some moments he will never share with us, his father says, but one he did share is that at the hottest time of the day, they would cover him in blankets. It's a difficult ordeal to be dehydrated through heat. Kozlov, 27 years old, is a Russian citizen who moved to Israel almost two years ago. He was working as a security guard at the Nova Music Festival on October 7th when he was kidnapped and taken into Gaza. His parents flew from Russia Sunday for an emotional reunion, one they hadn't dared to hope for after eight long months. This is the best scenario we could have hoped for, his father says, to see him alive, to feel his presence and to hug him. It is outstanding. His mother says, we are infinitely happy to see him. He laughs, he jokes, he enjoys communicating with all of us. With his family, with doctors, with the people who surround him. His family says Kozlov was shocked when Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, came to visit him and the three other hostages rescued while in hospital. As for those hostages still in Gaza, his father says, a deal or a rescue, whatever it takes to get them out. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Catherine, for me, there's good news and there's bad news all at the same time. The good news is the U.S. economy is incredibly resilient.

Not too long ago, there were fears of recession, reasonably so, because we've had a lot of rate increases. And yet, month after month, we continue to see very strong job growth, strong GDP growth as you pointed out today - - or on Wednesday, we had some data suggesting that inflation may have cooled. So, there are a number of metrics in which the economy looks quite good. But that has a flip side. If the economy is relatively strong, is still relatively hot, despite that most recent inflation print, that suggests that the Fed may want to hold off on cutting interest rates. The economy doesn't need more stimulus, essentially. Maybe financial conditions are already relatively lax. And so, it's not worth it. It's not wise, I guess I should say, for the Central Bank to have a little bit more stimulus there by cutting rates. And that means if you are a borrower, or if you are someone who wants to borrow money to buy a house, to buy a car, et cetera, or you carry a balance on your credit card payment for a month to month, for example, that's unwelcome news, right?

And if you don't know how fast it is, you're not alone. I had to look it up. And they are incredibly fast, 7,000 miles an hour. And so, this is one of the most feared ships in the Russian navy. I don't know if it's entirely comforting that they have said they left the nuclear warheads at home. Of course, no way to confirm that. We'll have to just take them at their word. But throughout the day, we've been seeing comings and goings. Welcome ceremonies. The Russian ambassador and a delegation from the Russian embassy came and welcomed their sailors. And we've heard the Russian anthem being sung. And then, starting tomorrow, Cubans will actually have the opportunity to tour some of these ships, something that is not a common occurrence here. And, you know, yes, there were lots of visits of this kind during the Cold War. But I was talking with many Cubans today, and they say they never remember, in the height of the Cold War -- despite the constant presence of Russian military in those years, they never remember, Julia, a Russian sub coming in out of the water so visible for everyone to see.

We don't offer revolving. We don't try to have consumers build up big piles of debt and then charge 20, 30 percent on it. We ask people to pay down in installments, and usually people pay down in about two months, all of the outstanding balances. So, as a consequence of that, you just have a healthier and more healthier portfolio as well as you have an agility to move faster when macro economical shifts change, you can very quickly change your underwriting that's happening real-time and adjust to new macro economical conditions.

I think that, unfortunately, you know, this technology has a profound potential impact.

Elisa Raffa reports on how our changing climate is affecting this long-practiced tradition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  In a remote, hillside village in Nepal, villagers prepare for honey-hunting season, a tradition passed down for generations. But over the years, villagers say the number of bees and hives has been declining. Chandra Singh Gurung is a former honey hunter in the village building ropes and ladders in preparation for the season. CHANDRA SINGH GURUNG, FORMER HONEY HUNTER (through translator):  Honey- hunting begins mid-May every year. And we were happy that we would get some income. But we are all worried now because there are not many beehives this time. RAFFA (voice-over):  The honey produced is sometimes called mad honey, a bittersweet, dark red honey made when these giant bees feed on rhododendron nectar. In small doses, it is known for giving people a sense of calmness, euphoria and in some cases, hallucinations. To get the precious liquid, the hunters use smoke to make the bees flee the hives. They climb cliffs with ladders and use the poles to knock down the hives. Down below, they filter out the honey. It's a dangerous job but a way to make some money. AITA PRASAD GURUNG, HONEY HUNTER (through translator):  I have to climb down the rope ladder and it is fraught with danger of falling. One must extract honey and remain safe at the same time. We get some income after selling it. RAFFA (voice-over):  One bee expert says climate change is affecting the production of this honey in multiple ways.",

The West Virginia native was drafted by the Lakers. And for the next four decades, he became one of the most influential figures in franchise history. An All- Star in all 14 seasons as a player, West was one of the best pure shooters to ever play the game.
