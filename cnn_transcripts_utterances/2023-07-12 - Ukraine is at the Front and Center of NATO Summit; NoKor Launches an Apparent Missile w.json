Ukraine has been dominating discussions there. On Tuesday, Mr. Zelenskyy was greeted by cheering crowds in Vilnius, where he appeared to put pressure on NATO members to provide a concrete timeframe on when Ukraine could join the alliance. In a statement, NATO leaders said Ukraine's future is in NATO as they reaffirmed their support for Kyiv's bid, but remained vague about the timing. Ukraine did win one major concession as NATO agreed to streamline the accession process by removing the requirement for a membership action plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So you're going to see a lot of extra commitments today beyond the ones that were announced yesterday specifically by France and Germany in terms of extra military aid. You're also going to see a little bit later on that speech by President Biden outlining what we understand will be about what this summit has been about, essentially the achievements so far, which are not insubstantial, even if President Zelenskyy would have wished for more and specifically that concrete timetable, from NATO's point of view, the fact now of Swedish accession, which is now only a matter of time with Turkey having lifted the possibility of its veto, but also that beyond its expansion it should have chosen to strengthen so much. And what this represents now in terms of the rules-based order, what you're likely to hear at the heart of the American president's speech is that even as we've been hearing throughout the day as fighting continues in Ukraine, various pronouncement from key Russian officials about exactly what this meeting represents to them.

They, according to the Air Force, shot down 11 out of 15 of the drones launched at the country. But meanwhile, as you say, the counteroffensive continues to be extremely difficult.Ukraine is pushing hard around the edges of Bakhmut, the villages and towns around that they are not, to be clear, yet trying to take the actual town itself, more trying to encircle, trap Russian forces within the town, gain control of the higher ground around that area. So, they say they're making small amounts of progress there, about a kilometer taken in the last day. Down in the south, they continue to come up against those heavy fortifications. Russian forces had months, don't forget, to dig in, to build those minefields and things like that. They're having to essentially demine as they go down there but still inching forward. And all of this is why we just heard from President Zelenskyy walking into the second day of the NATO summit saying that his top priority is weapons packages. Ukraine continues to run short of ammunition, needs those long-range missiles. We saw that announcement from France that they had already started providing them on Tuesday, all of this highly significant.

That's just a little bit above two degrees Fahrenheit. That has allowed the earth to hold the atmosphere to hold more water vapor.If there's more water vapor, there's more water condensation. And therefore that rain can be heavier and just maybe not 7 percent, but you can actually multiply that out as some of this rain runs up hills. Not that there wouldn't have been a flood anyway, but certainly increased amounts of rainfall possible when you have increased amounts of water vapor. Here's the rainfall and the flood in Kyushu. This is in Japan, the southern island of Japan. This was a major flood right along the Mayubayu front. The Mayubayu front sets up every year, kind of a stationary front, but right here in the southern part of this island, right there, that's where day after day of rainfall put down over 400 millimeters in three days. There's the front right there. The plumb rains come from this. Warm moist air to the south, the front sets up, and then the rain stays in the same place for many, many days in a row. And as we look ahead here for the rest of the week, it looks like South Korea is going to get involved with this. Also, possibly even the western coast of Japan, that's part of the rain that comes off of mainland China, and it's going to rain in mainland China as well. But look there for Seoul. There will be places, 200 millimeters over the next three days. Someplace else that's picked up an awful lot of rainfall, but this is kind of expected, because it is monsoon. Here's India. Spots in here 300 millimeters over the past couple of days. And the monsoon over the past couple of weeks has really exceeded expectations over all of India. And I don't see that going away anytime soon. When the monsoon comes in, the humidity comes in, the sun heats the ground, the air goes up causing thunderstorms and causing significant amounts of rainfall. Central India, those purple spots are greater than 250 millimeters of rainfall just over a very short amount of time. Across parts of the southwestern part of the United States, very hot weather coming in, 115 degrees, won't be out of the question in almost any city here in the desert, that's 43 in Vegas, 44 for Thursday, and 45 on Friday, temperatures just continue to go up, even for Phoenix, the high on Sunday, could be 48 degrees in the afternoon, that's an awful lot of heat, and those temperatures are in the shade, and there won't be any cloud cover. So, if you're out in the sunshine, when it feels like 48 it might feel a whole lot warmer than that and the temperature outlook for parts of the meta training going to be very warm as well and Rome you're going to start to ramp up look at this how's that going to feel on Tuesday a high in the shade again of 39 degrees hot in parts of Europe as well.

So the allies are quite used to the fact that their views don't always prevail. Having said this, I think it is important that the group of the friends of Ukraine, the Baltic States, Poland and so on, make their voice heard.They got support from other countries. The U.K., France were quite supportive of that view, while Washington and Berlin were more cautious. I think it is important that we keep, of course, the unity of the Alliance, that we recognize that we've achieved some progress collectively, but also that we prepare for the next steps with a clear message.",

The two countries, both subject to U.S. sanctions, are seeking to deepen economic ties through trade and investment.CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports now from Havana. [03:40:00] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Russian warship sails into Havana. Cuba greets the ship the Perikop, the first Russian naval vessel to make an official visit in years, with a cannon fire salute. It's just the latest sign of the reforging of ties between Russia and Cuba. While much of the rest of the world has denounced Russia for their invasion of Ukraine, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, seen here alongside Vladimir Putin, inaugurating a statue of Fidel Castro in Moscow in November, defends Russia's war. We are condemning, we are rejecting the expansion of NATO towards Russia's borders. He told Russia today. We condemn all the measures and sanctions that have been applied as a way to coerce the Russian Federation. And Russia increasingly is throwing a lifeline to their old ally just 90 miles from the United States. (on-camera): Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia and Cuba have signed a flurry of new agreements that would open the first supermarket selling Russian food here, increase oil shipments to the island, even develop this beachside community outside of Havana. It appears to be the most significant Russian investment in Cuba in decades. (voice-over): In February, after Russia donated 25,000 tons of wheat, Russia's then ambassador to Cuba said the aid will continue to flow. In spite of the challenges, he says, Russia and Cuba continue developing their strategic relationship based on the historic friendship, solidarity and mutual sympathy between our two countries. The warming of ties for many Cubans feels like a trip back to the future. In this video from the 1960s narrated by Fidel Castro, Cubans are told how visiting Russian experts would modernize the island. Instead, Cuba grew dependent on Soviet aid. The USSR collapsed and, facing punishing U.S. economic sanctions, the island plunged into a financial abyss from which it is yet to emerge. While Russian officials have suggested reestablishing a military presence on the island. Some analysts feel that Moscow no longer has the capability to do so. SERGEY RADCHENKO, PROFESSOR, JOHN HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INT'L STUDIES: I think this kind of threats are used more for taunting the United States and for kind of, for, it's a kind of a form of psychological warfare, kind of a cy-op against the United States. OPPMANN (voice-over): Whatever the future of the renewed ties, it's clear Russia is once again staking a claim in Cuba. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As you can see, no cars are passing through to be able to pick up passengers. And this is part of the protesters' national day of disruption. Protests have been going on all day, from the morning through the evening, all across the country.Now, protests have been going on here for months against the government's plan to completely overhaul the judiciary. But the reason that they've been particularly amped up now is because of legislation that was passed Monday night. It's the first of three readings on just one aspect of this massive judicial overhaul. This particular legislation has to do with stripping the Supreme Court's ability of declaring government actions unreasonable, but it almost doesn't matter what the legislative steps were. It's just the fact that the legislation is back on the table because they had actually been frozen for several months after those massive general strikes and protests and the defense minister coming out against the overhaul back in March. There were some attempts at compromise negotiations with the opposition, but those have clearly gone nowhere. The coalition government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are now pushing forward once again with this legislation. It's going to be done in a slower, more piecemeal fashion but for these protesters they essentially don't leave anything that comes out of Benjamin Netanyahu or the coalition government's mouth when they say this will be a slower process when they say that even partial legislation have been softened watered down these protesters and the opposition want the judicial overhaul essentially completely off the table they say they will continue coming out to the streets and continue protesting. Now, the government and Benjamin Netanyahu say the judiciary desperately needs some sort of reform they say they've won the election. They have the votes in parliament to make this happen. But the protesters here at the opposition and even some of Israel's biggest allies like the United States have expressed grave concern about what exactly this reform will do. And these protesters, they say they will continue coming out. Some have even said that they plan to pitch tents in downtown Tel Aviv to make their protest even more permanent.
