This is CNN Newsroom.Just ahead, while Russia celebrates what it calls a significant advance, Ukrainian forces scramble to repel drone attacks. We will have the very latest. Plus, U.S. President Biden slams his Republican rival over comments about Alexei Navalny. We will have the details live from the White House. And CNN takes an extraordinary look inside Ecuador's prisons, where rival gangs are in control and criminal bosses live like royalty. Well, just days after seizing the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, Russian troops appear to be gaining momentum on the battlefield. Earlier, Russia's army chief visited the eastern front line area and presented awards to soldiers who took part in the assault. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin is calling the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Avdiivka an unconditional success. And over the past 24 hours, Russia unleashing a torrent of attacks on other parts of Ukraine. Local authorities say at least three people were killed and 18 wounded in five separate regions. It comes as the mystery surrounding Alexei Navalny is no closer to being solved five days after officials say he died in an Arctic penal colony. His mother has filed a lawsuit with the Russian court over, quote, \"inaction\" to release her son's body. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen joining me now live from Berlin. Hi there, Fred. So you were very recently in Ukraine. The Ukrainians say that they're striking down drones, but the Russians say they're building a lot more. What more do we know? And from your assessment, who do you see having the momentum here?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think on the battlefield right now, certainly the Russians seem to have the momentum, seem to have the initiative, especially if you look down there in the places of Avdiivka and south of the Avdiivka area as well.But, of course, the drones have been and are a huge issue on the battlefield, really being used by both sides. And when you look at the Ukrainians saying that they're striking down drones, we're really talking about two different types of drones. On the one hand, there's those Shahed drones that are Iran made, Iran supplied, the U.S. and its allies say. That the Ukrainians are striking down a lot of those and the Russians are using those for a lot of attacks as well. But then as far as frontline drones are concerned, also, the Ukrainians also say they're striking some of those down. But that's really where one of the big battles is taking place. The Ukrainians, very early on in the war, certainly had the advantage as far as those small battlefield drones were concerned. So called FPV drones, as they call them, which are used on the front lines to bomb enemy positions, to bomb enemy troops, and also to take out things like tanks and armored vehicles. The Ukrainians have been doing that with great success, but the Russians now, at the very least, appear to be on parity. There's one thing that we're keeping an eye on, Amara, which we thought was very interesting, is that the Russian defense minister said the Russians are now producing thousands of such drones every single day and using hundreds of them on the battlefield. That is sort of the way things are going on both sides, both with the Ukrainians and the Russians, is that you have cheap, easy to use drones. A lot of those drones being expended, a lot of those drones destroyed on the battlefield, but simply to keep a mass of those drones coming. It seems to us as though right now, and certainly this is something that we heard from Ukrainian forces when we were on the battlefield in those areas. Right now, there seems to be parody between the Ukrainians and the Russians, but certainly, the Russian production capacities if the defense minister quite seem to be very, very large in the Russian certainly have caught up at the very least to the Ukrainians as far as the use of those drones are concerned, Amara.",

If you take a look at the numbers, the president -- his campaign alone has $56 million cash on hand. If you combine the totals of the campaign, the DNC, and their joint fundraising committees, that's $130 million cash on hand. By comparison, former President Trump currently has $30.5 million cash on hand, while the RNC has $8.7 million. One thing that advisers feel that they've been able to do since the launch of the campaign is focus on the fundraising at a time when Republicans are spending all their money duking it out with each other.

A stunning revelation from the FBI is raising new questions about Russian interference in U.S. politics. Alexander Smirnov, the man charged with lying about corruption within the Biden family told FBI investigators that he got his information from Russian intelligence officers.

So the charges that this man, Alexander Smirnov, he's an American citizen, that he faces are about lying to the FBI in multiple years, but primarily during the 2020 election when Joe Biden was running for office successfully.And Smirnov was telling the FBI that there was a link, a financial link, millions of dollars between Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and then this Ukrainian energy company Burisma. That was false. That is in the indictment of Alexander Smirnov. That's what he's charged with criminally. But then this week, after his arrest, Smirnov sits down and continues talking to the FBI and tells them he has plans to go meet with foreign intelligence officials. He has lots of foreign agencies that -- and governments that he's in touch with. And some of the information about Hunter Biden that is coming to them is false, that it is coming from Russian intelligence trying to corrupt the system. So the Justice Department is quite concerned about that. They were so concerned that they went to a judge just this week and asked them -- asked the judge not to release Smirnov, to keep him in jail because of the threat he poses to sow disinformation into the political system. The judge said that wasn't enough that he was going to be released. Smirnov was released after a hearing yesterday in Las Vegas in federal court. But the Justice Department has clearly outlined that this man, Alexander Smirnov, was feeding them lies that they were believing for many years and that he now says he was getting some of his information specifically about Joe Biden, things that could be damaging about the current president as he runs for re-election from the Russians. And just quickly, because we're out of time, but I do want to ask about the impeachment inquiry into President Biden. I mean, what happens to that then if it was based on lies?",

So the American lawyer -- the lawyers for the U.S. are arguing that he didn't qualify as a journalist. He released all this information in one big dump, and crucially, he didn't redact the names of members of the secret services, for example, many members of the security services who were in those documents, which didn't really play into the public service argument. So, a lawyer for the U.S. said Assange put lives at risk when he published classified information relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by disclosing unredacted names. Assange created a grave and imminent risk to innocent people who could suffer serious harm or arbitrary detention and that damaged the capability of U.S. forces.

The visitors were a group of 100 Russian tourists. Another sign of growing ties between Pyongyang and Moscow.CNN's Will Ripley spoke to some of the travelers about what they were allowed to see. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After years of near total isolation, North Korea is rolling out the red carpet for Russian visitors. This group of 100 believed to be the first post-pandemic tourist, visiting Kim Jong-un's hermetically sealed nation, amid its deepening ties with Russia. They flew from Vladivostok to Pyongyang on a vintage Russian plane operated by Air Koryo, North Korea's only airline. I've flown it more than a dozen times when Westerners were still allowed in. Diplomacy with the U.S. collapsed in Hanoi in 2019, when observers say Kim made a strategic pivot, bolstering his nuclear arsenal, prioritizing ties with Moscow and Beijing, both protecting Kim from fallout at the United Nations for his unprecedented missile testing binge. Russia is reportedly releasing millions of dollars in frozen North Korean assets, facilitating access to international banking networks, \"The New York Times\" reports, setting the stage for a new chapter of Kim's nuclear ambitions, possibly with the help of Russian rocket scientists. This Russian tour and perhaps more to come is about more than sightseeing. It's about the bigger picture of international relations. Russia and North Korea strengthening ties, icing out the West. Ilya Voskresensky is a travel vlogger from St. Petersburg, a tough job these days. Many European nations ban Russian tourists, the result of Putin's war on Ukraine. ILYA VOSKRESENSKY, TRAVEL VLOGGER (through translator): I signed up for this tour at the moment, I heard about it. It's like stepping back in time, reminiscent of the stories my grandparents told me about life in the Soviet Union, the empty streets, the lack of advertisements. It's surreal. RIPLEY (voice-over): Elena Bychkova is a marketing professional from Moscow. ELENA BYCHKOVA, MARKETING PROFESSIONAL (through translator): The meticulous preparations for our visit felt like being in a theater production. But amidst the choreographed scenes, I couldn't shake the feeling that there's another side to North Korea, one that remains hidden. RIPLEY (voice-over): Beneath the carefully controlled facade, encounters with North Korean children, revealing curiosity, genuine interest in the outside world. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on-camera): Tourism is one thing, but what the United States and its allies are truly concerned about is this deepening military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. At least 24 North Korean ballistic missiles fired on Ukraine, responsible for at least 14 deaths, according to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. And an investigative organization out of the U.K. says that a North Korean ballistic missile launched just last month by the Russian military onto Ukraine contained hundreds of components from the U.S. and Europe. All of them made reportedly within the last three years. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.",

With a queen size bed and mini fridge, his prison cell looks more like a hotel room. His recent jailbreak is shining a spotlight on the country's penal system with experts saying prisons have turned into headquarters for criminal groups.CNN's David Culver has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's as though they're stepping into a war zone. Ecuador's military and national police trail an armored vehicle in a raid of one of the country's 35 prisons. Inside, prisoners stripped down, hands tied, scenes like this have played out across Ecuador over the past few weeks. The Armed Forces making a very public show of force, attempting to reinstate order within their own prisons. It's part of Ecuador's effort to neutralize terror groups and weed out gangs, which have unleashed chaos nationwide from a live TV studio, armed takeover, to random shootings in the streets. This most recent surge in violence sparked by this suspected escape of this man, Jose Adolfo Macias known as Fito. On January 7th, officials reported that while serving a 34-year sentence for murder and drug trafficking, the notorious gang leader vanished from this prison in Guayaquil. A drone's view allows us to grasp the scale of this complex. It is sprawling.",
