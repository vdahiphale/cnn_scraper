But are they any closer to finding the armed and dangerous suspect. Plus, a potential breakthrough.Sources tell CNN, there's been significant progress on negotiations to release hostages kidnapped by Hamas. This as Israeli tanks conduct a second night of targeted raids inside Gaza. And the 2024 presidential field just got bigger, but this time it's another Democrat jumping in. Congressman Dean Phillips says, President Biden is doing a spectacular job as president, so why is he trying to take his place? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. We begin with the state still gripped with fear as the manhunt continues more than 40 hours after the shooting rampage that killed 18 people at a bowling alley and bar in Lewiston, Maine. Authorities are still on the hunt for the suspect Robert Card. Residents and communities across the state are told to continue to stay inside and lock their doors. Officials say, they will now be putting divers into a nearby river to aid in their search. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE SAUSCHUCK, COMMISSIONER, MAINE DEPT. OF PUBLIC SAFETY: We will be putting divers in the water along the Androscoggin River which you see here. And that's going to look like a couple of different things. So, the very first thing that you're going to see out there is you're going to see some air resources that will fly over this particular area. And they're looking to see what can we clear from the air. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's just crazy. It leaves you an empty hole that I don't know how we'll ever be filled. If this person was at the time in his right mind, I believe he would have been a loving person just like we are. There's something that went wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They said as well, they believed that he was still here. They have no evidence at this point to suggest that he has left this area. So, they are working under the theory that he is still here.However, you know, this morning when we first got here at around 7 am, things actually changed. It seemed like everything was over because many of the roadblocks that the police had in place were taken down. But now it seems what's happening is that they really want to focus around this river area, go where they haven't gone before, which is underwater. It's not clear why all of a sudden, today, they're starting to do this, you know, perhaps you can ask why didn't they start doing this yesterday. But it's clear that someone has come to the opinion and the feeling that, you know what, it's time we get into this water, and we start searching. And I think, Dana, the point you make about the families, they are still living and so with so much fear in this community, still living with so much fear that they can't get to that grieving point yet. And so, hopefully this can come to a resolution soon.",

      "sentences": "Well, every investigation is a progressive thing. So, you know, we know things today that we didn't know yesterday, and that we didn't know the day before. What they learned yesterday with the execution of three separate search warrants. One on the car, another on the house, and another on a different property is things that are influencing what they're doing today, and they found a note, which indicated that he didn't expect to be around when the note was found. So that's the equivalent of a suicide note in some manner. So, that shifts that search to the water. His car ends up there. There's no sign of him. There's water in front of where the car is. Did he get on a boat and further escape? Or is he under the water? Did he follow through on the idea that he was going to take his own life was that by drowning? The only way they're going to know that is with divers. Another clue yesterday was in the search of the car, they found a rifle, an AR-15 platform in the 308 caliber which is similar in description, making model to the gun used in the attack.So, was that the gun from the attack? Did he leave it behind and take his own life? Or did he escape and has access to another weapon. So, that's why the shift, but in the background, as Shimon demonstrates by being on the scene, they are still poised, coiled, if you will to respond to anything that could be a citing or a sign because they also know what they don't know. And right now, we're still in a period of increased knowledge, but some uncertainty.",

John Miller, thank you so much for that reporting. I want to dig deeper with experts who we have with us, Neil Franklin is a retired Maryland state police commander, and Katherine Schweit is a former senior FBI official and an active shooter expert.Neil, I'm going to start with you. What is your takeaway from what we heard earlier today? There was a press conference. We didn't play a lot of it, actually any of it because there was a lot -- let me just put it this way. There were a lot of words, there weren't a lot of details, except for that critical one, which is that they're sending divers into the river.",

      "sentences": "Yes, yes. Let me begin with it. John brought up a lot of important points here. It is a process of elimination that the teams have to go through, searching everywhere. So, searching this, this body of water, it will just help them out so much in this investigation. But there's one thing that I was thinking about here, you know, his car was located here.But if he hopped on some type of watercraft, where is it? If he took it to another part of the lake, where is it? Did he -- would he sink it? And that's another reason they would have to search. It's a process of elimination at this point, especially when it comes to that body of water, and searching other places. And I'd also like to say during this process of elimination, it's important that the citizens do their diligence. In a community like this, very seldom do people lock their doors. I mean, they feel safe. They don't lock their cars, they might leave their keys in their car, they leave their doors unlocked, or outbuildings unlocked. And I think it's important that they secure these premises, you can get into them easily. However, being locked, it makes noise, you know, force is applied, which can alert someone to the presence of Card or someone else. So, I think it's very important that people lock their doors and their cars, secure their facilities. It's going to help a lot. It's going to help a lot in this investigation.",

What are your (Audio Gap) right now, and the information that has been found that John Miller and Shimon were both talking about?KATHERINE SCHWEIT, FORMER SR. FBI OFFICIAL: I think, you know, as they mentioned that this is just kind of the doggy dog kind of beat the leather on your shoes, kind of investigative work that has to be done now that almost has kind of nothing to do with the fact that that he has committed this heinous act. He's a criminal, they're looking for him now. And they have to apply those same techniques that they apply in any other situation. I think, maybe some of the added layers on top of it really have to do with where this mindset of this individual might be because we know that this is a planned event. Targeted violence is a planned event. So, this person planned it. He gathered the things that he needed for it. He's carrying it with them, a lot of shooters, sometimes we see them they carry way more ammunition, for example than they're ever going to use. But they want to be prepared. And so, if he had a car and he abandoned it at someplace, you know, my instinct says, oh, did he -- he may have hopped on a boat? Did he hop another car? Did he have materials staged someplace else? And maybe the search of the house will help to give them some of that information that kind of speaks to his future where he wants to go.",

That's unusual, intense sustained for well over a couple of hours.We've heard a lot of artillery fire, a lot of explosions being reported in Gaza, small arms fire behind me right now. And at one point, a huge wall of smoke that lasted 15, 20, 30 minutes, literally blew up the hill towards where we are off of Gaza. The sort of smoke, it tasted and felt like the sort of smoke that can be used by the military for a smokescreen for activity, that's happening on the ground. We can't comment and say whether or not there's an incursion underway here. Now, these sorts of things tend to be clarified by the IDF the morning after the event. But knowing that the IDF has said that these incursions will be sustained and continued that for all intents and purposes, what we've heard behind us here over the past two hours has sounded like it might be that. And while we've been listening to that heavy fighting behind us, we know that my colleague, our colleague, Becky Anderson has been reporting from the talks in Doha, where there's a hope that the hostage talks over hostage released might be realized, might come to pass.

Israel, the United States, Qatar, which is leading these discussions with Hamas. They of course, are pushing for all of the civilians to be released. Men, women, children, everybody, certainly on the civilian side, both foreign and Israeli. But at the very least, there's an expectation and a hope that there would be a much larger group than we have seen in the past be released by Hamas. We have heard from sources that there has been significant progress. There are some issues that remain, but negotiations are going very well. We are told but there is caution.
