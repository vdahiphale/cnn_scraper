      "sentences": "As this monster storm moves across the country, blizzard and icy conditions are leading to widespread accidents, road closures and travel bans in some states. And we're now learning that emergency services are currently responding to crashes along the Ohio turnpike near Sandusky, involving multiple, heavily damaged semi-trucks and other vehicles.And take a look at the icy conditions that motorists in Memphis, Tennessee are having to deal with today. The roads just turned into sheets of ice, and the road situation is so bad that Memphis police are not responding to car accidents due to the dangerous weather. So, Aixa Diaz is the spokesperson for AAA. Aixa, your organization is predicting about 100 million people will drive more than 50 miles from home for the holidays. Now many of them are going to have to drive in weather conditions that they should not be driving in. How worried are you that this will get even worse than it already is?",

      "sentences": "Kristin, very worried because AAA always encourages you to stay off the roads if there's going to be bad weather. And what we know is that with this 102 million people production of drivers on the road this holiday season, we are seeing crashes.We're seeing them already and we expect to see more. And AAA of course is ready to help with roadside technicians and tow provider. But the reality is, if law enforcement is having a hard time getting to people, so are we. So, we're encouraging people to stay off the roads completely. If you are in an area where the weather is not supposed to be that bad, still prepare for winter storm conditions anyway. We saw here in DC earlier this year. This last winter we had that I-95 mess where people were stuck in their cars for literally hours, in some cases, 24 hours. So, have an emergency kit within you vehicle with extra blankets, water, food and they will keep you comfortable if you do get stuck.",

So important to have that, like emergency bag packed in the back of your car which I do not have but will at some point. But, you know, because this storm is so bad, and it's the holidays,you know, there's a good chance now that tow truck drivers like you were saying, police, fire crews, rescue crews, that they just won't be able to get to the cars. We're seeing in Memphis that police saying they simply get to accidents that are happening because of the icy conditions. So, what advice do you have? What do motorists need to know if they are in an accident and need help, but perhaps these emergency vehicles can't get to them?",

Aixa Diaz, thank you so much.So, this storm is bringing life-threatening cold to pretty much the entire country. Those most at risk are of course, you know, the elderly, very young children. CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen joins me now with more on how you can make sure that you and your loved ones stay safe and stay warm. Elizabeth, what are some health concerns that we should be watching out for in these extremely cold conditions?",

      "sentences": "Kristin, there are so many things that we need to watch out for. Let's start with the most vulnerable. As you mentioned, the elderly and infants, they are the most vulnerable to cold. They just don't regulate their body temperatures the way that other folks do. Also, cold puts a stress on the heart. That's been studied extensively, and so folks with heart disease, they should really beware and be careful.Also, cold can aggravate asthma and other lung issues. So, even if your asthma is under control, be aware of the cold that could make it worse. You should have your medications at the ready. So, here are some tips for dealing with the cold and for staying healthy. Dress infants warmly, more warmly than you would dress yourself. Check in on the elderly if you know an elderly couple. Make sure they have heat. Check in on them. Make sure they're doing OK. Also, avoid alcohol and caffeine. I know it sort of makes sense, you know, you're cold. Have some hot mold wine for the holiday. Have a whole lot of coffee. That can be problematic. Caffeine and alcohol do not help your body deal with the cold. In fact, they hurt. So, drink other kinds of warm liquids -- Kristin.",

Those cells in your nose. They're the first line of defense when germs start to attack.They have very specific roles to play, and they found they don't work great in the cold. Their effectiveness really wanes once the temperature goes down. So, if you find you're getting a cold in the cold, you're not crazy. There really is some science behind it.",

And his role -- the fact that he was at the FBI is drawing a lot of criticism especially because from Republicans who want him to come and testify. They want testimony also from some former intelligence officials.You remember, Kristin, that there were officials who signed a letter who said that the laptop story in the \"New York Post\" were the hallmarks of a disinformation effort from a foreign government. Of course, we now know that was not true, but that's the sort of -- the backdrop of what Republicans say definitely bears more investigation -- Kristin.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, there's a couple of key ones that we've -- that have made the rounds and that have gotten a lot of currency. One of them is, you know, the day before the \"New York Post\" article comes out, there is a set of documents that are sent by an FBI agent, ten documents that are sent to a top Twitter official. These ten documents are sent over. You'll see a tweet from one of the reporters talking about these documents to Yoel Roth, and it says, you know, essentially received, right.And we went to the FBI and the FBI has a team that has looked at these documents and they came away and they found these ten documents. What they say is that eight of them had to do with some kind of disinformation that was being sent by -- used by a foreign government operation essentially and they were flagging this to Twitter. Nothing to do with Hunter Biden's laptop. Two of them had to do with an investigation related to potential voter suppression. Again, nothing to do with the Hunter Biden laptop according to the FBI. The second piece of -- the second allegation has to do with payments that apparently Twitter received from the FBI -- $3.4 million. That is being sort of painted as some kind of effort to pay off the -- Twitter for suppressing conservatives. We talked to the FBI. They say that, you know, this is routine. Companies under federal law, under U.S. law are allowed to get reimbursed for the costs that they incur for having to do things that the Justice Department and the FBI are asking them to do. For instance, respond to subpoenas, produce documents, produce all kinds of information that is part of court orders that they're required to do. So, under federal law, every company that gets these types of subpoenas, including phone companies are allowed to recoup some of that cost, and that's what that payment is about -- Kristin.",
