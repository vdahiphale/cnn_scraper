Candidates for the next speaker, possibly one of the worst jobs in Washington, could be considered next Tuesday. A number of names already being tossed around, as CNN's Manu Raju reports now from Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Republicans struggling to figure out their way forward after today's historic vote kicking out Kevin McCarthy, the first time ever a sitting speaker of the House ejected from his seat by his own colleagues. This vote coming after eight Republicans sided with all Democrats to kick him out. Kevin McCarthy could only afford to lose four Republicans, so he was unable to convince some of those members on the hard right in particular, who were unhappy about some of his deal making. Really only two deals in particular. One, to raise the national debt limit to avoid a debt default, he had to get a deal with the White House and Senate Democrats in order to get that through. Also the other one, to avoid a government shutdown. That's something that he had cut over the weekend and allowed Democrats to help push that through to avoid a potentially disastrous government shutdown and just to keep the government open for another 45 days. That was enough to lead the Matt Gaetz, the Congressman from Florida, to lead the charge to seek Kevin McCarthy's ouster. He got the support of seven other Republican colleagues, enough to kick out McCarthy in a startling move that really caught many of his own colleagues by surprise, announcing that he would not be a candidate for speaker again. Kevin McCarthy said that he would step aside. He told me that he could potentially name a get behind a successor, but he said wouldn't disclose who because he didn't know who would possibly run. Now this all comes as tension is growing among those McCarthy allies, going after some of those critics who pushed out Kevin McCarthy, questioning whether they are true conservatives. AUSTIN SCOTT, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: I think Kevin recognizes that nobody can meet their demands, and the conference is going to have to figure out how we deal with, you know, eight people that are here that candidly aren't interested in governing. They're more interested in grifting. DERRIC VAN ORDEN, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: Republicans who have been claiming to be fiscal conservatives just voted with every single Democrat in the House of Representatives.

And you know, this decapitation of the House leadership is going to loom over whoever replaces McCarthy and how they approach this next government shutdown.

This was the charges that John Boehner faced when he was speaker and he quit the job kind of one step ahead of the mob ready to push him out. Paul Ryan came in, faced the exact same dynamic. Even Newt Gingrich, whose career began by accusing his own error as leadership in the being too cooperative with Democrats. He faced a rebellion on the right and ultimately left. This is a long standing dynamic in the Republican Party. It has been turbocharged by the emergence of Donald Trump and, you know, the question will be McCarthy, by and large, acceded to these demands. I mean, he launched an impeachment inquiry without any hard evidence against Joe Biden. He censured Adam Schiff. He mainstreamed Marjorie Taylor Greene. He voted to overturn the 2020 election.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Bangkok shopping mall where the shooting took place was very busy at the time. We're hearing this from the police chief who's given a briefing just outside the Siam Paragon Mall in central Bangkok. And he said that it was raining outside and a lot of people were inside when gunfire was heard. Now, we have seen images of many of those people rushing for the exits to get away from the gunfire. Now, the details we have from the police chief at this point is that a 14-year-old boy has been arrested. He said that he was taken to a police station for interrogation with juvenile experts. Now, he has pointed out there are certain things that he cannot disclose because the suspect is a juvenile, a 14-year-old. Now, he does say that he has mental health issues. He had been treated at a hospital, also pointing out that he had stopped taking his medicine and was told to cheat people. Now, these are details that are coming to us at this point from the national police chief. He also pointed out that the suspect had said that he likes playing video games. Now, what he hasn't told us at this point is how this individual was able to get hold of a gun. Now, gun ownership is fairly high in Thailand, certainly when you compare it to other countries in Asia. But there are checks and balances. You have to be at least 20 years old. There are background checks that are routinely done. So the question has to be how did a 14-year-old with mental issues manage to get hold of a gun? Now, one other thing that the national police chief did say was that he wanted to commend the police and also those in the mall for their quick action, saying that this situation could have been a lot worse given the fact that the suspect had more ammunition when he was apprehended.
