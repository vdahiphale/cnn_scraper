Our Donie O`Sullivan has more on this viral hoax. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O`SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There`s two parts of this, right? There`s, first is Elon Musk`s Twitter. And a lot of your viewers might remember the whole saga about the blue check marks on Twitter, the verified checkmarks. Musk has basically taken all of those away and is selling them now to people who want to get a blue check mark. So whereas before, if you had a blue tick on Twitter, it meant that Twitter had verified you are the person or the organization you`re claiming to be. That`s not really the case. So what happened this morning was somebody posted using an account that they claimed was linked to the Bloomberg News organization, posting that AI generated image and claiming there had been some kind of explosion at the Pentagon. That then got shared across multiple other verified accounts that we saw it on other platforms, too. It looked quite coordinated, but we don`t know right now who pushed this. Multiple experts we`ve spoken to and others who have observed this online say that that is an image generated by artificial intelligence. And you can see there particularly people who are familiar with Washington that the building in the picture is not the Pentagon. But, you know, it just goes to show, even with a crude fake like this and some verified accounts on Twitter, that, you know, you could still cause a lot of trouble. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Aconcagua is a mountain part of the Andes mountains, rising to around 22,000 feet. All right. Argentina has a massive, nearly 2-million-acre park called Ibera National Park, with thousands of plant and animal species and now they`re reintroducing the largest cats on the continent, jaguars. Awesome cats like the Collegiate Cougars in Richmond, Virginia. Now, bringing these jaguars back to the park`s ecosystem is part of the restoration or rewilding efforts happening there. Our Bill Weir has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Near the very top of that intricate food chain and vital to keeping it balanced, is the majestic jaguar. But until 2021, the biggest cat in South America had not been seen in the wild here for 70 years. KRISTINE TOMPKINS, PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER TOMPKINS CONSERVATION:  When we decided to try to reintroduce jaguars back into the Ibera ecosystem, we had to first understand what happened to them in the first place? So we went back in, it`s not hard to find. And you see why there are no jaguars left in this 2-million-acre territory. Kris and Doug Tompkins made a fortune in adventure gear and fashion, but now hold the legacy of launching what Chris calls a world first breeding program aimed at reintroducing keystone species back into the region.",
