But I think on the one hand, this does, potentially, show that Russia is now privatizing its relations with the Arab countries over what used to be a fairly warm relationship with Israel that has deteriorated since it started the war in Ukraine.Russia now needs Arab countries like Iran, for example, more than ever. They provide weapons that they use in Ukraine. So, if he had condemn this antisemitic violence to stamp out this kind of antisemitic tendencies, that might have upset people in these Arab countries, which have been up in arms over what has been happening in Gaza. Which is why instead of condemning it, Putin came out and said that what is happening in Gaza is not possible to justify. On the other hand, he also has a domestic constituency to appeal to because, of course, he doesn't want this violence to spread. Then he ends up with a domestic security problem coming just four months after an attempted coup a region that already has instability. And just six months before an election, albeit it one that will be what with what is unlikely to be a surprise outcome. So, hence, we see him blaming the U.S. That's a well worn tactic that appeals to a domestic audience he's able to deflect and distract and, hopefully, start this kind of violence from spreading. But a very significant moment for Russia and very revealing about the sort of complicated position that the President Putin finds himself in the moment.",

So, I think in some ways, he's still trying to thread the needle to keep that relationship up.But, of course, the war in Ukraine, Russia claiming that that is a war against Nazism and does not play very well into Israel. Israel has not joined sanctions against Russia, but it has condemned the war in Ukraine and come out against it, certainly, statements around fighting Nazism in Ukraine. So, I think, you know, we see the shift around the war in Ukraine. But, of course, it's crucial now for Putin to keep these allies in the Arab world up because he is now fully partnership with Iran, Syria is another ally of Russia, that is an enemy of Israel. So, I think with the war in Ukraine has certainly been, you know, a key part of shipping these alliances, creating this landscape ship for Russian in that region.",

Look at those temperatures in the upper 40s, lower 50s, along much of the east coast, especially in the northern tier. Look at, that flurries in the forecast for Chicago. That is a spooky forecasts, 39 degrees and clear from Denver. This is a Halloween forecast, again, for this afternoon and evening along the west coast, temperatures in the 50s and 60s. But when we talk about it this morning, stepping out the door today, we have freeze alerts that encompass much of the central parts of the country. We're talking 2,000-mile span of freeze alerts.

This includes Atlanta where we anticipate record low temperatures for many of these locations. I see these blue dots, plotting them out for you. You can see that general gist of where these cool temperatures will remain for the next 24 hours. It's a cool morning lows and a blast of autumn air starts to welcome in a fall-like weather pattern. At least for the foreseeable future, there is a warming trend and that's extended outlook. In the meantime, here's what you will wake up to over the next few days from Chicago, well below freezing, and New York City is flirting with the freezing mark. By Thursday morning, more of the same for Atlanta, Oklahoma City, as well as St. Louis. So, yeah, a spooky forecasts, bundle up, plan accordingly. It is not what we had yesterday.",
