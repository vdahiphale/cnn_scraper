What contributed to this? And it should be noted that, you know, the, you know, when many of us were growing up, maybe, am I the oldest person here? But when many of us were growing up, we didn't have these routine mass shootings with AR-15s. But guess what? AR-15s were available. So something's changed. And so one of the big things that we've seen in Sandy Hook and Parkland and other cases is that what's changed is the way these weapons are pushed on youth. And this is a crystal -- a tragic and unnecessary example of the repercussions of that. When we were growing up, nobody knew what an AR-15 was.

Why are we paying these officers? And then you want us to trust them with our families when they're getting paid to do nothing? We lost 19 children and two parents and another husband that died right after.[13:10:32] So really, I don't see where we should be rewarding our officers, because I was at the courthouse when they had the commissioner's court, and they asked me if they should have a raise, and I told them straight out, no, they don't deserve a raise. If you cannot serve and protect the people, these were children, all they wanted to do was play. There's no reason this should have happened. They should have did. They ignored the training that was supposed to be since Columbine, and they ignored it.

She refuses to answer any questions. She does have some meetings with them, but she's very evasive. She's been claiming that she's waiting to empanel a grand jury. There are some questions about that.So she's not very forthcoming on what she's planning to do. Many of them feel that she's not going to bring any criminal charges against any of the officers. They want charges. They want to see someone inside a courtroom facing charges for their failures. And I don't know if today gets them that, and it probably won't. It would be a very difficult task. And certainly the DA has not given any indication that she's planning on doing that. It's been stalled essentially, and everyone is trying to figure out, well, what is she waiting for? We're almost two years into this. And I just want to make one other very important point here about why we're even here today and why the Department of Justice is here today, because honestly, it's the mayor who, the former Mayor Don McLaughlin, and if it wasn't for him, the Department of Justice would never have been able to do this investigation. They would never be here telling the families what happened here. It was a very crucial moment because in the beginning stages of this, when the mayor realized that there perhaps could have been some kind of a cover up here, he quickly called the Department of Justice and said, I need help. I'm going to allow you into this investigation. No state official would have allowed him in. No other city official would have allowed the Department of Justice in. But he on his own against his party, the Republicans here against what the governor wanted him to do, what the Department of Public Safety wanted him to do. They didn't want DOJ in this. He said, no, I'm going to do this. I'm going to bring the DOJ here. And here we are today. And it is because of that the families are able to get the answers that they've been wanting. Because quite frankly, Brianna, I don't think we'd still be playing a guessing game here and the families would still be wondering, well, what really happened here. Because to this date, when you think of -- to this day, not one state official, not one state official has briefed these families. Not one city official has sat them down and said, let me tell you everything that has happened here. And it seems like today, at least for now, they have some answers. And as they said, they're going to keep fighting because there is just so much more. And they got to figure out how to bring this community together. To be here, you see it, you feel it. Even the families of the victims, there's some separation now. They aren't as united as they once were. And it's really hard to see. And I know for them it's certainly very painful. And maybe this today brings everybody together as we focus on the victims and the families, because I think that is the most important thing because what happened here was just so horrific and so bad that and shouldn't have happened. And that's why today is really just, I think it needs to be about those victims. [13:20:32] SANCHEZ: And Brett Cross, the father that we heard from previously, brought that up in his remarks, Shimon saying that now that this report has a DOJ stamp on it, maybe they'll take us seriously, people in the community, instead of telling us to move on. Shimon, please stand by. We want to go to CNN's Josh Campbell now to get some analysis on what is in the report. Josh, there's obviously an extensive list of failures outlined, some 273 recommendations. Notably, the attorney general spoke at length about a lack of training by some of the law enforcement officials that were at the scene. But how much of this, from your perspective, amounts to lack of training versus not just doing what has been mandated to be done since Columbine when officers arrive at a scene like that?",

      "speaker": "JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Well, this is striking on so many levels. And I think you see a bit of both there. There's the training aspect which is outlined in this report, and as the attorney general mentioned. But also, as I'll mention in a second, just the nature of being a police officer and what that means when you are in an emergent situation tasked with saving lives. First, on the training, the attorney general noted in the report, saying that what we've learned in the aftermath is that the vast majority officers who had arrived on the scene that day had received no training working with other agencies.And you have to think, you know, in this era of mass shootings, it's not just one department that's responding. It could be multiple agencies. And the idea that they haven't, you know, practiced some type of interagency training in advance is certainly unconscionable. And then the attorney general also said that when it comes to active shooter training, some of the officers there on the scene lacked any training at all. And so again, you have to think about what does that mean for leadership? I could tell you I grew up not far from Uvalde. I mentioned that because I know this area. It is not a place where police officers on a daily basis are dealing with endless emergent situations. The reason why that is important is because if you are a police leader, you take that time when you're not responding to shootings and, you know, urgent situations to train, to prepare. And so I still ask myself, you know, what was this police chief doing spending that time in order to prepare those officers for the day that tragedy might strike in his jurisdiction? The second part I'll mention, the actual nature of the profession. You know, this is a colossal failure. I've talked to law enforcement sources from coast to coast who say they are stupefied. They are appalled by what they see here. And just to put this into context, you know, I can remember going through tactical training in the FBI and the vivid words of a senior SWAT instructor who said, look, when you are going through a door to try to save lives, the first person through that door, the second person through that door, they may not make it home that night. That's the nature of the job. We'll take care of your family. But the third, the fourth, the fifth officer that goes through the door may be able to stop that threat. And the final point I'll make is that, you know, in the FBI academy, I know this happens in law enforcement academies across the country. Day one of training, you don't get instruction in firearms or law or tactics. In the FBI and in other training facilities, what they did is they brought us all into a room, all of the new recruits, in a dark room. We watched continual videos of law enforcement officers being shot in the line of duty. And after that gruesome display was over, the instructor stood in front of the room and said, look, this is a profession where you may die serving others. And if this is not for you, there is no shame in saying right now, this is not a job I can do. But there will be shame down the road if you make that decision when lives are on the line, when you're responsible for saving others. And it appears in looking at this incident in Uvalde, this colossal failure by officers there, that at least, you know, some of the officers that were in that hallway when it mattered most, they made the decision to put their own safety above the safety of a classroom filled with innocent, helpless children.",

Then individuals could be sued, you know, in their personal capacity, individual officers, first responders for being negligent on the job, right?Then put that aside. Criminal liability is always a possibility. If somebody was so negligent that their actions maybe constituted a crime, and that could happen as well. And then the big one, and this is the politically fraught one, lawsuits potentially against firearms manufacturers. These come up with mixed success, but sometimes firearms manufacturers are sued for negligence in the way they market and create their products. Now, again, that's a whole can of worms, but many people have tried to do that before. But these families, there's already a $27 billion civil lawsuit filed against some entities, so we'll see how those all shake.",

I think you'd be hard pressed to bring this 500-page document into court and say, admit this, because a lot of it's going to be hearsay, which often is not admitted into court. Now, everything in there is substantiated by interviews and conversations and documents, literally the receipts. And it's strong, it's damning, and it's really bad for the city of Uvalde.So, big picture, I would assume, what you'd see is a lot of settlements rather than going to trial and facing potentially billions of dollars, maybe far lower numbers and so on. And then finally, one more, there's so many legal questions. There's a potential civil rights investigation here, too, that the Uvalde Police Department so was negligent that they violated the civil rights of the people to attend school, which is a right you have, and you can be sued by the Justice Department for that as well.",
