It's Donald Trump's ads about transgender that are airing during football games and now this rally is giving Harris -- Vice President Harris a last-minute opportunity to take the wheel on the culture wars argument and say these are the people who feel elevated by former President Trump's campaign, and whether or not he pre-screened their jokes if you elect him again, you're going to get more of this. These are going to persuade voters who thought that they wanted to be voting on the economy?

So I think it's shocking to watch some of these comments. There -- that's -- come on, that's 2024, like let's move on. But I don't know that they will be the decisive factor in this race.

They're going to -- they know what they're going to do, but they're waiting into the last day or they don't know what they do, and they're going to go in at the last minute and say, what is my gut say. And so, all these things that seem like just a little piece really, really matter, particularly in a swing state, if -- if you are former President Trump and you're counting on the Latino vote, to move in your direction in Pennsylvania, is this going to help? Probably not. If you are Vice President Harris and you are counting on reproductive rights and abortion to carry -- propel a vote that completely overcomes people's concerns about how inflation and the price of goods have impacted you post-COVID on what has been the Biden/Harris watch, is this going to help carry you? Totally unclear. So, turnout really, really matters and we're going to see everything from these, you know, her version of a massive rally we're going to see tonight and Washington, D.C. today, in Washington, D.C., at the ellipse, but all of these efforts, they are both at turning out the base and at trying to just shave off or capture that tiny, ever shrinking element of persuadable voters.",
