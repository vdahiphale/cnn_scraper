Also, Tropical Cyclone Dana makes landfall in India. Hundreds of thousands of people in its path. Just 11 days remain for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to convince voters they're the right person to lead the country. To many people, the choice has already been made. More than 30 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting. Harris will spend her Friday in Texas looking for support at a rally focusing on abortion rights. She'll be joined on stage by singer Willie Nelson and superstar Beyonce, who's making her first appearance on the campaign trail. Trump will also spend part of his day in Texas. He will appear with Senator Ted Cruz before moving on to a rally in the swing state of Michigan. Now this all comes as the latest CNN poll of polls average shows the candidates separated by the thinnest of margins with absolutely no clear leader. Now at a rally in Georgia on Thursday, Harris was joined by some famous faces. She painted a stark difference between what day one in the White House would look like for herself versus Trump.

And these latest comments are right in line with the warnings made by Trump's former chief of staff that he wants to rule as a dictator with unchecked power. A second Trump term where a more unstable and unhinged Trump has essentially no guardrails and is surrounded by loyalists who will enable his worst instincts is guaranteed to be more dangerous.\" Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says she thinks Donald Trump is more dangerous than when she ran against him in the 2016 presidential election. Here's what she told CNN in an interview Thursday night.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I think he's more unhinged, more unstable. I think you see that all the time in both his rallies and his kind of word salad after word salad speeches. But you also see it in the interviews he does do, which are primarily with friendly outlets, where he can't follow the question, doesn't really answer the question. And then we certainly saw it for what, 39 minutes, when he just froze on stage and just kind of moved to music. So no, he's not the same person. Part of it is he seems to be totally obsessed by his grievances, his resentments, his getting even with people. And I think when you are living with that much bitterness and that kind of mindset, you are not able to communicate effectively because literally you are thinking all the time about who said something bad about you, who made, you know, kind of a comment that you disagreed with. You can't be president and have that kind of mindset. So I think that if people are paying attention, even if they voted for him before, once or even twice, they have to be honest enough to admit he is not performing anywhere near how he was, which I think makes him even more dangerous and frankly more manipulable by people around him, and let's be honest his foreign adversaries of our country who are watching what is a deteriorating performance with I think a certain amount of satisfaction. They're looking forward if he were to end up as president to continue to flatter and manipulate him into doing what they want him to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I've never seen a democratic candidate basically be so out in the open about how autocratic they're going to be, a dictator on day one, they're going to fire this person or that person, threatening election, people working on the elections, threatening poll workers, threatening anyone that goes against him, journalists. I mean, he's incredibly blatant and obvious that he's going to be an autocrat and the guardrails will be off. He's not going to be surrounded by the best people. A lot of the best people that worked with him so to speak have come out against it and said I can't work with him. I can't endorse him. His own vice president can't even endorse him. Several generals, high-level generals saying that he's a fascist, most recently General Kelly. And to Hillary Clinton's point about his mental decline, I mean that's been incredibly evident as well that he just isn't with it half the time. He can't maintain a spot. He goes off on tangent all the time. His memory is all over the place. He thought that he had debated in front of the audience and that's what he was bragging that the audience loved everything he said. There wasn't an audience there at the debate. So these are two real problems here that he has serious mental decline, but he has greater confidence in himself and his abilities which is going to make him easier for people to manipulate particularly for an adversary.",

He hasn't seen much of a drop in the polls.In fact, he's even seen his favorability ratings rise as he's going off on all these weird, you know, grievance-laden speeches about, you know, people having personal vendettas against him or off on weird tangents attacking immigrants and migrants and so forth that we -- you've spoken about many times before. But he's support base is just rock solid. And on top of that, he has these people who are not part of his base necessarily but to simply believe that they were better off economically when he was president. They are citing inflation and there's been all kinds of focus on inflation. Of course, inflation is affected by many other factors, doesn't really have to do anything that he did. Inflation was lower when Obama was president. But he's really gotten a big win with this and he's been able to maintain about 46 to 48 percent support so it's going to really matter whether or not these people weren't necessarily Trump supporters are going to the polls on Election Day.",

One from the Philippines and one from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.It was always going to be a rainmaker and, boy, it wasn't. More than a half a meter, more than 20 inches of rainfall fell in places and then, all of a sudden, it ran off and it ran off into cities, that ran off into valleys. And right through some of these spots where mudslides coming down the hills with all of those deaths already being reported. So you can see what's happening here. People just trying to get out of the way when the mud come sliding down. One big problem I think here is if you look at the end of the forecast, it does try to make a run, at Da Nang, but then it turns around and heads back. We certainly don't want this to head back and put more millimeters of rainfall along the coast of the Philippines. So Da Nang, you're going to get some significant rain, at least 250, maybe even 400 millimeters of rain before it finally stops. The problem is when it stops and it sits there, it could just rain for a day or two. Now, taking a look at the Indian Ocean because we had landfall here, here's Dana coming on shore. So many people in the way of this right now. So many people in the way of 150 to 250 millimeters of rainfall. It was a fairly big storm for awhile, 120 kilometers per hour going to die off as it makes landfall and starts to lose its water, and energy. But you are going to see significant rain in places that yes, they can use the rain. This is kind of in-between their seasons. But when you get 150 to 250 millimeters of rain in just 24 hours, that's an awful lot for anywhere on the globe. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
