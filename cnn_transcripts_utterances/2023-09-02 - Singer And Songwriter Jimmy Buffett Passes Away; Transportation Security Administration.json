For some context here, the former president had paid bills for advisers, both current and former, employees, aides, in both the January 6th committee investigation and both of those federal investigations. But obviously that is not the case here with Georgia.So it's making these co-defendants, who are now facing astronomical legal fees, have to turn to different creative measures. And that includes crowdfunding. We know at least four of them have started crowdfunding, that includes lawyer Jenna Ellis, election attorney John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, who is a former DOJ official, as well as Cathy Latham, who is a fake elector in Georgia. I am told that even though there have been grumblings by these co- defendants that they're not being helped by Donald Trump, that none of them have officially asked for help. And one official close to the former president said that if they want help they should apply to the legal defense fund. And a reminder, we talked about this legal defense fund established back in July because of these mounting legal fees, particularly for Trump's aides and advisers. They have been paid out of his Save America PAC, which is a leadership PAC, and we know that since 2021 that PAC has spent more than $41 million on legal fees. And, in fact, they've spent so much money on legal fees that recently they asked for a refund from a donation that they made for $60 million to a super PAC that was defending Trump. So that gives you an idea here of just how much money they are spending and how quickly they are spending it. In terms of that legal defense fund, it is unclear right now what, if any, funds exist in that fund. We are told that Don Jr. and Eric Trump have both been fundraising, that they have a lot of pledges, but unclear whether or not any of that is actual, tangible money, so, if those Georgia defendants were to request help, if there was any money to help them. So, something that we're keeping an eye on. But obviously it's going to be difficult for a lot of these co-defendants to muster up the cash that they need to pay these large attorney fees.

And the question is, as the wider electorate, not just Republicans, but Democrats, independents, those swing voters that we know can influence the outcome of the election, will the trial have an impact on them? That's the question. But again, so much is uncertain right now, because we don't know ultimately the timing of these trials, and even a start date doesn't mean that things -- jury selection could take some time, things like that.
