There's extra innings in our Constitution that nobody's ever played in hard. So, Trump goes and plays in those extra innings. Wait, what about this thing? What about the vice president? Now, the question is, is that wrong? No, it's not wrong. You can play in extra innings, but you can't cheat. You can't lie. You can't defraud. And so what's going to happen is, the other side's going to say, all Trump did was exercise his rights under our Constitution. And people who don't know this stuff will be confused. And so part of the challenge you've got here is, Constitutions aren't perfect. Everybody didn't go to civics class. Everybody's not a news nerd like us. And people are going to be easily confused.

We all agree Jack Smith is aggressive. Jack Smith has not charged any state electors, nor he's referenced them several times in this indictment, but he does not label them as CC 1, 2, 6, anything. He does not even say they are co- conspirators. In fact, he says in this indictment that some of those fake electors, he doesn't specify which, they were tricked, they were duped. And so the Michigan attorney general has now charged 16, every one who signed that.",

Those -- when Trump becomes the nominee they're going to go back to, he's a nominee, he can't do this now. That date's going to slide. So, everything's going to be tried after this. And I think the American people, at the election in 2024, in the presidential election, they'll be the ultimate jurors in this case. They'll decide whether they want Donald Trump to be president again or if they want Joe Biden to be the president again. That's what we're going to see here in the end.",
