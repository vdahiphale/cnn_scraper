We'll have a live report from Kyiv.Millions of people in the U.S. are under winter weather alerts. A winter storm is hitting large parts of the country. At one point, nearly a million of power outages were reported. And, Alec Murdaugh takes a stand in his own murder trial. He admits he lied to investigators who were looking into the killings of his wife and son. Ukraine's president is marking a year since Russia's military invasion with a message of strength and resilience. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 2023 will be the year of victory against Russia and he is promising to hold those accountable who brought war to Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  A year ago on this day, from the same place around 7:00 in the morning, I addressed you with a brief statement, lasting only 67 seconds. We are strong, we are ready for anything, we will defeat everyone. This is how it began February 24th, 2022. The longest day of our lives, the most difficult day in our recent history. We woke up early and haven't slept since. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is just round one, L.A. already dealing with showers this morning and then snowfall through the higher elevations, but this is going to really get nasty as we move into late Friday and into Saturday. All that heavy moisture has been tracking further south into L.A., which is really going to be beneficial. But the problem is now we're dealing with the flooding threats. Some of these locations picking up 4 to 8 inches of rain. L.A., Long Beach, areas highlighted in red where we have that moderate risk for flooding. Also, heavy snowfall. We talked about feet of snowfall, look at these darker colors, it doesn't even range through the legend here.

Look, again, we have proven our army can fight back, that we have one of the most efficient armies in the world. And giving weapons to this army is a safe choice.A year ago, you remember, everybody is saying we cannot give this modern weapon to Ukraine because they wouldn't know how to use them. But we have been using them extremely efficiency. And the more of that we get, the sooner we become a modern army, the sooner we would be able to win against the old style Russian soviet army, basically. So, the counter-offensive moment, there are different speculations about that, that it could over the spring or by the summer. I don't know. It's very difficult to predict. The situation is, of course, very unstable as in any war. But I know for sure that we can do this. And our army is just waiting for more weapons to be delivered so that they can launch a big counter-offensive and liberate our entire country (ph).",

Emergency teams rushed a 9-year-old Syrian girl and her brother from Syria across the border to Turkey for treatment. They are among the first survivors rescued in rebel-held parts of Syria to be given authorization to enter Turkey for treatment. The siblings were reportedly trapped under the rubble for 40 hours. Their father gave this update on their injuries.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMED SHEIKH MOHAMMED, FATHER OF INJURED CHILDREN (through translator):  Sham (ph) is suffering from crush syndrome from the knee down to the bottom due to the earthquake.

And in fact, here in Turkey, we've seen many people who are struggling, including Syrian families who moved over to Turkey years ago as a result of the war, displaced not only once by the conflict, but now multiple times.Many have lost their homes, have lost absolutely everything in the earthquake. And we've been visiting some of those families who are now being put up in refugee camps, or IDP camps rather in Antakya and in Iskenderun which is in the Hatay Province, which was among the hardest hit of the provinces here in Southeast Turkey by that earthquake a little over two weeks ago. And while so many are now living in these tents, there are still families who have registered their names, waiting to be offered a tent or a container where they can be housed temporarily. And they're still waiting more than two weeks on sleeping on the street. They've lost absolutely everything. Many have been telling us there is such little clarity over when they'll get a tent, when they'll be given that temporary accommodation. Some families are being put up in cruise ships now, which have opened their doors to those that have been displaced. And according to the authorities, there are at least 900,000 people in Southeast Turkey now living in these tents. Now, we have heard from the authorities they do say they are sending more tents over. In fact, we've been watching the authorities rapidly building these tents. One small encampment in Iskenderun went from just a couple of dozen tents to more than 200 overnight. So, this is an ongoing process. But there is a growing sense of frustration amongst some even anger over the government's response. They're saying not enough has been done. And look, these are families that have already been through so much. They've already been through so much trauma. They are going through aftershocks, of course, and that is difficult for them to relive, more than 8,000 aftershocks in the last 17 days. That's the amount of aftershocks this region would anticipate to see in about four months. So, people are still living in fear. So not only is this a difficult situation in terms of the humanitarian response, but this is a difficult time for those who are dealing with the emotional trauma of that earthquake. Max?",

The Israeli military says it's struck key targets in Gaza belonging to the Hamas militant group after a series of rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. Meanwhile, many Palestinians shops and schools across the region were closed on Thursday to protest against the recent raid.
