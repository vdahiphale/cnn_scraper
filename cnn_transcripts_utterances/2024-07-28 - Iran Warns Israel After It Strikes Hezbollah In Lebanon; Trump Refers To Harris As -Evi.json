He also really focused some of his attacks on her positions on immigration, the border, inflation. All issues I know that Donald Trump's team is telling the former president to focus on because those are the issues they believe that Republicans do better than Democrats.

And I think you can see some of that with that moment and other moments. Last night, he continued to attack Joe Biden anyway.

Now, one of the things that they also mentioned in this memo is that she now has over 170,000 volunteers across the country that are knocking on doors, talking to voters and really making that argument of why these voters should back Harris and what she would do if she is elected in this upcoming election.

And then we saw big pocketed donors like Elon Musk saying they'll put in $40 million a month. So, the Republicans are in pretty good shape as far as money goes. I think what this is doing is bringing Democrats back into parity with the Republicans to some degree. The numbers might not be exactly the same, but they're fairly close. So I don't see this as a huge advantage. What I see is a huge relief for Democrats because they were worried about the spigot drying up if Joe Biden didn't step down there.",

Harris campaign released a statement last night after Trump's speech in St. Cloud in which they said this, \"Tonight, a bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon kept clinging to his lies about the 2020 election he lost being rigged, rambled about his former opponent and golfing, and made excuses for why he's afraid to debate Vice President Harris.\"The Biden campaign was reluctant to refer to Trump as a convicted felon.

Kamala Harris is a young, vibrant, qualified Black woman running for president of the United States of America. And the other thing that's really going to hurt the Trump campaign, and B-Rob knows this better than anyone, that all the polling shows, even Republicans don't want the former president talking about the 2020 election. We know that he's basically been spreading that false narrative, those lies, now for over four years. And so as long as he's talking about the past and Vice President Harris' campaign is talking about the future, every single campaign that I've been on nationally, locally, if you're talking about the future, you're talking about issues that matter to the American people, then that's how you win this campaign. And the thing is, is that, look, Vice President Harris, where's Donald Trump on the debate, Victor? I know we don't have enough time to talk about that. He said anywhere, anytime. We're ready to debate Donald Trump, but he's scared to debate Vice President Harris because he knows that she would tear him up in the debate.",

The problem is those are going to start to warm back up. Now, we were able to make some containment number jumps. We went from 0 percent to 10 percent. That's fantastic news.Today is really going to be the last day where we can really hope to bring those back up simply from weather alone because we're going to start to see those numbers begin to increase starting tomorrow. Now, overall, you've still got more than 90 active wildfires across nearly a dozen Western states, so the park fire is not alone. But the reason the park fire takes so much of the attention is because of how quickly it spread. Over 350,000 acres so far have burned just since late Wednesday. You do the math. That's roughly 50 football fields burning on average every single minute. So just to kind of put that in perspective for you now, that area, but also some other areas, wind is going to be one of the big components here where you see the pink. That's where we have red flag warnings. Now you're talking 30 mile to 35 mile per hour wind gusts that can take a lot of those embers and spread them very quickly. It can also spread the smoke. So you've got a lot of these air quality alerts out here for numerous states because that smoke is going to be very thick in some places. So if you have respiratory problems, this is likely going to be a concern. Maybe try not to spend too much time outdoors if you can. We've got the potential for dry thunderstorms across the northern tier and then also those above average temperatures as well as those gusty winds.

You never want to do it, but sometimes it's necessary. And you know what just happened in the Democratic Party? The ultimate example of recasting. You know, that's what happened, right?

Vance's comments from 2021, where he was insulting childless people. Let's listen to that comment that's gotten a lot of play lately.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I've got nothing against cats. The substance of what I said, Megan, I'm sorry, it's true. It is true that we've become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, and Aniston posted to her 44 million Instagram followers that she hoped Vance would didn't have a daughter who would be unable to conceive. You know, she's been open about her IVF journey. She also appeals a lot to, you know, the Gen Z and the millennial crowd and the Gen Xers who are siding with her on social media.Do you think the Trump-Vancecampaign will now have to, I don't know, summon its Gen X celebrity supporters to counter the bad press or, you know, how are they going to fight this one?",

A great majority of Americans would support pro family policies, but that's not what Vance was talking about on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" three years ago. And the problem for Vance is that he went on that show a bunch of times.You know, J. D. Vance loved to go on Tucker Carlson's show and say provocative things in order to get booked again and get millions of viewers. So, this is going to be a recurring problem for Vance and thus for the Trump campaign. And the Trump campaign just does not have as many levers to pull, when we talk about this cultural power, right, these celebrity endorsements. They have some, but they don't have nearly as many. When you see stars like Jennifer Aniston or yesterday, Cardi B calling Trump a dictator on Twitter or on X, that sort of thing is going to keep happening every day. And I think it matters for the following reason. It becomes an entry point or a touch point for people who might not care as much about politics, who might not be paying attention every day, but when they see someone they trust, a big Hollywood celebrity talking about it, it becomes an entry point for them into politics for the first time.",
