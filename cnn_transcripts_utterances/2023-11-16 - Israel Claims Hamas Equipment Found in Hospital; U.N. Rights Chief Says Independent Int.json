But at some stage, it will be important to have access to all of these locations, to have access to the evidence and to be able to construct what has been happening. But what it means, also, we need to insist on standards of law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law. And that really must be the guidance in whatever each of the parties are doing when they continue conducting hostilities.

Because communications have been cut off in parts of northern Gaza. It has proven extremely difficult to speak with doctors within Al-Shifa Hospital, as well as journalists on the ground, getting slow information and video coming out. Of course, there is a huge amount of concern over the safety and security of hundreds of patients and medical staff inside the hospital. As we heard yesterday from doctors within Al-Shifa during that raid, which is said to be ongoing, the sounds of heavy fighting on the outskirts of the hospital complex, one journalist on the ground describing the walls of the hospital shaking from the shelling. Of course, CNN is not on the ground; we cannot independently verify these reports. But by all accounts, the messages that we've been hearing from doctors, medical officials, is that the situation that Al-Shifa is facing right now is hugely dire and is deteriorating by the hour. We know of course, Al-Shifa is one of the last majority hospitals in Gaza, which are now technically in operation. They are struggling to provide the care that is so desperately needed for patients in the hospital, because of a lack of fuel, supplies, a lack of electricity and oxygen, as well as crucially, a lack of medicine. As we saw yesterday, this raid, now by the Israeli military, has only made the situation more difficult, more challenging and more dangerous for medical staff inside the hospital. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voice-over):  Weeks of bombardment had already left Gaza as large as hospital and what has been described as a catastrophic situation. Doctors at Al-Shifa working under impossible circumstances caring for hundreds of patients as Israel's military incursion moves inside the hospital. DR. MOHAMMAD ZAQOUT, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITAL IN GAZA (through translator):  The occupation soldiers are still on the ground floor. They are searching employees, civilians, even the injured and patients. Some were stripped and placed in dehumanizing and miserable conditions. BASHIR (voice-over):  Israel's raid on Shifa has been described as precise and targeted, focused, they say on claims of a Hamas command center beneath the hospital. But it is civilians including medical staff and patients that have been caught in the center this unrelenting battle. AHMED EL MOKHALLALATI, SENIOR PLASTIC SURGEON, AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL:  We can't look through the windows and doors. We didn't know what's happening. Tanks are moving within the hospital. You can hear continuous shooting. You can't hear it now. But again, it's a totally scary situation.",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, in early weeks of this war, we saw leaflets being dropped on northern Gaza, warning civilians, telling them that they neededto move southwards for their safety. This area would be safe from bombardment. Although, important to underscore, it has not been over the last few weeks. Now we hear reports that leaflets have been falling on neighborhoods around the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza, telling civilians to move to known shelters. This is a huge point of concern. It does suggest that we may begin to see ground incursions headed toward southern Gaza. We heard last week from Israel's defense minister, suggesting that Israel would look to move further southwards, that this war could last months. As we know, according to U.N. figures, there are some 1.5 million Palestinians that have now been internally displaced, the vast majority of them moving southwards, hoping that this will remain a safe space as designated by the Israeli Defense Forces. We know of course, airstrikes and bombardment have continued across southern Gaza. This isn't a totally safe space. Hospitals in southern Gaza are overrun and overwhelmed. We know, of course, that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are now taking shelter in U.N. run schools and other facilities across southern Gaza. So the suggestion or indication that we may begin to see ground incursions in addition to the ongoing airstrikes in southern Gaza have certainly raised alarm bells. CNN has not been able to independently verify the details around these reported leaflets. We are not on the ground but we have spoken to humanitarian workers, who have suggested that this may well be in fact verified by their teams on the ground. But this will certainly be a huge concern for civilians and U.N. agencies, particularly, as you heard there, following that resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council, calling for extended pauses in order to allow for humanitarian relief to actually get into the Gaza Strip. This warning, if it has indeed called for civilians, if it is indeed signaling a ground incursion, will essentially stand against any suggestion of a window for humanitarian relief to get in. As we know, for some 1.5 million people, displaced, in a warning to the U.N. that there is nowhere safe left in Gaza, this is only going to make the situation much, much worse.",

They walked to the car; President Biden said goodbye. President Xi obviously dealing with a number of domestic issues, including high youth unemployment, a slow-growing economy. There is a housing crisis. But he is getting praise from state media, which, of course, is a direct reflection of the government. But he is getting praise for making it clear to the United States, in this reporting here from China, that he made it clear to President Biden that you should not be getting involved in the way China does business, the way that China conducts itself around the world. So overall, a very positive message. There was also a dinner last night with business leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook, with Tesla's Elon Musk. And president Xi was there. He talked to the crowd and he made it very clear that China is open. He definitely wants foreign investments. So he continued those feelings of goodwill.

When we talk about this military to military communication, you could say that it refers to the lines that cannot be crossed. China has had some run-ins with U.S. surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea, over the Taiwan Strait, that is really problematic for them. And now that these lines of communication are open, these barriers, these red lines are almost -- they're going to be very set. But the second reason why this is important is that, if you have this communication, things hopefully will not go backward. I'm thinking about the issue with the time it was a suspected spy balloon but the United States shot down a Chinese balloon over U.S. airspace. We spent many hours talking about that. Well, the problem with that is that, after that incident happened, there was no communication. If lines of communication were already established when that happened, it would have been a chance for China to talk to U.S. officials behind the scenes before it escalated into something greater. So while these phrases about open communication sometimes get trivialized, it is really important that these governments be able to pick up the phone in the best of times and even in perilous and challenging times.",

Becky, (INAUDIBLE) we got calls today from the foreign ministry, that from the stance of 400 people who have taken shelter in the Latin monastery in Gaza about 4 kilometers away from our hospital, they're leaving with us. One doctor called Mahad Saba (ph), who is from Romania, saying his mother does not have access to water. She is among 400 people who have taken shelter in that church. Now are you telling me there are military tunnels under this church? Those people cannot move. They asked if they can move to our hospital but the Israeli army is shooting at anybody that moves within the vicinity. So again, this has gone beyond what anybody can stay silent against. Any other country who has done would be under sanctions by now. So why not against Israel? Is it above the law? (CROSSTALK)",

Israel's killing people, killing innocent people, destroying 61 percent of all Gaza's medical infrastructure, which has been destroyed. Any underground facilities where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are taking shelter, there's one shower to every 700 people. So you can imagine, with bodies not buried, the kind of health catastrophes we're going to have going forward. And let me say, beyond killing those innocent people, Israel has killed any embrace of peace in the region. It is jeopardizing all its peaceful relations. We were discussing with Israelis a while ago, the prosperity deal, as it were called, we provide them solar energy and they provide us water. That discussion has stopped now. The peace treaty that we have with Israel now, which, in this environment, where people just see what Israel is doing, it will not allow for any kind of interaction. So to be under the document collecting dust because people are simply outraged to the extent that they don't see any value of talking or dealing with Israel now. They pushed us back to beyond 30 years ago in terms of people's belief in the viability of peace. And that's all on Israel. Israel is not producing security for itself by the killing of innocent Palestinians. It's putting the whole region on fire again. And it has destroyed the hard work that many have made over decades to make sure that we come to a peaceful conclusion to this conflict so Palestinians and Israelis can live in peace.",

You have one country that's challenging your connective will, violating international law and not listening to anybody when they say stop the killing. And what are we going to do next? What's the next resolution that's going to come from the Security Council? And the world should ask the question, what will we do if Israel continues to say no and continues in challenging the whole world and acting as if it is above the law? These are serious questions that I think put the whole international community and the whole idea of international law and (INAUDIBLE) values on the test fire (ph) here. We have failed at this thus far. The world has failed at this thus far. And will Israel be allowed to continue with this? Again, what Israel is doing is not about to bring about peace or security to anybody in the region, certainly not to the Palestinians but definitely not to Israelis as well, because it's simply investing, creating an environment of hatred, of careless that will not be conducive to peaceful interaction. That is one of the big things of what Israel is doing, killing an environment that could embrace a peaceful coexistence with Israel, which is, again, extremely dangerous, extremely tragic. But again it's on Israel, it's not on anybody else. They chose this path, they're continuing to fight the international community, they're continuing to (INAUDIBLE) hospitals, with no convincing reason.

And we heard from David Cameron, when speaking to President Zelenskyy here in Kyiv this morning. And he said, \"We are here for the long haul. We are here to provide you with moral, with economic and most importantly with military support for as long as you need.\" And we know, Becky, this is going to be a long war. Britain is obviously committed but there are countries in the West that are wavering. There is great concerns, as to whether the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine, depending on what happens with the elections next year. But certainly, Ukraine welcomed the visit from David Cameron. This has come at an extremely difficult point in the war. We are 21 months in, come next week. As you know, the world is heavily distracted by what is taking place in the Middle East. So really, to have David Cameron here, when the counteroffensive, which has been going on for four months, has not yielded the results or the breakthroughs that the West was hoping for, this is really -- just the confidence, perhaps, that Ukraine needs to know that the world hasn't forgotten.",

Police in Vancouver described it as a spontaneous pro Palestinian protest. Nearly 100 officers were deployed to disperse the protesters. Police report two arrests. They say one protester punched a responding officer in the face and gouged her eyes.
