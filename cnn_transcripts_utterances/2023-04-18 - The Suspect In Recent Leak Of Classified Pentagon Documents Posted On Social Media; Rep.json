Napoleon was at Notre Dame in 1804 when he took the crown from Pope Pius VII and placed it on his head by himself. Notre Dame, an 860-year-old Cathedral in Paris is one of the most iconic churches in the world, but a massive blaze in 2019 destroyed large parts of the relic including its idyllic spire and its roof which collapsed as firefighters battled the blaze. The roof had been said to be made of a forest because of the acres and acres worth of trees that were made into beams to build it. But Notre Dame is being rebuilt now. Let`s meet up with CNN Senior International Correspondent Jim Bittermann in Paris to see how this majestic monument is coming along. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And soon, if you believe, the general, who President Emmanuel Macron put in charge of rebuilding the monument.

(On camera):  Well, much care and effort and money are being expended to make sure the reconstructed Notre Dame is just like the old one. The workers who are working on these giant pieces of wood say they are sometimes amazed at how they could have done all this 1000 years ago. (Voice-over):  One person who`s had a better view than most of the Notre Dame reconstruction is photographer Tomas Van Houtryve. His photos are going up along the walls of the Notre Dame worksite. He began taking pictures of the cathedral long before the fire, sometimes using an ancient wooden camera as old as the iconic spire itself. Van Houtryve was then commissioned to document the Working side by National Geographic and the French establishment charged with the Notre Dame restoration and preservation. As the monument slowly rose again from the ashes, he emotionally recorded the work inside and outside.",
