A grand jury in Ohio deciding not to charge eight officers who shot a Black man nearly four dozen times after a chase. Police say they thought he was armed. And payback from DeSantis. The governor threatening to build a competing theme park or even a state prison right next to Disney. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, 25 years in prison just for taking on Putin. That is the shocking sentence handed down to Putin opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza. Kara-Murza's formal crime is criticizing Putin's war in Ukraine, which, of course he did, and did so bravely, just like he did on this show a year ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Governor, you've been clear repeatedly -- you and I have talked about this, right, that taking on a private company for their decisions on what they speak out on and how they run themselves is just not something you agree with. You disagree with Governor DeSantis on this, but now, he's not threatening just to take the land about Disney and raise their taxes. He's putting out their ideas like a new state prison. Your reaction? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE:  Well, yeah. Look, I think everyone's going to make the joke that, you know, Disney is going to have a new -- a new ride right next door that they can -- they can enhance with the new prison, right, or something. Look, I -- this has gone from kind of going after a headline to something that is devolved into an issue and it convolutes the entire Republican message. I just don't think -- it's not good for the -- for Governor DeSantis. I don't think it's good for the Republican Party. We tend to -- I think we have a great product as Republicans with limited government, limited government and local control and low taxes, individual responsibility. But that gets all muddled up with our messaging. We're horrible at selling our message. And so, I'm just trying to make the party bigger. I want independents. I want young voters to get on board. I want all these disenfranchised for us to get back. This does not help the team and I just want the team to be able to win in November 2024.",

Dominion may not be as motivated.
