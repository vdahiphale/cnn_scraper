You will spend the whole day with all of your colleagues talking about the style of the debate last night. But one of the things that is really clear is that last night when Donald Trump was talking, basically everything that he said was a lie and they were malevolent lies. And I think there were two people on that stage last night. My best bet is in a couple of days, we're going to find out that when the public watches that debate and the media fact checks with Donald Trump said, if he wasn't lying, he was doubling down on the most incredible policies that he has.

He won it on decency. And he won it on the ideas that people think are important in the country.I don't think that you can call the debate as a great time for President Biden. I think he had a rough time last night. There's no question about it.

Donald Trump is 77. So you had a guy last night that was 81 that had a difficult time and you had a guy that was 77 that lied in his -- and when he spoke the truth, he was speaking malevolent truth. That's the choice that the country has. And so, you know, you can -- you can -- you can judge the debate on style, if you want. I think when people get a little bit clearer from this, they're going to see that Donald Trump last night actually was unhinged as he's indicated that he's going to be and he's going to double down on the policies he had when he was president four years ago, which were not good for the country.",

Joe Biden is not averse to hearing things that are bad.He has to make the decision about whether he's going to be a candidate or not. He has done that, and he's going to be the nominee. So again, he started off slow last night. I thought he had some really good points during the debate. Concentrate on the fact that Donald Trump did not tell the truth the entire night.

You were both competing for the same job.But I actually got to work near him, not alongside them, but near him when he - I was in the Senate. And, listen, I'll give you a perfect example, OK. I was not a fan of him going to meet with Kim Jong-un. I thought, that guy's nuts, Kim Jong-un. He's out of control. He's a wild man. Nothing's going to come of it. I was very skeptical. He met with him three times. The second time he actually left early, didn't even go to the lunch. Trump canceled it because he didn't like the way North Korea was behaving. By the third meeting that they had, Kim Jong-un stopped launching short range - the missiles that he was testing for the duration of the Trump presidency. Now, he felt that if he can create some interpersonal relationship with the guy, he can get him to stop doing these things. It worked. It was real. That happened. I saw it. I witnessed it.

But the fact of the matter is, that in every single televised debate since 1960, the people that are making that argument are the losers of the debate. The fact is, that if you are on television, style matters. And it - you can just see it in terms of how Joe Biden just did not win in terms of the public performance of this debate.",
