How much danger does this pose to either one of the major candidates, but especially President Biden?REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): This election is going to be a near run thing, going to come down to a few states. It's going to come down to a couple of hundred thousand voters. So any third party candidate, especially with the last name like Kennedy, poses a significant challenge. And it's unclear out of whom he takes votes, right? Trump or Biden. I think voters are going to have to dial into Robert F. Kennedy's access to the ballot and how he has gotten where he is. He has used a super PAC to get onto the ballot at some states. He's looking at the Libertarian Party to get on the ballot in other states. It's all being funded by MAGA donors trying to prop him up as a stalking horse. Voters are going to have to, I think, peel back some of the layers of that name and say, who is this person really, and who is he helping? Because I think the answer is going to be he's helping Donald Trump. And who he is, is someone taking advantage of his family name to further his own ambitions and his own conspiracies.",

Now, whether that lasts going forward in the election, I think it's a question we've seen. But as you noted, every single vote is going to matter, particularly in the few battleground states that both nominees are trying to. BEDINGFIELD: I think this is why there has to be there has to be an effort to educate, and voters have to understand these voters who say, I don't want Trump. I don't want Biden. They have to understand that a vote for Kennedy or a third party candidate is effectively going to hand the election to one or other of the -- of the primary candidates. I mean, there is no universe under our current system where a third party candidate is going to win enough electoral votes to be president of the United States. Now, that's a whole -- we can have a whole other discussion about why that is and whether that's a good thing or not. But the fact of the matter is, you know, for November. So that is a task, you know, like I would say that the Biden campaign has in front of them, is to help these voters understand that casting a vote for Robert Kennedy, for example, is not so much casting an anti-establishmentarianism vote as it is, you know, saying, well, Donald Trump's going to have a second term.",

      "sentences": "Right. So I did a focus group for \"The New York Times\" all about these voters who had voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and then voted for him again in 2020 but now said, I'm off the Trump train.And I wanted to get at why. And for some of them, it was things like January 6 that came up. They said, I was with him, but that to me was a breaking point. But there were others who said, you know, I thought he was going to be this outsider. I thought he was going to be this change agent. I thought he was going to be anti-establishment, and now he kind of is the establishment. Now we know what we're getting with him. We know what this looks like. And I don't think I want it anymore. And so it was fascinating to me to see what does a Trump to RFK voter look like? And it has me taking him a little more seriously as actually potential threat to Trump's coalition for that kind of -- I don't want to say low-propensity. But that's in the political polling. What we would call them, the type of folks who they're not -- probably not watching the news every day. But they tune in periodically. They're -- might vote if they found someone compelling. They were a big part of Trump's coalition in 2016. What if Trump doesn't have them this time around, and they go to RFK? That could be very fascinating.",

And you know, I also was really interested to see that Chris LaCivita, the co-campaign manager, top Trump official, newly installed RNC chief of staff, says that they're going to hire lawyers who are going to battle on election integrity from an offensive instead of a defensive posture. So it's like were eight months out, and they're already looking at fighting like -- there's already the specter of them saying, regardless of what happens in this election, it's going to be fraudulent.

I mean, Donald Trump had already been acting like he was the presumptive nominee, even before Nikki Haley dropped out. They have been already very earnest in their efforts to expand across several battleground states.I'm told they're really focused on seven in particular. That includes Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, obviously, where we saw Donald Trump over the weekend. And that's going to continue even more in earnest now that he is -- officially has enough delegates to make him the presumptive nominee, or to win the Republican nomination come July. But as for the RNC, that's also where a lot of this focus is coming. And they've been very eager to have the full infrastructure of the party behind Donald Trump, all united behind Donald Trump to really boost him in this effort. And yes, a huge focus is this election integrity part that they want the RNC to focus on. They brought in one Republican lawyer. His name was Charlie Spies. He's someone that is going to be chief counsel for the RNC, handpicked by Chris LaCivita, who we know now has a massive role at the RNC. And then also Christina Bobb. She's a former OANN or One America News Network correspondent, someone who has peddled election lies in the past. She's also joining the RNC to work on election integrity, in specific. And that's something that Donald Trump had long really wanted the RNC to focus on. We know one of his chief frustrations with Ronna McDaniel, and part of the reason we saw him ultimately push for her ouster, is because he didn't think she was doing enough to battle the fraud that he viewed happened during the 2020 election. That is something that still to this day has frustrated and concerned Donald Trump. And it's something that he really wants this new chairman at the RNC, Michael Whatley, to focus on as they look ahead to November.",
