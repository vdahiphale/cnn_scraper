      "sentences": "As you watch the map fill in, right now, we know Donald Trump's going to win. We know that from our projection, which is based on the exit poll -- entrance poll, excuse me, which is based on key precincts, with based on what we're seeing and hearing, on the ground.The question is the margin, right? At the moment, he's at 54 percent. Governor DeSantis, at 19 percent. Nikki Haley at 19 percent, if you round that up. So now, right now, early in the count, very early in the count, look at all the gray. A lot of the 99 counties have reported nothing. It's a battle for second place. And right now, it is quite a spirited battle, for second place. If it stays this way, Donald Trump wins twice. He would win by winning with a big margin like that, especially if he stays over 50 percent. And he would win that there's no clear alternative below him. But I'm saying that at 9 o'clock in the east. We have a long way to go in this count. So, what else are we seeing in the map? Two counties, at the moment, where Nikki Haley is leading, one is Johnson County, Iowa City, a more moderate county, in the eastern part of the State College Area there as well. Another college area here, Story County, Des Moines -- north of Des Moines, there, where Haley is leading, at the moment. But look, 25, 13, 10, this is a tiny, tiny smattering of votes. That's one precinct probably. And we have our first DeSantis county of the night, up here. Sioux County, in the northwest county of the state. Again, northwest Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska, think that. You're rural. You're prairie. You're out this way here. DeSantis ahead, early though, 127 to 104 to 74. So, you're watching the map fill in. And it's one -- now, since we know Trump is going to win, the big question is by how much. And where? We know he'll be strong in these rural counties here. The question is in these places here, this is where Sarah (ph) has been throughout tonight, in Linn County, very early in the count. If Trump keeps this Trump red, that's a big win for Donald Trump. This is not a place, where he was strong in 2016. And it's a place, where in both general elections, he did not perform well. If suburban Republicans are coming back to Donald Trump, that would be a plus, coming out of Iowa. But as we watch this, Erin, remember, the most important thing, we know Donald Trump's going to win. The second most important thing, there's a lot of gray on this map. So, we don't know by how much. And we don't know what's going to happen, beneath him. And what happens beneath him, if there's no consolidation, and DeSantis and Haley are kind of congested together? That leaves it pretty murky, as Donald Trump goes on to a state, where he has done well in the past, New Hampshire. And then, if we get a consolidation? We know a little more. Let's listen.",

They took -- they were in grocery -- grocery store paper bags, is where they collected the ballots, these color-index cards. They brought them out here, laid them all out, divided them by name, and then counted them, and then counted them twice. Two precincts are in this gymnasium, Ames Precinct 23 that we -- Ron DeSantis got 29 votes, and brought in 38.7 percent of this precinct. Haley -- Nikki Haley was next with 22 votes, 29.3 percent of this precinct. And then, Donald Trump, he received 20 votes, which was 26.7 percent of this precinct. So, this is just one of the 24 precincts, in Ames, just Ames, and how this process work. They brought out those color-index cards, Erin. They counted them all out, counted them twice. Four or five volunteers, just from the bleachers inside, they were asked to come, help with the counting. Just as John was talking about, regular folks, volunteering, all came out here, counted them up. You see some of them kind of looking over. They were gathered, looking over some of the final counts. There is some volunteering, they're actually signing up for. And back inside the gymnasium, they're getting back to some more local county party business. And that's how it's gone down, here. It seems that it's gone pretty flawlessly. They counted it twice. And now, that's how this caucus works here, in Ames. Erin?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, the value of having these great reporters, in the key areas, around the state, is they're actually ahead of this count, right?So, that count -- anything counted there, right there, before her eyes, again, as Kate notes, will be double-checked and triple-checked on the scene, and then reported to the Iowa Republican Party. And then, it gets released, as official, and fed. So, our reporters, on the scene, in these key precincts, are ahead of the math, if you will, of what we're going to see here. But let's just come out, to the statewide map, first, just to check in again, not much has changed. The former President is well ahead, as a contested ballot for second place. Again, we're very, very early in the count. But look how close this is at the moment. 599 votes to 580 votes. It also tells you we got a long way to go, if it's 599 votes to 580 votes. We got thousands more votes to count. But you're looking at the map fill in. And if you're Donald Trump, that's your red. You're more than happy, at the moment, because you're just hoping -- your goal now, at Donald Trump, is to stay above 50 percent. That's your big goal. You're going to win the state? You want to stay above 50 percent, for the message that gives you, coming out of it. So, where Kate was? That was the context you ask. Story County is again, it's the seventh largest of the 99 counties. It's about, where are we, 3 percent of the population, smaller population of Republicans. This is one of the more Democratic counties in Iowa. But you have Ames here, college town. If you pull out to look where we are here? This is where you've had the biggest population growth. One of my questions, coming into this, is since 2016, when Donald Trump first ran, first took over his hostile takeover. Now, friendly Republican Party, 60,000 people have moved here to Metro Des Moines, since then. Now, they're not all Republicans. They're not even all voters. But one of my questions is what's new this cycle? And does that impact things? And so, you're looking for where the new voters are, and whether they make a difference, if they turn out. And so far, in the early results, we got a long way to go. But if Donald Trump, right now, is well ahead? It's 10 votes, two votes, one votes. So, it almost doesn't count. It's the first precinct's in. But in Polk County, Donald Trump running ahead. And in Story County, Donald Trump down low. This is interesting, if it stays like this, and he stays way down here. But that's what you're looking for, Erin. We don't have the answers yet. These are the seeds of the clues. But where Kate is, is one of the key places of even if Donald Trump wins Iowa tonight, by how much, and how strong is he, heading on to other states? We'll learn that as we get more votes later.",

They're moving on quite efficiently. And you see all the campaigns, they're counting. It's wonderful to watch. Where Dana Bash is, so I'm going to pull up Polk County here. This is Des Moines. Clive is unique. It's right out here. It's right out here on the border. She's in Polk County. But it also -- Clive also extends over into neighboring Dallas County. It's one of the fastest growing areas in Iowa. The Des Moines suburbs, you've been there. I mean, 10 campaigns ago was my first campaign, to go to Des Moines, in the suburbs, now, and to remember what they were like in 1987, and 1988. It is literally A and Z. And so, that's where you have new voters. That's where you have suburban voters. That's where you have the higher college education. The insurance industry, finance industries. The Des Moines suburbs are just gang -- growing like gangbusters. Younger people as well. So, watching the votes there is very important. It's if -- again, if you're going to say, this is Trump's party, all that red, that tells you this is Trump's state, and this is Trump's party. The question is, where are the new people going? And how -- are they for Trump? What's happening? So that's -- it's fascinating to watch a place like that. Earlier on, Nikki Haley was leading out here, in Johnson County. Again, about 60 percent of the vote count, ways to go. She's close. But Trump has now pulled ahead in this county. Again, if Donald Trump is winning, in a county, over here, in eastern Iowa, that has a big college, in the middle of it right there, that's a sign of strength for Donald Trump. The one place, where Nikki Haley remains ahead. But we're still very early in the vote count here. This has not changed in quite some time. This is where we were talking to Kate Bolduan, earlier.

So, it's a version of Trump-Cruz 2016, except Trump's on top, and by more. That's his hold on the party.Trump and Cruz were battling for the conservative vote, the evangelical vote, the rural vote, the farmer vote, in 2016. Now, it's Donald Trump's. And Ron DeSantis is trying to pull second place from that. So, let me come back out. I hit the wrong button. Let's bring this back in here. I just want to close this, and come back, just to see in places where Nikki Haley is running second. Again, all that red is Donald Trump. Where is she running second? Some. Some. Fewer than DeSantis. But some. And then, if you notice, where Nikki Haley is running second, with some exceptions, like down here, tend to be around your city, and suburban areas, which should be a sign of strength, for her. Interesting to see that down here. I just want to see by how far she's second. OK. She's second. But that's a drop. I mean, if that -- you know, that's 95 percent too, in these small counties. So, she's second. But I don't know what you'd call it. That's not a moral victory, when it's 61 to 18. So, let's turn this off and just come back to the full count. Again, Trump, 15,000-plus, just went up a little bit more, as we fill in right now. And it's going to go fast now, in the places that it took a little longer, maybe for the candidate representatives give their speeches, in places where you have the city dots, where you have more people. So, it just takes a little bit longer, to get through the process. Now that you see it filling in. Every five or 10 minutes, now, we're going to get a decent amount of more votes. But this has held. This has held. And, so has this. The question about -- about 37 percent. This can be a little bit off. But we're roughly a little over a third of the vote.",
