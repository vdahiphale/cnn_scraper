And you can see they've had people pretty steadily coming in here all day long, lining up the process. Very simple, and they're very good at it here in New Hampshire. They know how to do this. People walk up to this table right here behind me. They have to say what ballot they want.Are they voting in the Democratic primary, the Republican primary? And if they are undeclared, remember, there are Democrats in New Hampshire, Republicans, and undeclared voters, which actually make up the biggest block. If they're undeclared, they have to say what ballot they want. And then they get their ballots right here. They walk over to these voting booths. We're not going to get too close to the voters actually casting ballots. But they walk over to these voting booths. They cast their ballots. Check the name. If it's Joe Biden, they have to. It's actually right in his name. Don't forget that. He is a right- in candidate here in New Hampshire. Then they walk their ballots from here over to that black box over yonder there. Now, as of about two minutes ago, there were 1,726 ballots cast at this location, 1,726. In 2016, the last time there was a competitive Republican primary, there were 3,700 votes cast total here. So, are they on track for record turnout? It's hard to see. They're not halfway there just yet, but it could get busier later in the day. I would say it's steady but not overwhelming. Once voters cast their ballots, they walk out here, and we are actually allowed to talk to them. What's your name? HEIDI ROY (ph), NEW HAMSPIRE VOTER: Heidi Roy.",

Big task, but with a huge turnout and people I know that have been here for years, and this is my home, the polling places have been packed since early this morning. We're going to get a big turnout. I think it's Trump's, and I think it's in that 12 to 15 percent range, probably low 50s. And I think it's maybe around 40 for Nikki Haley, if I had to guess. But could it be tighter?

The DeSantis getting out on Sunday, on Sunday -- well, NFL playoff game surprised even me, the timing of it. I think it cuts both ways. I really think Nikki Haley has done a good job. Chris Sununu the governor here is doing all week, all he can for Governor Haley. But it's a tall order. Donald Trump, you look at the people just a few weeks ago in New Hampshire who were in the field. Christie, Ramaswamy, DeSantis, gone. Nikki Haley wanted a two-person race as she's got it.

These are calculations done with advisers, campaigns and family. And what's the best outcome? I don't think she wants to not do well in her home state. I asked Donald, Trump this morning. He was on with me, Anderson, not for eight minutes, 15 minutes, 15. And I asked him about South Carolina. Would you look at a Tim Scott as a VP choice even before then? He feels he's going to do well in South Carolina. I think Nikki Haley's real moment to shine tonight is tonight in New Hampshire to make it a two-person race.

Obviously, we know independents play an outsized role in this GOP primary. That is certainly not something that the former president wants, cutting into his margin. But I think it's a real question of whether or not Nikki Haley has appealed to them enough to cut into that margin in a significant way here tonight.TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT; THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Right. It's all about enthusiasm. We know that Trump's voters tend to be enthusiastic in their support for him. They boast that they, you know, in Iowa, they braved sub-zero temperatures. They braved sub-zero temperatures. They braved sub-zero temperatures. They braved sub-zero temperatures. They braved sub-zero temperatures. To support him in that caucus primary, now we're in New Hampshire. And even as we see the Nikki Haley signs in all these live shots, we see plenty of Trump signs, too. We know that in the polling, when it shows who is not just going to support Trump, but no matter what Trump supporters, so to speak, that polls high for him, whereas for Nikki Haley, it tends to be more tepid. So, what she needs is that enthusiasm. That voter who's going to say, I'm sticking with her no matter what, whatever's going on in my personal life, I'm going to show up at the polls. This is important. That's been the gap. All the Republicans have faced that enthusiasm gap compared to Trump. She needs to overcome that. And then she needs those independent voters in New Hampshire to be just as enthusiastic. Now, your colleagues have spoken to a lot of enthusiastic, independent New Hampshire voters who do want to support Haley, but she needs a lot of them tonight.",

I actually can't see her dropping out immediately after New Hampshire, particularly given that she's gotten a bounce in funding and plans to spend that money from funding and still is and is still fundraising right now. At least it's not going to happen tonight. South Carolina has sentimental value. I think it has. And it indicates that she's willing to fight to, you know, to the end, even if she has no choice but to pull out.And I think the other thing that's going on here is that she is banking on two things. One, this kind of anti-Trump vote and that this anti-Trump vote is enough to propel her at least a certain distance. The second thing that she is banking on is that she is making a case for the vice presidency and that this is a way to still operate within that realm. One of the things that Trump. Respects, he may not like you. One of the things that he respects is taking the fight to him. And so, I think she's making an argument not just for, I think, you know, anti-Trump people, but making an argument to the Trump campaign about how actually a pairing of the two of them would represent everything that you want in Trumpism with the kind of stability and accountability. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, NEW YORK TIMES JOURNALIST &amp; PODCAST HOST: I think Donald Trump Jr.'s head might explode. I don't --  I don't agree with that. But one of the other things that I think. When we're talking about Nikki Haley, that has always struck me is when you see Donald Trump attack her. He uses this very loaded language again about where she's from, where her parents are from, using her name, you know, kind of to make it seem that she's not really American, raising all these very nativist questions. And what does Donald Trump know about his base that we don't know? Well, he knows that. That those kind of attacks actually do have impact. And so there is something in Nikki Haley herself being a woman and a woman of color that I do sometimes wonder if there is a ceiling for her in the Republican Party right now, as it's --  as it's constructed right now.",
