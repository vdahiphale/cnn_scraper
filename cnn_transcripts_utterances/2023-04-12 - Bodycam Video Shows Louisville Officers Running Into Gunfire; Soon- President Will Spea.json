Police officials say the gunman, a 25-year-old bank employee. Fired his recently purchased AR-15 style weapon inside the offices for only about a minute and then appeared to wait for police to arrive. It was only after the gunman shot out one of the bank's windows that an officer was able to see his position and fire a fatal shot that ended the attack. More now from CNN's Adrienne Broaddus.

The Good Friday agreement brought peace, but the power-sharing government which was really the sort of big achievement over the past six years, it hasn't worked for four of those years.And right now, the main unionist pro-British party refuses to go into that power sharing government. The main pro-Irish nationalist party here is now for the first time ever the biggest party here that poised to become but -- their leaders poised to become first minister. The unionist party won't go into -- won't go into this government because they're unhappy about the way Brexit has unfolded. So what the president's going to do today will be the talk about those 25 years of peace talk, about how they are underpinned by an improvement in the economy without directly trying to pressure those unionist politicians to go back into the government, because I think that's widely understood here would be counterproductive. They are very bristly when it comes to a president they perceive as being pro -- the other side -- the other side of the political divide, if you will. So the message will be to them, perhaps subtly, look, this deal that's on offer over Brexit will help the economy. That's good for you overall. It may not give you everything you want politically. But, yes, after -- after giving this very important as I say, delicate address at the university here in Belfast will be taking off south of the border, and that's when it begins to be a little bit of the family tour to visit some of the -- some of his -- his relatives, his deep and distant relatives touring a castle, touring the city right on the border.

Some of the documents reviewed by CNN offers sensitive details on Ukraine's military capabilities or lack thereof, including critical shortages of air defenses and overall casualty assessments, after more than a year of war. Ukrainian officials downplayed the significance of the leaks, saying some of the information wasn't secret at all. But a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the military has already changed some of its plans because of the leaks. In a new set of leaked documents obtained by \"The Washington Post\", the U.S. learned Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was considering providing 40,000 rockets to Russia for its war in Ukraine, but to do so quietly to avoid problems with the West, since Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid. CNN has not seen the documents and cannot confirm their authenticity. Egyptian state media called the report an informational absurdity while the Kremlin called it another hoax, and the U.S. says they have seen no signs of Egypt providing lethal laid to Russia.

The International Monetary Fund, the IMF, lowering its forecast for global economic growth from 3.4 percent last year to 2.8 percent this year. In January, had expected growth this year to be slightly higher than that 2.9 percent. International business correspondent Clare Sebastian live in London. And, Clare, banking volatility will hinder global growth, the IMF says. And also there is that what it calls a fog for forecasters because of scarring from the pandemic, of war in Ukraine by Russia and a host of other reasons that make it very difficult to see what the outlook is. CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, that fog over the outlook, a really key point, Christine, given all the uncertainty and fragility as the IMF puts it out there. The reason for the downgrade, really two key culprits. One is that they are no longer as confident as they were three months ago that inflation is peaking. They say that inflation, particularly core inflation, when you strip out food and energy is proving sticky, still expected to be according to the IMF, just over 5 percent globally by the end of the year. So way above target. That means is that the IMF thinks that rates and monetary policy will have to stay higher, tighter for longer, which, of course, could contribute to a slowdown in the second thing, of course, is you say is the banking crisis that we've seen in recent weeks. That they say translating into tighter financial conditions that could impact the availability of lending if it persists, so that they think could play into growth rates going forward. Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, the striking a much more optimistic tone, on Tuesday, Christine, saying that she doesn't actually see a drop in the availability of credit as of yet. Does not as yet, folks as of yet forecast a recession for the U.S. Take a listen. I believe our banking system remains strong and resilient. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

To the gun, and if there is a route to hold the parents criminally responsible for allowing that to happen, they're going to pursue it. I think it's frustration, Christine, of prosecutors dealing with the book or set of laws they have in front of them, how to address it and how to do something to stem the violence in schools. You see, the parents of Ethan Crumbley, for example, in the Michigan school shooting, being charged with involuntary manslaughter for that shooting, for the access to the firearm for Ethan Crumbley. I think it's something that we're going to see perhaps the precedent set that parents are going to be more careful of how they store firearms because they're going to face some criminal responsibility, culpability, if, in fact, their kids use that firearm at school.",

Did people know something about this child in particular, a propensity for violence if you will, and they didn't do anything about it?
