And tonight, new video appears to show Wagner boss, YevgenyPrigozhin just as the chief of Britain's MI6 says Putin had to cut a deal with the mercenary leader, quote, \"to save his own skin\". Then what we are learning this hour about the U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea apparently willingly, including what charges he faced in South Korea. And then later, a new perspective on the heat wave making Europe's tourists sweat. Our Richard Quest is feeling the heat in France, he'll join us live. But first, Yevgeny Prigozhin's whereabouts have been a mystery after his short-lived mutiny in Russia, if you remember, last month. Now, for the first time since the Wagner Group founder is re-emerging, new video appears to show him greeting his mercenaries in Belarus. Moving there if you remember was part of the deal Prigozhin made with President Vladimir Putin to call off the mutiny and not be prosecuted. Well, CNN cannot definitely say whether the speaker is in fact, Prigozhin. CNN has though geolocated the footage towards this huge military base, southeast of Minsk, and the meta data suggest it was filmed on Tuesday. Meantime, the West has largely stayed silent on the man who defied Vladimir Putin, but our team sat down with the head of MI6; the British spy agency to try to understand what's really happening inside the Kremlin as Ukraine's of course, counteroffensive carries on. Here is what he told our Nick Paton Walsh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD MOORE, HEAD, MI6, BRITAIN: If you look at Putin's behavior on that day, Prigozhin started off, I think as a traitor at breakfast, he had been pardoned by supper, and then a few days later, he was invited for tea. So there are some things I know, even the chief of MI6 finds a little bit difficult to try and interpret in terms of who is in and who is out. He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin. He cut a deal to save his skin using the good officers of the -- of the leader of Belarus. So, look, even I can't see inside Putin's head, but the  only person who has been -- it's -- well, the only people who have been talking about escalation and nuclear weapons are Putin and a handful of henchmen around him.

The first convoy of Wagner forces arrived at a Belarusian base on Monday, and more vehicles are now piling in. Our Fred Pleitgen has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly a month after Wagner's mutiny, one of the biggest threats to Vladimir Putin's power, the Wagner mercenaries are on the move to Belarus. Social media channeled posting videos of massive convoys rolling in that direction. And now, CNN analysis of satellite images from the company Planet Labs and from Airbus show Wagner fighters have arrived at a formerly abandoned base southeast of Minsk with two more large convoys still on the way. The mercenaries are already getting to work, training Belarusian troops. \"They've been in combat, and this is undoubtedly a very useful experience for our army\", this Belarusian soldier says. \"We have not participated in combat activities since the end of the Afghan war.\" They saw some of the heaviest combat in Russia's war against Ukraine and where some of Vladimir Putin's most valuable fighters. But after the uprising, they've had to shutter their main base in southern Russia. \"The base ceases to exist\", this fighter says. Wagner private military company is relocating to new areas.",

Now, we did hear from U.S. military officials that they have reached out to their North Korean counterparts and the North Korean military. But they have not yet received a response, and this is not unusual, given that throughout the entire Biden administration, the North Koreans have not responded to any kind of outreach from U.S. officials. So, this is going to be very challenging for the U.S. to try to resolve here in this very kind of bizarre case frankly. We're learning more about what exactly happened when Travis King was on this tour of the Demilitarized Zone. He according to an eyewitness, all of a sudden just took off in a sprint and crossed the demarcation line, kind of running past everyone as soldiers on the South Korean side yelled at him to stop. And they yelled -- they yelled out, get him as they tried to stop him from crossing into the North Korean side. Of course, it was too late by that point, Travis King had already crossed over, and that was when he was detained by North Korean guards. Now, Travis King was facing disciplinary charges in South Korea. He actually was in a detention facility for 50 days, just nearly two months after facing assault charges for allegedly assaulting members of the South Korean public, and he was set to be removed from the military altogether and return to the United States. But just one day before he crossed that line over into North Korea, he was at the airport expected to board that plane back to the United States, and he actually never got on the flight. U.S. officials realized when he didn't show up at Fort Bliss, Texas, that something was awry here, and they've been trying to figure out how to get Travis King back ever since. Obviously, his family is very concerned about him, and his mother spoke to \"ABC\", and she said that she can't imagine Travis doing something like this. And she'd only -- she had spoken to him only a few short days ago, and that -- and he said that he was heading back to Texas. But in the end, of course, all she wants is for him to come home, Isa.",

And it was interesting in that column, Thomas Friedman said that President Biden felt he couldn't be silent on this issue. So many things when it comes to Israel and the United States are so politically fraught, certainly, Republicans have been targeting President Biden for not necessarily supporting the Netanyahu government, quoting(ph) it with not supporting Israel in its security, in its regional issues. And I think it's important that President Biden in this interview with Thomas Friedman made clear that while he supports Israel, he is a staunch supporter of Israel. He cannot support some of the issues that Netanyahu is talking about when it comes to this judicial overhaul. And certainly, no one in the United States wants their relationship to degrade. It's a very important Intelligence relationship, military relationship, in addition to the highly symbolic relationship with the world's only Jewish state. And so, certainly, President Biden walking a very fine line in that interview and in public when it comes to talking about these issues, talking about Israel, and talking about Prime Minister in Benjamin Netanyahu, who he is expected to meet later this year, that will be a very important meeting for all of these issues to kind of come to ahead, Isa.",

Michigan's Attorney General has charged 16 people with a range of felonies including forgery as well as conspiracy. The charges come as Trump faces new legal troubles of his own. His lawyers say they are appealing a judge's ruling in the E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse as well as defamation case. And they include the $5 million judgment against Trump and the judge denying him a new trial. This as the ex-president and current candidate, of course, says he is the target of special counsel Jack Smith's criminal probe. And it covers the aftermath of the 2020 election and the January 6th, of course, insurrection as you can see right here. Trump has already been indicted over the mishandling of classified documents. He's been investigated for election interference in the state of Georgia, and don't forget, he is indicted in New York over hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. CNN's Tom Foreman has a look at the case in Michigan and how it could fit into the special counsel's probe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Up in Michigan, state officials have now charged 16 people as false electors, posing as if they were the official electors from that state in the election. That fits in very well with the litany of accusations, suspicions that the special counsel has been scrutinizing. False electors, legislative nullification, pressure calls in at least seven different states. Those calls to state officials, saying they should overturn the election in Trump's favor. What else did team Trump tried to do to overturn this election? Sixty court filings around the country, they lost all, but one, all but one. They lost virtually everything, but when the Supreme Court turned one down, Trump went online and again said the \"Supreme Court really let us down. No, wisdom. No courage.\" What else did they try? There has been scrutiny of an Oval Office discussion from December of 2020, where there was allegedly talk about seizing voting machines, declaring martial law, anything rather than accept the fact that Trump actually lost the election. There was all that pressure on Vice President -- then Vice President Mike Pence to block certifications, something that we know legally, he could not do. And of course, we all saw what happened on January 6th, when the then President Donald Trump rallied his supporters, told them to go to the Capitol, and said to them at one point, you need to fight like hell to defend your election here, what he called his victory in all of this. All of that we saw, all of that testifies to the fact that there was a concerted effort by team Trump in many places to try to overturn this legal, fair election that he lost.\" And yet, Trump's response to all of this in the latest news is, \"I have a right to protest an election that I am fully convinced was rigged and stolen.\" Only question from many legal analyst here is, when did he go and did he go beyond merely protesting into something much more serious?

And in return, which would also help alleviate global hunger, the United Nations would help Russia with its own agricultural exports. But Russia is unhappy with how much has been done on that account. Actually, Russia's grain exports are not sanctioned. So it's mainly a dispute about the financial arrangements, about the banking systems that undergird the trade. And Russia is not happy with those. And so it has pulled out.",
