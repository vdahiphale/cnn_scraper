Thanks for being up with us. I'm Kasie Hunt. Lawmakers once again scrambling to head off a government shutdown. Tell me if you've heard this before. Sources tell CNN that congressional negotiators are close to reaching a spending deal but there are some hurdles that still remain. They have until Friday to finalize an agreement and to write it. At stake, funding for key agencies like Homeland Security. That's been the most contentious one at a time when the southern border has become a central campaign issue. Let's bring in Jackie Kucinich. She is Washington bureau chief for The Boston Globe. And Andrew Desiderio, senior congressional reporter for Punchbowl News. Good morning to both of you.

That's why you're seeing these last-minute negotiations.And what's fascinating is over the weekend, Democrats actually had some intraparty fighting of their own, which is quite rare on this -- on this issue -- Democrats on the Hill versus the White House. At the White House, they wanted something more of a continuing resolution basically continuing the same spending and same policies for the border.

The president is saying he supports the bill and he would sign it into law if it gets to his desk. That's very different than putting a concerted push behind it and trying to get it over the finish line like he has with the border security deal from earlier this year or with Ukraine aid, and things like that.

In 2022, we saw President Trump endorse in a lot of these races and his candidates won. We saw Dr. Oz advance and then we saw him lose in November. So the question is going to be is Bernie Moreno, his endorsed candidate, going to make it to the general. And then if he does -- like, can he beat Sherrod Brown? And this is one of three very, very -- like, the three toss-ups that will determine control of the Senate. And so, it's -- I mean, it's like crucial. And so, if Trump backs somebody who ends up losing, that's going to -- I mean, hurt him if he becomes the president and it's going to further show that maybe Republicans were -- maybe the lesson from 2022 was to not just vote for the candidate that Trump backed.",

The question is which of the two candidates -- two Republican candidates who have been endorsed by different members of the House of Representatives are going to go on to challenge her in November?

How do you see that playing out this time? JOHN:  Absolutely. I mean, like, we're going to see a court case in June on the abortion drug. And what I've heard from Democrats is that last time around, the idea of abortion was very -- I mean, if you're in a blue state like California, there is like a handful of competitive primary races there. It's hard -- it was -- 2022 was hard to say hey, this Republican is going to take away your right to abortion in California and New York. But this time around, they can say Mike Garcia voted for X, Y, Z bill that could have led to a national abortion ban. If Trump is president and Republicans take control of the House and the Senate, Democrats are arguing there could be national implications to these abortion policies. So I think -- so I think we're really going to see Democrats hitting this idea that no matter where a Republican is in the country, if you elect a Republican you risk limiting abortion access nationwide.",
