Israel says Hamas used one to stash weapons and at one point to hide hostages. And, new speaker, same dilemma. The House's GOP leader might need Democrats -- will need Democrats to help stave off a government shutdown in just days. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's Tuesday, November 14th, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, where President Biden wakes up to growing backlash within his own State Department over his staunch backing of Israel with hospitals in the line of fire in Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged Monday that the hospital crisis in Gaza is sparking anger and dissent not only from staff at the State Department, but from within the broader Biden administration. Here's the president on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So he's really talking about this incredibly difficult conundrum that Israeli military forces are facing right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But they are saying that Hamas does have a habit of surrounding itself around civilians, using them essentially as human shields and that is a habit that they have been told from Israeli intelligence.But I think what we're seeing really is the White House sort of changing this into how they defend Israel. There's been growing calls, including as you mentioned, from inside the administration, particularly at State Department and USAID about how the administration has continued to defend Israel, especially in light of the sheer amount of deaths. Gaza, the health minister there, even though the U.S. does not know for sure whether those numbers are verifiable, but they had said that over 11,000 people have died and those -- because of those sheer numbers, there has been growing dissent. We've obviously seen protests several weeks ago. And so, the administration is definitely taking a harder stance when it comes to protecting civilian life. Publicly, there was a time where the administration said it was obvious to them that Israel was protecting civilian life. That is something that we're no longer hearing them necessarily say and they're still holding a stronger line to Israel for this specifically.",

And that is hugely significant because the G7 has really rallied around Israel. They had a joint statement affirming their support of Israel in this war.And so, that was very significant for him to come out and say this just recently. And just yesterday, you had the president of Indonesia in the Oval Office very publicly in the press break calling for a ceasefire. And that was very intentional especially because the press leaves in just a few minutes and they have several minutes to be together privately. And so, there is definitely increasing pressure from world leaders. And that is significantly different than Ukraine. We've seen most countries on the same page when it comes to supporting Ukraine, except for very small hand few of countries. And this feels starkly different. And again, I do think it's because the shear number of deaths that we've seen. People have been questioning Israel's military (INAUDIBLE).",

      "sentences": "Welcome back.A CNN review of court documents, social media reports and victim interviews has revealed a massive, relentless campaign of intimidation by the Chinese government targeting U.S. residents. Known as spamouflage, victims are sent thousands of posts or emails harassing them or name-calling them, using racist slurs. The State Department says it's part of a broader effort to silence critics of Beijing. CNN's Max Foster joins us live now from London. Max, good morning. Always good to see you. These kinds of coordinated attacks or trying to discredit U.S. politicians and journalists and also disparage American companies, what do we know about this and how does it potentially affect this big meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi tomorrow? MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it does seem to be very specific, so it's trying to silence, as you say, China's critics and doing so with this intimidation campaign which effectively scares people into silence. And we saw from Donie's reporting how powerful this can be. So even using images to disparage the people who are critics of China in the United States. So, it is very specific, not necessarily anti-American, you could argue, but when you are promoting Chinese values, that sometimes undermines U.S. values. And it's a huge problem, how do you manage this. You have to work with the social media companies, but one of the biggest, of course, is Chinese. So, it is something which is a big problem because it does undermine U.S. interests to a large extent and overtime could be seen to be doing more. So, Biden would be expected to mention it, but it's very difficult to see Xi admitting to it if it is something that he could admit to or indeed doing anything about it.",

Russia being much more vocal and they tend to fall behind China on these sorts of issues. This is all about undermining the U.S. isn't it, and creating this new world order if you like.So, China -- so Russia pretty much taking the side of the Palestinians and the Arab world and dropping the sort of relationships they had been building up with Israel. So we can only assume that China is looking at this and saying, until it works against its interests, it's just not going to get involved. So it's not currently a big issue for China. Whether or not he addresses it with President Biden, we'll have to see. I think they will just pretty much say we need to find a resolution to this and America is far more involved so over to them to find that.",
