I'm actually sure he's in that camp.Look, Mark, in theory, the debt ceiling should act as a sort of fiscal restraint during the budgeting process. But then we had these near- meltdowns in 2011 and 2013, and many argue it's just time to take this political football off the field. The time for tax and spending choices by Congress should be during the normal course of business. Deciding later not to pay the bills by not raising the debt ceiling is not sound fiscal policy. What do you think? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Totally -- I totally agree with that, yes. Count me in. Yes -- you know, there was I think reasonably good intent when this was first put on the books over 100 years ago to force lawmakers to come together and figure out how to make sure that the government's fiscal situation is on sound ground, but that's not what's happening now. It's just creating all kinds of havoc and increasingly so. And the other thing is it doesn't feel like even the solutions they're coming up with here are going to address our long-term fiscal problems.
