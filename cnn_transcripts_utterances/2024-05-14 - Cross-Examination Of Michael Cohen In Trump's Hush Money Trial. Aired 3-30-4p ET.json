I think he's jumping quite quickly from one theme to another, and he doesn't seem to be fully fleshing out these things.I mean, he started, in my view, strong on the theme of, you, Michael Cohen, hate Donald Trump. You want nothing more than to see him convicted and go to prison. That's a great point. There's a lot there. Then he jumped into sort of, well, there was another time when you liked Donald Trump. Now he's into the nuances and deep in the weeds of Cohen's efforts to talk to Mueller, and sometimes when he misled Mueller. I mean, all of this has its place, but the organizational structure here, to me, is lacking. I would do this first, all the stuff on bias, how much you hate him, then all the stuff on credibility, all the times you've lied, and then if you have some extras, maybe.

Now, maybe we'll get to the documents soon. Maybe we'll talk about what he did with Weisselberg soon. But at this point, they're kind of gilding the lily and going over and over and over again.

And when he testified with the prosecution on direct examination, it was mostly chronological. They went through logical questions from one day to the next day, from one month to the next month. He was confident. He was strong. He was consistent throughout. And it appears that this is a tactical decision to throw Michael Cohen off a little. Now also note that our colleagues inside the courtroom, they say that it doesn't seem in the courtroom to be jumping around so much. It's sort of like a movie where they show the present day and then they go all the way back, right, to start at the beginning of the Trump organization. But I agree with you.

And he would say, yes, here's this check where you said here's an invoice for my legal work, which he did no legal work. I mean, he admitted already multiple times to lying.

OK, at the very end of that, then you said this, but that wasn't true. It wasn't a deep dive into how many times he's lied. But part of this, which we believe might be tactical, going back and forth is really just showing bang, bang, bang. Here are the times that you lied. What was this? What was this? And part of throwing him off, remember, is because they want to get him to react. That is what they want from Michael Cohen. He is known to be a reactive person, and they believe that if he reacts, that the jury will react to that. What we have seen from Michael Cohen, who has been deeply prepped for hours and hours, is a calm, measured person, a witness who knows what he's talking about, who is sorry for some of the things that he has done.

We know that he is the current Republican nominee for president, and there is a chance he could be president again, and all of these various lawmakers want to be on the right side of this. Now, when it comes to Michael Cohen, very much radio silence right now on what they've seen of the testimony. All of them telling me they are waiting to see how the defense plays out. They thought that he did a good job, but not much on where you could actually poke holes in his story.

I think what they're trying to figure out, to the extent to which they're actually thinking about it too much, is, is he really falling asleep, or is he really just trying to focus? There seems to be a pattern that he's doing that when it's testimony that Mr. Trump doesn't like, and it might be a technique on his part to try to keep his frustration and anger and anxiety in check so he doesn't get reprimanded from the judge again.
