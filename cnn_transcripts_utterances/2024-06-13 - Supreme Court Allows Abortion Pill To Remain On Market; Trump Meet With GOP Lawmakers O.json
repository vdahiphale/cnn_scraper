But the reality is, is what the president actually said was, he said, you know, he talked about how Roe v. Wade, even the legal scholars on both sides of the aisle said that was not really well written law and it wasn't a unanimous decision when Roe v. Wade was passed. And so he went back to the reiteration of -- that everybody wants states' rights. We threw it back to the states and now some people are unhappy about that. So, you know, there's a lot of conjecture back and forth. It's going to be a hot button issue. And honestly, people on -- a lot of people on both sides don't want it solved because then they're not going to be able to sell memberships to their organizations.A whole lot like term limit. You know, I've carried a term limit bill for years and a very strong one. And yet, the term limit people that sell all those $50 of memberships never come see me.

We know that Americans are out $600 a month, on average, more than they were under his administration.The border is a disaster. No, the Democrats aren't doing anything to fix that other than than lip service. And I said, but you do even better job of explaining how we're going to fix these problems. And he did a very good job in the meeting. He talked about our steel situation with China. He talked about down in Cuba that nobody seems to be talking about. If it was under the Trump administrations, we all know this would be headline news across the board. So I just -- you know, I talked in a positive tone. I think now that people are hurting and we need someone to fix this and to talk about it in terms. And I felt like at that point, he was very Reagan esque in his explanations of those things.",

I actually took it as more of a healing thing and it was more of just friendly jabs. So, I mean, you know, you can take it for what you want.
