Monday, June 5th, 1944. The evil Third Reich was devastating the world. Nazi Germany had subjugated the once free nations of Europe through brute force, lies, and the twisted ideology of racial superiority. Millions of Jews murdered in the Holocaust, millions of others killed by bombs, bullets, bloody warfare. Hitler and those with them thought democracies were week, that the future belonged to dictators. Here on the coast of Normandy, the battle between freedom and tyranny would be joined. Here on that June morning, the testing was at hand. President Macron, Mrs. Macron, Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, distinguished guests, most of all, our honored veterans who met that test of the ages -- the test of ages to that moment 80 years ago, 80 years ago today.

America's unique ability to bring countries together is an undeniable source of our strength and our power. Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today.(APPLAUSE)",

Let me end with this: History tells us freedom is not free. You want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy, come to Normandy and look. Go to the other cemeteries in Europe where our fallen heroes rest. Go back home to Arlington Cemetery. Tomorrow, I will pay respects at Pointe Du hoc. Go there as well and remember the price of unchecked tyranny is the blood of the young and the brave.  In their generation in their hour of trial, the Allied Forces of D-Day did their duty. Now the question for us is, in our hour trial, will we do ours? We are living at a time when democracy is at more risk across the world than a point since the end of World War II, since these beaches were stormed in 1944. Now we have to ask ourselves, when we stand against tyranny, against evil, against crushing brutality of the iron fist, when we stand for freedom, when we defend democracy, we stand together, my answer is yes and only can be yes.

We cannot allow what happened here to be lost to in the silence of the years to come.We must remember it, we must honor it, and live it, and we must remember the fact that they were heroes here that day does not absolve us from what we have to do today. Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it. That's the test of the ages. In memory of those who fought here, died here, literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice. Let us be the generation that when history is written about our time in ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, eighty years from now, it will be said when the moment came, we met the moment, we stood strong. Our alliances were made stronger. We saved democracy in our time as well. Thank you very much. And may God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)",

But then said that it relates to today and what is happening in Ukraine. He said Ukraine will never back down and we will not walk away because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there, to surrender to bullies, he said would be unthinkable, that would be two forget what happened on these beaches. In essence saying, again, we have The Watch. Looking at Tom Hanks, Jamie Dimon, just some of the people gathered there.",
