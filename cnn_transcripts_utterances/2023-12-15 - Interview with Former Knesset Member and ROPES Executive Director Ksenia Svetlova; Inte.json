And talk to an Israeli analyst and Palestinian activists about the hard work of making peace. Then, \"Cassandro,\" Award winning actor Gael Garcia Bernal joins me on his transformation to the gay wrestler who changed Lucha Libre. Plus, \"The Discord Leaks\" Washington Post reporters Samuel Oakford and Shane Harris talked to Hari Sreenivasan about one of the most significant intelligence leaks in recent U.S. history. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. I want them to be more careful, President Joe Biden's latest message to Prime Minister Netanyahu, a clear sign that he's growing more and more vocal about Israel's offensive in Gaza and the mounting civilian death toll. To drive home the urgency, the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was dispatched to the region, tasked with walking that tricky line of supporting its ally Israel, but also trying to rein it in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We are now in the middle of a high intensity phase with ongoing ground operations, military operations in both the northern half and the southern half of Gaza. But there will be a transition to another phase of this war, one that is focused in more precise ways on targeting the leadership. We're not here to tell anybody, you must do X, you must do Y. We're here to say, this is our perspective, as your partner, as your friend, this is what we believe is the best way to achieve both your tactical and strategic goals. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Will there be a change of the old guard? In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is losing popularity. And in the West Bank, according to PSR polling, public opinion is turning sharply against Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. And support for Hamas meantime is surging. Gaza residents who live with Hamas are more critical, however. So, how will the leadership crisis be resolved? And what impact would new leadership have on efforts to make peace? Nivine Sandouka, Regional Chief of Staff with the Alliance for Middle East Peace, says peace won't come from the top down. Joining her is Former Knesset Member Ksenia Svetlova, who leads an organization which is a member of Nivine's alliance. Welcome both of you. And I'm so glad to see you sitting there together talking to us about this really critical moment in the region during this war as you see Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, meeting with Israeli officials yesterday in the West Bank today. Ksenia, let me ask you first. What is the reaction in Israel of what appears to be a growing rift between Israel and its closest ally, the United States, not on the context of going after Hamas, but how it's being pursued and more specifically what the day after looks like?",

I cannot tell you whether it's four weeks or six weeks, but the clock is ticking and it's clear to just about everyone. And while the rift between the U.S. and Israel is widening, I think that the camp off those in Israel who were critical, you know, before the war in Gaza off the Prime Minister Netanyahu and the decisions that he makes, they become impatient and there is growing anger against him because, you know, the United States right now, it's the only country that openly supports and supports in every international organization of Israel and the continuation of this unfortunately needed military operation. So, in this regard, I think that we will see mounting pressure on Netanyahu, not only from his -- you know, from people who usually criticize him from the camp of those who protested against him for the last year and even more but also from people who are very realistic about everything from his own camp, from the Likud Party. We still do not hear the voices out loud, but there is a lot of dissent and understanding that Netanyahu is ruining, he is ruining Israel for his own good, for his own narrow political interest.",

The big question is how is it going to be revived and who is the next Palestinian president? And the good thing is that since there is this agreement, both within the Palestinian Authority and the American administration, it kind of gives hope to the Palestinian amid all of this despair that we are feeling and living as Palestinians these days, the collective punishment, the lack of economic sources for the Palestinians, what is happening in Gaza as well. So, all of those give us a lot of despair. But if the Palestinian authority will actually be willing to revive and, you know, at least nominate another leader, that is going to give us hope for a negotiated agreement afterwards with the Israelis.",

And again, I'm telling you that this is -- it's a daydream that he tries to sell to some people in his camp that are naive enough perhaps to believe that there could be some kind of solution that will exclude the authentic leadership of the Palestinian people who -- that is recognized by the whole world, and which is, of course, the Palestinian Authority. Anybody who will now -- right now to try to imagine some foreign form of leadership government whatsoever, peacekeeping force that will, you know, just land from -- I don't know, from outer space and will govern this place that nobody really wants but the Palestinians themselves. He's daydreaming and he's lying. He's lying to the Israelis, first of all. It's time, and I think, you know, these words were actually uttered by the adviser of national security to the government, Tzachi Hanegbi, in -- as late as, I think it was beginning of November. He said, in his own words, they'll need -- there is a need for Palestinian Authority to be reinstated in Gaza Strip. We'll know that it has issues. But there is no other way. With this government, I do not see any way to move forward.

But if we read right now into these statistics that you rightly mentioned, if you think why are the Palestinians in the West Bank have a high percentage of supporting Hamas, it doesn't necessarily mean that they want the government of -- or an Islamic State to be the future Palestinian State. You need to read into the psychology of the Palestinian people at this stage. The psychology is basically saying that what is happening in Gaza with all these calls for displacement and becoming refugees actually brings back to the psychology of the Palestinian, the Nakba, or the catastrophe of 1948. And if you say that, and if you look at who is actually right now defending the Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority is helpless. It is talking in the United Nations. It is talking to other governments. Nobody is trying -- is stopping the offensive in Gaza. And it seems for the Palestinian, the only party that is actually defending and, and preventing another Nakba from happening is Hamas. That is why the psychology of a Palestinian in the West Bank is, yes, let us support them because they represent these days resistance to the occupation. That does not necessarily mean that they want Islamic government. Just let me read into just one more statistic that is important. If Marwan al Barghouti runs against Ismail Haniyeh, which means Marwan representing Fatah, and Ismail Haniyeh Hamas, actually Marwan al Barghouti will win, which shows that we actually want a moderate Palestinian State to be in place rather than an Islamic State.",

I know it's very important. Well, up next, to bridge building of another sort. In Mexico, Lucha Libre, homegrown professional wrestling, is widely popular. Luchadores are superstars, macho, menacing masters of the ring. Well, enter Cassandro, a flamboyantly gay wrestler who takes the sport by storm. Cassandro, whose real name is Saul Armendariz, takes on the role of an exotico, a character who performs in drag. In doing so, the liberace of Lucha Libre rises to international stardom, breaking cultural taboos every step of the way. Since bursting on the scene two decades ago with back-to-back breakout roles in \"Amores Perros Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" actor Gael Garcia Bernal has racked up a long list of leading roles.

And he's reprimanded for that and told to stop but he keeps doing it. And what you see is that while he's being worn and sort of scolded, no one steps in to either pull him off the line or restrict his access. And what this new Air Force investigation has found this week is that no one in his chain of command reported him to the relevant security officials whose job it is to step in when someone violates those rules and suspend them or restrict their access or withhold their clearance. That just never happened. And the Air Force investigation faulted the Air National Guard there for what they call the culture of complacency about Teixeira. And they found other instances too, in which people were probably looking at classified information that they didn't really need to see. Now, none of those people are accused of leaking it, we should say.

So, there's definitely accountability. But so far, I have to say, it's really focused on this particular unit where this happened. I think what we found is that the security clearance process and other mechanisms that are put in place to prevent something like this don't seem to be working and capturing the kind of people or the red flags that might end with the next Jack Teixeira might be.

And there were red flags in Teixeira's history going back to his high school years where he was suspended for making threat of violence and making racist comments at school, that was overlooked, but they were aware of it appears, but they really were not aware of any of the activity that he engaged online, which was already racist and was already involving threats of violence separate to that incident at his school.

And the way Discord is structured means that you can create a community in the way that you want it to be, right. And that's some of the selling points -- that's a selling point that they have. Another a key aspect of Discord's -- of their dynamic is that they don't really monitor what's going on outside of very narrow cases. So, for instance, a child sexual exploitation, right? If there's material like that, they might catch it. But if you're running a server where you're, you know, making racist comments often or in Teixeira's case, actually posting videos where you're making comments like that, they don't appear to be catching that all. And that's something they told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think you're right to point out those other leaks because they all have something in common with what Teixeira is alleged tohave done, which is that someone who had top-secret clearance and had access to all of this information abused the privileged access that they had. And every time that this happens, the military, you're right, comes in and tries to sort of tweak the system a little bit to make it less likely that that would happen. But fundamentally, there's not a change to the sort of the basic architecture of this system, which is that post 9/11, the Intelligence Community, the military, the government as a whole made a decision to make classified intelligence much more widely available to a broad variety of people who have clearances. And there was a reason for that. I mean, before 9/11 information was siloed. It was arguably over protected and the situation we had was where, you know, people at the FBI didn't know what the CIA knew about 19 people who were about to get on airplanes. So, they tried to correct that in the government by spreading out that access. What they've never done, though, is really try to regulate on an individual level who gets to see certain documents and who doesn't. We've talked to people, including lawmakers in our reporting who said, look, there's technology available that could essentially make it so a guy like Jack Teixeira, who is just the maintenance person, if he spotted lingering on documents, calling up documents, searching for them, that could potentially flag someone to say, wait a second, it doesn't look like you're doing something that tracks with what your job responsibilities are. Why is that happening? And we just don't really have a system on a kind of a pervasive system wide level to gate that access, if you like. And why the military is not doing it? It could be hard. It could be cumbersome. And it's kind of like, there's a level of bureaucratic inertia here, I think. This is the way they've been doing it for 20 years. And with every one of these leaks that really seems to be an attitude of this is kind of the cost of doing business, we're always going to have an insider threat like this, the overwhelming majority of people don't leak information, but when they do, as we've seen, it can be incredibly damaging.",
