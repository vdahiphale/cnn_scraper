And that is the polls, all of them, what they show and what they absolutely are not. Just minutes ago, Kamala Harris, she arrived in Chicago for a coronation. So, does a new snapshot of the show, a clear Kamala Harris lead in these polls. Just look across these samples of the polling from ABC News, \"Washington Post,\" they show a consistent finding. All adults, Harris is in the lead. Registered voters, Harris is in the lead. Likely voters, Harris is in the lead. And most importantly, that is not where this race was just about six weeks ago. My panel is here in the arena with me. Shermichael, this is more than just a sugar high it seems. Looking at this poll, the ABC News-\"Washington Post\" poll, on several metrics Harris has taken the lead but done so in a dramatic fashion. Physical health, 30 points up from Trump. Trump was leading that in July. Honesty, she's basically tied with where Biden was, up by 15. Mental sharpness, she leads by 10. Trump was leading that by 30 points.

I'll give her and my Democratic friends some credit there.But when you're proposing economic policies that are going to cost the American people close to $2 trillion without explaining how in the heck we're going to pay for this stuff, I think reality is going to hit and for a whole host of people they're going to say, wait a minute here.
