They're pretty attentive to everything, but they know right here Michael Cohen's credibility is on the line. And Todd Blanche, given a day off to kind of regroup, see how his approach on Tuesday works, he has been much more effective in undercutting Michael Cohen's credibility.

I don't want this to happen, so I'm going to lie to this judge. Here, we have an update here. Cohen says: \"Again, I don't know how Judge Pauley made his determination. Judges, as you know, have a wide range of discretion over guidelines.\" Again, they're really trying to push his buttons here.

Now Blanche pressing Cohen on whether Judge Pauley would have liked to know he had lied. \"I am certain he would have.\" Blanche: \"You blame a lot of people over the years for conduct that you were convicted of.\" \"I blame people, yes.\" And Cohen -- and this goes potentially to the heart of this case. We have previously had Trump Organization accountants testifying that they were just cutting checks based on invoices, falsified invoices, that they received from Michael Cohen. Is that enough, right, to sow the seeds of doubt, reasonable doubt, in the mind of one juror that, hey, maybe this is not beyond -- proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Donald Trump, engaged in a conspiracy to falsify business records based on the testimony of Michael Cohen, that this is someone who always shifts blame for things that he has done?",
