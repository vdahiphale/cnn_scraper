As for Trump, he is expected to land in Philadelphia within the next hour. His campaign telling CNN that the former president is in good spirits. His strategy tonight is to take on Harris record as a prosecutor. Meantime, Harris, there's been an ad put out by the campaign getting under the president's skin, obviously seems to be the goal, releasing a number of ads that are directed at Trump specifically and directly. And a new billboard up in Philadelphia, and it reads crowd size matters with a full Philly pretzel above Harris' name, Wolf.",

But when the two candidates meet for the first time on the debate stage, they will be not having any props of the kind. They will not be speaking with any pre-written notes. It is just the two candidates. And both sides are sort of telegraphing their chief objectives here.For the former president, he is going to try and define Vice President Harris. Of course, she is only 51 days into her presidential candidacy. It's extraordinary when you think about the rapid turn of events since he last appeared on the debate stage in June. But trying to define her and trying to point out some of the contradictions, perhaps, since her 2019 brief presidential candidacy, when she was on the left of her party, to how she has evolved to be a more centrist. But for Harris, she is going to also point out some flip flops that the former president has made. I'm told she is likely to zero in on abortion. Abortion rights has been the anthem of her candidacy. She talks about it everywhere she goes. This is something that is the biggest difference, perhaps, from the last presidential campaign. So, look for that to be front and center as well. Of course, the former president is trying to tie her to the Biden Harris administration. He'll be talking about that a lot. As for President Biden, he told reporters just a short time ago he spoke to his vice president. He said she is calm, cool and collected. Wolf?",

You know, anytime President Trump sort of talks about anything but the issues, that tends to garner significantly more attention than the issues that matters before the American people. So, if he were to say something during debate, I'm sure at the top of the hour, every panel on CNN would be discussing the insult that he said, and not about the case that he's made about Kamala Harris and the economy, Kamala Harris and inflation.",

And now you have -- he is 18.5 years older than the woman who's going to be on the stage with him, right? So, the age dynamic has completely changed. How does that play?LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  I think it plays very poorly for former President Trump. I mean, I have said this before and I'll say it again, she looks like the future and he looks like the past. These visuals matter. That's why you've heard the Trump campaign and the Trump team, you know, going and measuring things and seeing where everyone is, you know, for this debate because he understands that visuals are very important. You know, compared to President Biden, he looked vigorous. He seemed energetic. But compared to a woman who's 20 years his junior, I mean, it remains to be seen exactly how he's going to be perceived. And don't forget, this is a side by side comparison. This isn't people looking on a T.V. and trying to imagine how he is. This is actually going to be -- people are going to have to see this in real time.

I think that has been Donald Trump's Achilles' heel, shall we say, for some time. He is not a disciplined candidate. And that kind of worked for him in 2016 because people could sort of kept waiting for this pivot. Well, now we know the pivot is not coming. This is who he is.And so when you have that side by side, if Kamala Harris is out there laying out her vision, talking specifics, which by the way, Trump doesn't talk a lot of specifics, I think that also will make the lack of discipline, and the old versus young, much more stark.",

But there's another way to think about moderate, and that's temperament. And CNN's own polling asked, do you think of this person as more extreme or more mainstream? And on that, Harris did have a slight edge in the battleground states.So, while Harris really has to convey to voters, I promise you I'm not as liberal as Donald Trump says, Donald Trump has to convey.

I mean, listen, it's a difficult position for President Trump to navigate. He's still been trying to navigate it nine years into this. But, you know, his current position is, it is actually is a moderate position for Republicans. He doesn't think nine months is acceptable without exceptions and he thinks six weeks is too short. He wants a little bit more. You know, that is where the country is. The country is not at banning six weeks and the country is not at a limited abortion. So, he's moderating the party.And then he also brought forward recently, you know, funding IVF. That's unprecedented for a Republican. I'm a Republican. The first thing that came to my mind is how are we going to pay for that? So, you have Donald's position, you have the traditional Republican Party, and you have Donald Trump sort of moderating the party in that position. It may not be enough for these people, but it's moderation. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  Whatever he may or may not believe, the issue with abortion in particular is that he has to own the fact that he put three Supreme Court justices on that ended Roe v. Wade.

There is a reason we all know the phrase, nasty woman or nasty women, because he has used it so many times.And, look, Harris' people feel that she triggers him both as a woman and as a woman of color. So, one of the things we'll look forward tonight is, does she get under his skin? Does she trigger him to go after her as a woman or a woman of color? Because that can have an enormous effect on how women voters react to him.",

Just moments ago, President Biden arrived in New York City, where he will watch tonight's debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. MJ Lee is joining us right now from the White House.

And tonight as his vice president, Kamala Harris, faces off against Donald Trump, he is in New York City, ahead of the 9/11 anniversary tomorrow, and we expect that he is going to be watching just like you said, like the rest of us from his hotel in the city.But as a source close to the president tells me, earlier today, the gravity of this moment is certainly not lost on him, that he understands and certainly based on the experience that he himself has had including that last debate against Donald Trump and other presidential debates that he has participated in, the exciting and the pressure that goes into a night like tonight, and also the intense pressure and the focus that is going to be required of his vice president as she tried vice to have a good showing against the former president. Now, we have reported, of course, that the president and the vice president have spoken about the debate. But those close to the president have really remained tight lipped about what advice the president may or may not have given, but he did tell reporters as he was leaving the White House earlier that he thinks that the vice president is calm, cool, and collected. Certainly, he is one of the many Democrats that is really rooting for the vice president to have a good debate performance tonight.",

If you didn't see it today on social media, take a look at it. There's no headline. The dark image, sending a message on its own. It depicts Trump leading a circus wagon to a defiled Capitol. My next guest is \"The Atlantic\" staff writer Tim Alberta, who's reporting a showcase in the special edition of \"The Atlantic\". And, Tim, this statement, I mean, the cover is obviously a statement in and of itself. I saw it on Twitter this morning. What was the thinking behind this cover at this moment?",

I think the theme that runs through this issue is as illustrated there on the cover that Donald Trump is not just riding back to Washington, but that he's obviously got the elephant caged behind him and that, of course, is symbolic of his relationship to a Republican Party that is entirely in hock to Trump.That has been -- that has been remade from the top-down in his image, and a party, whereas at the beginning of his presidency in 2021, there were still so meaningful pockets of resistance where there were still real checks and balances on Donald Trump from within the GOP, that this is now a party that shows no appetite for dissent from him whatsoever. And obviously there are certain cases of that that are more notable than others.",

And this was really his M.O., this was his image, a self-styled Tea Party insurgent who came to Washington in 2010, like so many other Republicans in that year, promising to put the Constitution above his fidelity to the Republican Party. And in fact, in 2016, when Trump emerged as the Republican nominee, Mike Lee led the charge at the convention that summer to literally rewrite the rules of the Republican Party so that they might stop Donald Trump from becoming the nominee in Cleveland that summer.So here we are, eight years later, in the summer of 2024, and when I'm pressing Mike Lee on how he could have gone from that place in 2016 to now enthusiastically supporting Donald Trump in 2024 he says to me, well, remember, he did in fact leave office, basically saying that sure, he attempted a coup, but the coup failed. So something here has changed at a personal level, at a -- at a -- at a political level. And really the story of Mike Lee is in so many ways the story of the modern Republican Party, the story that we illustrate on the cover of the matter magazine.",
