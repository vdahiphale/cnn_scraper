He got a standing ovation at a time when everybody else was walking out. So, he knew his audience.I think there was some chum in there that got everybody knowing who Harrison Butker is, where Benedictine College is. So, in that sense, it succeeded and it played into probably what he was looking to get at. But at the same time, he's talking to women who self-selected to go to that particular college and probably took that in the way it was intended. It was genuine, it was earnest. And quite frankly, having talked to my wife before I would go out here and talk about these things, it spoke to her as somebody who is a professional woman, led me in a lot of ways throughout my career, but has four kids at home and sees, you know, the role as mother first and foremost in her life.

The Louisville Metro Police Department saying in part -- quote -- \"We are in the process of conducting a thorough investigation. We are appreciative that all parties involved are fully cooperating.\" Scheffler's attorneys say that the golfer will plead not guilty. Joining me now, CNN sports analyst and sports columnist for USA Today, Christine Brennan. So great to have you here, Christine. How bizarre is this? I mean, Scheffler, he's known to be a pretty mild-mannered guy, I understand, but he's calling this arrest a big misunderstanding. What happened here? CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST: It was early in the morning, it was dark, and it was raining, Laura. And after this terrible accident in which there was a fatality, a man named John Mills was killed crossing the street, getting to the golf course, the police obviously were redirecting traffic. And Scheffler says that he continued on because he was told it was okay for the golfers themselves to work their way to the golf course. And he has called it both chaotic and a misunderstanding in terms of where he was supposed to go, what he thought he could do versus what the police were telling him he could do. That's his story. As you alluded to, of course, the police report, the police are saying that's not the case and, in fact, one of their officers was dragged 10 feet by Scheffler's car once that car accelerated, the SUV accelerated, and that officer went to the hospital, and actually had abrasions, and that's in the police report. So, did that happen? Was an officer dragged by Scottie Scheffler's car or was it all just a misunderstanding? Obviously, that will be determined later because that is certainly a contradiction in the stories.",

He's the masters champ, the world's number one. And it's really bizarre.And one of the things, Laura, that was so troubling, I think, was that -- whether it was social media or just golfers in general, fans were all worried about his tee time. Is he going to be able to make it to the golf course? And yeah, that was weird and it was different and certainly understandable. Meanwhile, as I mentioned, of course, John Mills lost his life, this man, and it seemed as if the entire golf world pivoted to the question of Scottie Scheffler's tee time. A really bad look and a really dark day in golf. And, of course, a mugshot of the number one golfer in the world, that's not going to help the game of golf, men's golf, with TV ratings that are sinking, and the game really looking for a new star in the wake of Tiger Woods, obviously, not being around very much.
