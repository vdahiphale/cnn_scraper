Obviously, there's a difference between holding off Russian in terms of defending and attacking but conventional military wisdom is that to successfully attack, you need something like three times the number of equipment and forces to do that. And we have now seen that that there has not been a significant breakthrough frankly, on either side for a year, since Ukraine took back the city of Kherson in November of 2022.So, look, the U.S. is by far the biggest player when it comes to military aid, some $44 billion so far. It's pretty much as much as everyone else in the world combined, every other donor country. Not only that, but it's a catalyst for other countries to provide sort of political cover for European countries to sort of step in and offer the same kind of aid. So, a really, really important player in all of this, and potentially critical. Zelenskyy has said this before. His wife even warning last week, if the world gets tired, they say that they will simply let us die. And the other hand, we have Russia, which still outnumbers Ukraine in terms of its military in pretty much every metric, and is not a static enemy. It has been learning from this. It's been able to erode the advantage that Ukraine got from some of those Western weapons by coming out with new ways of the thwarting them like electronic warfare, for example. So, all of this combined, the fact that we are going into winter now with Russia stepping up attack, it shows why Zelenskyy was willing to take the risk of making this trip.",

Lawyers for the 47-year-old imprisoned Putin critics say he didn't appear yesterday that this court scheduled appearance, and they've not been able to find him at either one of the penal colonies where he's supposed to be. Overnight, a spokesperson for the Russian prison system told Navalny's attorneys he was no longer at the IK9 colony, but claimed not to know where he was taken. And there's added worry that Navalny is not in good health. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live for us in Berlin. Fred, good morning. You've covered Navalny for years. What does this tell us? What do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, it certainly tells us it's pretty difficult to get any sort of answers out of the Russian prison system. And, you know, you mentioned some of the stages that Navalny's lawyers have gone through and trying to find Alexei Navalny.It really is even worse than that because for a while, the prison services putting out this narrative that allegedly wasn't showing up to these meetings by video link because of some sort of power outage in the prison that he was supposed to be. And then only now are they admitting that he is actually no longer in that prison. But at the same time, not saying which prison he's been transferred to. Now, one of the things, Kasie, that we do need to mention is that he was up to be transferred to a different jail, which is supposed to be an even tougher jailed in the one that he has been in so far. We know he spent a lot of time in solitary confinement. You just mentioned very correctly that he has had some serious health issues. In fact, a spokeswoman said yesterday that he fainted in his cell last week and had to be put on an IV. So, at this point in time, he is supposed to be transferred to a different jail. It's not clear where that is though and whether or not he is already there. This is actually something that's not that uncommon in the Russian presence system, that during that time of transfer, that prisoners do not have any sort of communication with the outside world or not allowed to communicate. It's actually something that happened to Alexey Navalny the last time that he was transferred to the jail he was supposed to be in now. So, it's not unheard of. Nevertheless, there are some pretty big concerns because all of this is happening pretty much at the same time that Vladimir Putin announced he was running for reelection again. There is also a campaign by Alexey Navalny's supporters against having Vladimir Putin elected once again. So, that is also out there. One of the things I also want to mention is that you mentioned that the U.S. is very concerned about the whereabouts of Alexey Navalny. We just heard from a spokesman from the Kremlin who said that this is none of the America's business and accused America of meddling in Russia's domestic affairs -- Kasie.",

The American journalist, Evan Gorsuch of \"The Wall Street Journal\" has been stuck in a Moscow jail for 258 days and counting.

The Supreme Court has agreed to special counsel Jack Smith's request for a ruling on whether former President Donald Trump could be prosecuted in the federal elections subversion case or if he has immunity. Team Trump has until December 20th to submit a response. Attorneys for Kate Cox say the Texas woman has left the state to obtain an abortion. Hours later, the state's Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling authorizing her to get an instate abortion. The court agreeing with the state attorney general that Cox's pregnancy was not life-threatening. Harvard's governing body is expected to finalize a decision on its president, Claudine Gay, as soon as today. Gay has been under fire following her remarks on countering antisemitism at a congressional hearing last week. Hundreds of faculty members have rallied to her defense. All right. Now, let's get to weather. Storms wrap up in the Northeast, bringing warmer weather to the region later on this week.

So, we'll kind of ease into the rest of the work week with slightly warmer temperatures than what we've experienced yesterday. And slightly better conditions, and I say a major improvement because we don't anticipate the rain and the snow that we saw. So, here's a look at your temperatures. We're running above average, maybe a dip in the temperature for the Northeast tomorrow. But in the meantime, enjoy, right where we should be this time of year for places like Atlanta, all the way to D.C. But talking about the storm that was, it produced a lot of rain, right along that I-95 corridor. And, of course, on the north side of that, the cold air produced a snowfall for the higher terrain of New York, Vermont as well as New Hampshire. Check of some of these snowfall totals, exceeding a foot in Upstate New York, impressive for Vermont as well. Equally impressive were the winds. You probably felt that as you stepped outside of Monday morning. But that system is long gone. So like I said, this is a walk in the park today. Much clearer skies overhead. The winds will not be as breezy as what we experienced yesterday. No real concerns in terms of travel, maybe a few flurries entering the equation by middle of the work week for Upstate New York and into northern New England. But not a major concern. So there is the cold front. That's going to allow for that brief dip in our temperatures. Casey mentioned the new developing storm that we're going to keep our eye on. That is going to form near the four corners and into the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle. So this is going to be a rain and snow maker, depending on where you are located. We do believe it will be generally rain across Texas. But on the cold side, in the higher elevations of Arizona, into southern Colorado, perhaps a bit of much-needed snowfall running a bit below average for this area. You can see that relief to the drought conditions expected to come across the central parts of the U.S. -- Kasie.",
