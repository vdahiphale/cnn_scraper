I'm Bianna Golodryga in London today sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Russia wants more war not peace, that's what Ukraine's foreign minister says after Kyiv faced what he said was its largest missile attack in weeks. This is Vladimir Putin today confirmed that the first tactical nuclear weapons to be stored in Belarus have arrived there. Meanwhile, African leaders are in Ukraine on a \"peace mission.\" Next stop for those representatives is Russia this weekend, where they're set to meet with President Putin in St. Petersburg. The message from the Kremlin today, that the Russian leader support \"any set of ideas to end the conflict.\" But international legal experts say that is a highly likely -- that it's highly likely that Russia was behind the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. All of this as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy continues to appeal for weapons for support for his country's counteroffensive. Earlier, I spoke to Ukraine's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Vadym Prystaiko, about the latest on that military campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the Kharkiv operation, I agree with you, it was spectacular, the whole, but that Russians are also learning from their own mistakes.

But when they will join, when Ukraine can join, is the big question mark here. And we don't really have a timetable, even said by President Biden. There does seem to be this alternative model that it doesn't have to be an all or nothing scenario, that Ukraine could go by way of Israel, perhaps or even Taiwan, would not officially joining any sort of membership or alliance but getting all of the weaponry and supplies in order to protect itself.

So, I would not expect our friends and partners to, you know, invent something new and unique for Ukraine if we have such a proven mechanism and instrument as in NATO. And Ukraine was trying to get into the alliance for years and years. I understand that for some of the members it is difficult for their own reasons, but I guess that Ukraine is proving that actually can be a donor (ph) of the -- of security in this particular region. We have the strongest army, probably, right now, in Europe. And if we need somebody who will actually fight with Russians, the only archenemy of the NATO, that's Ukraine.

So, we've been kind of taught the history of the U.S. without really fundamentally recognizing that at really key elemental moments of national formation, the revolution, the constitution, the civil war era, the rise of the administrative or kind of political new American state of the 19th century, Indian affairs and Indian peoples were central concerns to American policymakers, and those words are literally found in our nation's most cherished and often recited documents.",

It begins in the interior of North America and it ends even further in the interior. American settlers in these interior regions are not happy with the British crown because the British crown is attempting diplomatic and trading and various other types of initiatives with native peoples who are not easily conquered -- or not easily conquerable and have yet to be conquered. And so, these American settlers, in these backcountry regions that I write about and others do as well, have kind of really -- kind of almost virulent anti-indigenous ideologies that are forming around British policies, and that's how those sentiments essentially find their way into the declaration.

You know, and so, we -- you know, we just lose the kind of heterogeneity of -- you know, of the subject and kind of fall upon relatively received and simplified categories of analysis. So, if we have that kind of capacity, it's not -- you know, it's not going to yield initially the kind of immediate moment of revelation that we may be hoping for, but we can see past them and you can start seeing how numerous monuments have recently come down. The State of Massachusetts finally abandoned its kind of mythologized state flag of an Indian welcoming Puritan settlers from the 1620s. There's a kind of reckoning happening, not just with the history of African American slavery and its centrality in America, but also with the indigenous peoples of the continent.

And so, this is the kind of dominant theme of the federal government throughout the late 1800s, shortly after reconstruction concludes. There are U.S. army officials who had been out west and stationed among Indians who start realizing that their -- you know, their charges, essential the people they're supervising lack the kind of capacity to become immediately incorporated into the union. There are very few missionaries initially in certain parts of the west, there are very few schools, and military officials start trying to forcibly impose certain types of pedagogies on their -- on, essentially, their prisoners. And that becomes the kind of model of pedagogy that forms at the Carlisle Indian Institute in 1879, run by former military captain named Richard Henry Pratt. And so, this military style pedagogy eventually reaches roughly 40 percent of all the nation's indigenous children, roughly 75,000 American Indian children are sent to these boarding schools, which essentially characterized federal Indian policy about half a century. And we really can't understand the evolution of the 20th century with the Native America without understanding how extensive, influential and harmful these institutions became because they inspired then a generation, Native American activists, who took aim at changing these policies, which they were successful in doing throughout the '20s and into the '30s. So, this kind of anti-assimilation kind of ideology and activism of Native American leaders and a group particularly known as the Society of American Indians helps establish other alternative political philosophies about what Indian country should look like and what it should be doing. And this sets in motion some of the most important reforms in federal Indian affairs during the new deal era known as the Indian New Deal, when tribal governments start forming and adopting constitutions for themselves to be self-governed.",
