We begin this morning with major breaking developments in the Middle East.The Israeli military claims it has killed the leader of Hezbollah after carrying out targeted airstrikes in Beirut. Israel says Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the terrorist organization, and several commanders were killed in a strike on what it says was Hezbollah's headquarters, though Hezbollah has not yet commented.",

      "sentences": "The announcement comes after more than a day of continuous air strikes by Israel on eastern and southern Lebanon. The explosions flattened buildings in a densely populated area. The IDF says those residential buildings housed has below weapons caches. According to the Lebanon's health ministry, at least six people were killed and dozens wounded in the strikes.Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says Israel did not notify the U.S. about the strikes until they were underway. Sources say the lack of notice added to frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, the news that Nasrallah has been killed is a significant development in this ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and we should stress Hezbollah still has not commented on these recent reports. For more on this, let's go now to CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman in Beirut. Ben, what can you tell us? I believe we are waiting on a moment to get Ben back up. He is, of course, in Beirut for us. So in a moment, we'll get his shot up for you, just as we continue to follow this breaking news of Nasrallah's killing, at least, that's according to Israel and the IDF. In a moment, we'll bring in Jim Sciutto. He's CNN senior international correspondent, but I guess for a moment, we'll just continue to talk about these claims that we've learned overnight in the past few hours of the fate of Israel's leader, excuse me, of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. He was the secretary general of Hezbollah. According to the IDF and Israel, was killed in these airstrikes that happened late on Friday. There was a long period of time where we did not know the fate of Nasrallah, and we still have been waiting on Hezbollah to comment and confirm this finding as well. Jim Sciutto also spoke with the IDF in the past hour, interviewing them about this operation, and they gave a little bit more details. But this all comes as well after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel spoke at the U.N. on Friday morning, giving stark warnings, basically to the region, saying that they would continue their fight against Hezbollah. And also, as we've been monitoring and watching this ongoing war and conflict in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu gave no indication that a ceasefire was on the horizon. Then later in the afternoon, on Friday, we saw these attacks. And now this morning, the IDF confirming that the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has been killed. But again, we're still waiting for a comment from Hezbollah at this time. This follows a number of airstrikes that have happened over the course of the past several hours in Israel. And again, you can see the images that we've been seeing from earlier this morning, inside of Beirut, inside of Lebanon, just continued bombardment, again, showing no signs at the moment of letting up, even though at this point the IDF is saying that the head of Hezbollah has been killed, has been eliminated. I'll just check with our controller for a moment. We have either Ben Wedeman or Jim Sciutto at this time? I believe we have Ben Wedeman now up for us in Beirut. Good morning, Ben. Thank you so much for joining us. And please, can you give us the latest from on the ground. I know it's been a long number of hours for you and for certainly, Lebanon, tell us what the latest is after the IDF is confirming that Nasrallah has been killed.",

Even before yesterday's events, officials here in Lebanon were talking of up to 500,000 people, half a million. That's just a little less than 10 percent of the population fleeing the Israeli bombing campaign in the south and the east.And in fact, what we've just seen as Hezbollah has put out announcements with numbers telling people in certain various parts of Lebanon who they can contact if they want to leave the country and flee to neighboring Syria. So people in those areas that have been under severe Israeli bombardment are just looking for anywhere to go, whether it's outside of Lebanon, or just find any space, for instance, in Bay -- in West Beirut, there's what's called the Corniche. It's a broad Boulevard with a broad sidewalk by the sea. We had our colleagues driving along there late last night, well early this morning, at about four o'clock in the morning, and what they saw were just people camped out with whatever they could take with them, sitting on the street trying to put their children to sleep under the circumstances. Others, sort of the adults, many of them, very concerned, change smoking, just wondering how they're going to survive this night, this week, God knows how long this conflict is going to go on. Keep in mind, of course, that many of these people are coming from the poorest parts of Beirut. They have very little resources. Some of them don't even have a car or a motorcycle to get out of those areas. So it's a really desperate situation, and the Lebanese government, very limited resources, after a prolonged economic crisis, is trying to do what it can, but under the circumstances, and given the numbers we're talking about, that's very, very difficult.

Nasrallah has run Hezbollah since 1982 and as a result, you know, one would have expected he would have been a target a long time ago, but the Israelis have usually stayed out of Beirut in their bombing efforts. They've been occasional shelling of Beirut, but not anything like we've seen in the past 24, 48 hours, and they have avoided going after the leadership.Now, partly that was because he was hard to find, but partly that was because they understood what the escalatory ladder could look like, and frankly, that's the thing we need to worry about this weekend. We have seen that Hezbollah has aimed a few missiles, but not many, at Tel Aviv in the past few days, during the time that Israel is has moved now the focus of action from Gaza up to the north into Lebanon. But you have to wonder whether or not their reaction to the killing of their longtime leader is going to be to try to attack directly at Israel's biggest population centers. So, you know, this is exactly what President Biden had been fearing for the year since October 7, that there would be some escalation to a much more regional war.

Then, of course, we saw the pager and walkie talkie attacks, which were aimed right at the leadership of Hezbollah and the rank and file. And now, of course, we have seen this. It does appear that Bibi Netanyahu has decided, Benjamin Netanyahu,the Prime Minister of Israel, has decided two things, first of all, to ignore the United States, the G7 and other allies in their call for a ceasefire, because he believed that if he did that, he was going to lose his one opportunity to dismantle Hezbollah and then to turn around give the speech he gave yesterday, hard to believe that was only yesterday at the U.N. basically doubling down on the Israeli strategy.

This morning, Israel's army chief sent a stern message after a strike in Beirut Friday, which Israel now says killed the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah. Israel said, quote, this is not the end of our toolbox, perhaps indicating there are other military steps to follow.The Israeli military claims it killed Nasrullah as well as other Hezbollah commanders in an attack a massive one on building, several buildings in southern Beirut that was followed by attacks on missile storage facilities in Beirut. Hezbollah has yet to confirm the deaths of any of its leaders or commanders. Officials are reporting at least six civilians have been killed dozens more injured as those Israeli strikes continue. Lebanon says more than 100,000 people have lost their homes due to recent Israeli attacks. However, the government believes the actual number of displaced people is likely higher. CNN International diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson is with me here in Tel Aviv as well. Nic, when I spoke to an IDF spokesperson in the last hour, he said all options remain on the table in terms of next steps, this has been quite a comprehensive series of operations, we should say, a number of Hezbollah commanders killed. Now the leader of Hezbollah the attacks, the pay the exploding pager attacks, as well as multiple attack strikes on missile facilities. What are the possible next steps?",

I certainly can't speak for the IDF, and I certainly can't speak for what political decisions would be made to cause them to use the weapon systems that they have available to target Iran. But what I can say, having talked to officials over the last few days, is they are confident that back in April, when Israel responded to Iran's barrage of 300 also missiles fired at directly for the first time, that Israel, when Israel responded, it only had a couple of strikes, but it feels confident that where they targeted in Iran successfully targeted. They believe that sent a very clear message to the Iranian leadership,and they wouldn't say what those targets were, but the analysis has been that they were aired linked to air defense around sensitive nuclear production sites in Iran, and if the IDF analysis is correct, these sorts of operations have shown the Iranians what they're capable of and what they're thinking about. That messaging was strong. So undoubtedly, it would seem at this stage, if Iran responded, as they did directly back in April, with a large number of missiles. It is those sorts of sites and facilities that Israel clearly has in its crosshairs. And I think there's another piece of information we can factor into this, Jim while, while Iran decides what to do, there is the possibility, and we don't have any confirmation on this, but there's a possibility that Hassan Nasrallah, while he was in that deep bunker where he was targeted, according to the IDF, successfully last night, he may well have been meeting with senior Iranian military commanders, and all of that may well factor into Iran's calculus about its next moves.",

But we have not really seen any kind of major uptick from Hezbollah, and we certainly have not seen what Israeli officials had been warning me for months.They expect it to happen in the event of a major escalation in this conflict. And that is to say Hezbollah firing hundreds of rockets simultaneously at Israel, perhaps even thousands of rockets a day designed to overwhelm Israel's air defense systems including the Iron Dome, for example. And so, we certainly are not seeing that, and it speaks of course, to the enormous blow that the Israeli military has dealt to Hezbollah over the course of the last two weeks. And that's not only just the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, but the killing of multiple other senior commanders in just the span of the last two weeks, effectively decimating much of Hezbollah's senior leadership. And so, what it seems that we have is an organization that is very much in disarray, that is very much trying to figure out what its next steps will be. And also of course, the question of who will actually take over for Hezbollah if indeed Hassan Nasrallah is confirmed by other parties beyond the Israeli military to actually be dead. This is definitely a major inflection point in this conflict on earth- shaking moments in this nearly year-long conflict. And we are also seeing that the killing of Hassan Nasrallah is not the last step in the Israeli military's campaign against Hezbollah. All morning, we have been hearing actually from our position to Haifa, which is, we should note some, you know, 25 miles away from the Lebanese border. We can hear from here the power of some of those explosions rocking southern Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes into southern Lebanon as the Israeli military continues to strike Hezbollah targets there as well as targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut. They have clearly made a decision here to continue to go after Hezbollah assets to deal as much damage to this organization as it is in this moment of uncertainty and disorganization as they possibly can.

You'll remember that in those early days and weeks, Jim, there was even a question of whether at that time, the Israeli military would carry out a major offensive against Hezbollah, ultimately, the decision was made to not do so.Over the course of the last couple of weeks, we've seen the 98th division, which was a major fighting force in Gaza being redirected to the northern border. And then as you mentioned, two reserve brigades being called up, that's a force of multiple thousands of troops being called up and sent to the northern border. Actually yesterday, Jim, we were driving along the Israel-Lebanon border in northern Israel, and we saw an array of tanks and armored personnel carriers in a field off a highway in northern Israel that had only just recently arrived there. So, there is certainly a build- up happening. One thing that we don't have as much insight to, is whether that force is substantial enough to carry out a major offensive. The likely answer that I've heard from sources is that it probably isn't yet that they would want to call up additional reservists, bring in additional forces before actually carrying out that offensive. But there's no question that they are actively preparing for the possibility of a ground offensive as we heard from the Israeli military Chief of Staff, General Herzi Halevi earlier this week saying just that. And we heard from him today, again, making clear that this was a major strike to take out Nasrallah, one that he believes was carried out at the right time, but that it is certainly not the last action that the Israeli military is going to carrying out. And he is going to carry out, and he said that Israel will carry out additional measures against Hezbollah in the days and weeks to come.",

Under Hassan Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah carried out terrorist attacks in other countries against Jewish community centers, notably one in Argentina in 1994 that killed some 85 people. And so, I think the focus today in Israel is certainly one of, you know, joy and a feeling of success at having been able to kill this leader who was known for his secrecy, who hadn't been seen in public in years, and really thought that he was able to avoid detection from Israeli surveillance and other covert operations. And yet, clearly, he was not. You know, yesterday, you know, I had a U.S. defense official reach out to me, unprompted, and tell me that the Israelis had not given them an appropriate heads-up on this strike in Beirut, and they were certainly upset about that and wanted to telegraph that message publicly. I spoke to an Israeli official afterwards who simply responded with an Israeli flag.
