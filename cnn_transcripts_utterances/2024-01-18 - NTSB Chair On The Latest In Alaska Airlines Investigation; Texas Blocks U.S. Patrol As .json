Border Patrol does not have access to that area, which means the state of Texas is determining the outcome of what migrants have to face first. In this case, according to Texas DPS, single men and single women are being arrested for criminal trespass, so they have to deal with a state charge first. Families and children are turned over to U.S. Border Patrol. Again, this is the state of Texas determining the outcome because Border Patrol is not in that area.

And you can see that really transcends the entire battlefield here in Ukraine.You'd be surprised if you go to the frontline areas how much American gear you actually see there. It's not only those Bradly infantry fighting vehicles, it's anything from cars, trucks, Hummers, MRAPs. Everything that needs to stay in the fight. One of the areas, guys, where I've really seen a big impact of all this already is we're at one of the most active frontlines here in Ukraine, a town called Mar'inka, where the Russians are constantly trying to assault. And we were with an artillery unit that has a U.S.-provided M777 howitzer and they said that because of ammo shortages they are only able to shoot about half as much as they used to be able to shoot. They said before, it was 50 to 60 rounds they were able to fire per day. Now they say it's about 20 and in the best case, 30. So already, a big impact happening there. And if you listen to the president of this country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said that, of course, if the U.S. doesn't provide further aid it's going to weaken Ukraine. There could be some gains for the Russians even though the Russians are also losing a lot of people on the frontlines right now. But it certainly will mean that more Ukrainians are going to get hurt and more Ukrainians are going to die on the battlefield but possibly, also in places like where I am right now in the cities of Ukraine. Because, of course, one of the things that we have seen over the past years is attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukrainian cities. One of the things that's preventing that is, of course, air defense provided by the allies but, first and foremost, by the United States. And if missiles, for instance, for air defense systems are not going to keep coming to the Ukrainians, it could have a massive impact on the civilian population here in this country. So there's a huge concern among civilians here in Ukraine and among the military as well. The folks that we've been speaking to say that the U.S. aid that they're getting absolutely key to keeping them in the fight and for holding the Russians off, guys.",

Remember, Democrats in the state hold their primary next Tuesday.But President Biden doesn't appear to be worried. He has no plans to travel to the state and is actually going to North Carolina today to talk about his economic plans. And perhaps more importantly, Biden is still polling far ahead of Phillips and other challengers despite not even being on the ballot in New Hampshire. Nearly 70 percent of Democratic voters say they'll write his name in. That's according to the latest CNN poll. Now, Biden didn't file in the state because the Democratic National Committee, at Biden's behest, changed the rules to put South Carolina and its primary first. Joining us now is 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang. He is supporting Dean Phillips and will be hitting the campaign trail with him in New Hampshire today. Appreciate your time, Andrew. It's always great to see you. You said earlier this week in an interview that it's a matter of whether Dean Phillips can get big enough fast enough to really kind of have an impact on this race. What creates the big enough and fast enough, and is it possible before the primary? ANDREW YANG, (D) FORMER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AUTHOR, \"THE LAST ELECTION\":  There's really one factor, Phil, and it's if people hear about Dean Phillips on the ground here in New Hampshire. We have a poll that was released that said that Dean's at 28 percent in New Hampshire with about 50 percent name I.D. When people find out that there is a 54-year-old, three-term member of Congress running against Joe they get excited. So, the question is whether New Hampshire voters will tune in.

That's what gives Democrats -- particularly, in urban areas -- a chance in North Carolina.Why is Dean Phillips -- a white guy from Minnesota who doesn't talk a ton about these issues -- why is he somebody who can do better than Biden in those states? YANG:  If you look nationally at Biden's approval rating it's been declining in all groups. As one example, he's losing to Trump among Latinos, which is a traditionally Democratic constituency.
