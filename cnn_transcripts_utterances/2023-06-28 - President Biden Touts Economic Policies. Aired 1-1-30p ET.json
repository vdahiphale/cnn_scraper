The first quarter of the 20th century, the poet Carl Sandburg described Chicago as a city of big shoulders, a city of big shoulders. He was describing the big shoulders of a working-class American town who were building this city, same time building the middle class. I'm here in Chicago today for the first quarter of the 21st century to talk about the economic vision for this country, the economy that grows the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, instead of just the top down. When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still do -- everybody does well. (APPLAUSE)",

It's called trickle- down economics, fundamental economics, trickle down. The idea was, it's believed that we should cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations. And I know something about big corporations. There's more corporations in Delaware incorporated than every other state in the union combined. I want them to do well, but I'm tired of waiting for the trickle down. It doesn't come very quickly. Not much trickled down at my dad's kitchen table growing up. And it's a belief that we should shrink public investment in infrastructure and public education, shrink it, that we should let good jobs get shipped overseas, and we actually have a tax policy that encourages them to go overseas to save money. We should let big corporations amass more power, while making it harder to join a union. I meant what I said when I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history, and I make no apologies for it. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",

Now Republicans are at it again, pushing tax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy and adding trillions of dollars to the deficit, trillions. Folks, let me say this as clearly as I can. the trickle-down approach failed the middle class. It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity and it weakened our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride, and hope out of communities one after another, particularly through the Midwest, Western Pennsylvania and West. People working as hard as ever couldn't get ahead, because it's harder to buy a home, pay for college education, start a business, retire with dignity, the first time in a generation the path of the middle class seemed out of reach. I don't think it's hyperbole. I think it's a fact, no matter whether you're a Democrat, Republican or independent. I knew we couldn't go back to the same failed policies when I ran. So, I came in office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone on \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"Financial Times\" began to call Bidenomics. I didn't come up with the name. (LAUGHTER)",

And there are three fundamental changes that we decided to make with the help of Congress and been able to do it, first, making smart investments in America, second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class, and, third, promoting competition to lower costs to help small businesses. Here's what I mean by all this. Under trickle-down economics, it didn't matter whether you made things, as long as you helped the company's bottom line, even if that meant seeing jobs and industries go overseas for cheaper labor, supply chains and key products moved overseas, like China and much of Asia. The entire towns and communities from where I live all the way out there and through the Midwest were shut down, hollowed out, I mean literally hollowed out. All over the country, parents have to say -- and many of you, all elected officials, heard people tell you this, had to say to their children, honey, I lost my job. We can't live here anymore. We got to move. Trickle-down also meant slashing public investment on things that help drive long-term growth and help America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. By the time I came to office, that was down to 0.7 percent. We used to be number one in the world in research and development. That's what we were known for. Now we rank number nine in the world. China decades ago was number eight in the world. Now it's number two in the world, and other nations are closing in fast. We used to have the best infrastructure in the world, roads, bridges, et cetera. But then we fell to rated 13th best investment in infrastructure, two to 13. How can you have the best economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? How do you get product from one place to another? I was out in Pittsburgh recently, the City of Bridges. Bridges collapsing all over the nation. You have seen on television railroad bridges collapsing. Bidenomics, we're turning this around. We're supporting targeted investments. We're strengthening America's economic security, our national security, our energy security, and our climate security. I designed and we signed a bipartisan infrastructure law. It's already announced. I heard some of the speakers before touting some of it. It's already announced 35,000 projects across the country. Think of it this way. Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Act, Rural Electrification, brought electricity to millions of Americans in rural America. Seventy years ago, Dwight Eisenhower launched the Interstate Highway System, the largest infrastructure project to date in history. That's what the bipartisan infrastructure law does. It will be for our kids and grandkids, only bigger. Just last week, we announced our plan to bring affordable high-speed Internet to end a decade of unaffordable and inaccessible Internet to every home in America, every small business in America. And to no one's surprise... (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",

Within one week of my being there, two weeks of it happening, tanker trucks that crashed and caused this overpass that has 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day and 14,000 trucks -- it's critical to our economy.

It's actually happening.You know, when Roosevelt passed the legislation in the '30s about unions being able to be engaged, everything thinks you just legalize unions. They said we should encourage unions. There was a little provision there that very few presidents paid attention to. It said buy American. That meant that, if a president was given money by the Congress to build, say, new deck on an aircraft carrier, whatever it was, he or she was supposed to use 100 percent American labor and 100 percent American products. It hardly happened. They got exceptions down to 30 percent, et cetera. I changed all that. We're now investing in key industries of the future, making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric cars, clean energy.

I want to remind you America invented these chips, small computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in your life, from whether your cell phone functions, your automobiles can be built, refrigerators work. It goes on and on, into sophisticated weapons systems. It's all in that little chip. Without that computer chip, we got a real problem. But, over time, we went from producing 40 percent of those world chips down to 10 percent. Not anymore. Biden economics means the industries of the future are going to grow right here at home.

You talked about the wind farms you're talking about. It's already cheaper. Wind and solar are already significantly cheaper than coal and oil.

It had thousands of good-paying jobs that were lost. But, today, with the help of the Inflection Reduction Act -- Inflation Reduction Act, the new plant's being built, building iron air batteries, which are going to help store energy. And these batteries are going to help store energy, and it's being built on the same exact site, bringing back 750 good-paying jobs, bringing back a sense of pride and hope for the future for all the people of Weirton and surrounding areas. I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to say where they grew up and stay where they grew up. That's Bidenomics. You know, my dad used to have an expression: \"Joey\" -- and I give my word, as awe say. My dad was a well-read guy, never got to go to college, and a hardworking gentleman. We had dinner at -- where we incidentally had conversation and incidentally ate. My dad used to say: \"Remember, a job's about a lot more than a paycheck.\" Now, I mean this. I give you my word. He would say: \"A job's about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. It's about pride.\" It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be OK. Think about it, I mean, in the literal sense. Think about that. It's about your dignity, how you're treated, and being able to make a living you can tell your kids is going to be OK. The second big part of Bidenomics is empowering American workers. When I took office, unemployment was over 6 percent. With the American Rescue Plan, we provided relief and support directly to working-class families. Our economy came roaring back. Unemployment dipped below 4 percent by the end of my first year in office. Now it's been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years of American history. (APPLAUSE)",

You know, I have indicated labor -- to labor leaders they must expand their ranks, as I said, more women, more minority minorities. That's what they have got to do.
