And tonight, how Joe Biden got his groove back, and why you're about to hear what he said last night more than a Taylor Swift single on the radio. 30-plus million people tuned in last night to watch the president insist that the State of our Union is strong, but also to see if Biden could still look strong himself. It's something Republicans told you over and over again that he simply could not do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): President Biden, on the other hand, I'm not even sure if he knows where he is. And I don't say that flippantly, Neil, it actually hurts. He is our president, even if I disagree with him violently. But he clearly is not all there. REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R-TX): It may be automatically that we laugh at it because some of his ideas and all his ideas are laughable, aren't they? But also the longer we laugh, the less he'll speak probably, or the longer he'll have to be up there. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The president delivered a pretty forceful and sometimes it was even combative speech in that chamber. He was challenging Republicans on democracy, on the economy and all these other issues. But I wondered, I mean, does this signal a pivot for Joe Biden from when he ran in 2020 as the candidate who would take the temperature down on partisan fighting? He believed then that Republicans would come to their senses after Trump. Today, he seems to have come to a different conclusion. FMR. SEN. DOUG JONES (D-AL): Well, I think you have to you have to campaign in the with the battle that's in front of you, not the one that's behind you. And he is recognizing what's happened since he took office, and that is, he has been demonized. Democrats have been demonized, all with both basically, Abby, nothing but falsehood and lies. And so when you do that, you become combative. And anybody who knows Joe Biden knows that when you go after him like that, he's going to come back and he's going to be forceful. And last night was not just a pivot. It was a demonstration to the American people about what he's done, what he will do, his vision for America, and importantly, that he is up to the task.

If Republicans will meet him, even part of the way, Joe Biden has indicated that he would be there.

Look at what he said about Mitch McConnell when Senator McConnell announced his resignation the other day from leadership. I think that that's going to be the difference.

And the number one word that I heard was weird. People thought it seemed weird. She was tonally off. Her smiles didn't match what she was saying. She was kind of all over the place. One person in the focus group said she seemed like a Stepford wife. Another person suggested that perhaps it was trying to distract from the recent Alabama IVF decision. But, overall, I think they were confused by it. And I think a lot of viewers who were watching it were confused because it just landed as terribly inauthentic. And this is what -- the problem is, is that Katie Britt is a talented, normal person, but they wanted to sort of slot her in. They didn't want people to read senator, right? That's what Tommy Tuberville was really saying. It's sort of like, forget that this is a senator here and think about the fact that she's a wife and a mother. But, again, this fundamentally misreads the voters that they need to bring back into the tent. The people that they're -- the women that they're hemorrhaging in terms of voters are people who don't like the Republican position on IVF or on women's reproductive freedom and who don't like the sexist comments that Donald Trump makes and the way that the party's posture sort of is toward women.

But have all Oscar voters even watched all 10 of these movies?First, let's talk about the Best Picture and how it's even selected. Academy voters, they take all 10 of the nominees and they rank them from best to worst. If a movie doesn't reach 50 percent, the total vote, the movie with the fewest votes, is then eliminated. And those votes would then go to the movie that's ranked second on the ballot. Now, this process is just repeated until one movie reaches that 50 percent threshold. And then a winner is selected. But ranking all 10 movies may be tough if you haven't bothered to see all the movies. You would think that that would be a prerequisite for becoming an Academy voter, but actually it isn't. There's no requirement that voters actually watch all of the movies. Here is what Best Actress nominee Carey Mulligan said a few years ago about the nominating process.
