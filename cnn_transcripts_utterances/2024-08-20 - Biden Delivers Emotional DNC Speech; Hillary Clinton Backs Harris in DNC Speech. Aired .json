We have really, in a lot of ways, hardened into our corners. We've become incredibly combative and defensive in our politics.And watching him last night, and as somebody who worked for him for a long time and saw him up close and the way that he conduct -- conducts himself in public service, it was such an ode to the idea that public service is about being bigger than ourselves. And that there is reason for optimism. And that people should want to participate in the process. I think so many people look at politics today and say, why would I want any part of that? And I just thought he did such a moving job, as somebody who's dedicated his life to public service. I thought he did such a moving job of making the case for the fact that, you know, working in politics can -- is about serving something bigger than yourself. It is about country. There just aren't that many moments in our politics where somebody stands up and says what's best for me, the thing that I want, is not what I think is best for the country. And so, I'm going to take a step back. And that is a huge, huge, selfless thing to do. So, I was -- it was really moving. It was obviously emotional for those of us who worked for him.

But to pretend that there is complete unity, I'm not sure if that's -- that's accurate. But I want to just touch on President Biden quickly here. I mean, it does take a certain level of magnanimity to be in a very, very powerful position and be willing to give it up.

For Democrats, it was a traumatic experience. And so, I think, you know, the way -- I would agree, the way Kamala Harris is handling the \"lock him up\" at her rallies, I think, is the right -- is the right strategy. But I also do not begrudge Hillary Clinton this moment, both for her own personal -- considering that she was tarred in that way for the entire campaign. You know, and now he is actually a convicted felon. I think she should get that moment of emotional satisfaction, just as a human. But I also actually think that it serves to remind Democrats of the stakes; what it is like when Donald Trump is in power in this country.

That's an interesting argument that I'm open to.But I wouldn't necessarily ignore the divides, the gender divide. I think that men can play, particularly those disengaged low-propensity men, can make they make a mathematical difference in places like Wisconsin, like places like Pennsylvania where there are more blue- collar. They don't have a college degree. They do want a message that speaks to their future and not just a future of women. And I do think Democrats have some issues there.",
