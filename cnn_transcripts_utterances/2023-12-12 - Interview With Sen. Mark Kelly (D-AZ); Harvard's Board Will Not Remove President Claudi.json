His trial was postponed today after his legal team said that it lost contact with him.Navalny's spokesperson says that there is no concrete evidence of where he is, but they had been told that he quote, \"left a Russian prison colony.\" Navalny is serving sentences totaling more than 30 years in maximum security penal colonies near Moscow. Now the White House and State Department both say that they are deeply concerned about his well-being. But earlier today, the Kremlin pushed back against those concerns. The spokesperson saying that it does not have the capacity nor the willingness to monitor the whereabouts of prisoners.",

Earlier today, the Ukrainian president was on Capitol Hill. He met with members of the U.S. Senate. Including Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who joins us now live. Senator Kelly, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. Do you think that President Zelenskyy's visit changed the minds of your colleagues who oppose sending more aid to Ukraine? SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Boris, he presented a compelling case. He talked about how they're inflicting huge losses. They've made a lot of progress. They have more work to do. We can't ignore and abandon our allies here in this time of need. I mean, they need our support. The problem that we are seeing on Capitol Hill is but we usually see, and it's frustrating. They are running out of ammunition, and we have to provide that combat power back to replenish what they have.",

And we need to make sure that the Ukrainians win.I mean, if we let Putin take over Ukraine, he is going to set his sights on another target. And that target could be a Baltic country. It could be Poland. It will be a NATO ally. Then we end up in a situation where we are going to have to defend our allies. And that means committing combat troops. We have eliminated, by helping Ukraine, a lot of the combat capacity of Russia. And the Ukrainian people have fought really, really hard. I've been to Ukraine twice this year. A young woman, who made this compelling case for getting F-16s to me personally, I worked on that. They now have F-16 pilots training in Arizona. They are learning how to bring this platform into the fight. We can't let the dysfunction in Washington prevent us from doing what is right.",

I mean, that is not who we are to let that happen to one of our allies. This thing has not gone exactly as we would have liked. But if you go back two years, we thought Russia was going to run through this country in a matter of just days or weeks. They have not done that. And with our support, we can help them fight back against this dictator. We cannot give Putin his Christmas present. I mean, he is looking for this. He is waiting. Even commented on what happened here last week when we started to seem like we had some trouble here. And you know who else is watching this? It is the Chinese president. The leadership in Iran. The dictator in North Korea. They are watching what's happening here. And if we fail, if we fail in this moment, I think history is not going to judge us well.",

You know, saw where they keep all of the paperwork of everything that we are transferred to Ukraine.I went through the entire process. Including where weapons are loaded onto the trucks, you know? Poles who are bringing these weapons into Ukraine. I've talked to the ambassador about this in detail. There's no evidence that any of these weapons are showing up in other countries. We talked about this with Zelenskyy today. They have made reforms. They have complied so far with 100 percent of the items that we have asked them to look into. So I think that this is -- at this point, this allegation of corruption, sure, Ukraine's had corruption problems in the past. They are in an existential fight with Vladimir Putin, who wants to take over Ukraine and end them as a country. We cannot let that happen.",

We are talking about Ukraine aid, Israel, humanitarian assistance, funding for INDOPACCOM, with a -- future issues with China, let me leave it at that. For this to be caught up in the politics of the border would be a mistake. There is a lot that we agree upon. Resources for border control, CBP, rebuilding ports of entry. On policy, we need to continue to talk about it. There's been a proposal from the White House. We have to come to an agreement.

They even had to accept Claudine Gay's apology or push out the first black president in Harvard's nearly 400-year history.And so after what they described as extensive deliberations, the Harvard corporation announced that they don't want Claudine Gay to go anywhere. They praised her as the, quote, \"right leader to help a community heal.\" They pledged their unanimous support. I would note, though, that the statement, it did offer some criticism, saying that the Harvard initial reaction to the October 7th Hamas attacks should have been an immediate and unequivocal condemnation. Still though, this is a huge relief to the more than 700 faculty members of Harvard who were pleading with officials not to cave to outside pressure. I spoke to Harvard economics professor, Jason Furman, the former Obama official, and he told me that he is glad that the Harvard corporation made its own decision instead of quote, \"outsourcing it to others.\" Not surprisingly, though this is not silencing Harvard's critics. We heard from Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik who, remember, it was her questioning during the hearing just a week ago that sparked all of this controversy. Listen to what Stefanik said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): This is a moral failure of Harvard's leadership and higher education leadership at the highest levels. And the only change that they have made to their code of conduct, where they failed to condemn calls for genocide of the Jewish people, the only update to the code of conduct is to allow a plagiarist as the president of Harvard.

The Harvard corporation says that they did an independent review here. While they did find a few instances of inadequate citation, they did not find a violation of the university's standards. The bottom line here is the controversy at Harvard is not over. But officials have decided that Claudine Gay is the person that they want to lead them out of this crisis.",
