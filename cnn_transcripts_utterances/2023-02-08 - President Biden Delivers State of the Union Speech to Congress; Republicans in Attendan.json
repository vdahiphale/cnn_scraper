It is true that the deficit declined $1.7 trillion in fiscal 21 and 22 compared to fiscal 2020. But here's the key, experts have consistently told CNN that Biden is taking way too much credit for this decline when he suggests his own administration is responsible.In reality, that decline overwhelmingly occurred simply because temporary pandemic spending from 2020 expired as scheduled. And not only that, experts tell me that Biden's own actions, his legislation, his orders have, on the whole, significantly increased deficits. Dan White, a senior director of economic research at Moody's Analytics, which is a firm Biden has repeatedly cited, told me this, on net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it. How much? Well, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, estimates that Biden's actions will add more than $4.8 trillion to deficits from 2021 through 2031. And that group's president, Maya MacGuineas, told me before the speech the White House deserves credit for the $250 billion of deficit reduction they enacted through the Inflation Reduction Act but should also take responsibility for the $5 trillion of deficit increasing policies they signed into law or executive order. Biden can take some credit, Don, for the economic recovery, which has boosted tax revenues. That helps deep the deficit down. But overall, what he's done has made the deficit bigger, not smaller.

In short, Don, Trump won't solely responsible for the debt increasing during his tenure. Under Trump, the debt did rise by a quarter, it's now above $31 trillion. It went up by about $8 trillion under Trump. Some of that was definitely Trump's own doing. His unfunded tax cuts were a major contributor.But a big chunk of the increase was the trillions in bipartisan COVID spending. That's when the big Trump-era spike in the debt occurred in early to mid-2020. Also, as always, some of the increase was because of spending that is mandatory because of decisions from previous presidents, from Medicare and Medicaid in the 60s to President George Bush's prescription drug benefit to Obamacare. So the debt blame game is common to both parties. It is tradition. But the reality is more complicated than the debt belongs to the president. Don?",
