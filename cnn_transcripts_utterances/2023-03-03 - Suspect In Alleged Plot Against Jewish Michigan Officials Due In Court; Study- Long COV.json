Now, these threats were posted online out of state is what law enforcement believes the suspect, Jack Eugene Carpenter III. One of them reading in part, I'm heading back to Michigan now threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government if they don't leave or confess. And now, later adding, any attempt to subdue me will be met with deadly force in self-defense.And court documents show his mother told investigators that he had three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, and two rifles. He was eventually arrested, but a law enforcement source told CNN among those targeted was Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who confirmed that on Twitter but also, while testifying in support of gun safety legislation said this.

They've been saying repeatedly this is really going to be up to House Ethics. Now, it could take weeks, even months really for the House Ethics Committee to go over all of these pieces of their investigation.They announced yesterday a couple of the areas they're looking at if there was any misconduct on his campaign. They are also looking at whether or not he may have misfiled anything with the House of Representatives. That could be something like a financial disclosure that they're going to be probing. They also are looking at whether or not he engaged in sexual misconduct with someone who was seeking employment in his office. Now, George Santos's office announced yesterday that they are fully cooperating with this ethics probe, but that they are not going to comment any further on this investigation at this time. And they are also -- we are also learning what exactly the House Ethics Committee could actually do. A couple of areas that they could pursue. They could recommend an expulsion. But that would take two-thirds of the House of Representatives to actually vote for that. They also could issue a censure, that would be a reprimand -- a public reprimand in the well of the House of Representatives from some of Santos's colleagues, or they could simply just reprimand him in a letter that, of course, really nothing more than like a slap on the wrist, Amara.",

He was so relaxed about this. He has no bitterness, no ill will.For him, it's simply an honor to be considered for the Medal of Honor. And to receive it, he said, it's beyond his wildest dreams. And that's why it is so special to him. He was awarded the Silver Star for what happened back in June of 1965. And that was pretty much the end of it for a long time. But in fits and starts on and off some of the men he served with there, some of those who knew the story tried to get this forward to get this upgraded to a Medal of Honor. And it took more than 50 years. It got going again in earnest just a few months or years ago. And that has led us to this day. He will receive, Colonel Paris Davis, a Medal of Honor. You see that ceremony beginning right now. The invocation at the White House with President Joe Biden standing there. And soon we'll see Colonel Paris Davis receive the Medal of Honor for the fight that day. And it's incredible. He kept going back in over the course of a 19-hour fight, knowing his men needed him. I had the chance to ask him why did you keep going back in and he said others. He had the need to help in any way he could. He knew his men were out there. And he kept going in after them. We also had the chance to speak with one of those who served with him who said you always knew Captain Paris Davis at the time, had your back. And not only would he be with you on the front lines, he would be in front of you. And that gave his men a measure of courage, a measure of confidence knowing their leader was with them in that fight. It started as a pre-dawn morning raid. It began according to plan, but those plans quickly fell apart when they were outnumbered by North Vietnamese forces. And from there, that is where the story picks up, Amara. I suspect the ceremony here is about to get going, so we'll tune in in just a moment here.",

Tell us more about how the retired Colonel actually, you know, made an impact on the field there because he was under fire.I mean, he had been hit by automatic weapons fire, right? And this was during a 19-hour firefight with the North Vietnamese. And what really got me was that when help came in the form of a U.S. helicopter to get him and his men out, he said, no, I'm not leaving, I'm not evacuating, I'm going to stay behind and help my fellow soldiers.",
