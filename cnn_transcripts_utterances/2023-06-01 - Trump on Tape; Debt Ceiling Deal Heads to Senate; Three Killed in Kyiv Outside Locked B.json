What does this intensity, is the way that I am describing it to you, seem to say about the war? GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Russia still does not have the means to go after significant Ukrainian military targets with its missiles for whatever reason. It just does not. It seems it gets better return by simply punishing the Ukrainian people. If you don't like me, I will kill you. So it is a personal attack by the Russians on the Ukrainians. Ukrainians recognize that Belgorod is a key logistics center. So these Russian dissidents are actually disrupting the ability of the Russians to respond to a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive. Where that is, we don't know. It could be in Bakhmut or in the south or in the northeastern part. So what happens in Belgorod would be significant. This is a cat and mouse game at this point. They're doing reconnaissance, using their artillery, looking at Russia's reactions. And they are trying to assess the best opportunities.",
