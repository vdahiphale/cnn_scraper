That's tonight on NEWSNIGHT.Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. Breaking tonight, indicted again, the president's Justice Department charges the president's son with tax crimes. David Weiss accuses Hunter Biden of cheating the government out of $1.4 million that he owed. The Justice Department says that the president's son faces a maximum of 17 years in prison on nine felony counts, three counts, tax evasion, assessment, three counts, a failure to file and pay taxes, and three counts filing a fraudulent tax return. Now, minutes ago, Hunter Biden's attorney responded to the special counsel's charges saying that if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware and now California would not have been brought. Let's get right over to CNN's Evan Perez. Evan, you broke the story that this was coming down the pipe. Walk us through what this very lengthy indictment says about where all of this money went.",

Hunter Biden was using a company that he owned and making deductions for some of the expenses that he was using on his personal life.A lot of it is obviously a very messy personal life that he has detailed during the time that he said he was addicted to drugs. He was paying for escorts. He was paying for luxury clothing. He was paying for, you pointed out, that Lamborghini. He had used or he had claimed a deduction for a $10,000 membership to a sex club. He also, according to prosecutors, spent $188,000, more than $188,000 on adult entertainment. There was money that he was paying for women that he was romantically involved with, including one woman who was pregnant with his child. So, all of this, they say, was during a time that he should have been paying his taxes and instead was using it to fund what they say was an extravagant lifestyle. You pointed out, Abby, that this was something that, according to his lawyer, should have been wrapped up in a plea deal. Of course, that fell apart spectacularly last summer, over the course of the summer. So here we are. Hunter Biden is now facing charges in Delaware for that gun that he bought when he was prohibited from purchasing firearms. And now he's facing these nine counts in Los Angeles. So, he's got two trials in the coming months. Abby?",

And the Republicans have tried very, very hard for the last couple of years to make the linkage that somehow the president was involved with his son's business, that he profited from his son's business. None of that has turned out to be true. They certainly haven't turned up any evidence of it. But is it problematical? I mean, this is not going to be welcome news at the White House.

So that's a difference between now and when he wasn't the special counsel. But, Abby, I expect that the Republicans are going to try -- they will -- you know, there's an impeachment move. The speaker said the other day that he's ready to move to an impeachment inquiry. I think Donald Trump is very much encouraging that because he wants offsetting penalties.

So, we want to welcome this evening's NEWSNIGHT debate, New York Democrat Jamaal Bowman and New York Republican Mike Lawler. Thank you both for joining us. And before we get to these issues, I do want to start with some news. The House just censured you, Congressman Bowman, today, 214 to 191. The inciting incident was when the congressman set off a fire alarm in the middle of a fight to avert a government shutdown just a few weeks ago. Congressman Bowman, Adam Schiff, your colleague, when he was censured, he said that it was a badge of honor. Do you think it's a badge of honor? REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY):  Well, it's another example of how the Republican Party is not serious about governing. They have no ideas. They have no policies. They can't inspire the American people. So they focused on censuring me, even though, after the fire alarm incident, I took full responsibility right away. The legal process is playing itself out. And if all things go well, the case will be completely dismissed in January, have to pay a fine. Ethics at the moment is not moving forward. So, once again, the party is focused on censures and culture wars and messaging, and not focused on governing for the American people. So it's unfortunate.",

The fact is that those college administrators should all be fired, every last one of them, that they couldn't say that calling for the genocide of Jews on their campuses violated their conduct. In fact, some of them said it's context. It needs to turn into action. Are you calling for the actual genocide of Jews? You want them to be killed first before you take action your campuses? I introduced a resolution on the House floor that made it very clear that Israel has a right to exist, because if you look at the terrorist attack of October 7, it's clear Hamas and its backer, Iran, do not believe Israel has a right to exist. They want to eliminate the Jewish people, period. And so we need to be unequivocal and clear. There is no moral equivalency here. This is good versus evil. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has oppressed the Palestinian people, that has used them as human shields. So, if we want to combat antisemitism, not only do we need to take it on, on our college campuses and in the halls of Congress, but we need to make it very clear that terrorist organizations like Hamas and its funder and backer, Iran, that we do not support that at all, that we stand by Israel, and, very clear-eyed, we believe in Israel's right to exist, its right to defend itself, and the right of the Jewish people to practice their faith.",

Not one Republican voted for my resolution condemning the Great Replacement Theory. So, once again, they are not serious about addressing the issue of antisemitism.

The challenge that we have here is that the Biden administration refuses to negotiate on critical issues such as securing our own border. So while I do believe in providing funds to Ukraine to secure their borders and protect their sovereignty, we need to do the same here in America. Since Joe Biden took office, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed our southern border, many of them illegally. The asylum process is fundamentally broken, taking two to three years for these cases to be heard. And when they are heard, nearly two thirds rejected. New York City is facing an existential threat. Eric Adams said the migrant crisis is destroying New York. They're talking about cutting funding for police and fire and emergency services. Joe Biden needs to get serious about securing our border. What we have said in the House Republican majority is that we will support Ukraine, but it needs to be tied to real changes in border security policy. In addition, Chuck Schumer has done absolutely nothing. He has passed nothing through the Senate. He's the Senate Majority Leader from New York. He has done nothing on the border, nothing on Israel. He's the highest-ranking Jewish official in America. Has not passed one thing to provide aid to Israel. The House passed it in a bipartisan way weeks ago. What is Chuck Schumer doing?",

Now, I look at this and see it, that it is one of the greatest challenges we have in this country because, as Jamaal said, immigrants do enrich our communities, our culture, our economy as our population declines, we need immigrants in this country. We welcome them. But there has to be a process, and it has to be done legally. To just allow 10 million migrants to flood the southern border and act as though that's not a problem. And if you've been there, I can't understand why you would not vote in favor of legislation to secure the border. We have to deal with this. This is not about being against immigration.

Our caucus and myself, we support universal health care. We support Medicare for all, because we spend more than other developed countries on health care, and we're not as healthy as a nation. So, Trump is not going to be successful in rolling back Obamacare, one, because Democrats are going to have control of the House and the Senate, which is going to make it much more difficult for him to do that if he were to get in, and I don't think he's going to get in, but we will leave that on the side. But in terms of much of what my colleague said about health care, I agree with. One thing I want to add to it, he mentioned housing, which I 100 percent agree with, and he mentioned a holistic approach, which I 100 percent agree with. We have to talk about the predeterminates of health and the things that we need to invest in that will help us to dramatically bring down health care costs, like universal childcare and early childhood education. Many of our babies, our children are dealing with toxic stress and chronic trauma because we don't have a universal childcare system. And many of my colleagues in the Republican Party do not support universal childcare. But that social determinant of health, in addition to housing, in addition to other environmental factors like climate and education, will help with health care outcomes on the back end as well.",
