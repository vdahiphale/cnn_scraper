The heavy infantry fighting vehicles, those track vehicles, they make a very distinctive sound and that's what we can hear coming up from right along the border fence right now. It was much heavier earlier this evening, a lot of airstrikes, a lot of artillery fire, tank fire, very intense tank fire from around here. But today, we've been able to take an opportunity to get to some vantage points and to see exactly what the IDF is doing along the border, get a look right into the beginnings of that incursion, as it is happening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): Racing along the border with Gaza, Israeli Merkava tanks, an incursion force on the move. Part of the IDF's intensification of operations preparing the way for an expected large-scale ground offensive. ROBERTSON (on camera): That dirt track down there where you can see the dust coming up, that's the road that runs along the Israeli side of the border. We've been able to hear intense gunfire from the IDF shooting into Gaza, tank rounds as well fired from there right into Gaza. ROBERTSON (voice over): Machine gunfire erupts as unseen soldiers battle for control of the fields that separate the border from the crowded Gaza towns. Inside the towns, smoke rising from intensified strikes, where the IDF says Hamas hides in underground tunnels and among civilians. Israel's defense minister announcing a new phase in the war. GALLANT (through translator): Last night, the ground in Gaza shook. We attacked terror operatives from all ranks in every location. ROBERTSON (voice over): The tempo of battle rising noticeably Friday night, power, phone, and internet services cut in the north of the densely populated Palestinian enclave. Hospitals already short of medicine, water, and other essentials at times appearing overrun with casualties. On Saturday, in apparent desperation with deteriorating humanitarian conditions, some Gazans stormed a UN compound looting food.",

Because - especially countries like the United States and other countries listen to the rule of war and we have to search houses by houses and look for insurgents and/or what supports them.And that's where it gets very deadly, especially when you're fighting terrorists, because they will hide behind civilians.

And I think they have no choice but to actually try to eliminate Hamas as a military, an existential threat to Israel or else they're going to find themselves again dealing with this in a couple of - potentially a couple of years or even sooner and it could be other countries - I mean, other elements get involved like Hezbollah, for example, and other organizations like Islamic Jihad or something else like that.",

GALLEGOAnd unfortunately, in this scenario, the best we can do is to make sure that we give support to Israel. We give them the intelligence that they need so they target terrorists and that we encourage them to reduce civilian harm. This is something that I did on the Armed Services Committee. I led a civilian harm - task force to try to reduce that along with other actual veterans, because our recognition of what happens during urban combat, and the best we could do is to protect these Palestinians to make sure that we work with Israel.

Palestinian authorities in Gaza reject that claim.CNN's Nada Bashir has more on the impact of this war on Palestinian civilians. And a warning, this report contains distressing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): A flash of light over the chilling, imposed darkness that engulfs Gaza every night. A glaring promise of more death and destruction. The ongoing siege and a communications blackout plunging Gaza into eerie silence. What little video has emerged so far paints a picture of the devastation wrought by Israel's relentless bombardment, scenes of incomprehensible loss, shrouded bodies, the latest amongst thousands of victims. Israel says it is targeting Hamas, now also expanding its ground operations. A retaliation, they say, to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7th, which left at least 1,400 dead and more than 200 others held hostage inside Gaza. But in the besieged strip of land, the number of Palestinians killed also rises with each and every airstrike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
