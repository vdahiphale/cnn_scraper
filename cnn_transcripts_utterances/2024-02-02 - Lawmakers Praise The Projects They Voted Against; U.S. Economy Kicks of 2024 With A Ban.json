People see the situation at the border and they're responding to the Republican narrative around what's happening at the border.Listen, there is a global migration challenge between global climate change, between failed governments in our hemisphere. There's a challenge that we have to address at the root cause and also how it's appearing at our border. But when you look at what Republicans talk about, when you talk about a mass invasion, like you hear Texas Republicans talking about, when you talk about things like replacement theory, these are things that have gained hold in our electorate because that's what Republicans are talking about. Because they think it's, if they can come up with a conspiracy theory that's dangerous enough, that Americans will trust them. So when you see the rise in support for mass deportations, it's in response to a dangerous Republican narrative.",

In fact, she was putting a company in the -- we'll call it, criticize and vote against and then turn around and seek credit way to do things when it comes to two of President Biden's cornerstone legislative achievements. It turns out the more than $1.2 billion authorized between Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill and the semi-conductor manufacturing law creates a lot of funding and a lot of funding opportunities for districts and states. It's not even actually the first time we've seen Salazar praise it. She praised the quote, \"impressive facilities\" at the renovated Miami Airport, renovations financed with the $85 million investment from Biden's infrastructure law. And just last week, Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber praised a billion-dollar investment to replace a bridge in his district. As for the legislation, I don't think you guessed it, Stauber voted against the bill that allotted those funds. Now, as you'd expect, White House officials have noticed too. One advisor told me, while those in the West Wing are exactly shocked, the quote, \"unmitigated gall\" is not lost on us. That goes a long way in explaining why the White House last week targeted Stauber. Quote, \"POV, you voted against President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, but you are taking credit for it.\" Biden's done it on the trail as well. And in a visit to the district last week, Biden made sure voters should know who to thank. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: For decades, people talked about replacing this bridge, but it never got done until today. Until today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Oh, Phil. Thank you. This is CNN breaking news with the latest jobs report shows the economy added 353,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent.Joining us to break down those numbers, CNN Anchor and Business Correspondent Rahel Solomon. This isn't just good. This is really good and beating expectations. RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is a stunningly good report, a hot report. So expectations, Erica, we're closer to $176,000 -- 176,500, let's call it. So this is twice what Wall Street was expecting. As you pointed out, the unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent, third month in a row. We've been in this really tight range of unemployment under 4 percent for at least two years now. When you look at the industries where we added jobs in January, this was what was really interesting to me. So professional and business services really, I think the bulk of it here, adding 74,000 jobs in January. If you compare that to 2023, we added about 14,000 jobs per month. So you think professional and business services, think sort of white- collar jobs, accounting, for example, healthcare, that's a continuation of what we saw last year, healthcare adding 70,000, retail adding 45,000. As Phil laid out quite nicely there, this is a really important year, both politically and economically. And so this is the first jobs report. So a lot of eyes are going to be watching this both on Wall Street, both on Main Street and Washington. And what it shows is that it's an economy that continues to hump when expectations were that we would be in a recession in 2023, or the labor market would start to cool in a significant way, it hasn't happened yet. One thing that I also thought was really interesting is the last I checked futures were actually down on this news. Futures actually turned down on this news, at least the Dow. And the reason why perhaps is because earlier this week when we heard from Fed Chair Jay Powell, he said in determining when the right point is to start cutting rates, they're going to be looking really closely at reports like this, the labor report. And so a report which still shows some strength there, well that indicates that maybe they can wait a little bit longer in 2024 to start cutting rates, cutting rates and so on.",

It's not the only report that they'll look at. Certainly, they'll look at GDP. Obviously, they'll look at CPI, the inflation report. So there's sort of a lot of indicators.

Lewis Hamilton, who is considered to be one of the greatest drivers in F1 history, announcing he is leaving Mercedes after 11 years moving over to, of course, one of its biggest rivals, Ferrari.The 39-year-old shares the record with Michael Schumacher for the most world titles ever. Hamilton broke multiple other records during his decade, plus time at Mercedes, cementing his place in racing history. He joins Ferrari, not this season though, starting in 2025. Joining us from Hamilton's whole country of England, F1 Correspondent with the Press Association, Philip Duncan. Philip, good to have you with us this morning. This is -- OK, full disclosure, I am a massive drive to survive fan with my son, Sawyer. We love this. This was huge yesterday morning. Phil is getting on board with me.",

You know, Lewis Hamilton's always spoken about the dream of racing it for the red scene and now it's actually coming to fruition. So it's a remarkable story because no one really expected it to happen. Obviously it's been spoken about, but Lewis Hamilton signed a two-year deal with Mercedes only in September. And now four or five months later, he's joining their rivals Ferrari in 2025. You know, the biggest and most well-known driver joining the biggest team, it's a great story.",

He's -- as I said before, he's always dreamt about racing for them. Now he thinks it is the time to happen. He's friendly with John Elkann, the Ferrari Chairman, who's been instrumental in making sure this move has happened and now it's coming to fruition.

It's such a great story and a boost that F1 really needed after two years of Max Verstappen winning pretty much every race.
