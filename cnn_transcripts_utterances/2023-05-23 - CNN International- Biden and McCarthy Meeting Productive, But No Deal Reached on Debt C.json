Now we would not have access to these details if the special counsel had not gone to court to fight to get around attorney-client privilege by successfully arguing that Corcoran's advice may have been used in the commission of a crime. Now the special counsel is looking at whether anyone is trying to obstruct this investigation into the possible mishandling of classified materials. But at least one source did note that the kinds of questions Trump was asking his attorney, were at the kind of questions that you would seek out an attorney to help you understand. At this point, it is unclear though how these notes will impact the ultimate charging decisions of the special counsel.

That's just two miles per hour shy of a category four storm, on the Saffir-Simpson scale, based on the Atlantic basin. A lot of de- convection around the center, a very clean eye, still rapidly intensifying.So, it's strengthening as we speak. And it's roughly about 150 miles from Guam. And yes, still slowing down, winds pushing north northwest at eight miles per hour. It's taking on a very warm ocean waters in the mid 80s. That is fuel for this system to really continue to strengthen. What we're hoping for is some up welling, where the cool water gets pushed up to the surface and it can help it weaken a bit. But it's a very slim chance of doing so, with some very warm water. So, over the next 24 hours, expect winds to increase to 155 to even stronger as it pushes over Guam. Now, don't pay attention to that centerline. Sure, is there a potential direct impact? Yes, but the eye has been wobbling which is why we have a cone. There is still some uncertainty as to where direct landfall will be. That line pushes further back out to sea towards the northern provinces of the Philippines. And yes, strengthening to 160 miles per hour within the next 72 hours. The first band has already moved through. We're waiting for the next band of rain to push closer to the island. Very light to moderate rain, but still nonetheless, another outer band and a lot of wind with these bands too. Tropical storm force winds 39 plus miles per hour. The eye now showing up on radar. So, some of the heaviest rain still about a day away. But now it's still the time to prepare for this type of situation. A very dangerous storm ahead of us Wednesday, late Wednesday local time. The heaviest rain staying on the southern end of the island, and finally starting to taper back once we move into Friday. Regardless, we're talking about picking up roughly ten inches of rain over the next five days. And isolated higher amounts are possible. On shore flow causing storm surge as well. We're talking about winds, tropical storm force as early as Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. Typhoon force winds pushing up to about 119 miles per hour here late Wednesday -- Max, Bianca,",
