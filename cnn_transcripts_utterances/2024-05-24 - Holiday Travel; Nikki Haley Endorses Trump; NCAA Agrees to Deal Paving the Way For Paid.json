And Israeli officials are responding by saying that that Israeli military offensive in Rafah, which has been ongoing now for nearly three weeks, will indeed continue.The Israeli Foreign Ministry, for its part, defending the Israeli military campaign, saying that Israel is acting based on its -- quote -- \"right to defend its territory and its citizens,\" and also saying that Israel has not and will not conduct military actions in Rafah which may inflict loss of -- on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction, effectively responding to the wording of this ruling, which is based on the Genocide Conventions. Now, as it relates to the offensive in Rafah, it is very much proceeding. The question now is, even though this -- the ICJ doesn't have a mechanism to enforce this ruling, what kinds of consequences could Israel face? And, indeed, other countries could potentially impose sanctions on Israel as a result of its decision not to comply with this ruling by the ICJ. But that, of course, remains to be seen. Certainly, at a minimum, it is reinforcing the kind of growing international condemnation and isolation that Israel is facing on the world stage over its actions in Gaza.",

We're told that, once Hagerich, who pleaded guilty to these possession of ammunition charges, once he's able to post that amount, he will be able to be released from jail -- or, rather, he will be able to be released from where he's staying at and travel back to the U.S. His attorney told us that they expect to get that done today, and so Hagerich could be back in the U.S. as early as later tonight, rather. His attorney told us that Hagerich -- quote -- \"is pleased. He is relieved. The sentence in all of its circumstances is reasonable and fair, and he's relieved and looking forward to pay the fine and return home as soon as possible.\" Now, the judge's ruling is something that Turks and Caicos officials really had stressed over the last couple of days that was always a possibility. Yesterday, the country's premier noted that no American that's ever been convicted of a firearms offense has ever been sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 12 years in prison. And he also noted that judges in the country have this discretion. He also really pushed back hard against some comments that U.S. lawmakers had made earlier in the week that Turks and Caicos officials were targeting Americans. The premier said that's just not the case, that is not something that they were doing. As you noted, Hagerich, who is from Pennsylvania, is one of five Americans that have been arrested in recent months for possessing ammunition in the country. And, as you all noted, Hagerich said that he did not know that he had this ammunition in his bag. We expect another sentencing to take place next week, and then the remaining Americans are expected back in court next week as well, with court appearances also scheduled in June and July -- Boris and Brianna.",

And now we're trying to figure out, I think what they will try to figure out with this settlement, because, again, it's still very ambiguous over how these schools will disseminate this rev share model. It seems as if -- and if we had, in theory, talked about it -- and I have talked to some college -- some different colleges about this. What would happen is, is that the schools that make -- the programs that make the most money, for instance, the football program and the basketball program, will receive the most money. And then they will share the rest with the other programs, because, as of now, some of these -- and it's just the way it is -- some of these women collegiate teams are not making the money. They're living off of football. Football is king when it comes to college finances and sponsorships and deals. And so they will have to figure out a way that seems equitable for all of these teams.

Now, how this will play out moving forward, it seems to me that the players who are the most well-known, the most recognized -- you mentioned Caitlin Clark -- will make the most money, especially in name, image and likeness deals. That's just how it's going to work. That's how it works in the real world. The biggest talent gets paid the most. However, what we're going to see is, a lot of people, students, in particular -- because students don't necessarily have to opt in this deal. While the schools have agreed and the NCAA has agreed, there are certain student athletes who will try to push this through. What they're trying to do now, the NCAA is trying to lobby Congress to come up with some sort of law, so that they don't have to continue to pay these students as if they're employees, because, if they did, that would bring health insurance into the matter. That would bring a litany, other -- a litany of other details that they just don't want to address. This is just the beginning. And it's going to be -- if I had to bet, and I'm not a betting woman -- but, if I had to bet, there's going to be more money to be paid out to these students and to these programs, and the NCAA is going to try to push back. That's why they're trying to settle this right now.",
