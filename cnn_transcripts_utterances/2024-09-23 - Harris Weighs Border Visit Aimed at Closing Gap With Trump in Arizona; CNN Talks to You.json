We'll also break down the newest polling results and lines of attack with high-profile governors from both parties.Also tonight, how younger voters view the Harris-Trump matchup and whether they're feeling energized or apathetic about the race. CNN is on the ground in a crucial swing state. Plus, breaking news, officials say hundreds have been killed as Israel targets Hezbollah with intense airstrikes, its deadliest day of attacks on Lebanon in decades. CNN is in the region as fears of an all-out war are rising. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news on the intensifying fight in presidential battleground states, Kamala Harris and her aides studying the newest polls and gaming out their strategy in the days ahead. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is covering the Harris campaign for us. And CNN's Danny Freeman is covering the Trump campaign. Priscilla, first to you. You have new reporting on what Harris may do during her visit to Arizona this week.",

Sources are telling me that the Harris campaign officials are weighing a potential visit to the U.S.-Mexico border when the vice president is set to visit Arizona later this week. Of course, this has been a political vulnerability for Democrats, and they have been trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls, but they see an opportunity, an opportunity, Wolf, to narrow the gap, try to close that gap with the former president on the issue of border security. Now, some campaign officials remain concerned about that gap, but, again, perhaps with this visit to Arizona could tack on that border visit. Now, of course, no final decision has been made yet, that according to a source, and the vice president has previously visited the border as vice president as well as senator of California and also attorney general.So, while she has been on the trail, she has talked about her work as the attorney general and campaign officials think she has a case to make, not only painting the former president as I'm serious on the border for taking that bipartisan border bill, but also calling back to the work that she has done tackling transnational gangs. And some of this we've had a preview on last week. For example, she also hammered the former president over his controversial immigration policies. So, considerations underway on whether or not she goes to the border later this week. Wolf?",

And I think that it's really a good idea for her to go out there and visit the border, go on offense more on the border. If there's a reason she's down five points in Arizona, it's because people are angry about the border. And I think she's going to have to distance herself from some of Joe Biden's policies and not just say, you know, that Donald Trump scuttled that deal, the bipartisan deal, but also present her plan for what she's going to do about the border. She's talked about getting more funding and doing more about it. Arizona should be a state that she can do well in. Joe Biden won it in 2020. The Democrats were able to win the gubernatorial race in 2022 because Kari Lake was such a catastrophic candidate. Kari Lake is on the ballot again as a Senate candidate. There's also an abortion ballot initiative that's going to be on the ballot in November. And so Kamala Harris should be working hard to compete there. Now it should be noted, she continues to do better and improve in those more blue wall states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and then Nebraska too, which is what she needs to get to 270. But certainly her campaign would be more comfortable if she was able to also have Nevada and Arizona in better places.",

We need to deliver our message for the next 42 days to the voters of Pennsylvania and Michigan. We need to demonstrate and continue to demonstrate that we're the change agent. But more importantly, we need to talk about the economy. That's why we're benefiting in these states, is people are still apprehensive about Kamala Harris and they're confident in the Trump economy. So, those are the messages we're going to hit. Immigration is a big thing. I think showing up to the border this late is very insincere, and it just lacks credibility with Harris, when you consider the fact that she was a sanctuary D.A. in San Francisco, when you consider the fact that just recently a video was released today where she talked about down with deportations in Los Angeles, and when you talk about the fact that she, at one point, I guess in some questionnaire, talked about defunding ICE.

And across those three states, 55 percent of the voters say Trump would do a better job managing the economy compared to just 42 percent for Kamala Harris. Why do you think Harris' messaging on the economy, such a critically important issue, is not breaking through right now? GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD):  Well, I think that people should be cautious about getting too excited about good polls or getting too down about tougher polls. I think that polls are our snapshots, and I think that this race is going to be won or lost on the ground, and we'll see that over the process of these next 40 days. And I think the thing that you're continuing to see from the vice president is she's actually putting together detailed plans about things that can actually get our economy moving and making sure that our economy works for everybody. She's putting together detailed plans about what does it mean to support small businesses and making sure the small businesses are getting the liquidity that they need and the capital that they need to grow. She's putting together detailed plans about increasing the child tax credit and by adding on a $6,000 child tax credit that can not only have a significant impact on the child poverty rate that we have in this country but also being able to create economic momentum and get people back into the workforce and actually incentivize work.

What if Hezbollah doesn't back down then? Does this mean that Israel will invade Lebanon with ground forces, something that both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Gallant and the IDF really don't want to do. So, in a way, even though it has taken tremendous hits in the last few days, Hezbollah will still determine whether this thing will stop or it will continue indefinitely.",

We'll have to see whether that continues, whether they're simply trying to regroup so that they can land a devastating blow on Israel. They're not going to simply back down and admit defeat We need creative diplomacy to provide an off-ramp to a group that has said they will not stop firing into Northern Israel unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. If there is no ceasefire in Gaza, we need creative diplomacy with the help of the United States, France and Arab countries to help find a way out on an off-ramp so that someone within Hezbollah can say, for the sake of Lebanon, we are now going to step down, but they're not going to admit defeat short of that.",

Governor, thanks so much for joining us. Senator Vance, as you know. is calling this a sex scandal that of course ignores the hatred exposed in these various posts, Robinson referring to himself as a, quote, black Nazi and saying some people need to be slaves and he would buy slaves if slavery were legal. Does the Trump campaign need to be more clear about where they stand? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH):  Well, I think they've been pretty clear. I think again, they're not going to be campaigning with them. I think they've already canceled an event with them. They're focused on North Carolina for their campaign. You know, the lieutenant governor has a lot of problems that he's got to deal with and basically everybody's kind of walking away from this one, saying this isn't this isn't a policy problem, this isn't an image problem, this is hatred.

I mean, it's almost daily that you get something kind of interesting coming out of whether its tweet or one of his speeches. At the end of the day, this -- as you and I both know, this comes down to swing states, swing voters in swing states like North Carolina, Pennsylvania Arizona, Georgia, where Trump is doing pretty darn well, even aware the vice president is leading in the polls in most of those states, I don't think its by enough so by enlarge. I mean, she's had her moments of, you know, kind of swooping in taking the nomination from the current president, having a strong convention, a strong debate performance. You've got to give her some credit there. But I don't think those big inflection points are going to exist going forward. So as folks get their bills, as the credit card bills come in people start focusing more on policy and listen just the personality difference. I just don't think in some of those swing state, she's built up enough of a buffer to overcome the change that, that folks want to see. So, whether it's a weird tweet -- my point being whether it's a weird tweet or not, right now, people are really policy-focused. They're really looking for some sort of change.
