Meanwhile, Moscow says the region was hit again overnight in drone strikes that damaged several private homes. The Kremlin has opened a terrorism investigation into Monday's attack.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Max. And you're absolutely right. The Russians are saying this is a cause of deep concern for them. And they also say that what they call that antiterrorism operation is still going on in that region, which essentially means that the people who live in that region can't come back. And they also have a more strict regime down in that area near Belgorod where they can check IDs more easily and generally are conducting sweeps of the area as well.So the Ukrainians -- and I just spoke to the Ukrainian national security adviser, Max, and he quite frankly told me that, yes, these are Russians who did this, Russians who are fighting on the side of Ukraine here inside Ukraine. But he also says that the Ukrainians have nothing to do with this attack and that this is an inner Russian matter. Obviously, the Russians themselves see that very differently. Dmitry Peskov, aside from saying -- he's the spokesman for the Kremlin, of course -- asides from saying that this is a cause for deep concern for the Russians, also said that they hold the Ukrainians accountable. He says that this shows that the Ukrainians are attacking Russian territory and is obviously using this to try and justify Russia's war in Ukraine, what the Russians call their special military operation. But as of right now, it seems as though, Max, this is still an ongoing situation there in that Belgorod area where these forces, these Russian forces fighting on the side of Ukraine do say that they still have people inside Russian territory. Now, we don't know whether or not that's true. The Russians are saying that they are sweeping that area, that they're coming to terms with the situation, but it certainly seems like something that's still ongoing. And I think one of the things that's very important to make clear to our viewers is that that region down there is absolutely key for Russia. It is the Belgorod region. It's close to the town of Belgorod, which is one of the main military hubs for the Russian military, not only in general, as far as bases are concerned, but also specifically for the war in Ukraine. So certainly, a key area that these mercenary or these people have managed to get into and fight there. And certainly they say that they are not going to leave. The Russians again are calling this a terrorist act, Max.",

A source says it will focus on extending his pretrial detention. Gershkovich appeared in court last month to ask that he be allowed to await trial whilst under house arrest. But that request was denied and he was sent to Moscow, a Moscow prison. A fatal car crash in Wales has set off a riot there. It all started when two teenage boys were killed in a car crash or a crash near Cardiff on Monday. It's not clear how the crash and ensuing violence are related, but there are reports the rioters believed police were somehow involved in the boy's deaths. Police say vehicles were set on fire and property was destroyed. Several people were arrested. The driver who crashed a U-Haul truck into a security barrier near the White House faces a slew of charges. It happened on Monday night in Lafayette Square near the White House. Video shows police inspecting a flag with what appears to be a swastika, a roll of duct tape, and a black backpack that the suspect apparently had with him. The driver is in custody and is charged with threatening to kill or harm the president, vice president or their family. No one was injured and the driver's name hasn't been released. CNN's Evan Perez is at the scene of the crash and joins us now live. Lot of mystery around this, but also very worrying to see what they found.",

The FBI did a search to see whether there were any explosives. None were found, but a nearby hotel was evacuated for a period while the authorities tried to figure out what was happening with that truck. As you pointed out, you could see some of the video there showing some of the items that were believed to have been taken from that truck. One of them includes a flag with a swastika on it, a backpack, and a roll of duct tape. Now, this all going down in Lafayette Square, just a few 100 meters from the White House. There was never any threat to the president or to anybody inside the White House, according to the Secret Service. And, you know, this is normally a bustling area for tourists. Certainly, even at 10:00 p.m. at night, a number of people are out here taking pictures of the White House. Thankfully, nobody was injured. Back to you.",

Mexico's most active volcano roaring back to life as Popocatepetl began spewing smoke and ash in the past week. Towns in the vicinity are being warned to prepare for evacuation. Some 25 million people live in 100 kilometer radius of the volcano, which is south of Mexico City. Mexico City's airport was temporarily closed over the weekend and flights were delayed this week. Now, still to come, police investigating the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in 2007, have begun a new search at a reservoir in Portugal. What's prompted this new development? Next.

      "sentences": "Yes, so that's precisely the question, Max. So what we know so far is that this search was prompted by German authorities who asked the Portuguese police to go back and relook at this area, in particular.And as you mentioned, they are looking for evidence of potential activities of the primary suspect here, a man in his mid-40s, Christian Brueckner, might have had in that area when he lived in Praia da Luz for more than a decade. This area is about 50 kilometers or so north of Praia da Luz. We're talking about a pretty vast piece of land. There's a large reservoir, obviously, there's some scrub land, some surrounded by parks and walking paths and things like that. It is a needle in a haystack, it seems. Last time, the police searched this, or the authorities searched it privately, I should say, was 15 years ago, and they were actually inside the reservoir with dive teams and they turned up animal -- what turned out to be animal bones at that time, but nothing more. This time, from the pictures that we've seen, thus far, Max, they are primarily focusing their search on land, though, there are divers and boats there as well. You can see sort of lines of police officers or investigators on the shoreline sort of prodding around with sticks. And so, what they're looking for precisely, we don't know. We also don't know how precise of an area they actually have to look at because, obviously, this is a pretty big area.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so it seems like there is a lot of circumstantial evidence from what we can see so far. Obviously, he lived in this area at the time. He was a known pedophile. He is now a convicted rapist, serving seven years in a German jail. Brueckner cell phone was also placed in the area at the time of the crime.He tried to re-register one of his vehicles just a day afterwards. His story has also changed as well. He was actually interviewed back in 2013 as a witness in this case. And initially he said that he was not even in Portugal at the time. Then later he said that he was with his girlfriend on the night that this actually took place. But investigators haven't been able to find any woman to actually support this claim. The prosecutor in this case has also refused to deny the suggestion that they have found something belonging to Madeleine McCann inside of Brooklyn's trailer where he was living at the time. And so there seems like a lot of circumstantial evidence, but under German law, prosecutors need to be able to convince a judge that they have enough evidence to secure a conviction in this case. Clearly, they're missing something here and the clock is ticking. As I said, he's serving seven years right now for a rape case of an American, and he's more than halfway through that sentence already. So potentially, we could see him released.",

Portuguese police investigated for more than a year, and then they actually closed the case.And for some time, a few years, the only people who were investigating this actively was actually the McCann family, who, by the way, police had wrongly suggested for a time, for several months that they were suspects in this case. Then all of a sudden, this couple wrote to then-British Prime Minister David Cameron pleading for British police to get involved. They managed to secure new funding from the Home Office to the tune of, well, it's been more than $15 million has been spent so far to reexamine and reopen this case. And then in 2020, you had this breakthrough with the German prosecutor's office, but again, still no charges. And so, this case has generated a huge amount of attention because, obviously, when you have missing children, the more you can get this child's picture out there in the world, the more chance you might have of actually finding her. And so right off the get go, this case has attracted a whole lot of media scrutiny. And even 16 years later, we're still talking about it because it remains unsolved, Max.",
