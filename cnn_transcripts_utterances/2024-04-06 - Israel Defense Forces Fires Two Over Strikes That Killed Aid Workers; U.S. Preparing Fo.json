The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.\" The head of one group, a former CNN correspondent, Arwa Damon, told us that the strike has shocked her and other aid workers.

The warning, of course, sent in response to a warning from Iran for the U.S. not to be pulled into further and deeper into the conflict with Israel. But of course, there is mounting concern around the situation across the region as we continue to see these incidences and attacks. There are fears that this could trigger and provoke a further escalation beyond the region. We have seen this, of course, sometimes before, particularly early in the year across the southern border of Lebanon.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hezbollah's marching band kicks off an event in Beirut marking Yom al- Quds -- or Jerusalem Day -- a day set aside by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini 45 years ago in support of the Palestinian cause. And while the masked Hezbollah fighters carried the Palestinian flag, when Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah addressed the crowd, the focus was last Monday's Israeli bombing in Syria that killed, among others, two senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.",

Where, how, when, the scope, said Nasrallah, well, that's not our business to ask about or interfere in. That's up to the supreme leader. If Iran strikes back, it would be the first time since the Gaza war erupted that Iran steps out from behind its allies and proxies and attacks Israel directly. For months, Hezbollah, closely aligned with Iran, has been trading fire across the border with Israel. An Iranian strike on Israel would circumvent the middle militia. In Tehran, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, paid final respects to the Iranians killed in Damascus. He has vowed revenge. Tens of thousands paraded Friday through the Iranian capital for Jerusalem Day. It's an annual event where the chants and symbols are predictable, as Israel and Iran risk careening from strike to counter- strike to full-blown confrontation. -- Ben Wedeman, CNN, Beirut.
