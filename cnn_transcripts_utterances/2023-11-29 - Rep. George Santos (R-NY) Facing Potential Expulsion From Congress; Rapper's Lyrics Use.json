Are we to now assume that one is no longer innocent until proven guilty and they are in fact guilty until proven innocent or are we now to simply assume that because somebody doesn't like you, they get to throw you out of your job? [22:05:7] REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC):  The American people aren't worried about George Santos. They're worried about what they're paying for gas. They're worried about what they're paying for eggs. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  What we've said as the leadership team is we're going to allow people to vote their conscience. I think it's the only appropriate thing we can do. We've not whipped the vote and we wouldn't. I trust that people will make that decision thoughtfully and in good faith. I personally have real reservations about doing this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

When I was growing up, that's all I heard at the dinner table was that the Arab-Israeli peace possibility. I remember when in 1979, I was 14 I guess, when Carter and Begin and Sadat stood on the White House lawn. Camp David accords were signed, there was finally peace between Israel and Egypt. My dad was just flying high. It was the happiest moment I've ever seen him. So this was his whole career was based on the pursuit of peace in the Middle East. So as I watch it now, I wish he were still alive to explain the nuances. But my thought is it's all about the nuance. And unfortunately, in our society today, people don't want to recognize nuance. They want black and white. They want you're either on this side or that side. My advice to people, read Tom Friedman from the \"New York Times.\" Tom Friedman is the foremost expert on Middle East peace. He's been studying this issue his entire life. All of his articles the last few weeks really examine the nuance, the fact that there are Israeli people who are desperately trying to help people in the Gaza Strip. There were Palestinian people desperately trying to help Israelis on that awful day of October 7th, get to safety.
