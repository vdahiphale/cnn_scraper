I mean, there's a case in Georgia where the jury took almost a year to pick the jury. So this will take a little bit of time.But I also want to point out that the idea that it's Trump's lawyers that are trying to basically really sift through and listen for other motives or other reasons people may want to be on the jury or not be on the jury. The prosecution has to do the same thing. Because they're also having to sort of use the art of the jury questioning process to find out, does -- do these people have a bent toward the defendant? Is there some reason that they may have a reason to dislike the state in a case? Have they -- have somebody in their family been prosecuted by the state? And so they may not be a good juror for us aside from the Donald Trump case. And so all of these things will be going on and all these machinations will be happening. This is a little bit of an art. It's not just a science as you have to listen carefully and it'll be up to some skillful questioning to sort of ferret out those places where there may be biases for or against the defendant or for or against the state in this case.",

You usually would have a jury consultant helping you in this -- in this kind of case and that person would be advising you like, look, you know, these people seem to be put off by some of the questions or they maybe are sitting there with their arms crossed and they seem to be defensive when either the defense lawyers or the state attorneys may be questioning them or they seem to be evasive in their answers or we saw them laughing at an inappropriate time or at a joke that one of the counsel has made or maybe they're making eyes at some of the lawyers in the courtroom. And so somebody is watching this to read that language to see if there may be some inherent feeling for or against one side or another.It may not be necessarily about the facts of the case, but that sort of subliminal messaging is always key. And you're -- if you think about it just sort of from basic psychology and how people react and do they look you in the eye? Do they seem to be welcoming? You hear about people when they're a fight, they may cross their arms and get defensive and protective. They're looking to see the jurors answer the questions like that or in that posture. And so all of those things come into play almost as much, I think, as some of the questioning that they'll be getting because, you know, people -- people want to inherently say, look, I can absolutely be impartial because people want to be good, right? They want to do the right thing. They don't want to admit that they may have some bias because they think bias is a negative term somewhere. So all of these things factor together as both sides try to -- try to go through these jurors as they're brought in for further questioning.",

PETER MANSOOR, U.S. ARMY (Ret.): Well, a limited response could be a covert response, say a cyber-attack against Iran. That would be probably the best of all worlds, because it doesn't force Iran to retaliate. Another way to strike at Iran would be to strike at its proxies or its operatives around the region and refrain from attacking Iran directly.

      "sentences": "Yeah, we are still waiting on a release of that legislative text. That's when we'll get a lot more details. That's when members will get a lot more details about precisely what he has planned.Democrats are anxiously awaiting to see whether or not there's about $9 billion in humanitarian aid that would be included in that package, some of which would go to Gaza. So there's a lot of questions right now about what this package will include. But essentially what he wants to do is break up pieces of what was already passed in that Senate bill and try to pass them one by one. Aid to Israel, aid to the Indo-Pacific, aid to Ukraine. The reason perhaps for doing that is the fact that there are vastly different coalitions of votes in the House that would be willing to support those various bills. You have some Democrats who do not want to support additional aid to Israel if there are not conditions put on that aid. You also have many Republicans, conservatives, who do not want to support additional aid for Ukraine. So the hope in the mind of Republican leaders is by breaking this up, do you have more success in getting some of these pieces across the finish line? Boris?",
