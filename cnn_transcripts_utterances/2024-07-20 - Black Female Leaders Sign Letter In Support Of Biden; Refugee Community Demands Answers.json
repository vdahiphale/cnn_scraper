Maybe the only thing as complicated to navigate is the 2024 race. Inauguration Day is six months away from today, guys. And Democrats do not want to see former President Donald Trump back on that stage and yet they are struggling to decide who has the best chance to keep that from happening. Among the new batch of names publicly asking President Biden to step aside Congress Congressman Marc Veasey of Texas, not the biggest name, but he is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to do it. President Biden still seems to have the support of what Democrats know is the base of their party most black women. This week, more than 1,000 Black women leaders and organizers signed and released a letter demanding no change to the ticket. Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, actress Vivica Fox, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun sign that letter. This line from the letter sums up. \"The message the suggestion that any candidate who won their primaries should simply step aside because victory appears difficult at the moment is disrespectful to the voters unjust and undemocratic.\" Melanie Campbell signed that letter. She is the chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund and convener of the black women's roundtable to critical civics groups, and she is with me now. Thank you for being with me. I want to start with the broad question here. Why are you committed to keeping Biden at the top of the ticket when the polls in the swing state suggest it's harder to win? And the money from the big donors is drying up?",

And they didn't want to see President Biden stepped down. They had a concern and he had a bad debate. But then he spoke in North Carolina, and he has spoken, I was in in many places.

He like many of the people in these marches was a member of the Karen, that's a refugee ethnic group from Myanmar.Nyah was tackled to the ground and shot after he ran from police who were in the area investigating to armed robberies. Police say he fit the description of the suspect and he was carrying a replica gun which later turned out to be a pellet gun. Police say it had the same markings the signatures detachable magazine serial numbers as a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun.

If you look at the bystander video that was taken, and also the body cam videos of the officers, Nyah Mway was not a threat at the time, that officer whose knee walked up to him and shot him in the chest. At the point where he was shot, he was already on the ground pinned, and one officer was punching him several times when his partner walked over and fired while he was on the ground. And at that point, there was no BB gun in his hand. If you look closely at the videos, you can see that the BB gun was recovered, not anywhere near where Nyah was.

According to the LGBTQ advocacy group, GLAAD, it's considering a ban on transgender members. They say Alpha Phi Alpha would become the second of the Divine Nine to adopt such a band and glad notes that the proposal still has to be ratified by the general body and chapters of Alpha Phi Alpha.And we reached out to the fraternity to invite them on or for statement about their transgender member policy. We have not heard back. One of the groups now calling out Alpha Phi Alpha is the National Black Justice Coalition. It's a civil rights organization which advocates for Black LGBTQ people, their CEO and Executive Director, Dr. David Johns joins us now. Good to have you back on. Let me start here, you have said that if this becomes policy, this is a betrayal of their own legacy. Explain that. DR. DAVID JOHNS, CEO AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL BLACK JUSTICE COALITION: Yes, and I want to be clear before answering that. First, let me say thank you for inviting me and the audience to have this conversation. That in addition to representing a legacy civil rights organization that understands that as long as there have been people, I remixed that acknowledging that all people originated in Africa as long as it had been black people, even before the terms lesbian and gay existed. We occupy beautifully diverse ways of big. Also, I'm a student of history. And I know what Fannie Lou Hamer taught us, which is that none of us are free, unless and until all of us at free, also approached this conversation as a member of a Black Greek-letter organization. I'm a member of Kappa Alpha Fraternity Incorporated the greatest fraternity known to man, and both Kappa Alpha Psi and Alpha Phi Alpha were founded and historically white institutions to support those of us who know the sting of stigma and the damage that discrimination can have. And to privilege, the assumption that a doctor makes by citing gender at birth, over the identity of one who was making a determination, while also seeking membership of an organization reeks of white supremacy. And it is counterintuitive to why organizations were founded.",

And I wonder for black trans people who are at PWIs, predominately white institutions, and are looking for community and are looking for kinship and are told that you cannot if this becomes policy, join this group because of who you are.What that message is to that black trans person?

The sailors expressed safety concerns after the 1944 explosion at Port Chicago, and that explosion at a Naval Weapons Station near San Francisco killed 320 sailors and civilians.Surviving black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while white officers were granted leave to recuperate. 50 sailors who refuse to return without safety and training were tried as a group on charges of conspiracy to commit mutiny and they were convicted and sent to prison. And a statement, President Joe Biden said the decision to exonerate the sailors is writing historic wrongs. 10 years ago this week, Eric Garner was killed after being put in a chokehold by police. A decade later, his final words I can't breathe still resonate. The ritual of breath is the right to resist responds to Garner's death and the killings of other black people by police. It's an opera and we asked some of the creators behind the project, how it came together.
