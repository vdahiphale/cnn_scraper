(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SINEMA:  A growing number of Arizonans and people like me just don't feel like we fit neatly into one party's box or the other.

She waited until after the midterms, after the Georgia runoff, she did not try to screw the Democratic Party, she said -- they say she did an indifference to the Democratic Party.

And so, there is that timing.There's other people who thought, well, maybe, why doesn't she do this actually closer to when she announces she's going to run for reelection? So, there is that timing component. I think the Democratic senators are saying, that you played, that it's not going to change a lot in the senate, I think that is true. The biggest change with the 51st senator was in the committee process. And now that they have peer subpoena power, now they're not going to have evenly split committees between Republicans and Democrats, it seems like even with Sinema as an independent, the Democrats are still going to have that.

It has been a progression to which there really is a comparison that I could think of in the near term, from very far-left bordering on, you know, Green Party, almost socialist to some degree, now very much at the center of everything.I do think, the one thing that's interesting, at least talking a White House officials on Friday morning, and I would agree, 6:00 a.m. on a Friday, I had too many kids to deal with that at six a.m. on a Friday, I did not appreciate the timing necessarily. There is a sense of it could've been a lot worse, right? When you talk about it, you've dealt with here, this includes the president to some degree, she's been Rubik's cube for them over the course of the last two years. They can count on her vote, as you noted, 93 percent attempts to both Joe Biden. She almost always votes for the nominees. They don't think that's going to change. That is a big deal. The committee and where the majority stands, no sense that is in the change as well. But they have always found her a very difficult kind of thorny individual to try and pin down on specific issues. And yet, she has also been a critical player in some of their biggest bipartisan bills. That relationship will continue up until this point. The one thing that will matter though, and I think it's going to be something we don't necessarily have a full grasp on yet, there is going to be a lot of feeding to ensure, we allowed you to stand committees, you need to stay with us on this, how does that process work going forward? It's going to take a lot of work. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  You had a key point when it comes to the White House kind of view of this, we have to remember that Sinema has voted and supported much of President Biden's agenda, but also on some of his tax policies, she's been a holdout as well, she has shown already throughout the past two years that she can be somebody to push back against the administration as well. We have to remember that, yes, the White House is currently celebrating the summer they've had, the Inflation Reduction Act. Some of those proposals when Biden came into office are much larger and more sprawling, partially because of the slim majority and to particular holdout senators, one of those being Senator Sinema.",

So, if there is a three-way race in Arizona between a Republican, Kyrsten Sinema, and a Democrat, it's going to -- some are worried that she's going to be a spoiler, but it also is going to depend on who the Republican candidate is running against her.

Multiple associates were ordered to testify about him. He recorded a video for the families of jailed a January 6th rioters. He called for the termination of the Constitution. His company was convicted of tax fraud and other handpicked candidate in Georgia suffered a stinging defeat, and he hosted a prominent QAnon backer and more classified documents were found in a storage unit.

The grip finally loosens. And everybody starts to move away from him. And so, it's one of those I will believe it when I see it. Lawmaker quotes will not trigger it.

This is all part of also under the umbrella of attacking him on law and order, attacking him on foreign policy, trying to make him appear weak. But it seems that's more politically advantageous and as you were saying celebrating an American coming home as well. It's a trend that we have seen as well, you were saying but it's a party of opposition. But you know, when you look at as well Paul Whelan's family come out and also say and note rightly there were opportunities for this in the past. There were opportunities in the previous administration. Also worth noting, we reported -- my colleagues reported that the Biden administration as well was pushing for an arrangement to get Paul Whelan.
