I will say, if you are President Biden, I mean, I have to say, they have had various turns throughout the past three years, been able to look around at the national media and they have recovered and say, you have underestimated us, we are going to pull this out, we are seeing the things that we are seeing.

Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and -- and the Internet and so on? I don't -- I don't know any -- I think that the problem is the major piece of legislation we passed -- and some of it bipartisan -- takes time to be recognized. For example, you got -- you got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in -- up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the Congressman who got elected. And he said, \"Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York City?\"  I said, \"Yeah, we can. We can.\" First of all, it'll make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the -- in the pot now already -- already out there -- we voted for -- than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with. It's the same way -- for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year. So there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving. So, I'm not going to change -- as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I want to change and add to. For example, we had -- passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation, anti -- you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And -- but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil. So, I'm not going to change the direction. I said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm -- and I know -- I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay? One is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are -- the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more -- how can I say it? -- decent. Second thing I said is I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hardworking folks. And the third thing -- I know is still very hard -- I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't -- can't generate some unity. So, I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.",

Number two, I -- there are a number of things that we can and must do to make it -- and, by the way, this is a case involving an Asian American, in terms of getting into school, and whether there's affirmative action makes sense at all from the standpoint of those who are arguing against it. But, you know, the fact is that we're -- we're also in a circumstance where there's a lot that we can do in the meantime to make sure that there's an access to good education across the board. And that is by doing things that relate to starting education at age three -- formal schooling at age three -- which it increases -- not daycare, but school. All the studies over 10 years show that that increases the prospect of someone making it through 12 years without any difficulty, no matter what the background they come from, by 56 percent. And I also think that we should be making sure that we have the ability to provide for two years of education beyond that, whether it's apprenticeships or community colleges. And we also are in a situation where I think that -- for example, I want to make sure we -- a lot of it has to do with finances as well, that we make sure that we have help for people who come from modest means to be able to get to school. You know, the cost of college education has increased fourfold. And it used to be that a Pell Grant would cover something like 70 percent of the college tuition. Now it covers significantly less than that. So I want to increase the Pell Grants as well. But let's see what the Supreme Court decides. And I'm -- I am hopeful.

You know, I think that we -- we understand what it's like to lose family members, mothers, fathers, to can -- all of you have been through that kind of thing. We've been fortunate, though. We've had each other. We've had strong families -- Jill's sisters, my brothers, my sister. And so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there's help available, make sure there's people who are there to help -- whether they are a psychologist or whether they're medical doctors or whether they're social workers -- to be there to help, to help just hold a hand. And, for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you're talking about, if we re -- reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40 percent when it was in place. I couldn't get it passed the second time around. So there's a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it's communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don't understand, because they -- I don't want people having to know the pain. But the second piece of that is: Let them know that you are there to help. You're there to help. And one of the things I've talked with Vivek Murthy about -- and a lot of you have written about it, and you've written it well about it -- is the need for mental health care in America. You know, when we got elected, there were something like, I don't know, 2, 3, 5 million people who had gotten their -- their COVID shots. Well, in the meantime -- I've got over 220 million people all three shots. But in the meantime, what happened? We lost -- over a million dead. A million dead. I read one study that for those million people, they had nine people who were -- each one of them had, on average, nine people close to them. A relative, someone they're married to, a child -- someone close. The impact has been profound. It's been profound. Think of all the people -- think of all your children or your grandchildren who didn't have that senior prom, who didn't have that graduation party, who didn't have all the things we had that we took for granted -- the impact on their psyche. So, there's a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just on what a person demonstrates they understand -- of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we're trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it, too. I don't mean this is a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we got a problem. Okay, excuse me. These 10 questions are really going quickly. (LAUGHTER) REPORTER:  Stick around for more.",

I've met with him many times. And I've told him: I'm looking for competition, not -- not conflict. And so what I want to do with him when we talk is lay out what the -- what kind of -- what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interests of China, what I know to be the critical interests of the United States, and to determine whether or not they conflict with one another, and if they do, how to resolve it and how to work it out. And so -- and the Taiwan doctrine has not changed at all from the very beginning -- the very beginning. So, I'm sure we'll discuss China -- excuse me, Taiwan. And I'm sure we'll discuss a number of other issues, including fair trade and relationships relating to his relationship with other countries in the region. And -- and so, anyway.
