A win means that he will stay in office until at least 2030, continuing as Russia's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

She's been pretty much thrust into this position right now. So the question is, you know, where does the opposition go? The other leaders, Vladimir Kara-Murza, for example, is imprisoned in Russia in very bad shape. So it's not clear where the movement goes. I think the spirit continues, but there's nobody who kind of embodies that at this point.",

It -- that is another challenge for Putin. Real danger that he hasn't made it clear who's going to be his successor. But if he does do that, then he becomes a lame duck. So he has all the marbles right now. But whether he can really, you know, manage a transition, Russia hasn't had very many transitions in its post-Soviet life. So this is -- this could be a real danger. But at this point, he's got another six years. And legally, he could run for another six years.

Then lava first burst through the surface in December, followed by a second eruption in January that destroyed several homes and buildings in the area. A third eruption last month demolished a hot water pipeline and cut off heat to more than 20,000 people. The last few residents of Grindavik, who had returned to their homes, have been evacuated again. And Icelandic authorities have declared a state of emergency for the area, calling this the most powerful eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021. As in previous eruptions, the Blue Lagoon Spa once again closed its doors, interrupting the vacations of some tourists, some who may have gotten a little more of the Icelandic volcano experience than they imagined.",
