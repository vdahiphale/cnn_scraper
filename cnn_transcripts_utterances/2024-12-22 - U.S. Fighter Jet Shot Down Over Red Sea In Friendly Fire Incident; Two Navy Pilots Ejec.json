What we know is this U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jet was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman, and it was mistakenly fired upon by the USS Gettysburg.Now, when that jet was shot down, both pilots were able to eject safely. But one crew member sustained minor injuries. Of course, so many questions now. This incident is now under investigation by the U.S. military, and questions about how this could have happened. As CENTCOM emphasizes, this was not the result of hostile fire. Of course, this incident took place over the Red Sea, where the U.S. has moved warships and fighter jets and other assets in recent months amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East. And in a sign of the activity in this area, this incident comes the exact same day as the U.S. carried out airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. Now, the U.S. struck a missile storage facility and a command-and- control facility in the capital of Sanaa. During that operation, the U.S. also shot down one way attack drones and an anti-ship cruise missile, according to CENTCOM. Now, those attacks also involved U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighter jets and U.S. Air Force assets, according to CENTCOM. But two U.S. military officials tell CNN that this downed fighter jet, we have talked about in this incident, was not a part of those strikes, MJ and Victor.",

The investigation will determine how this mistake happened. But typically, how do these types of mistakes happen?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. Victor, good morning. Yes. One of the big things here is that you have a very big air space that they're dealing with. And in that airspace, there's a lot of activity, especially when there's a carrier battle group active like there is in the Red Sea with the USS Harry Truman. Now, when you -- which is where the F/A-18 came from. So, when you are in a zone like this where there is combat happening at one end of the Red Sea, and then there are other flight patterns that the folks on the USS Gettysburg, the sailors on the USS Gettysburg, have to deal with, it can be pretty easy to mistake targets from one to the other. In other words, is one a friendly target, or is one an adversarial or potential adversarial target? So, what the investigation is going to look at is what the people, the sailors who were manning the, you know, the positions on the USS Gettysburg, what they saw, what they believed was coming toward them. If, in fact, the aircraft was heading toward them, you know, why they saw it as a potential hostile aircraft and why they fired. So, this is going to be, you know, a critical piece. And in these situations, what they saw, what they believed to be the case, is going to be a key part of that. [06:05:06] What the radar picture looked like for them is also going to be a factor. And of course, they'll need to answer why they didn't flip the aircraft properly.",

If you can evade that missile, you're going to do everything you can to not only save yourself but save the aircraft.If your aircraft gets hit, that's when you eject.

You know why the crew on the USS Gettysburg did not see this aircraft as a -- as a friendly aircraft. So, they're supposed to be communication between not only the pilots and the aircraft carrier, in essence, their controllers in this case, but also with all the other naval assets in the region.And so, what was communicated to the USS Gettysburg is going to be a critical part of what this investigation finds. You know, whether or not that communication was clear, whether it was something that they, you know, mistook for something else and why they mistook it for, you know, for a potential hostile target. That's the kind of thing that is going to be part of the investigation. So yes, communication, what it was, how it was lacking. If that's the case, that's going to be part of the investigation.",

They're pretty tight procedures, and they're designed to avoid incidents like that. And when a situation like this occurs, obviously something went wrong. And, you know, whether or not, you know, you would have expected something like this, that depends on what exactly went wrong.

He has criticized the German state for being extremely soft on immigration and for its -- what he regards as its overly close relationship with Saudi Arabia.What we've now learned from sources inside Saudi Arabia is that the Saudi authorities repeatedly warned Germany about this individual. He's originally a Saudi citizen. Of course, he's 50 years old. He'd been granted asylum in Germany. Have been living here since, well, since 2006. And he worked as a doctor. He was a consultant psychiatrist at a local clinic. But the Saudis had repeatedly warned the Germans about the fact that he was becoming radicalized, that he'd been trying to, you know, get people out of Saudi Arabia and that he was generally sort of -- sort of voicing quite radical sentiments. And if you look at his social media, you know, he's talking quite aggressively towards the German state, saying if they want a war, you know, we will fight it. Things like that. But, you know, the fact is that he was anti-Islam, even though he was born in Saudi Arabia, and he was an active campaigner against immigration in the country. And that means he didn't really fit the security profile of someone who the security forces may have expected to carry out this kind of Christmas marking, ramming attack. I mean, there was another attack like this back in 2016, when more than a dozen people were killed when somebody from ISIS, the jihadist group, plowed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin. This person, as I say, doesn't fit that profile. But it's still fueling anti- immigration anger across Germany right now as they deal with this horrific tragedy, Victor.",

So, there were growing concern -- growing concerns about his radicalization, whether it was going to be targeted in Germany or elsewhere they didn't know.

You don't know that's how they're going to do it. But what they could see from his social media pages and what he was presenting publicly was that his radicalization wasn't turning towards sort of more extreme Islam, but actually more extremism towards the right-wing.

As Matthew was saying, we're not quite sure how this is going to play out. Is it going to play out with sort of antagonism towards the violence that is sometimes embraced by the right-wing in Germany or towards Muslims because he was, of course, a Muslim immigrant? And how that unfolds, we don't know yet. But both the Saudis and the Germans could have seen at least -- like maybe they couldn't have stopped this. But his -- he was presenting himself as someone who was dangerous and someone who might be prone to violence in protection of -- the irony here is, of course, in protection of some notion of Germany, of which he clearly is not a part of.

So, but let's say for instance, if we do have eggs, all of the eggs in our system are pasteurized. And so, they should therefore be free of the bird flu. The same for pasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk will go through the heat killing process and that will remove any of the bird flu. The other thing you can think about if you're consuming the meat of the chicken, if you're eating chicken, then make certain that it is cooked or heated to at least 70 degrees Celsius, which is about 171 degrees Fahrenheit. So, you want to make sure that you cook it because heat can also kill it. We certainly don't recommend drinking unpasteurized milk because large volumes of that virus can be in the milk.
