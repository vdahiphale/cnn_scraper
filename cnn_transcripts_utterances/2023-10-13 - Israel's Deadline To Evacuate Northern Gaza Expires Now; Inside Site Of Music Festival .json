But when we got there, it was a massacre. We saw bodies of men, women, children, elderly, caught up into pieces, the most gruesome images you can ever imagine.

It's actually been in their constitution when they built their government saying that they need to eliminate the Jews, not only in Israel, but in the entire world. So, when you give a terrorist organization like that weapons to go and fulfill their goals, we know what that looks like, whether it's for Hamas, the Palestinian authority, or Hezbollah, or all these different groups that are actually oppressing its people and don't actually represent its people.If you speak to Palestinians on the ground, whether in Judea and Samaria, the West Bank or in Gaza, they do not like Hamas, they do not like the Palestinian authority. They're on their, what, 20th year of their four-year term. These are oppressive regimes that are controlling their people and not only attacking Israeli civilians, but forcing Palestinians to also be counted to this conflict. Israelis do not want to see either Israelis die or Palestinians die. The majority of us are innocent. And this is not a war between the people. Let me make it clear that Jews are not fighting the Muslims and the Israelis are not fighting the Palestinians. We're fighting Hamas, which is oppressing both Israelis and Palestinians. Are we ready? We are ready. But we also need to not only look at what is happening. We need to understand why it is happening. And this really started with the west pushing narratives of dividing Israelis and Palestinians. The reality is that there is no future without Palestinians and without Israelis. Neither of us are going to disappear. So, I hope that when this settles, we can learn from this and transcend this conflict together.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that's going to be the real question, Abby. And, you know, let's take a look at the evacuation zone, as we know it right now. Because when you see the types of things that can happen here, you've got this area in the north, there are about 1.1 million people that are in this area at this point. And what's going to happen, Abby, is they are supposed to, according to what the Israelis have told them, go down here toward the Rafah crossing right here at the Egyptian border.

So, it's pretty dense in terms of its population.And what they're going to have to do in a case like this is not only go through these areas, but there are no safe zones in any of these areas. And when you go through these areas, which are less densely populated than the northern area, there are less services, there's less of an ability to care for people. And if they don't get this crossing opened, they won't be able to really stay in this area for a long period of time because it's going to be a place where they don't have living facilities, they don't have water, they don't have sanitation or any of those things.",

Cohen says Hamas gunmen repeatedly toss grenades into the shelter. People inside were blown apart. It's one of the most gruesome videos we've ever seen. This is some of the aftermath. Noam Cohen survived hiding under body parts. That's him terrified but alive. We found the shelter in the town of Alamein (ph) yesterday evening. Someone had put a curtain up over the doorway, but nothing could hide the smell as you enter. My cameraman, Neil Hallsworth, who's experienced a lot of war, began to retch and had to step outside. There's bloody hand prints on the wall. There's blood smeared on the walls. See, probably these are either bullet holes or from the grenades that were thrown in here. Body parts have already been collected from here, but blood soaks clothes and shoes remain. This looks to be a bloody handprint The shelter is no more than 15 feet long, maybe 5.5, 6 feet wide. The idea of so many people packed in here, standing shoulder to shoulder terrified screaming, it's incredible that anybody was able to survive.

Look, there's some new comments tonight, Carl, from Former President George W. Bush, urging a hard line in the U.S. response to the attacks. Just take a listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm kind of a hard liner on all this stuff. But I never thought we should try to accommodate Iran any way, shape, or form. I always felt the objective ought to be to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon to prevent a cataclysmic event in the Middle East. And these are the kind of people that if you show softness, they will take advantage of it. The administration started off on the right foot, it seems to me. Pretty bold statement, and that's good. And you got to take some heat, you know. Both parties have got isolationist tendencies. And, you know, we shouldn't get involved, who cares? Well, we should, we should care. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have not seen the condemnation of Hamas by these leaders.And the longer this war goes on, the great fear in Washington today, is the longer this war goes on and the more dancing in the Arab streets there are, the worse it is, not only for Israel, but for the United States and for the international world order. And Secretary Kissinger and I, we've known each other half a century, not always agreed. But his comments today deserve great attention.",
