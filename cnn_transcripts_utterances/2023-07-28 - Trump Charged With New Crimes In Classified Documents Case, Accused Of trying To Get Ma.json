A big question, how will his opponents respond to the frontrunner's legal troubles? CNN This Morning starts right now.We're glad you're with us. And there is a superseding indictment this morning. And there is a new codefendant. This morning Donald Trump is facing serious new charges in the documents case. The special counsel is now accusing the former president of trying to get surveillance video deleted at Mar-a-Lago, notably after it was subpoenaed by the Justice Department. Trump's long-time valet, Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago's property manager, Carlos de Oliveira, are accused of helping in this scheme. Investigators say Nauta abruptly changed his travel plans just hours after that subpoena for the video came down, and then secretly headed to Mar-a-Lago. According to the new indictment, Nauta met up there with De Oliveira, they went to the security guard booth where security video is displayed, and then, went around the property with a flashlight, through a tunnel, pointing out where cameras were located. Just after that, investigators say De Oliveira brought the club's IT expert to a private room. And according to the indictment, this was their conversation. \"De Oliveira told the IT expert that the conversation should remain between the two of them.\" And asked how long the server kept footage. The IT expert said he thought it was around 45 days. De Olivera then said that, quote, \"'the boss' wanted the server deleted,\" and when the IT expert pushed back on that request, De Oliveira have reiterated 'the boss' wanted it gone and then asked, \"what are we going to do?\" So, the timing here matters a lot, right? De Oliveira was told on June the 27th that the cameras caught not (ph) the last 45 days of footage. And if you go back, that would include the time when Trump allegedly had Nauta move boxes of national security secrets around Mar-a-Lago to hide them from federal investigators.

There's a power discrepancy here. Walt, you know, was someone who he did serve in the White House. If Donald Trump's reelected, it wouldn't, you know, be shocking if he followed him there. But this, you know, kind of maintenance manager, this is a, let's call him, 'junior person', who works at Mar-a-Lago, that I can imagine felt some level of pressure. I mean, I would guess if he has outside counsel, and is not having his counsel provided for by the former president, it would make a lot of sense for him to sever. Because there's going to be pressure there. I imagine that he felt like he needed to cooperate with what he, the former president, was instructing him to do. This is Donald Trump's playbook. He pressures people around him. He clearly bypassed his lawyers and wanted to work directly with these two individuals to obstruct. And it, you know what?

It's been parked over the Southwestern U.S. for so long, expanding, of course, now into the Midwest across to Northeast. Nearly half the nation, this morning, is under some sort of heat alert.And we are covering it as only CNN can. We have meteorologist Derek Van Dam in Miami Beach with a closer look at how this extreme heat is impacting sea life. And of course, the broader impact from there.

It could feel like 109 degrees in Philadelphia. That's why we're in this heat health emergency right now in this part of the city and really in our area as well. In the city of Philadelphia, we're seeing cooling centers open up and folks are really recommending that you stay indoors and get access to libraries. Schools that are open with air conditioning to support some of those folks who may not have it in their homes. The other thing parks and rec. They're also recommending get out, go to the splash pads, go to some of the community pools that are open today and will be open tomorrow as well. They say, ideally, don't jump in some of these fountains like this, but you know that may happen. It is Philadelphia, but that main message stay indoors and hydrate.

Yesterday, we went on a scientific expedition with the University of Miami Rosenstiel School. And we went to go determine how the delicate ecosystem of coral reefs here in southern Florida are handling these unprecedented ocean temperatures, this marine heat wave.And if anyone can tackle this problem, it's these guys because they are inspired. They're motivated and they are on the front lines of this climate emergency every single day studying this coral. I remember coral reefs provide this natural protection, this barrier from storm surge, from hurricanes here in southern Florida. So, we desperately need them. Also, for the tourism as well. And when we went underwater, we wanted to determine just how severe the bleaching was occurring. We know that there's been reports of 100% mortality of the coral in the southern Florida Keys. We went out to Biscayne Bay in the middle of the bay, specifically the southern sections, and we took samples with these scientists and that helped them determine and also in report back to NOAA, the level of this, ocean bleaching that is moving from the south to the north as these temperatures continue to stay warm. You know, 90% of excess greenhouse warming is literally stored and absorbed within our oceans and it's been apparent this week with temperatures over 100 degrees in some of those buoys on the southern side of Florida. Now, when we surfaced from under the water, we were about 30 feet deep taking these samples. This is the reaction from the scientists, again, these are top coral scientists have a listen.
