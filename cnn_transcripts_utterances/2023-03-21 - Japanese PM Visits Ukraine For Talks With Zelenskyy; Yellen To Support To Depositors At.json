President Xi eager too to push his 12-point proposal to address the Ukraine war largely dismissed. As you know by the West as a non-starter, the United States suggesting this visit provides, \"political cover\" for the conflict, some extraordinary images there. We will discuss the second meeting, Federal Emergency efforts to study the U.S. Regional Bank, First Republic including possible direct investments. It shares up some 23 percent pre market up, I said after losing almost half their value on Monday. Reports say the big banks spearheaded by JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and looking at boosting First Republic's capital. We're still in the world of banks saving each other it seems. And U.S. Officials also reportedly meeting to discuss how to ensure cash deposits above that $250,000 level until the financial turmoil passes also if it's going to be needed. We've been asking that now for a week and what whether that's what it's ultimately going to take to draw a line under this crisis. We'll discuss a little bit later on the show too. For now, take a look at U.S. futures and European stocks building on Monday's gains with banks. The outperformance Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will also be speaking later on today to bank executives. Her prepared statement reiterates that outflows of funds especially from these Regional Banks have slowed. The fingers crossed, that's enough, but as you can see a strong performance particularly across Europe. And one more meeting in our sights too, the U.S. Feds decision on Wednesday, on what to do about raising interest rates. Most investors are now expecting a quarter point hikes. But for me, it's more a question of will they hike versus should they inflation versus financial stability? It shouldn't be a compromise between those two things but recent events suggest otherwise. We'll discuss later this hour with the Former President of the New York Fed Bill Dudley. But first, the Kremlin rolling out the red carpet Russian President Vladimir Putin welcoming Chinese Leader Xi Jinping as they hold a second day of talks in Moscow the two leaders met for four hours on Monday to referring to each other as dear friend. Nic Robertson joins us now to discuss this. Nic, I think we have to talk about the visuals, first and foremost. And we were just showing that long walk there in that imposing room down the red carpet to the meeting of these two leaders. A vitally important moment, I think for President Putin to simply display President Xi in Moscow and the projection of the image that implies the support also implies.",

Security Council. So they would have the world believe that their vision of the future, a vision where autocracy is where, you know, President Xi has said that he thinks President Putin will get elected again next year. This is already extending into the third decade of leadership for President Putin where President Xi is arriving just 11 days, 10 or 11 days after he was given a third term as President of China. These are not men who believe in the value of democracy, but they say they uphold the values of international law, which were built coming out pretty much of the Second World War on the values of democracy. So this is a rebuff, it's a challenge, it's a visual statement to the West, to NATO, to the United States, to other members of the U.N. Security Council, United States, U.K., France. This is a challenge to their world order and their view. And this is really, where China in particular sees the importance of the relationship with Putin and sees a future of the world in its mold. And is beginning to reach out diplomatically more and more around the world we've seen in the Gulf recently, being becoming broker between Saudi Arabia and Iran. China's goals and limits are extensive and this is part of that picture.",

Even though Beijing claims that it is neutral in this conflict, even though Xi Jinping is currently embracing Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, and a suspected war criminal, according to the International Criminal Court as we speak. So there have been some contacts at lower levels. For example, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister spoke with his Chinese counterpart by phone last week. But the Ukrainians were saying they're still kind of in discussions to try to arrange some kind of a direct communication between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. Which then raises the question, if China does want to promote peace and some kind of dialogue in this horrific war that is now underway? How is it going to do that? If Xi Jinping has never had any communication with the leader of one of the two warring parties here, it does raise some serious questions.",

This is really about banks with large bases of uninsured deposits who've taken on interest rate risk. It's very well-known, well defined during the great financial crisis that was much more about, you know, the underlying housing boom and bust. And that putting a lot of stress on the banking system and that was exacerbated by the fact that it was very hard to value, a lot of the complex assets that banks and other financial intermediaries held. I think this situation is much more manageable than the great financial crisis, and I think it's going to have much less damage to the U.S. economy. But the Fed is in a bit of a bind. On one hand, they should keep typing because inflation is still too high, labor markets too tight. On the other hand, they want to basically make sure that they don't do anything that exacerbates the stress in the banking system and so that argues for pausing. So I think its very close call what they're going to do tomorrow. And there's not really a right solution, they could pause and signal that further rate hikes are likely once this situation gets stabilized, or they can hike 25 basis points, and make it very clear that they're very focused on what's going on in the banking system. Either option, that's completely reasonable one.",

So they can free up their ability to tackle inflation, I mean, at the end of the day, they still have an inflation problem.

Unlike other countries, where the banking system is more important, and these few Regional Banks that are really under stress only represent a few percentage points of the U.S. banking system. And the problem is not a credit problem. It's not a question of the banks having bad credit. But the problem is that they have lots of uninsured depositors and they have losses on their long asset holding. So I think this is manageable if the Fed can just calm things down.",

I do think where I would disagree where the markets are right now pricing and all these interest rate reductions in the second half of the year, and in 2024. I don't really see the basis for the Fed to be cutting interest rates. I think the economy is still very strong labor market, still very tight. And as long as this banking crisis is sort of contained, then I think the impact on the economy is going to be relatively minor. We're going to see growth in the first quarter of around 2.5 percent.

And I just wonder whether there's a way to sort of flip that, and you and I've had a discussion separately and are now and I want you to say on air, because I think it's important where you sort of make, rather than individuals have insurance or uninsured deposits.

It's available on ex-ante basis that Silicon Valley can access. So they don't fail in the first place. If they don't fail, then the contagion, you know, to other banks is, you know, minimal, and you can get life can go on. One thing you could potentially do is basically force banks to buy liquidity in short. Explicit liquidity insurance from the Fed, that would avoid the moral hazard problem of giving them something for free, they had to pay for it. And once they bought it, then everyone would know that they have the ability to go to bed and obtain funding, according to what they purchased. I mean, one of the problems the Fed has is the discount window, which is the Feds wonder of last resort facility is stigmatized. Banks don't like to use it, because they view that this is something that makes them look weak.

I think the real bottom line after domestic stability is that Moscow can't fail in this conflict from Beijing's perspective, that doesn't mean that Putin needs to win. But he can't fail in a way that would be calamitous for him, because the risk for China, if he does fail, is potential instability in Russia, and also just the sense that China has failed to some extent, as a partner for Russia. So I think the bottom line is at this point I don't think we're seeing a sense of urgency from China, which Putin is so close to failing in this conflict, that it would lead them to take risks for domestic stability.

Of course, the U.S. and the Europeans view that as an argument that just serves Russia's interests by kind of entrenching Russia's gains in this conflict. So I think in practical terms, it's going to be a non-starter. And that's I think, one reason why this proposal, and we'll have to see what China comes out with coming out of this meeting is unlikely to go very far.",

I just - Emmanuel Macron come to mind and the protests that we've seen in Paris as a result of the decisions he took to make changes with the age of retirement. He's burned political capital domestically. I just wonder whether there's anything that can take place here that perhaps in some way softens the minds of some of the Europeans?",

They don't believe Beijing fully understands how serious this conflict is for Europe. But from Beijing's perspective, they're seeing some of the strains in Europe right now, socially, economically. And I think part of this trip is to say, look, China's not going to deliver a peace agreement. But we are a part of this dynamic. We're a part of an eventual solution. And the reason why that's helpful to China is that they want to prevent Europe from a strong relationship with the U.S. in countering China. And so to show that China might be a constructive actor, at some point down the road, even on Ukraine, is a way of dissuading European Leaders from taking very aggressive actions towards China. For example, on Taiwan or technology controls, or other areas in which Washington is trying to strengthen the U.S. EU relationship, so there is clearly an element here that Beijing is targeting, you know, at Europe.",

It's related to hush money payments made by a former fixer Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Paula Reid is on the case for us. Paula, great to have you with us!

They also granted a defense request to put a witness in front of the grand jury. A grand jury that's prosecutors control that show but they granted this defense request to put a witness in front of the grand jurors to attack Michael Cohen's credibility. Again, these are things that are only typically done when you are planning to indict a defendant. We also don't know right now, though, is if the grand jury is going to hear from any more witnesses, and when if ever, they will vote to indict. If the Former President is indicted, the way that process works is that the indictment is filed under seal defense attorneys are notified that there has been an indictment but not necessarily the charges that have been filed. And then you negotiate an initial appearance in a self-surrender. I've spoken to sources on the Former President's legal team who told me he would surrender if he is charged. And that at this point, they don't expect that any sort of initial appearance would happen until at least next week. So right now we're waiting. And we're watching.
