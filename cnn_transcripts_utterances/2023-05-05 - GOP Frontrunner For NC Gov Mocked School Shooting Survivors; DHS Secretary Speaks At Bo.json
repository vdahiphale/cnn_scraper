He made a surprise appearance on the Mall near Buckingham Palace greeting the crowds of well-wishers and shaking hands. Britain is preparing to welcome its first new monarch in 70 years following the passing of Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II. And first lady, Jim Biden, is there to lead the U.S. delegation and representing the president, who will not be attending. Mrs. Biden. She began her three-day trip with a visit to 10 Downing Street, meeting with wife of the British prime minister. Later, she met with veterans and their families and the coronation fair hosted by a local primary school. Remember, CNN will carry tomorrow's coronation. Live coverage begins at 5:00 a.m. Eastern. Also, it is \"case closed\" for former North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn. He just pleaded guilty to bringing a loaded handgun through a TSA checkpoint. That is a third-degree misdemeanor charge. And it happened last year at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. The trial was supposed to begin today. His attorney says he was fined $250 without probation and police will return his firearm. And just as the summer travel season is set to begin, Yosemite had to shut down a major highway inside the park because of this giant crack in the road. It's about 200 feet long, up to four-feet deep. Officials say it even moved the road's serves a few inches vertically and horizontally and it is still moving. Repairs are under way and it could take to July to complete. Jim?",

The impact felt everywhere. In New York, for example, the FAA is warning summer travel delays in the city's three main airports to rise by 45 percent. Meanwhile, on the runway, you may have noticed, we have seen several near misses. At least seven close calls this year alone. Joining me to discuss this -- oh, stand by.

We'll continue, of course, to monitor the situation. We do have reporters on the border. I want to turn back to another member of the cabinet, and that is the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg.

We just got a report to Congress laying that out, controllers in training and a number eligible to retire.To get the numbers where they need to be, we are hiring right now. There is an application window open this week. And I encourage anybody who is interested in a career that, by the way, is not just meaningful and purposeful, but also pays quite well, to consider applying. Let me also say this is yet another example of what is at stake in the question of what our budget is going to be next year. The House Republican plan just passed through the House, if that were to become law, that would stop us completely from hiring air traffic controllers. And this is no time to do that. You know, we've seen a lot of improvements in terms of air service this year. The last four months, cancellations below 2 percent. But if you stop us completely from being able to hire and train air traffic controllers, there's no way we can guarantee to continue delivering results, which, of course, we have. And we've been working very hard and this would make it that much harder.",

This is nothing we can't prepare for going into this summer.But this is part of why we're working so hard to train new air traffic controllers. We got 1,500 who came in, in the last cohort for this year. The president's budget has the resources to bring another 1,800 onboard. But if the House Republican budget were to pass, we would be completely stuck. We would have to stop training at exactly the moment when we needed to do even more and not less.

And part of what I expect will happen when the president hosts Speaker McCarthy at the White House next week.Budgets are negotiable. That's a normal process. Whether America pays its bills is not. It's absolutely appropriate to negotiate on the details of what the budget will look like. It is absolutely not appropriate to negotiate over whether to destroy the American economy. That is what Republicans have -- in the House, have threatened with this debt ceiling fight. Let's take default off the table. In 200 years, the U.S. has never defaulted on its debts. That's not a negotiation over how much debt to take on. It's the equivalent of deciding whether to pay your mortgage bill when it comes in the mail. The U.S. always pays its bills.

And it would also stop us from modernizing the computer system that gave us so much trouble and earlier this year, the air systems mission. We need to understand at a higher level of detail.
