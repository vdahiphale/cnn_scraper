You've been watching CNN'scontinuing coverage of the federal charges against former U.S. president, Donald Trump. More on that this hour. Let's get you today's other news at this point as well. And as CNN watches and listens for signs of Ukraine's long-awaited counteroffensive, we are hearing from the country's deputy defense minister. She says the frontline in eastern Ukraine is still the epicenter of the battle where, quote, \"heavy fighting continues.\" This comes as Kyiv accuses Russian forces of shelling flooded areas in Kherson including evacuation points. Thousands of people have been fleeing floodwaters unleashed by the catastrophic collapse of a major dam in southern Ukraine. We're told water levels there are now starting to recede. Fully broken dam along with support for Ukraine played a big part in Oval Office talks between U.S. president Joe Biden and the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak. Moments after Thursday's meeting at the White House, Mr. Sunak sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN. Here's what he had to say about that dam breach. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The message militarily is one about interoperability, that speaking with the German commander who's heading this whole 10-day exercise, and he said, look, this is to prove to ourselves, to our public that we can react quickly. That we can train together and be an effective military deterrent right up to the red line of NATO's border. Clearly with that image of Russia being beyond that border, and Russia being the biggest potential aggressors there, but in military terms, it's about training and it's about getting their air force pilots and all the support staff that go with them to be in lockstep, to have that quick response to be able to defend NATO territory. But if you look beyond that, diplomatically, yes, there are diplomats around all of this from the NATO nations that say very clearly this is something that is so big, 250 different aircraft involved, 190 of them at least fighter jets. 10,000 air force personnel involved. All of these coming from 25 different nations. This is a message that all world leaders including President Putin will see so he is going to see this, and he is going to understand, you know, the F- 16 fighter jets are lined up behind me here, all part of this training exercise here in these exactly similar to the F-16s and the Ukrainian fighter pilots are training in today and will be bringing in to the battle space in Ukraine, expected at least by the end of this year -- Becky.",

He visited those victims in hospital, said that everything he'd heard and seen of them suggested that their health was heading in the right direction, so that was good news. But it was also the opportunity for him to thank personally a man who's become a hero here in France ever since the attacks. When you look at the amateur footage that was shot during the park yesterday, you can clearly see a man carrying a backpack, at one point trying to stop the assailant, even as he tries to dodge his knife. He's become a hero. An overnight sensation. Of course the French media flocked to meet him. He's become the backpack hero, and Emmanuel Macron had the opportunity to meet him and to thank him for what he's done. It turns out he's a young student on a pilgrimage of cathedrals here in France who happened upon this horrific attack, did what he could to save whoever he could, try to stop the man from acting, and asked Emmanuel Macron whether he might be invited to the inauguration of the Notre Dame when it opens next year, to which Emmanuel Macron replied that he would be taking care of it personally. So it was quite a moving moment for a lot of people watching this, and of course the good news that these children appear to be on the mend or at least in a stable condition. Of course, that was what everyone was worried about. What we know also, of course, Becky, is that that Syrian national, a Christian Syrian asylum claimant in Sweden is in custody. 31-year-old. We wait to hear more about the investigation as to why he acted the way he did, the motives that may have been behind his attack of course. No suggestion that there was any terror link since the investigations often sees by those authorities -- Becky.",

To eavesdrop on signal communications in the United States, telephone calls, any kind of communications they could essentially suck up and use to understand what was happening in American society and with the American government. There has been a Russian ship over the years that I have seen. It comes very near our office here, that is well as spy ship. And so the Cubans have let that spy ship in the Cuban waters, and so it's remains to be seen if this base will actually be built here, but at the moment, you know, all the governments involved in this angrily denying it. And the Cuban government saying yesterday the only base with foreign troops on Cuban soil is the U.S. base at -- the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo which they very much want to leave Cuba. So for the moment everyone, Becky, saying this is not true. Sources saying otherwise. I think this will be one that we will continue to cover for a while.",

A former U.S. president has been indicted on federal charges. Donald Trump's lawyer says he faces seven counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office. They include violations of the Espionage Act, conspiracy, obstruction and making false statements. Trump and his aides are said to be, and I quote here, \"jacked up\" by the indictment, not ready to fight it beginning next week when he is expected to appear in a federal court in Miami. Remember this is federal stuff. This isn't state stuff as we've seen before. This is federal stuff. We're looking at key questions surrounding this indictment. What makes it different than other criminal cases that Donald Trump has faced? How does it compare to legal problems faced by other past U.S. presidents? And what impact will it or could it have on next year's presidential election in the U.S.? We'll break it down for you starting with Paula Reid in Washington, who Paula has exclusive CNN reporting on an audio tape that could prove damaging to Trump's defense. Explain.",

      "sentences": "This is a bombshell audio recording that CNN broke news of last week. It's in the possession ofprosecutors. We now have a transcript of exactly what was said. Now after we reported last week on this recording, the former president claims that he has classified information and also acknowledges the limits of his ability to declassify it. And we know in this meeting, he is in a room in his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, where several people including aides and two people working on an autobiography for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. But I want to emphasize, he knew he was being recorded. His aides were recording him as they were recording all conversations with anyone working on a book. And here is what he said. At the time he was very upset about a magazine article that had just come out about General Mark Milley, comments that were made about the former president's feelings and plans regarding Iran. He objected to what Milley said. He says, quote, \"Well, with Milley, let me see that. I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't that amazing? \"I have a pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. This was him. They presented me this. This is off the record, but they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. We looked at some, this was him. This wasn't done by me. This was done by him.\" Now, I'm going to stop for a second. He says this was him about four times, clearly referring to Milley while talking to the group of people in the room. He goes on to say, \"All sorts of stuff, pages long. Look, wait a minute, let's see here. I just found, isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, except it is like highly confidential. Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this.\" So here he is referring to this information being confidential, also referring to it being secret. Those are two different levels of classification here in the United States, but he's also saying, look, look, urging other people in the room who we know don't have security clearances to look at this sensitive material. Then the key quote is that he asks if he can declassify this, he says as president I could've declassified, but now I can't, acknowledging the limits of his ability to declassify. So this is so damning, so key for prosecutors, because here he is acknowledging in his own words on a recording he knew was being made that he had sensitive information, that he had retained it, and he did not have the power to declassify it. He also appears to be at least attempting to share it with other people in the room.",
