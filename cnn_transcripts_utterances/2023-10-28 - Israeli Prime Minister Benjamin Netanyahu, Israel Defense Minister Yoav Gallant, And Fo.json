He's talking about the soldiers that are going in, as you heard, in that ground incursion, as well as the civilians, potentially, as this fight goes on and on. And he said, look, you're going to have to be patient, you're going to have to be patient, because this is going to go on for a long time. It's about the operations, it is not about the time.

And that while we will listen to, quote, our friend, unquote, we will do what is right for and by us. And I think that was an effort to sort of navigate between the advice that the administration is providing and Israeli goals and objectives. The only clock is the operational clock means basically that Israelis will take -- they won't be rushed, and this is going to be, as Gallant said, a war of phases with no single necessarily winning phase, but a collection of phases to destroy, and he reaffirmed it again, to destroy Hamas' capacity to govern and its military capabilities.",

And we have heard already previously from the Israeli prime minister and other Israeli leaders, they have noted the fact that October 7th was the deadliest day for Jews since the holocaust, and that is very much a sentiment that was echoed throughout Israel over these last three weeks as this country has really been stocked by the violence and the brutality and also the surprise nature of that sophisticated attack that Hamas carried out, sophisticated, of course, in terms of the planning of the attack that they were able to carry out.What I also think is interesting is the extent to which this issue of the hostages was very much hanging over this moment. And all of these three leaders took pains to make clear that even as this ground operation expands, it will not be at the expense of trying to free the hostages. You have Gallant, the defense minister, in fact said that he believed it would strengthen Israel's hand at the negotiating table in order to get Hamas to release some of those hostages. Whether or not that is actually the case is an entirely different matter. But that just speaks to the politics of this moment inside of Israel as well. The Israeli prime minister made these remarks just hours after he sat down with the families of hostages who are currently being held inside of Gaza. And so it is a balancing act that he really has to try and manage as he tries to not only maintain support in Israel for this ground operation, but also make clear that he is not forgetting about those hostages, who we need to be clear, Wolf, are at much greater risk because of the intensification of these operations. The Israeli military has been targeting those tunnels under Gaza, and we know that most, if not all of those hostages, are being held in those tunnels as well.",

So, after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today.

Now, the one thing I must point out here is just how far we have come to look at where we were in 2016 versus where we are now. Pence was brought on to Trump's campaign as vice president essentially to secure the votes of the Republican establishment, of those evangelical voters. Now flash forward to this election two cycles later, and there is no room for Mike Pence in the Republican Party. He has essentially been cast to the side. Now, of course, it will be a big question to see if he comes out and supports one of these other 2024 GOP contenders, unclear at this point. But this is really a remarkable moment, having him suspend his career here. And I will note to you, I saw some of his top advisers in the room here, I was wondering why they had decided to come to this event on a Saturday. Now, obviously, that is clear.

We're hearing from the United Nations, from many members of the international community and aid agencies, who are calling for an immediate ceasefire, a humanitarian pause, because they fear, they say, that this is going to deteriorate to unimaginable suffering inside Gaza.And we have to mention, Wolf, we don't really know the real extent of the crisis right now in Gaza because very little information is trickling out, very little pictures are coming out of Gaza because of the near communications blackout that started more than 24 hours ago right now. You have some people who have got international phone lines who are still able to get some of that information, some of those images out. But they're already telling us that they are starting to lose connectivity, the Internet is getting weaker and weaker. And the impact of that communications disruption that is going on there, Wolf, we cannot even begin to imagine what it has done on the ground to the first responders, the emergency services, the ambulances. We are hearing that they were not able, after the night of the most intense bombardment in Gaza since the start of the war, to try to reach those who need them the most, to coordinate, to communicate with each other. Accounts coming from a journalist on the ground telling us that people had to carry their injured, have to put them on carts and push them to these overwhelmed hospitals that are on the verge of collapse. And people inside Gaza, Wolf, are unable to reach their loved ones. They don't know if they survived the bombardment last night, an absolutely devastating situation. And even before this intensification that we're seeing right now, people in Gaza, Wolf, were telling us that they have gotten to a point where it's no longer a case of if they survive. They have now -- they've gone to a point where it is how are they going to die and when are they going to die. Mothers telling us that they were praying that if they die, they die together with their children so they don't end up injured on their own in hospitals. Israel says it is targeting Hamas, it doesn't target civilians, that it is Hamas that is using people as human shields. But Wolf, as you know, the reality on the ground, this is one of the most densely populated places in the world, a besieged territory where you have more than 2 million people, about half of them children.

Who nurses him, who gives him hugs? I mean, this is insane. This cannot be. We know about Abigail (ph), three years of age, and her parents were brutally murdered in front of her. And she managed to escape and probably the neighbors took her, and they all were taken hostages together.
