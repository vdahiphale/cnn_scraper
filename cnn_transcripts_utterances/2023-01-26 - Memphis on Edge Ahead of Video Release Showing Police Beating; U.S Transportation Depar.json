He wants consumer advocacy here because passengers have dealt with so many cancelations and delays, not only in 2022 but also in 2021, and the big question now is whether or not airlines recovering from the pandemic have simply overexerted themselves and they can handle all the people who want to fly again.",

Sources describe them as briefing binders prepared for Pence's foreign trips. Sometimes these binders simply include basic biographical information on foreign leaders. But sometimes they have more sensitive information.CNN is told that the papers may just have been overlooked as they would not have been visible unless the packers went through the binders page by page. Well, today, President Biden will try to leave the classified documents scandal in the rearview mirror here by giving his first major economic speech of the year. CNN's M.J. Lee live at the White House with more. M.J., good morning to you. Is this all one big move to distract from the documents scandal? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Don, as you said, this is a speech that the White House is building the president's first major economic speech of the year. And, frankly, it is probably one of the topics that the White House wishes that the president could be talking about more. We know that in large part this will sound sort of like a victory lap speech. He wants to be talking about, according to officials, things like jobs growth under his watch, low unemployment rate, the fact that wages are up, the fact inflation does appears to be finally moderating some. And we also know that he intends to take on House Republicans in particular as the White House tries to continue making that contrast between the Democratic economic agenda and what House Republicans are wanting to do. We have to, of course, point out that the political environment for President Biden now for the next two years is incredibly different on Capitol Hill now that Republicans do control the House. In order to get anything done, it is important that Democrats at least work with some of the House Republicans. And the first big test of this that we are about to see is over the debt ceiling. House Republicans have made really clear that what they need in return to raise the debt ceiling are deep spending cuts. And, of course, the White House has said we are absolutely not negotiating. So, it is about to be crunch time come a couple of months because, remember, the Treasury Department has said that they probably have only until about early June or so for these so-called extraordinary measures to make sure that the government is preventing itself from defaulting, essentially. So, this will be a major speech but, of course, the White House trying to turn back to some of these bread and butter issues because the last few weeks they have been distracted by the classified documents issue, Don.",
