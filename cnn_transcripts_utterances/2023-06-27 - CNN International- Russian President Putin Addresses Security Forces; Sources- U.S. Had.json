I think you were also right to say that the messaging right now is very important for Vladimir Putin. Obviously, trying to show that he's in charge, that there is unity, but also trying to show, Max, that he believes in the Russian security services.And, you know, certainly the main thing that we picked upon in that speech is what you've been pointing out, that Vladimir Putin praised the security forces, but at the same time also said that they prevented, as he put it, de facto, a civil war. Let's listen into what Vladimir Putin had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): You defended the Constitution, the lives, the security, and the freedom of our citizens. You saved our homeland from being shaken up. In actual fact, you stopped a civil war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "\"You stopped a civil war\", as he put it there. And I think if you put that in context, it becomes even more important, the words of Vladimir Putin, because one of the things that we have seen since Yevgeny Prigozhin turned back that convoy and since it was clear that he was going to go into an exile de facto in Belarus, is that Yevgeny Prigozhin is not quiet.He came out with an audio message, very long one yesterday, saying that if he had wanted to, he could have gone to Moscow. He said they were blocking air bases, that they were blocking military bases, and that he felt that he had the population behind him. So this is clearly some counter messaging coming from Vladimir Putin. And, of course, we saw that last night, Max, when Vladimir Putin, you know, gave a five-minute address to the Russian nation saying they could have put down any sort of uprising anyway, and that it was important for them to not spill blood of Russians -- on Russians. But then also afterwards, we saw Vladimir Putin with his larger security Cabinet. The heads of the security forces right now, obviously, trying to portray that picture of someone who clearly has the reins and who clearly is in charge. And, you know, you mentioned Alexander Lukashenko as well. He's probably the biggest winner in all of this, receiving praise from Vladimir Putin, receiving praise from the Kremlin for essentially brokering that agreement, which led to Yevgeny Prigozhin calling back his forces. And you're absolutely right, he came out earlier today. He says he doesn't want to be called a hero, as he put it. He said it was painful to watch. But, you know, one of the things that we picked up on there as well, which I think goes to show just how concerned Lukashenko and probably Putin was as well with all the things that were unfolding, is that Lukashenko, quite frankly, said that he put his security forces, the military and police on combat alert that day. And so that certainly goes to show that this was a serious situation. And, of course, that also reflected in the fact that Vladimir Putin said that the security forces, as he put it, prevented potentially a civil war. Max?",

According to several sources, U.S. intelligence officials had gathered a detailed picture of Prigozhin's plans leading up to his revolt. The sources tell CNN the U.S. knew how and where bargainer troops were planning to advance, but not when. This Intel was so important. The sources say that it was shared with only the closest of allies, like the U.K., for example. Let's get the very latest from Arlette Saenz in Washington. Very sensitive this, isn't it, because the Americans don't want to be seen to be getting involved in this, but they clearly knew what was happening.",

In his nightly address, he said his troops were advancing in all directions along the frontlines in the east and the south. His comments followed his visit to the Donetsk region in Zaporizhzhia, where he met with generals and awarded some of his fighters. Now all eyes are on Mr. Zelenskyy to see if and how he capitalizes on this weekend's internal strife in Russia. Nick Paton Walsh analyzing all of that from Kyiv. What sort of progress? Obviously, it's quite widespread progress, looking at the map that we just showed, but is it deep? NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: In lots of areas, but incremental, I think it's fair to say, at this stage. Now, obviously, there's not always transparency about Ukrainian military advances. They keep a lot of that quiet, and often what you do hear about is on a significant time delay. But at the moment, yes, it's true to say that in the west of the front lines of the Antonovsky Bridge, there's Ukrainian claims backed up by some video advances over a bridge there, which potentially gives them a new front heading in from the west towards the territory north of Crimea. In the Far East, progress around Bakhmut, and then suggestions too, of weaknesses owing to the withdrawal of Chechen troops further to the south of that, and then claims that Rivnopil has, in fact, been taken down in the south and the Zaporizhzhia area. All of this incremental at this stage. But Volodymyr Zelenskyy talking about how there was progress in all directions. And we simply don't know whether this is part of the continued incremental pressure which we've been seeing from Ukraine over the past weeks, or whether the traumatic and chaotic events for Moscow's top brass over the weekend has led to disarray in their command and a lack of morale on the front lines. It's important to point out, Max, that a lot of soldiers in the Russian trenches don't have smartphones deliberately prevented from contact, often from the outside world, partly because their phone signals give away their position sometimes.

Prigozhin didn't get a name check during that, but very clearly, the target of Vladimir Putin's comments about how many north of $80 billion, given -- sorry, 80 billion rubles given to that particular group.It pains to point out how all their financing had originally come from the state. And I think that is a bid in front of those soldiers there to talk about Yevgeny Prigozhin without mentioning his name, as somebody who took a lot of money from the state and potentially benefited from those contracts. So details there from the Kremlin head trying to build a case, possibly without mentioning Yevgeny Prigozhin byname again, but mentioning his company, Concord. And it's interesting there to see the former sponsor, the paymaster of Prigozhin laying out a case of how that money essentially would have at some point allowed Prigozhin to aggrandize himself to the point where he chose to march on Moscow. All that Putin would sort of point to the long history that Prigozhin has of being financed by the state as perhaps a way of trying to undermine essentially what he did in the latter stages of their amicable relationship. Part of a series of appearances that we're seeing today from Vladimir Putin, where after two and a half days of, frankly, going MIA while this coup played out and a deal emerged on late Saturday to this attempted coup, I should say, this deal on late Saturday emerged to finally reestablish a narrative and provide Kremlin's context for what happened. But a lot of this seems to sort of gaslight the events of the weekend and try and suggest that soldiers who really did not appear on the ground to offer much opposition were somehow all working together to maintain the Kremlin head's position.

All of the Wagner fighters have to, by this weekend, make a choice -- go to Belarus with Prigozhin, go back home, or sign a Russian military contract. So Putin is putting a loyalty test out there and telling them, you know, are you with me? Are you with the state?
