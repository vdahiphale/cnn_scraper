Sixty-five mile per hour winds. It's still a tropical storm. It will bring hurricane conditions to western Cuba today. This is important. It started to move in a northerly direction. That is completely different than what it did over the past 36 hours. Now, this storm is going to run basically parallel with the Florida Gulf Coast. And this is important because any deviation to the left or any deviation to the right can have major implications on places like Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Cedar Key, Tampa Bay as well. And it is not lost on me that putting a category 3 major hurricane upon arrival and what that means for the Florida coastline here. So, we remember what happened with Ian. Look at this, seven to 11 feet. Right along that big bend there. That's the storm surge forecast. And I want you to see this as well. Look at the wind and the direction of that wind. That is going to push all of the water, very shallow water, across the eastern sections of the Gulf of Mexico. That is why storm surge, the wind threat here potential for 110-mile-per-hour or higher across the big bend. And then, check that out, rainfall will lead to flash flooding as well.

What -- who is he trying to get -- just get attention or is he trying to get voters using this kind of trash? JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST AND ANCHOR: Both. Primarily attention. But the idea that reverse racism is the real racism is something that presumably plays to the base. And, look, you've got to separate this out, right? The - your point you're making about any comparison to the KKK, let alone to a black female congresswoman. KKK is a terrorist organization. It was a terrorist organization. At its inception, when former confederal veterans got together in December of 1865 and used violence and voter intimidation to try to push back the gains that were on paper in the Constitution.

Each day of the Biden/Harris administration we continue the march forward.\"Joining us now, global human rights leader and son of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Martin Luther King III. Sir, thanks so much for taking the time on this incredibly important day, on this anniversary, but also in the wake of what we saw just this weekend in Jacksonville, Florida. And I think these types of moments underscore the fact that the job isn't finished, the dream hasn't been fulfilled. And I wonder how you think of moments like today, where you look back at such history and yet still see so many problems. MARTIN LUTHER KING III, SON OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Well, maybe it says -- and thank you for the opportunity to share on this day as we observe this anniversary. Maybe it says that we, in a sense, continue history, and yet somehow we have to move forward. I must first say to the victims, the family members who have lost loved ones, that my condolences I send to them. But there's something wrong with the nation where this continues to happen over and over again. If you remember in 1963, about three weeks after the March on Washington, four little girls lost their lives in the 16th Street Baptist church because of bombing. Every time there seems to be a sense of a forward movement, there's always the inevitable setback. The fact of the matter is, hate is being promoted in this country and we've got to change that and we got to do something about it now. Not tomorrow, not next week, but now.",

That's what I'm dedicated toward, building coalitions to say, America is better than it is acting at this time. We have an opportunity and we must -- we got to learn non-violence also. We've accepted a culture of violence. We must create a culture of non-violence. That makes us a better nation. Darkness will never put out darkness. Only light can do that.

And the one most important step we can take is that short step to the ballot box.The second thing is, we got to do some more about hate crimes and hatred that is being spewed. Whether it is figuring out how do we address what the internet does, there's got to be a constructive way to do that.
