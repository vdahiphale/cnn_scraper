And I think it's also quite telling to see what Vladimir Putin has been doing on this evening. In fact, he would have said a ceremony in the city of Kursk, which of course is in southern Russia tonight, where held a moment of silence. But that had absolutely nothing to do with Yevgeny Prigozhin. That was a moment of silence for fallen Soviet soldiers of World War II.Putin not saying anything yet about the crash, not saying anything about the investigation. We've also been in touch with some pro- Kremlin figures, including a former advisor of Vladimir Putin who was also quite close to the Wagner private military company, anti (ph) Yevgeny Prigozhin. He's sort of pushing that narrative, saying that they believe that Ukraine might have actually been behind all this, saying, look, it is Ukrainian independence, and they point to some other assassinations that the Russians have pointed towards the Ukrainians, even though the Ukrainians have not acknowledged. Again, none of this is confirmed or is in any way possible to confirm at this point in time. But if we're looking at the coverage of Russian state media and of course, also by Russian authorities as well, they are saying that the investigation is ongoing. They've, of course, come out and said that Yevgeny Prigozhin was definitely on that plane, as were large parts of Wagner's leadership. And of course, one of the things, Wolf, that we also have to point out is that this is de facto, a total decapitation of Wagner's leadership, as it had been before that mutiny took place. We looked especially at Dmitry Utkin who was on there -- Prigozhin's military commander, and also the man who gave Wagner his name, who came up with that name in the first place. So, it looks as though a whole new Wagner might be emerging. Certainly people that I'm speaking to in Russia are telling me, Wolf, that Wagner will continue under new leadership, Wolf.",

The flash of a missile, the flash of an explosion in the air that would determine whether this was an explosion that originated from inside the plane or that there was a missile that launched prior to this plane coming down and where a missile launched from, whether from the air or somewhere else. I was at DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, in the same room where they did exactly the same thing following the Russian shoot down of MH-17, they looked at that data and were able to determine it was a Russian missile fired from Russian controlled territory. They are almost certain to be in a similar room right now looking at similar data, which would give them an indication, was this an explosion from inside the plane? Was there an explosion? Was there an explosion or a flash from a missile launch prior either from the air or the ground elsewhere that would then help determine what kind of weapon took this down, if it was a weapon, and where it was fired from.",

But I also would not rule out, as incredulous as this sounds, an accident, even if it's a missile that was shot at this plane. We know that Russian air defense right now is very jumpy, could have been that if Prigozhin was indeed flying to see Putin, as some reports have suggested, maybe the air defenses around Putin's residents were not aware of that flight path and were shooting it down.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, as Dmitri noted, we may never get a specific answer as to why this happened now and who called for it and who was behind it. Russia has a history of being the birthplace of conspiracy theories, and I think they've all started circulating as well. But there is no denying the fact that many were puzzled in the sense that this man who had conducted a failed mutiny, the biggest threat to Vladimir Putin's reign in two decades, was wandering freely between countries and popping up online on social media and flying on his private jets around the world. And so, there was confusion in terms of why Putin didn't react sooner. Intelligence suggests that he was really paralyzed the first 24 hours as this mutiny was happening. Perhaps there had been indication that it was coming, and yet there was no preparation. And now here we are, two months later.It was surprising to see this news, but also, at the same time, not that surprising, because I think, given that the two months had gone by, Putin, if this was in fact led and directed by the Kremlin, I would imagine didn't want to look like they panicked and didn't want to make a murder out of somebody whose popularity only increased after the failed mutiny. It seems that things have quieted down on that front. A new poll out of Russia, one of the only independent polls, though they're still very difficult to trust, shows that only 20 percent of Russians are following this war on a daily basis. That's the lowest level since the war began. And perhaps this was a good time to finally come to some sort of conclusion with Prigozhin. And given that he can't be controlled, necessarily, you do have a, quote unquote, \"election,\" presidential election coming up in Russia in March of next year. So, this could have been timely as well.",

And this may very well be what we're seeing take place right now if it is established that Russia took down Prigozhin's jet, but also this gentleman who's been removed from his post and others whose stars have fallen in the wake of that coup.

And the judge said there just isn't law here to avoid the arrest, to put on hold the state proceedings of this criminal case for Mark Meadows or for another top Trump administration official, Jeffrey Clark, in the Justice Department who had tried to do the same thing. So this judge is making quite a signal here that they need to get on the plane, both of them, if they have not, if they want to avoid being arrested, they are going to have to get to Georgia and go through the same process as the rest of the defendants in this case, as Donald Trump plans to do as well.Trump, notably, hadn't asked for the protections that these guys in his administration had by trying to move the case to the federal judge so that the judge would have it fully very immediately. Trump hasn't done any of those legal procedural maneuvers yet, but we are thinking that he may at some point. It is something that he could try, but this is something that really gears us up for a lot of drama over the coming days not just with Donald Trump coming town in Atlanta, but also with Mark Meadows and Jeffrey Clark, two very well-known figures in Washington needing to arrive here. And at the same time, gearing up for a hearing on what happens to their cases, as well as they've been making these legal arguments of having protections from the constitution because they were administration officials. That hearing now is set for Monday. And we know just from what's been in the court system that the District Attorney's office is gearing up for it too. They want to bring in witnesses who had heard that call to the Secretary of State in Georgia that Donald Trump made after the election asking to find votes. And so they're going to be going town telling the story of this case in court on Monday, very likely.

Russia claiming the Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash today, as well as the surrender of former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani at the Fulton County Jail in Georgia. Both of which could come up during tonight's highly anticipated first debate among the Republican presidential candidates.I want to discuss this and more with the former Republican Maryland governor, Larry Hogan. Governor, thanks for joining us. As you well know, there's a growing divide among Republicans about supporting Ukraine's efforts to combat Russia's invasion. How do you think the death of Prigozhin should impact the candidate's views toward Russia? LARRY HOGAN (R), FORMER GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND: Well, that's a great question, Wolf. I mean, I happen to be someone who thinks that we ought to be supporting Ukraine and standing up to Putin. There are a number of people on that stage that don't agree with that position. But I'm sure this question is going to come up tonight, and hopefully we'll get a chance to hear the positions of these various candidates. It'll give them an opportunity to explain themselves.",

This debate is also happening as Donald Trump is set to turn himself into the Fulton County Jail tomorrow, and as his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, did the same thing earlier today. What's your reaction, Governor, to that? And what does it say about the Republican Party that Trump is still the very dominant frontrunner right now?",

And yet he's the weakest possible candidate that we could put up for the general election. And, you know, there's no getting around that. But tonight is actually the real start of this election campaign.And I believe, I'm hopeful that some of these candidates will have a chance to get America to know them, to hear about what they're all about, instead of it being completely focused on Trump. But it's -- he's the 800 pound gorilla. He sucks all the oxygen out of the room. And as you and I are doing right now, we have this big debate. It's very important. I hope people will tune in, and all we're talking about is Donald Trump and his problems, and that's what these candidates are going to have to overcome.",

Trump won't be there tonight, but do you expect the candidates to challenge him during the debate tonight?",
