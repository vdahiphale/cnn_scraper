      "sentences": "Well, good morning to you. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.Our breaking news coverage on the deadly attack in the New Orleans continues this hour. The FBI is investigating the deadly incident on Bourbon Street as an act of terrorism. Police say at least 10 people were killed and 35 others injured when a man drove a pickup truck into a crowd early this morning. And you can see in this video, multiple officers running towards the scene as soon as they get the call. Right here. According to the New Orleans Police Chief, the driver was hell-bent on causing carnage. One witness said he was in a bar when people ran in, saying it looked like the driver was going 60 miles per hour on Bourbon Street. Just imagine that, a driver in a pickup truck weighing 4,000 to 6,000 pounds going 60 miles per hour in a crowded street, just running over people. The suspect has been confirmed dead. Investigators have been looking into these possible improvised explosive devices at the scene as well. And last hour, I spoke to Congressman Troy Carter who represents the area about what he's hearing from officials. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TROY CARTER (D-LA):  They appear to be a lone actor at this point. Yet, we are being very cautious to make sure that we are exploring and investigating every point to make sure that the villain that has been taken down by police officers that he was in fact alone in his actions and securing the area to make sure that any other bombs or information or threats have been detonated. You may have seen bombs that have gone off in other parts of the quarter. Those were detonated by law enforcement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we know with the Sugar Bowl being played, the Super Bowl is going to be played there later on this year. A lot has been put into getting this ready for people to be out there on that street.And of course, the description of people driving around that barricade and him being dead set on hitting people is just so troubling to hear. We have some video that we'll show you. We blurred some of the images because it's so difficult to look at of some of the carnage that was left behind. And when you did that interview last hour, when you're talking to that witness, it was so hard to listen to him describe all of the all the bodies that were left behind, and people who are in obvious pain or who could not be helped. Take a listen to this eyewitness who just talked to one of our affiliates a short time ago about the description of the pain and the carnage that was left behind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) I saw lots of fireworks and then I laid down and I was watching them from my bed and I heard, maybe they were going off for quite some time. They didn't stop it at midnight. So, I thought maybe it was like the final, whatever you call it, the grand finale. It was just loud, something really loud. And then, I heard more fireworks. I don't know what it was, but apparently it wasn't fireworks. It was right outside our window. I don't know why. I guess I should expect it these days, but it's sad. Very sad. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We also know investigators are looking into just where this truck came from. And of course, there's video circulating of officers surrounding a white truck out there. We have not confirmed all this video right now. We know that news conference is within the next hour. We're hoping to get more information then. But then, you have the officers who were also shot. We know two of them are in stable condition right now at the hospital. Haven't got an update about whether or not they were able to return fire to the suspect. But so many questions so shortly after this, but a lot of people talking about they will never forget the images of what happened out there because it was so painful to watch and experience. Pamela. [11:05:00] BROWN:  Yes, I just keep thinking about that eyewitness I spoke to in the last hour. We're going -- to run that sound very soon because he unfortunately saw what happened just before in the aftermath. Paula, what more do we know about this suspect?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, law enforcement officials say they believe this suspect acted intentionally. Now, in addition to that one suspect who was killed at the scene, they're also looking at any other associates or anyone else who may have been involved in this. That's a standard step in any investigation of this kind.We've learned that they're specifically looking into any possible connections the suspect may have had to the State of Texas. We know from officials that they do have the license plate number for this vehicle. So, that's going to be a key piece of evidence as they continue to pursue any additional leads. Now, the FBI is heading up this investigation, and they have noted that this is now being looked at as an act of terrorism. In a statement, they said, quote, \"This morning, an individual drove a car into a crowd of people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing a number of people and injuring dozens of others. The subject then engaged with local law enforcement and is now deceased. The FBI is the lead investigative agency, and we are working with our partners to investigate this as an act of terrorism.\" Now, earlier today, there were some conflicting messages from various law enforcement agencies about whether this was or was not terrorism. When it comes to the FBI, they look for certain factors before they give it that label. So, that just has to do with sort of technicalities. We, of course, heard from lawmakers and other officials who say, of course, that this was terrorism. But when it comes to the FBI officially putting that in a statement, that is significant because they look for certain criteria before making that declaration. Now, Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on this incident in a statement. He said, quote, \"My heart is broken for those who began their year by learning people they love were killed in this horrific attack, and my prayers are with the dozens who were injured, including the New Orleans Police Department officers who risked their lives to save others.\" Now, the FBI is sending resources to New Orleans, including evidence teams from Quantico, Virginia, which of course helped them review some of the evidence they've gathered to maybe get more information about exactly what happened here.",

This is also likely one of the factors that contributed to the FBI designating this as a terrorism investigation. So, that's something we're definitely going to be looking at in the next briefing that they have to see if they have any additional information about that because it really adds a whole another dimension to this attack.",

      "sentences": "All right. Thank you so much, Ryan Young and Paula Reid. Appreciate it. Let's bring in CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem and former NYPD Lieutenant Darrin Porcher.First to you, Juliette, I just want to go back to the timeline here. You know, most revelers were out in this area at midnight, right, celebrating the New Year. This event happened at 3:15 in the morning and there were many, many casualties, 10 dead, more than 30 injured. The barriers, we keep showing this because I'm just struck by this, were -- appears to be those flimsy orange and white barriers according to the eyewitness and according to video that we have. What do you make of all this? What are the big questions you have?",

    {
      "timeStamp": "11:10:00",
      "speaker": "BROWN",
      "sentences": "Of course. And to bring you in on that, Darrin, as someone who's been with the NYPD, tell us a little bit about your experience in that regard, providing security for these, you know, big events and what it is like in the overnight hours and what typically happens as we try to learn more. And also, the suspect. I was just told by this Louisiana congressman, that he was likely a lone actor from the area and had Texas license plates. What can we glean from all of this? DARRIN PORCHER, FORMER NYPD LIEUTENANTTraditionally, in a place like New York, and I give you an example, Times Square, you would have these large, robust, concrete barriers coupled with even sanitation vehicles to ensure that you wouldn't have a vehicle that it would have the ability to penetrate that area, that corner where Bourbon Street is where you have the revelers that will be participating in New Year's Eve, or I should say New Year's Day because this was after 12:00 p.m., New Year's Day celebrations. So, you -- it's very important that you substitute your -- the accommodations appropriately. And that unfortunately that didn't happen. One of the things that people make mention to when you have these large demonstrations -- or I should say large celebrations is drone traffic. If you had some drones up, it would probably been able to identify or preempt that there was a potential for a vehicle that was speeding towards the crowd. We mentioned these lone wolf attacks. These are some of the most problematic instances for law enforcement. I give an example, when we look at Mangione shooting the CEO of U.S. Healthcare, he was functioning and operating by himself. This appears to be more than the same in that we had a lone wolf attack. So, this becomes very challenging. And so, what law enforcement is going to do is a backwards investigation to find out, and we're going to start it, the scene of the crime and we're going to go into a cell phone, of course, the traditional methods that law enforcement deploy, but to see where he purchased these firearms, what was his ideology online, and hopefully, that can assist for us to understand what the means or why he actually did this horrific act.",

There is an incident, a horrible incident that happened in one part of the city, and I say that it should go on for two reasons. One is based on the assurances so far, if that changes, I'll change my mind, that this was a individual attack that they don't view that there's any other threats. And the second is the capability of a city like New Orleans to adapt in the next six hours to call on other local, state, and federal resources and to provide the protection that is necessary both operationally. And also let's just -- you know, symbolically.I am not opposed to what people sometimes called security theater. You want people to feel safe. That is an important part of what the obligation of government is at this stage. They will not feel safe given tonight. And so, you can't -- New Orleans knows how to do this. Louisiana knows how to do this. Just deployed additional resources with changes to the operational planning, including just changing your vehicle traffic capability near the dome, and they can do that. I know it sounds complicated, but people know how to do this in six hours. They can do it. And I think it is important for the show to go on in many ways because these cities often will close down. We've seen this in the past, and it -- there's never a good time to reopen, if you know what I mean, like just given the kinds of threats that we have now, and I've sort of changed my mind on this over the years, that part of our resiliency is we can pivot and still honor and recognize and mourn.",

We counted around eight bodies very quickly, right in our area. One gentleman crushed. Had tire tracks across his back. Once they rolled him over, he had tire tracks on his front. He was completely crushed. Another girl, young small girl was dancing when we were coming up the street. And she was just completely flat in the middle, dead center middle. Another woman just brutally run over, but still agonizing. I'm certified in CPR and first responder training and they wouldn't let us help.
