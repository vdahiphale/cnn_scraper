This is where a catastrophic -- a massive earthquake struck. It's now killed, the estimates, 1,900 people. Sad fact is that number is expected to grow, and a lot, possibly into the tens of thousands. Concerns being scenes like this, entire buildings collapsed.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. A big concern, Erica, we were hearing from Turkey's disaster and emergency management agency in the last few moments saying they've recorded 130 aftershocks. I mean, speaking to colleagues and people in southern Turkey right now, they're very concerned. They don't know where to go. Authorities are trying to create shelterfor tens of thousands of people across this region. We're talking about a vast area of southern Turkey, ten provinces, that have been impacted by this earthquake. And, of course, in Syria as well. And also, unfortunately, in the last few moments, we have gotten an update with more than 2,300 people confirmed killed in both Turkey and Syria right now. This is after Turkish officials raised the death toll right now to nearly 1,500 people who have been confirmed killed. But we were talking about thousands of buildings that have been damaged, destroyed, many flattened across this earthquake zone. The concern is they don't really know yet how many people are trapped under the rubble. So there's a lot of concern that the death toll is going to significantly increase in the coming hours. Of course, we are running out of daylight hours right now, making this already very complex search and rescue operation even harder for the teams on the ground. They are saying, of course, the current weather conditions, this winter storm, the ice, the snow making it very difficult for them to move around, to reach areas. That they are going to try using helicopters to reach many of the devastated areas. And, of course, a lot of concern for what is going on across the border as well in Syria with hundreds of people killed, both in rebel- controlled areas in the northern part of the country. A very vulnerable population there. Hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced time and time again, living in absolutely - in miserable conditions, in urgent need of aid at the best of times. So you can imagine the kind of conditions they are going through right now. And both countries, I can tell you right now, are calling for international support and help with the rescue operations as well as aid. We know that Turkey is starting to get a lot of support from the international community and now calls for Syria to get the same, especially in the rebel-held parts of the country that really have very little to deal with this catastrophic situation right now.",

CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson, he is live fromnear Tapa Army Base in Estonia. This is where NATO is holding training exercises with the same equipment. Nic, you're getting a firsthand look at why it could be a while before we see these German-made Leopard tanks on the front lines. Why is that? I mean it's a training question, isn't it?",

      "sentences": "Today, President Biden returns to the White House from Camp David as he prepares to deliver the State of the Union Address tomorrow night to a divided Congress. His administration has already been out there previewing the president's message of building a stronger U.S. economy. And, in D.C., U.S. Capitol Police ramping up security, as we often see, adding now a non-scalable fence around the Capitol grounds.Joining me to discuss, Laura Barron-Lopez, CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for PBS \"Newshour.\" Good to see you this morning. Look, the administration would love to focus solely, as we know, on the state of the union, but the reality is this Chinese balloon is what's dominating politics and conversations in Washington, as we know. House Republicans even considering this vote ahead of the State of the Union that would criticize President Biden and his actions, his response there. How much is this China spy balloon issue overshadowing the State of the Union Address? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's certainly something that the administration is going to have to address. We know that President Biden, in the past, has made competitiveness with China and support of allied democracies a big piece of his speeches. He talked about this in his last State of the Union speech. And the White House has said to expect him to, again, address China and the administration's efforts to try to combat it.",

      "sentences": "So, as we - as we watch that and see what, you know, may or may not make it in tomorrow night, there's also the reality of where things stand. As we know, the administration wants to talk about the economy, wants to tout some of the successes of the first two years of the Biden presidency in this address. The reality is, some of this new polling really isn't on President Biden's side.From \"The Washington Post\"/ABC poll, 62 percent of Americans think the president has not accomplished not very much or little or nothing. So, barely more than a third say he's accomplished a great deal or a good amount. Is there a sense that anything he can say tomorrow will change those feelings? BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, he's certainly going to try, Erica, because the president is well aware and has talked in the past about when he was vice president with former President Barack Obama and he said that he didn't think that they did a good job of selling their wins on the Affordable Care Act. And so this entire year, and this second half of his first term, is very much focused on implementation and that sales job, trying to tell the American public what exactly was passed because we've seen in polling time and time again that they may not be aware of what was passed this that bipartisan infrastructure law or aware of what was passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. And some of those aren't even going to take effect until about this year, like prescription drug reform. And so that's something that the president and vice president, Kamala Harris, are going to be talking about a lot and we've seen them in recent days travel across the east coast on a tour to try to talk about the infrastructure law, as well as they're going to travel again right after the State of the Union, the president going to Wisconsin. And so this is something that is going to be a big part of his run up to a potential 2024 run.",

Imagine if that hadn't happened. That just would have been such more of a heartbreak for her fans. But she didn't win Album of the Year. But someone who did was Harry Styles for \"Harry's House.\" I got to say, Harry Styles had a huge year. He also had that movie with Olivia Wilde called \"Don't Worry, Darling.\" You know, it's -- he is somebody where he really broke out of One Direction. He proved, like some others that paved the way before him, like Justin Timberlake, that you can leave a boy band and have incredible solo success. So, I'm happy for him.
