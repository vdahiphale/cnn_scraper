They're still mounting. It all started early morning after a key FAA system went down, halting all U.S. flight departures.",

Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I just spoke with Buttigieg. They don't know what cause is. But I was on the phone with him in the last ten minutes. I told them to report directly to me when they find out. They expect in a couple of hours they'll have a good sense of what caused it and will respond at that time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Hi, Jim, you're right, Newark Airport and also Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, were the first two to come back online now. The ground stop has been lifted nationally, at least from the one from the FAA and usual airlines are grappling with what is going to be now a huge ripple effect of delays.I just went to the board a few minutes ago and there're still quite a few delays. And you can imagine that there would be. There were flights that were scheduled to take off at 5:00 A.M., 7:00 A.M., several of those were delayed until 9:50, so just a few minutes ago. We'll be checking to see if they all depart at 9:50, but just a lot of sort of crowded air travel here. And you heard Pete mention United, one of the airlines that are giving passengers a chance to have waivers or refunds. We also know that -- he also mentioned this idea that we, and we heard this from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and others, that they need to get to the bottom of this. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, she is the chair of the Senate committee on commerce and transportation, and she's yet another person vowing to look into what caused these delays. She said in a statement, the public needs a resilient air transportation system. And they have to look into how redundancy plays a role. So, should there be a backup, maybe even a backup to the backup for the system, the NOTAMS system, the critical system that failed today. That is something that everyone is going to be looking into. But as I mentioned, things are a little bit calmer here now. People are still walking up to check in. We're still talking to folks, many of them going to Miami or Fort Lauderdale, or internationally. They say that they expect to have a fine day. Miami still was not delayed, a couple other flights are still facing delays. Jim?",

That's because it is a slower travel day. Typically, it is a Wednesday. But, look, it goes without saying, a lot of people were still inconvenienced as a result of this FAA ground stoppage and this computer glitch.We spoke with several travelers who were dealing with a lot of delays, in fact, on the departure board, there were so many delays on there, about two to three hours. There were just a few cancelations for those early morning flights. And we did see a handful of departures starting at 8:30 this morning. So, yes, Atlanta was one of those first airports to get the planes back in the air. I spoke with one woman a few minutes ago, who is a Southwest passenger, she's trying to get back -- she said she was in an Uber on her way to the airport when she got the notice that her flight had been delayed. And, initially, she was quite worried. She thought that she might be going through the holiday nightmare that she saw playing out on T.V. with Southwest Airlines passengers. So, she is, in fact, is just relieved that that is not the case. Listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There needs to be more investments in the infrastructure for the FAA.Athena had just noted with us Senator Cantwell talking about -- to your point, Miles, talking about the need for more redundancy with this program in particular. And Jim and I were talking earlier with David Soucie about how so many of these systems are so old, and yet thousands and thousands of flights depend on them every single day. Why is it so tough to bring it up to speed? O'BRIEN (voice over):  It's just amazing that the system works as well as it does. I often marvel at it for its lack of technological advancement over the years. It's been very difficult to get, frankly, out of the era of tubes, for that matter. We're past that now. But basically the FAA system, the architecture has its origins, post-war, '50s, radar systems, and it's been slow to move into the era of satellites and computers. And as it moves in that direction, there's inherent safety that goes along with it, but you have got to go all-in and you've got to go in with a layer of redundancy to make sure when something like this fails, it doesn't shut down the system. I mean, the good news is this is not a safety issue. This is an inconvenience issue, but it does underscore the fact there are technological gaps in the system which need to be addressed.",

And, frankly, there's a direct line between expenditure of money and safety. And that goes with the airlines themselves and the FAA as well. If you want a system that's going to operate at the level of safety that we expect out of our air traffic control system, you have to keep investing in it. And when problems like this come up, they should not be ignored, they shouldn't be swept under the rug and put together with bailing wire and duct tape.",
