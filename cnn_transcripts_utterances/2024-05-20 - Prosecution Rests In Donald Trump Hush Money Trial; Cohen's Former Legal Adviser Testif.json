So Robert Costello is a witness that was called to the grand jury at the beginning of these proceedings at the request of the Trump attorneys, basically to attack Michael Cohen's credibility.My guess is that he's up to talk about places where he believes that Michael Cohen is lying. He's even been on other media outlets saying, I'm the one who can demonstrate that Michael Cohen is lying. Now again, sort of as we've been talking about through this program, it's not in the defense's interest to spend a lot of time with this witness. Also, partly because every word that comes out of his mouth, prosecutors can attack him on in terms of contradictions he's made, the fact that he testified in Congress just last week about all of this. It would be easy for prosecutors to say that this witness is himself biased against another witness and is sort of clouded by his own judgment.",

I agree with Eliot.I mean, not knowing yet exactly what he has to say, my inclination would be not to call him as the defense. It seems he's clearly going to undermine and contradict some aspects of Michael Cohen's testimony. One area where it seems likely, given prior statements that he's made and the lawyers have made, is he's going to say, I believe, that Michael Cohen did want and was hoping for a pardon. Ultimately, Cohen didn't get it. That ground's already largely been covered, though, and there's other evidence to show, there's e-mails and other evidence in the case to show that Cohen did want a pardon at some point in time or was hoping or at least asking about it.

So you can't call a witness to say, well, he lied about, let's say, the pardon, because the pardon is not central to this case. What you can call an outside witness, Bob Costello, to do is to attack the credibility on the core of this case, on the hush money payments.

So the judge is wise to try to limit the scope here to make sure this doesn't go on forever and that what he offers has relevance here.Now, what I would expect will definitely come up is the fact that Rob Costello has repeatedly said that during their conversations, Michael Cohen told him, he was under enormous pressure, right, to come up with some sort of evidence of criminal wrongdoing related to then President Trump to help himself. Because he was under scrutiny by federal investigators. And Cohen repeatedly told Costello that he had no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by then-President Trump. So it's interesting. Costello did not look at Trump's table when he walked to the witness stand. A little bit of bad blood between the two of them because Costello still has millions of dollars in outstanding legal bills from Rudy Giuliani. And he, Costello and Giuliani, asked Trump for help with those. Costello still hasn't been paid. But let me tell you, Costello is still 100 percent team Trump, and wants to do as much damage to Michael Cohen's credibility as he possibly can.
