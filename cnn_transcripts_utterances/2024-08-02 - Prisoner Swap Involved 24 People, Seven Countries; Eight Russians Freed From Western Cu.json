Now, will this prison swap lead to warmer relations between Washington and Moscow? That's more -- we'll have more on that after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

And it's in a very difficult place because Russia has chosen to commit some unconscionable acts in the world. First and foremost, its war of aggression on Ukraine. Nothing that's happened today changes that. We are fundamentally still at odds.But on the other hand, we did find a target of opportunity through very hard-nosed diplomacy with Russia, close collaboration with our partners and allies, including some very difficult questions we had to ask of some of our friends to help us here, and then very careful execution of what was a logistically, diplomatically and politically complicated exchange to execute today that went off without a hitch.

She praised Jackson Lee's legacy of service and dedication. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She truly was a force of nature. When it came to her constituents, there was no task too big or too small for the Congresswoman. If it needed to be done, she made sure it was done and done right. When it came to crafting policy, there was no detail too minor or point of order too obscure. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: Meanwhile, Donald Trump is defending his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention, which was contentious and combative at times. He says he showed up whilst Kamala Harris didn't. At the convention on Wednesday, he attacked Harris' racial identity and falsely claimed that she, quote, happened to turn Black a few years ago. Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, is defending those comments. He spoke with CNN's Steve Contorno on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I asked him, as the father of three biracial children, did Trump's remarks give you pause at all?Listen to what he said. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They don't give me pause at all. Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon. She goes to Georgia two days ago. She was raised in Canada. She puts on a fake southern accent. She is everything to everybody, and she pretends to be somebody different, depending on which audience she's in front of. I think it's totally reasonable for the president to call that out, and that's all he did. I mean, look, she's running as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, even though she implemented open border policy. She's saying that she wants to support the police, yet she wanted to defund the police just three years ago. It's totally reasonable to call out the fact that she pretends to be somebody different, depending on the audience she's talking to.",

On Thursday, a jury had ordered the league to pay more than $4.7 billion for anti-trust violations for its Sunday ticket package, but the judge found issues with the trial's expert witnesses and said the jury's decision was based on speculation not evidence. The case involved an NFL package that required fans to buy a bundle of games in order to watch teams outside their home markets. In a statement, the NFL says it's grateful for the ruling.Today's competitions at the Olympic Games are underway right now. China has the most gold medals. The U.S. trails closely and has the most medals overall. Thursday proved to be monumental for U.S. gymnastics star Simone Biles, and it was also historic for swimming sensation Katie Ledecky. And while all eyes were on Biles and Ledecky, Team USA's women's fencing team made history in their own right. But the excitement of the Games is far from over. Track and field events kick off today in just a few hours. American track star Sha'Carri Richardson will make her long-awaited Olympic debut.

And there's not many people who can get away with celebrating with a diamond-encrusted GOAT necklace around your neck, is there?But if anybody can, Simone can. And that's pretty apt. So when it comes to her gymnastics performances as well, it really was a privilege to be there. The atmosphere was everything you've been hearing about. The game has changed. The likes of Vogue and Vanity Fair were there. Seth Rogen, Steph Curry, Kim Kardashian, everybody wanting to get in and see the action and history play out. And Biles did have some pretty tough competition from Brazil's Rebeca Andrade. She won silver last time out. Her U.S. teammate Suni Lee, who took the gold in Tokyo, but she's credited both of them with pushing her and inspiring her to do what she does. She did have a wobble on the uneven bars. Can't all be perfect. So that brought a massive intake of breath, but then put in a great performance on the beam and the floor, ultimately stepping up and doing what she does to become the first woman to win non- consecutive all-around titles. The first woman to win two since 1968, her sixth Olympic gold medal in all. It was Andrade claiming silver, Lee the bronze. And if Tuesday in the team event had been dubbed the redemption tour, I'm not entirely sure what you call this, but there is potentially more to come. She's still got three finals left, which she says are now the events where she can have some fun, more fun, I guess. But from the most decorated U.S. gymnast to the woman with the title of the USA's most decorated female Olympian across the board, Katie Ledecky, she racked up an incredible 13th medal last night in the pool, helping Team USA to silver in the 4x200 relay behind an Australian four that set a new Olympic record en route to gold. For Ledecky, it completes her set of medals for this Games, one of each color. And later this evening, she's got a chance of another in the event she's dominated for so long, the 800 freestyle. But she is going to have some tough competition from the next gen, Canada's 17-year-old sensation Summer McIntosh. She took her second gold of the Games last night.",
