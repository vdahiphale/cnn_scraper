That's five more seats than they have now. The battle will take place in 82 key House races, competitive contests that really could go either way. In the closely divided Senate, Republicans need 51 seats to take back control. That's only one more seat than they already have. We're watching 13 key races that will be crucial to the fight for control of the U.S. Senate. We're also following the 36 governors' contests across the country, including key races in a number of critical battlegrounds. Our election team is in position for a very busy night, including Dana Bash, Abby Phillip and Chris Wallace. Over at the magic wall, John King is standing by. He'll track the results and give us perspective on the votes that have not yet been reported. Kasie Hunt is following all 35 Senate contests, including the crucial key races, as we get closer to the first results. And Boris Sanchez is watching those 36 governors' contests across the United States. David Chalian will soon share more exit poll information as polling places close. And Brianna Keilar is at our voting desk, keeping us up-to-date on how and when the ballots are counted in each state. Our election team is fanned out across the United States, including at the headquarters of the top candidates. Right now, let's go to two of the top battlegrounds in the fight for the Senate. Kate Bolduan is in Pennsylvania at the headquarters of Republican Senate Candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz. And, Kate, what are you hearing there in Newtown from Oz's campaign headquarters about their expectations for the night?",

And from another source, a Republican close to the campaign, describing the feeling as cautiously optimistic but still nervous, saying that they feel good that they really left it all in the field.Now, the campaign believes that they closed out this race on a high note, pointing to the big crowd that they saw in the Philadelphia suburbs last night with a final rally that Mehmet Oz held. We were there. We saw it. They also believe that the end, the campaign is pointing to at this point, Jake, that they believe that they have gotten into the good position that they believe that they are in because of one factor specifically, the contrast that they drew in their message, the contrast of balance, bringing balance to Washington and contrasting that, as Mehmet Oz describes it over and over again, as extremism on both sides. That is what the campaign says they feel good about. And a source telling CNN they believe the message really resonated with voters and that they've defined Fetterman in a way that stuck with voters.

What we have seen, though, is Republican newcomer, former NFL Star Herschel Walker really mount an aggressive challenge and Warnock is trying to stave off that challenge.Notably, he has been confident in the last several weeks but Warnock has been telling his supporters, look, we do not want this to go into overtime. He has two ads up in the state saying just that, the Democrats need to come out and vote to avoid a December runoff. If neither Walker or Warnock get above 50 percent, then this goes for another several weeks. That is something they are trying to avoid. You don't hear Walker talking about a potential runoff as much but Warnock is. I asked him about this, why is this a concern? He says, listen, and he reiterated this again today, that he is prepared to win tonight, but that this -- he's also prepared for this possibility as well. You know, his potential success in this state really, I think, underscores the challenge or that Georgia Democrats face. Really, it is a test, his potential success is a test to see if Georgia Democrats can pull out a victory even though that this is a difficult midterm now for Democrats across the country. If Warnock wins here, it will illustrate that the way that he has run his campaign really focusing on his bipartisan credentials can work in a state that is so competitive like this one, Jake.",

And here in Maricopa County, you can vote anywhere because they're able to print out the ballot that marks exactly who you are and has all the issues and people that you need to vote for in your specific area.Now, I do want to give you an update because there were some voting issues in Maricopa County this morning that somebody basically put out to the public. Now, they've investigated it. And what they found is that some of the printers at about a fifth of the locations, the 223 vote centers, were not having ink that was dark enough to mark the ballots. They have fixed that in 41 vote centers so far, according to Maricopa County Spokesperson Fields Moseley. Now, we are learning that there are less than 30 that still need to be fixed. But what the county wants everyone to know is that no matter what happens, even if there's a problem with the tabulation machine that isn't printing properly, that doesn't have the proper ink, that they are going to count your vote. You can either take your ballot and put it into that machine, which has a lockbox and they will pick it up and they will take it to the tabulation center or they will take your ballot to the tabulation center and make sure that your vote is counted. They have been saying that over and over and over again.

Donald Trump's favorability numbers here, interesting, 40 percent of the Pennsylvania electorate today views him favorably, 58 percent unfavorable. That is a significant downtick from the 47 percent who viewed him favorably just two years ago when he narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden. And then how much of a factor was Joe Biden in the vote for Pennsylvanians today? Well, 52 percent, a slim majority, say not a factor, but if he was a factor, it was more negative. 32 percent voted to oppose Biden, 14 percent to support Biden. We also looked at that same question with Donald Trump among Pennsylvania voters. A significant majority, 57 percent, not a factor, but where he was a factor, it was more negative than positive, 24 percent oppose Trump, 18 percent, Anderson, of Pennsylvania voters today said they voted to support Donald Trump.",

And the fight for the Senate, the Georgia race could be a decider. Incumbent Democrat and Pastor Raphael Warnock faces Republican former football star Herschel Walker. Walker has held on to the support of top Republicans despite multiple controversies. Warnock is aiming to repeat his special election win two years ago that was key to flipping the Senate to Democratic control. To the governor's now, we're watching an epic rematch in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams challenging Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who narrowly beat her four years ago. We're very close to our first chance to make projections. Right now, let's check in with our correspondents in Georgia, first to Eva McKend at the headquarters of Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock.

You'll think back just to several weeks and even months ago when Republicans here in Georgia and in Washington were just in a state of panic about the allegations that were, indeed, coming out about Herschel Walker.But then, Republicans did one thing, they circled the wagons around him and dispatched many senators who are campaigning at his side and took a page from the Trump playbook and did not apologize and pushed forward. It was a page from the Trump playbook without the former president himself. In the final days of this race as Donald Trump campaigned across the country traveling from state to state to state, he did not come to Georgia and that was by design, I am told. I'm told that the former president was in frequent conversation with Herschel Walker, of course, he's the one who recruited him to run in this Georgia Senate race in the first place. Over the objection of many Washington Republicans including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell but it was former president Donald Trump who urged Herschel walker to run and I am told they have spoken all the time on the telephone. Last evening they spoke a few times, I'm told. Today they also spoke. So, very interesting, taking a page out that have playbook but leaving him out of this so that allowed the Walker campaign to do one thing, to make this race about President Biden and to tie Senator Raphael Warnock to President Biden. Jake, I'm just struck here, either driving down the freeways, watching television, looking at mailers that voters received, there was a side- by-side picture of Senator Warnock and President Biden everywhere you went, effectively trying to tie the two together. What that allowed them not to do was to link Herschel Walker with Donald Trump. So, as the votes are counted here at the top of the hour the polls will close across the state of Georgia with the exception of a few polls that are staying open a bit longer because of some minor complications. It'll be fascinating to see which strategy actually worked but one thing that's clear, Herschel Walker was not disqualified as this campaign came to a close -- Jake.",

Dana and Chris and Abby were talking about Herschel Walker. How do Republicans view Herschel Walker? If you go back to the 2020 presidential race, Donald Trump lost. Donald Trump lost Georgia by 11,000 votes. But look at all this red. This is a test for Herschel Walker in Georgia tonight, the polls close in a few minutes. It's a test for Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. Can they run it up to Trump voters who like that particular style of Republican? Do they turn out? Do they turn out in decent high numbers? You know, they're small counties. You go into some of these counties and they're tiny in terms of the population, 2,400 votes, but 73 percent. That matters, right? Margins, again.",

Do Trump voters view him as legitimate and they turn out, and the suburban voters who were frankly repulsed by Donald Trump and much of the country say we think Herschel Walker is good enough for us. It'll be a key in the governor's race and key in the Senate race as well.That's where it starts to get real. Let's come back to 2022 when we start to fill in the votes here. We also then at the bottom of the hour, 7:30, you get North Carolina, if Democrats are going to have a surprise tonight and an extra piece, if you will, in the chess game, the Cheri Beasley race in North Carolina, you have to come to the visit for that, it's one of our competitive races. You know, they're hoping -- oops, one up there, come on down, here we go.

That'll be critical for Cheri Beasley tonight. Can he do that in a midterm election year?We'll start learning that 7:30. At the top of the hour, Georgia is the big one for us. Because what happens here is this in the house race, these are the ones that are in so far. Eleven races coming in so far. Ten Republicans leading, one Democrat leading. These are not viewed as competitive races. But, again, if you're in the party headquarters, you've got to keep what you expect to keep. The challenge is as we get into the next hour, we bring up these competitive races. Virginia closes at the top of the hour. Just in the commonwealth of Virginia, you have these Democratic incumbents in the northern Virginia suburbs it's Jennifer Wexton. Central part of the state, still suburban, Abigail Spanberger. Considered the most vulnerable of these three, Elaine Luria. She's on the January 6 committee. What happens in Virginia as we start to count those House races? Can Democrats keep all three? Do they lose one? Do they lose two? That's going to tell us a lot, Jake, about Republicans need a net gain of five. Polls close in Virginia. That is a big early clue.",
