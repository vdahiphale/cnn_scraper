I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this hour with the tempers flaring in Nashville where emotions are raw and the politics much like the rest of the U.S. bitterly divided. Republicans in the state house there voted to expel lawmakers for breaking decorum during a raucous but peaceful protest demanding gun reform. That protest ignited by the Nashville school shooting that left three adults and three young students dead. How the expulsion vote ended has only added to the anger. Representatives Justin Pearson and Justin Jones, who are black, were expelled. Their fellow protester and colleague Gloria Johnson, who was white, kept her seat by one vote. CNN correspondent Isabel Rosales joins us now with the latest. Isabel, what happens now? I guess there is some hope that these two lawmakers who were expelled might get their seats back.",

This is one of the primary medications used to provide abortions.Meanwhile in Texas, a federal judge is halting the FDA's more than two decade old approval of the very same drug.

Now President Biden in a statement warned of the national implications of this judge's ruling. He wrote quote, \"This does not just affect women in Texas. If it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in the state.\" He added, \"It is the next big step towards the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America.\" Now, this case, this ruling -- neither of them deal with the question of whether there is a right to an abortion. That was something that was central to the Dobbs decision from the Supreme Court last summer. But instead these two cases are really dealing with this administrative facet of how the FDA regulates mifepristone, that abortion medication drug that judge down in Texas, ultimately ruling and suspending that FDA approval, saying that the process was flawed and that it didn't take into consideration some of the risks that it could pose to women and children. Now President Biden has also warned of what this could mean for other FDA approved drugs, saying that they could be vulnerable to political and ideological attacks. They will wait to see how this appeals process plays out. But it's also worth noting that that Texas ruling does have a seven- day pause to allow the federal government to appeal it.

You do have to be careful in this scenario. This happens sometimes with prosecutors -- different prosecutors looking at the same thing. Ordinarily, what you do is you would get together and do what we call deconflict. You would say to the other prosecutor's office. Hey are we looking at the same witnesses here?

But it turned out, at the same time, DeSantis was saying there was a new sheriff in town, Disney had pushed through its own agreement with the outgoing board that basically said all the power this board has is now in Disney's hands.
