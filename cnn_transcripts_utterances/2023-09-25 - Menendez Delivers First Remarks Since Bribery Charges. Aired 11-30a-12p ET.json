And prosecutors put out several different pictures of the things that they found in his home, including gold bars, wads of cash, and a fancy car for his wife.He talked about the wads of cash, which was surprising to a lot of folks, especially to those attorneys who wish he would not say that if they're defending him. But he talked about the thousands of dollars of cash and where it came from. He said it came from his personal savings account.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Sara and John, after a weekend of these growing calls for Senator Menendez to resign. We saw that defiance from the senator. We saw him pledging to continue serving the New Jersey people as he has for decades.He's speaking in Union City where he was once the mayor. He served in the New Jersey legislature, then in the House of Representatives, and now Senate -- the Senate. He's up for reelection in 2024. But we really heard not only defiance but also the senator beginning to mount his defense. Remember that an indictment was brought on Friday. He's scheduled to appear in federal court for his first appearance likely arraignment on Wednesday along with his wife and his co-defendants. And so, we're hearing the defense's here, namely two of them. Sara, you mentioned that he talked about all of that cash that was found in his home and in some cases on envelopes inside jackets that bore his name. He talked about the fact that these were from personal savings accounts. Prosecutors have indicated that that was money that came from these New Jersey businessmen who were bribing him to do these official acts that may have influenced arms sales and military aid in Egypt. Also, he's accused of trying to influence criminal prosecutions on the federal side and on the state side in New Jersey. So, the senator coming right out and trying to defend against the nearly $500,000 that was actually found inside his home. And then also talking about his record when it comes to Egypt. Because remember, another part of this very vast indictment spanning about 39 pages were allegations that he abused his power to influence arms sales, military aid to Egypt, in -- you know for kickbacks from those New Jersey businessmen. The prosecution talks about how he had meetings with Egyptian officials throughout this period spanning from 2018 to 2022. So, really what we're seeing from the Senator is already a defense. And he hasn't even appeared in court yet for his arraignment. That will be on Wednesday. You know, the senator here talking -- referencing that prosecution that he -- that he went through, you know, beginning in 2015, that he was eventually -- there was a mistrial in 2017. The judge eventually acquitted him in 2018 with the Justice Department deciding not to bring more charges. But now, the senator facing probably a more difficult prosecution in this sense, a lengthy indictment, and -- but he is pledging to stay on as senator despite those mounting calls for his resignation, guys.",

And he did say that when all the facts come out, he firmly believes he will be exonerated and he will be New Jersey's senior senator, which is his way of saying he is not at all resigned.I want to bring in our senior political analyst John Avlon to this discussion. So, John, you did have the political defense there where he talked about people who are already in a way dancing on his grave because he says they \"see political opportunity.\" You could talk about that. And as notable, Jessica said, there was also a bit of a legal defense there which will get you more later.",

      "sentences": "There is the political issue where he is -- as he's put it, sort of fighting for his life. And then there is the legal issue. And I want to get to some of that with Gene Rossi. We've got him here now. Former prosecutor.Gene, we've heard from Bob Menendez that on the charges of why he has all this cash, he says, look, it came from my personal savings account. It's something that I did because I'm old-fashioned. I'm from Cuba. And this is how you protect your money, even if it's old- fashioned. He did not mention the gold bars or the car that his wife was accused of -- and also indicted for getting as part of a bribe. What do you make of him touching on some of the evidence but not others? GENE ROSSI, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA: Well, he's putting his toe in the water. And I'm thinking back to Rocky Marciano, who had a lot of cash because he didn't trust banks. But that was in the 1940s. We're now fast-forward to 2023. Mr. Menendez's argument is similar to as if William Jefferson argued that he put the $90,000 of cash in his freezer because he wanted to preserve the integrity of the dollar bills. That argument -- it's a foolish argument. And if I had been his attorney, I would have told him to pause.",

And I got to stress this.These are allegations of presumption of innocence burden on the government, we all know that. He's already had a successful trial and got a hung jury. So, we have to give him the benefit of the doubt. But what's important here and what your audience should understand is this case appears to be allegedly far different than Governor Bob McDonald. In that case, there was an attenuation, there were amorphous actions by Governor McDonald to do things for Johnny Williams. Here, allegedly, you have an official act and then you have cash, gold bars, checks, or some other benefit, or you're about to do an official act and you have cash checks, gold bars, and other benefits. There's a nexus between his actions that have occurred or will occur and the benefit that he got. And the gold bars and the cash, it's just proof that there was some quid pro quo allegedly.",

I want to go back to -- do we have Kara Scannell now or Jessica Schneider? OK.Jessica Schneider, on your thoughts about how he went down. He really jumped on two different things. One, the cash. But he also talked a lot about his relationship with Egypt. And that particular charge seems to be one of the most troubling charges in this case that he was trying to have some influence and using bribery to help them for example, with military aid.",

And the thought that he pushed this military aid despite the record of human rights abuses in Egypt, and he -- that's what he really focused on in his defense that he mounted there at the press conference talking about how he has long urged for the addressing human rights issues in Egypt. He went down the list. He talked about letters that he's written to former President Trump. Meetings that he had with the president of Egypt.So, trying to defend -- right, what you see in the indictment here against what his record was in the Senate as Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. So, yes. I mean, that -- in terms of official acts, what was spelled out in the indictment as what he allegedly did to assist Egypt, whether it was having those meetings with officials from Egypt, outside the president -- presence of his staff. There were also accusations in the indictment that he gave sensitive information to those New Jersey businessmen who then related to Egyptian officials, the sensitive information being the number and nationality of the U.S. employees at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. So, there are a lot more specifics in the indictment that the senator really did not touch on in his press conference, probably much to the relief of his lawyers. But he did talk about his rights -- or his record when it comes to looking at the human rights abuses that have been alleged in Egypt. So, that was a big talking point that will likely be expanded upon in his defense when he does begin these proceedings in the courtroom and beyond.",

The two not necessarily connected in any way.Jessica, standby. I want to bring in Kara Scannell who was in the room for this statement from Senator Bob Menendez, who says, Kara, that when all is said and done, he firmly believes that he will be exonerated and he will still be the senior senator from New Jersey.
