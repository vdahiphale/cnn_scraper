And this is what the forecasters have been warning people about for the last 12 hours or so, and really urging people the stay off of the roadways, which because of the office closings, and the school cancelations across the region, you are not seeing that many people on the roadway. But it is treacherous. You can see here on this pass up to the highway interchange here, there are several cars there struggling to make their way up to the hill as the icy conditions continue to worsen, and it has become deadly. In Austin, we are hearing reports of one fatality and the winter weather warnings, and the advisory stretching from San Antonio all of the way up to Oklahoma and Arkansas as well. And these are the kinds of conditions that we are going to continue to see throughout the day and well into tomorrow as well. In fact, some forecasters are saying that the worst of this might not be over until Thursday morning.

Sleet has a little bit more traction than the wet ice, that freezing rain. Freezing rain is rain that comes down as liquid, hits the ground and freezes. Sleet freezes on the way down. The farther you get to the north, the more likely you are to get to that sleet. Now, this is not a snowstorm. This is an ice storm, ice storm warnings here, and why? Why would it sleet or why would it rain at 26? Because it isn't 26 at 2,000 feet in the sky. It is 33 up there. It is liquid. And then it falls down into this very shallow layer of cold air and then you get the ice, the ice into Dallas, the ice causing the accidents. This was freezing rain. You can see it looks like black ice. Now, the roads are turning white, especially where Ed is. This is the swath, though, and hours and hours more of this. Not only that. I am going to change colors and get you to what the real radar looks like. There is convection in here. Not only is it sleeting but it is lightning as well. Thunder sleet out there at this point in time, and that starts to pile up very, very quickly. That entire system moves to the northeast. This is the one that came through yesterday. This is the one that came -- will come through today, coming through Dallas right now. [10:05:01] But it will move on up into Arkansas and into places like Kentucky, Paducah, Evansville, you are about to get into middle of it, also into Arkansas, right through Hot Springs, all the way up across the Ozarks, very difficult travel today. Then there is the break, but then look what happens to the west of Dallas. Another batch of this is comes in for tomorrow, right on top of the same places. And I just looked. There is really not very many power outages out there, like less than 1,000 in Texas. I think that number is going to go up significantly if we get this freezing rain that sticks to the power lines, sticks to the branches and does not just bounce off like it was bouncing off of Ed.",

It is for money that has already been spent, and we have to always explain this over and over again, we keep going through this. It is for money that has already spent. So, it is not really supposed to be a negotiating tactic. It is just the job of the Congress to raise the debt limit. And we need to get back to doing that.And I think that, you know, Biden has said that he won't negotiate with them, though he has asked for them to basically send over what they are thinking. But I think that, you know, the people who ultimately will be held responsible for this if it is not lifted will be Congress because it is their job. At the same time, Joe Biden as the president and what happens to the economy matters very much in terms of what people think of the president. So, he is in a very difficult situation, especially because Kevin McCarthy made it as part of negotiations to become speaker, he said that he would not take up the debt limit without essentially having cuts going along with it and having some sort of negotiation with the White House to make cuts in the budget. So, I think that it has to be handled very delicately and to the extent that Biden can keep the focus on the fact that this is their job, I think that that is important.",

And all of those are third rails for the Republicans who claim that they want these deep cuts.So, you take those three off the table, it gets to be very difficult to see how can you really cut trillions of dollars from the federal budget. And I don't think they have a list of cuts. They don't. We'll see how this works. If they fall into the trap of saying that they want to tamper with Medicare or Social Security in any way, shape, form, it will be the biggest gift they could have given to the Democrats going into 2024.

So, we here at CNN are also learning this that this new initial police report was directly contradicting what we all saw happened on the video.It was written in the hours after the Tyre Nichols stop and makes no mention of these officers kicking or punching Tyre Nichols, had actually list him as violent and as the aggressor. And this initial police report says that Tyre Nichols, at one point, reached for an officer's gun. None of these things we saw transpire on the videos that were all released last week. It goes on to say that Tyre Nichols was violent was actually a suspect in an aggravated assault and lists one of these five former officers now charged with second-degree murder as a victim. What we still don't know is who authored the police report in the police department. That is something that we are trying to figure out this morning. But we can verify from the district attorney's office that this New York Times report is correct. All of this happening, meanwhile, as the fallout over Tyre Nichols' death continues. Three personnel with the Memphis Fire Department have now been terminated. They include those two EMTs that were put on administrative leave last week because of their inadequate assessment of Tyre Nichols when they got to the scene. The fire department claims in their investigation that this personnel, we're told, that they were responding to a pepper spraying incident. We know it was much, much worse than that. But they said that the expectations of a fire department official were not met that day on January 7th, the day of Tyre Nichols' incident with police. This as we're also learning of two other officers who were put on administrative leave at the same time as everyone else that we are learning about this week's later. It is a question that we directly asked the Memphis Police Department. They did not respond, but did point us to statement saying that they are committed to transparency and that we should all expect more personnel actions in the coming days. Jim, Erica?",

We on the council experienced the same thing. We were told the same thing to the public before the release of the video, and even though council did get to view the footage before it was released. We have the same exact questions.

We now know that one of the two officers who, again, were put on leave at the exact same time, one of them we know is white. I wonder, Justin, do the chief's comments still hold up this morning?PROF. JUSTIN HANSFORD, HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW:  Well, thanks for inviting me. So, those comments never held up even on its face. We understood that it is very unlikely that a white young man would have received that sort of attack, and so race was a factor. But, of course, now with this added element of this seeming process of hiding the one police officer who was not black from the public in the beginning, it is a very problematic situation. And this goes back to what we saw with the Derek Chauvin case. Once again, we had a huge gap between what was in the police report and it's the facts that later came out.

And the idea that we could look at first the police officer who was sort of at the end of the trail and point of interaction, and look at the race of the individuals involved and think that tells the whole racial story is a misunderstanding.

I was listening in the car, that there was a press conference on Friday afternoon before the video was released. And her words struck me because she said, I haven't even began -- didn't have the chance to grieve. We ask so much of these families and we highlight their strength and their grace in this moment. I would think that the answer is no, but are giving them the space and the grace that they deserve to grieve, to mourn the fact that their loved one was brutality beaten and murdered, to allow them to be angry? How do we change that conversation so that we are also acknowledging that hurt and that pain, Councilwoman? EASTER-THOMAS:  Erica, I think you hit it right on the head with that. That answer is no, we have not given them the space, the privacy, the intimacy, anything, to be able to do anything with themselves, their families. We also learned that Tyre also had a small child. So, this is something that will forever be horribly etched in their minds as we think about, and as they think about policing, as they think about policing in Memphis, and as they think about justices and elected leaders.

We can always, first and foremost, give our utmost respect and condolences and thank yous and apologies to the family and friends of Tyre Nichols. I think that if we make sure that we keep in the forefront, we can make sure that our efforts and actions are on line and that they are all going towards the same mission, even though we cannot Mr. Nichols back, even though we cannot even begin to fathom the hurt and the horror that they've experienced since January 7th.
