One day after what may be the largest and mostbrazen attack on Russian soil since Moscow launched its war on Kyiv 15 months ago, the Russian Defense Ministry says Ukrainian fighters have been pushed off its territory and 70 of them have been eliminated. The governor of the Belgorod region says a counterterrorism operation is over, and he denies any further cross-border incursions. Kyiv insists its troops aren't fighting on foreign territory and says it had no direct involvement in Monday's attack. The group of anti-Putin Russian nationals are indeed claiming responsibility. The Kremlin, meantime, warns the attack is, quote, a cause of deep concern. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us live now from eastern Ukraine. So, Nic, what does the attack in Belgrade really say about Russia's ability to protect areas close to the border?",

      "sentences": "I think it says exactly what Ukrainian officials would like it to say. Of course, they're notlinking themselves to it. They're saying it's a group of Russians who did this coming out of Ukraine, but it's exactly what Kyiv wants at this time, is it's considering a big counteroffensive. It wants to have what's called shaping operations. It wants to confuse its enemy in Moscow and unbelievably, literally able, these fighters were literally able to get across the border into Russia to actually, as we now know from Russian officials, one civilian was killed but injured several civilians. The reaction on the Russian side from the local villagers was to chase the mayor into the basement of a building and bang on the door demanding that he give them more safety and security. This incident really highlights for Russia that its border with Ukraine during a war isn't secure. Of course, it calls it a special military operation, but the reality Russia is seeing is that this border isn't secure, they don't have it secure. Their sort of response to call it a counter-terrorism operation, they quickly stand it down, frankly sounds somewhat in disarray. And again, this is something that Kyiv will be very happy to see, the Russians in disarray. In an ideal world for the authorities here, they would wish Russia would divert troops away from the front line in Ukraine so it could bolster its security along the border and this seems to be perhaps one of the take- aways for Moscow. Their border isn't secure, they need to do more to secure it. They'll have to put troops in there and equipment and ammunition and there are many little border crossings like this one. So, the net effect may be that despite Kyiv saying that it's not involved in this, that the outcome works to their advantage. Maybe of course Russia will be wholly aware that this would be potentially an effort to divert their resources onto what is clearly a very exposed border.",

It's been 16 years since Madeleine McCann vanished. And now there are new developments in the disappearance of the British girl. Right now, police in Portugal are searching an area around a reservoir. These are live pictures for you. CNN has learned they're looking for clues about Christian Bruckner's activities in the area. He's the main suspect in McCann's disappearance. The convicted rapist and child sex abuser is currently in prison in Germany and has denied any involvement in McCann's disappearance. CNN's Scott McLean has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Madeleine McCann would have turned 20 this month. Her family last saw her when she was three. She disappeared in 2007 during a family holiday in the Algarve region of Portugal. She was with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining with friends nearby in the resort of Praia da Luz. The mystery of her disappearance gripped many across the U.K., Portugal, and Germany. On Tuesday, Portuguese police, at the request of German authorities, will search a reservoir near the Portuguese city of Silvish, around 50 kilometers from Praia da Luz. Over the past 16 years, police have searched numerous wells and properties in the area, including this one, which was searched in 2008. It is unclear whether it's connected to Christian Bruckner, the German suspect first named in the case in 2020. Bruckner, a convicted sex offender, lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 in an apartment about a mile away from the resort where the McCanns were staying. He's in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman committed in Portugal at the same resort. He has not been charged in McCann's disappearance and denies any involvement. But one German prosecutor said he believes she was killed by Bruckner.",

When he complained to the referee, it sort of escalated from there. A brawl broke out between players, and it was actually Vinicius Jr. who was given the red card and expelled from the match. So, I think that's what really infuriated Real Madrid, too. Not only did he have to endure these verbal assaults by some fans but then he actually got a red card for reacting to it. So, I think there's a lot of anger for certainly from Vinicius Jr. from Real Madrid fans, but there's a lot of confusion as well from Valencia fans who are now very defensively saying, well, it's not all the fans. And I think the reaction to that as you're seeing today is that the Valencian football club says it is cooperating with an investigation with the police to track down those people who were hurling these racist insults. We've seen three people arrested already today between the ages of 18 and 21. There could even be more arrests. The investigation is still ongoing and it's now being classified as a hate crime. So, we are seeing some movement by police. Now, traditionally, La Liga has said that it has its hands tied on this, that it can't sanction teams and fans for these kinds of abuse. But it has now said that it is making moves, that it is asking to change the laws to allow it to do that. But all of this comes too little too late for a player like Vinicius Jr. who has been documenting just how many incidents he has endured over while he's been playing at Real Madrid. I mean what happened on Sunday here in Valencia was shocking, but it's certainly not the least of the incidents we've happened -- that has happened here in Spain. In January, for example, there was an effigy with Vinicius Jr. Real Madrid jersey with his number. It was tossed over a bridge -- hung from a bridge, and then shared widely on social media. Now, that was incredibly shocking. But it's only today that we've seen the national police arrest four people for that. They've described these four suspects as radical members of a Madrid fan club and say they are continuing to investigate that also as a hate crime. But I think it just goes to show that these kinds of incidents unfortunately are not isolated. The silver lining here is that we are seeing they're working together with football clubs to try and track down perpetrators but it's still very disturbing.",

The money comes into the treasury and bills get paid every single day, and they don't actually know how much is gonna come in every day. What is particularly complicated about this early June deadline is that a lot of businesses and some people pay taxes on a quarterly basis and those quarterly payments are due June 15. I mean, I guess as a concerned citizen, maybe we should get our payments in a little early.

It is tricky because what will happen is by that June 15th, they'll get enough revenue in that they'll be able to pay all the bills on June 15th. And we'll sort of get a little reprieve for a few weeks. And so, all of that is tricky business. I don't think that Janet Yellen's hiding anything at all.

So, even though technically June 1st is the deadline here, realistically, they can't leave it to the last minute. There does need to be some kind of framework for a deal this week, because of course, Kevin McCarthy has to then sell it to his caucus. That's gonna take time, as well.

My concern is that, you know, things don't really fall apart even if we have a technical default in early June. I mean, they might. Again, they might because we might see markets really react, or it might be that there's a bunch of bills that aren't paid in early June and they get delayed and that's disruptive. But if the markets don't freak out, it won't be the catastrophe people have been hearing about, but that catastrophe will still come. So, I think that's the most important thing to realize is whether markets freak out on this Friday, whether they freak out on June 1st, whether they freak out on June 4th, I don't know when that's going to be. But if they don't raise this debt ceiling, and we've got serious problems making payments as we go through the summer, then we're gonna see really catastrophic effects on not just the U.S. economy, but I think the reason people are worried around the globe is that will spill over into the global economy.",

So, the judges made clear that this is not a gag order. He said that the former president is allowed to defend himself on these charges. He's allowed to discuss any information that's in the public domain. But what the judge is saying he's not allowed to do is use any material that are handed over by prosecutors. That could be things such as witness statements or grand jury testimony, and Trump cannot post that on social media. You know, there are also rules about and restrictions about what kind of evidence Trump can see. So, he can view some materials that were made off of copies of cell phones of some witnesses, including Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, but he can only view that in the -- when he's with his attorneys. He can't make copies, he can't transcribe that. Now, this is at the request of prosecutors, and the hearing today is also at the request of prosecutors because they want the judge to explain to the former president exactly what this protective order includes, so there can be no misinterpretations about it. And also to explain to Trump what the potential consequences could be if he violates the court order. Now, we also expect to learn what the trial date will be in this case. The judge asked both sides to work together to come up with a date in next February or March of when that they will potentially go to trial here. So, we'll learn, hopefully, some more information about when this case will actually go to trial, Zain.",

And though the report concluded that there's not enough evidence to say that it is safe, and they did note that there are some benefits, they detailed a huge number of potential risks here just looking at the available body of evidence. And this is really concerning to them given the ubiquity of social media among kids. They cited one study that showed up to 95 percent of kids ages 13 to 17 say they use social media. And even though the age of 13 is really the minimum age usually required for a lot of these sites, they say 40 percent of kids ages 8 to 12 say that they already use social media. And so, when they looked at the risks and the benefits, you know, the benefits, they say these things can create communities and help kids, you know, meet other peers, especially in marginalized groups, which can be really helpful. But in terms of the risks, they cited studies showing links to depression and anxiety, disruptions in their, you know, helpful things to do, like getting enough sleep, things like online harassment and of course low self- esteem.
