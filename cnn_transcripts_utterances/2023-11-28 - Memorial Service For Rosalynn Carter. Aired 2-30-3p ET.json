But she was made for these long journeys and she was made to summit these mountains. As they said before, when she started in politics, she'd never talked to a group of people bigger than her Sunday School class. And then she elected her governor and president. She shaped our national policies. She faced down dictators herself on issues of human rights. She built the Carter Center from an idea into a powerhouse, human rights. And as the chair of that board, I've watched her do it. And it's because she poured out her love. All over the world and especially, as Kathy said, the end of the road. Her 122 countries included Liberia and Mali and Sudan. And it was natural for her to open up her heart to those people not with pity but as partners. And she knew in those communities and recognized that ancient steel from rural women who carried their children from their communities on their backs. Whether they're from a 600-person town in south Georgia or South Sudan. As the song says, she knew what comes back when you give your love away. And for my grandmother, what came back was this unshakeable strength and this powerful faith and not just an abiding love but a fierce, determined adventurous love that sustained her on all of these long journeys. Journeys, like Kathy mentioned of her Guinea Worm eradication, which has taken almost 40 years. But the Carter Center's unwavering efforts and her powerful partners in these tiny villages took a disease that affected three and a half million people every year in the poorest parts of the world. And this year there won't be millions of cases, Paw-Paw. This year, we've had seven total cases. And we're in the last mile because she could see far. And she kept going, was not afraid of these long journeys. Her advocacy for mental health was a 50-year climb that is as remarkable as any other and has been mentioned already. But if you imagine just how far our society has come in the last five years on issues of mental health and you think that she decided in 1970 to tackle the ancient stigma associated with mental illness, it is remarkable how far she could see and how far she was willing to walk. And that effort changed lives and it saved lives, including in my own family. She was made for these long journeys. The Rosalynn Carter Institute helps caregivers because you can't journey alone. Even the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail goes through 3,000 gardens from Mexico to Canada to help monarch butterflies on their journeys. John Lewis once said that in all of his marches, he only really learned one thing: Don't let them turn you around. That was my grandmother to a \"T.\" One of my last memories of her was in a hospital. We were there for my grandfather, but she had her own physical limitations that made it hard for her to walk. She had to practice. She was ready to go for one of these walks and she picked up this cane, and I looked at the cane. She looked at me and she said, \"You know, it's not a cane.\" And I said -- she said, \"It's a trekking pole.\" (LAUGHTER)",

Governor, she said, she would say thank you. But I want to tell you something. To all the staff, she would say thank you. But there's somebody in here that's very important and only them are going to get what I'm about to say. There are some folks that make all this possible. Their sole mission is to make sure you get home safe. For 46 years, the men and women of the Secret Service has made sure that she got home safe. For 46 years, they left their families and traveled with Rosalynn to make sure, Garth, that she got home safe. For 46 years, they gave themselves. Jason, they had ice cream, peanut butter ice cream. They did all the things that she did. For 46 years, they made sure she got home safe. I want to tell each and every one of them, she would tell you, thank you, you got me home safe. (APPLAUSE)",
