We've talked about that for years, and that has never occurred.I think the question that I've got is how will he react to Joe Biden if Joe Biden gets under his skin? How will he react, because there's no audience there that he can play off of? How will he react if his mic is shut off? Will that anger him? I mean, we don't know the answer to those questions, but what we do know is that Biden is not going to let up on him. I mean, one of the best points of the first debate of 2020, lots of people say, is when Biden told Donald Trump just to shut up because he couldn't get a word in, edgewise. So, you know, we'll have to see how Biden behaves and how Trump responds. Scott Jennings is with us as well.

He was measured. He had command of the facts. He won several exchanges with Joe Biden. He had a much better debate. Of course, by then, as we all know, the election was basically over. He had cratered in the first debate. Millions of people had already voted. And the thing -- the die was cast, as they say.So, if I were them, that's what I'd be thinking about. Replicate debate number two, throw away debate number one, because if you do that again, that's a bad day. BLITZER: Ashley Allison is with us as well.

And I don't think Joe Biden is going to let that go unmentioned. I think it's going to be a key part of this debate.And, again, the question I have is how much of this gets under Donald Trump's skin and how does he react to that? He is not used to being attacked by the people around him, nor has he debated -- don't forget, he didn't debate during the primaries. He hasn't had any practice at debating.

What Trump has to do is pivot to the things that actually sit at the top of the issues list, inflation, economy, immigration. That's why Joe Biden has a low approval rating right now. And what Trump has to do is pivot out of this infirm ground and pivot to the firm ground. But the only way to do it is with the facts. He has to be better, well-armed with the facts than Biden has proven to be.Remember, when he sat down with Aaron Burnett, the president said a lot of falsehoods about inflation and the economy. Trump's got to get him backpedaling on that. That's the firm ground for Donald Trump. So, that's what Republicans are hoping for, a long debate about the economy.",

I want to bring in former Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts Kerry Healey. She was involved in prepping both Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan prepare for their debates. Kerry, thanks so much for joining us. More specifically, back in 2012, you helped Paul Ryan in the vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Joe Biden. Walk us through what that is like. KERRY HEALEY, ROMNEY 2012 CAMPAIGN ADVISER: Well, it's very interesting. I mean, that was probably a very different type of preparation than what you see between these two very experienced debaters now and people who are literally and have been incumbent presidents now. But for Paul Ryan, it was a question of making sure that he understood all of the issues, that he could address all of the difficult policy questions that might be thrown his way. And, quite frankly, one of the things that we were dealing with was this idea that Biden was such a good debater, and that he had so much energy, and he simply was overflowing verbally. And we thought perhaps then maybe one of the advantages that we would have would be that he would get carried away and go outside the boundaries of his preparation and say something that would be surprising and detrimental to the campaign. But we saw the energy. We didn't see the mistake.",

But there are signs that she's skeptical about the special counsel's request.CNN's Katelyn Polantz is in Fort Pierce, Florida, for us. We're also joined by CNN's Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Andrew McCabe. Katelyn, Judge Aileen Cannon appeared skeptical of a gag order for Donald Trump today. Tell us about that. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes. Wolf, much of the questioning from Judge Cannon this afternoon of the prosecutors was how they would be able to link the threats of Trump supporters toward the FBI and federal officials, law enforcement to the words of Donald Trump himself. So, the Justice Department has come to the court and is arguing here that Donald Trump has created an environment around his supporters that makes a significant, imminent and foreseeable danger for the law enforcement officials that are part of the FBI. They've used examples of a man who fired a nail gun into an FBI office, another person who was threatening an FBI agent. And so pulling that all together, they're saying to the judge, please limit Donald Trump, a criminal defendant, limit his speech and ensure the safety of the law enforcement officials from the FBI that took part in the August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. But Judge Cannon has a lot of questions that does make her appear quite skeptical of whether she would do this and impose a gag order on Donald Trump. Here's a little bit of what that questioning sounded like. So, Prosecutor David Harbach asking, the government is at a loss to conceive why Mr. Trump would say something so false, so inconceivable, or inviting a violence about law enforcement officials taking part in that search. Judge Cannon then asks, where do you see a call for violence? And David Harbach, the prosecutor, responded that there are posts and comments by Trump that ultimately result in all types of terrible things. But she is asking them to make the link and to potentially even go back to the drawing board, get more information and bring it to her in the courtroom.",

And in this case, he has clearly done that to the people who participated in the search in Mar-a-Lago, those FBI agents and really any FBI agents by drawing attention to this false claim that the FBI tried to assassinate him. That is definitely a dog whistle to his supporters to come out and do something to defend him.However, gag orders are very, very tough things for courts to have to deal with. And they generally disfavor gag orders that are that are broad and not clearly defined. If you compare what the prosecutors are asking for here, which is a general prohibition to keep him from talking about the FBI or law enforcement, compare that to the gag order in the New York case that we just saw concluded. There, it was very specific. Donald Trump himself was talking about the judge, the judge's family and other people in the court and potentially witnesses, and he was restricted from talking about those individuals. So in a situation like that, it is narrowly tailored and very clear, easy to administer. In the Florida case, it's not quite as clear. And I think the judge is probably not going to come down on the prosecutor's side.",
