In the first place we are used to these types of travel delays, but what was unexpected is that there were delays in the healthcare sector as well. So the NHS, the National Health Service here, said in the statement earlier today that nearly all GP practices, so that's your local doctor here, all of them were impacted. Their booking systems were impacted. One of Europe's largest medical facilities, it's in Germany had to cancel all non-emergency operations. You also mentioned the media here in the UK; Sky News was off the air this morning when it comes to those doctors again, patients describing just pen and paper at this point for doctors to be able to prescribe. So it really takes everyone back and creates that huge backlog that already exists in the health sector across Europe.

Now in 2016, it was hired to look at the Russian hacking of U.S. Democratic National Committee Computers. Alright, so people around the world are stuck seeing this, that image behind me right now is cold, the blue screen of death. All right, joining me now to explain what's going on is Professor of Cybersecurity at Monash University, Nigel Phair, joining us from Canberra, Australia. So thank you so much for taking the time. I think everyone's wondering how this could have happened. And if you dig a little deeper, this is just a software update that clearly had some kind of error in it.

So in these instances, we really need to think about how do we deploy our staff? Do they use different devices? This is only a Microsoft issue. It's not a Mac issue.

There was acknowledgement that he has slipped in the polls against Former President Donald Trump acknowledgement that it has been a tough several weeks and days for the campaign. But also, she forcefully defended where they are and the fact that the President is going to remain in the race. Now, of course, their sources have been telling CNN that this has certainly not been easy, and that there really are still concerns around the President's viability as the Democratic candidate, and he has been increasingly isolated, is his group of inner advisors has gotten even tighter. So all of this as the president also looks over polling and looks at and has cast out over polling that shows him not being able to defeat Former President Donald Trump. Now, of course, as we are hearing, almost in real time from the Biden campaign chair they are digging in. And we have similarly heard that from sources who maintain that this is where this is headed, the president will not be stepping down. But the other realities that they face, and ones that they were asked about are that donors are not prepared to give big dollar checks right now, given all of the questions over the president's candidacy, and that there are high profile Democrats who are casting doubt over whether the president really is up to the task here. And so this is all really happening in real time and still very much unfolding.

So we're seeing that at Heathrow, the services, some of the servers down a few outages here, much more disruption at Gatwick and Stansted. But really across the board looking at Europe, I mean, it's hard to find an airport perhaps that isn't impacted in some ways. Some airlines have more impact than others. But we're looking at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport with KLM saying it's been making flight handling impossible airports in Berlin and Paris and Lisbon and Madrid. So you just have to imagine all those people wanting to fly away for holidays, people getting married this weekend, all those people that are having disruption.

The delegation was led by Russia's Deputy Defense Minister North Korean state media says the two sides discussed military cooperation. Kim also expressed firm support for Russia's war in Ukraine.

An American journalist has been found guilty of spying by a Russian court. Russian media reports Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security colony. Gershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip for \"The Wall Street Journal\" and Yekaterinburg in 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. The American journalist had pleaded not guilty of espionage. For more on this, let's turn to CNN's Matthew Chance. He is standing by for us in London. Matthew, it's a story we've been covering and watching very closely. And finally, you know, found guilty of spying 16 years is what he's facing.

You mentioned Brittney Griner, she was swapped for a notorious Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout in a very high profile exchange just months after she was detained. But of course there are other examples of American citizens that are held in Russian jails, where it's not been possible to achieve a prisoner exchange or a prison swap. Paul Whelan was arrested back in 2018. He's serving a 16 year prison sentence as well, for you know, basically for spying charges as well. And it's been six years they've been trying to organize a prisoner swap with him. And that's been unsuccessful. You know, look, I think Evan Gershkovich trial there are a lot of cases, a lot of pressure on the Russian authorities and a lot of impetus on the part of the U.S. to try and get something across the line in terms of a prisoner swap. But again, you know, these are very delicate negotiations and it could be some time before anything is agreed.",
