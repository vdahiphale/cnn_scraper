Now, that they've all been arrested, they have the ability to start making filings in this case and also they have the ability and the need to enter their initial pleading, so it's very likely that many of them will plead not guilty, if not all, at least initially people could always plead out.Donald Trump, of course, is expected to enter a pleading of not guilty to start things off in this case and hold that the whole way through trial. He wants to go to trial and then that's the next thing that they're going to be talking about very likely, when a trial would happen, will it be all of these 19 defendants together or whoever many - however many end up going to trial ultimately or will the case get split up in different regards, either having some people tried earlier, some people tried later, potentially some of the proceedings here happening in federal court, that's the other question on the table too. There are several different people who say that they had a role in the federal government or they were acting at the direction of the federal government fake electors. Mark Meadows is the chief of staff, Jeffrey Clark from the Justice Department, those - all of those defendants are seeking ways to get their case moved somehow to federal court. That is going to be teed up in a hearing on Monday for Mark Meadows, but we are going to be watching and seeing just how this plays out. The dynamics between all of those defendants one by one making their own decisions and Donald Trump, does he keep them all in the fold and so this case moves together as a - as one monolith or does it get split up.",

And it seems to me that they're all - in effect, already cooperating with the district attorney. They might have - they should have taken a plea deal earlier, as their fellow electors did, because each of them are saying exactly what the District Attorney wants to hear them say, which is we were directed by President Trump.
