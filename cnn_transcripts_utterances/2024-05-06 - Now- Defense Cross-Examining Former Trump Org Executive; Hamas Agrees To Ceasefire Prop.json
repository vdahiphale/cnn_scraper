And it's also getting to this idea that we call him a fixer.We knew what Michael Cohen did, he was a conciliary for Trump. But in his email signature, it says that he was an attorney for Trump. So defense attorneys are going to seize on that and say, look, it's not like this idea that he was being paid for legal services. Is it that far-fetched? Even if it was hush money, even if it was other things that he was doing, they're going to insist that during the time that he was paid, that he was doing sort of his version of legal work for Trump. Unclear if that's going to be successful, but that's where they're going to take this.",

These are the people he chose, who he -- the journalist he befriended was David Pecker.

When they're watching, you know, Emil Bove, the Trump attorney who's questioning them right now, he's been quite tough on this witness, saying, you didn't really talk to Trump that much.You never saw him in New York after he became president. And you didn't speak to him these three successive years. What do you think is the tactic in the Trump defense team's strategy here and how they're questioning him and creating that distance?",

So they have sort of a multipronged approach they're going to take here.

This is only his second day being there.Trump's attorney from the civil fraud trial, which he lost, what was also -- is also in the room today, along with another attorney, Boris Epshteyn, who was indicted recently in Arizona in that fake electors scheme.

And that is really what will make or break.Now, I would argue that the prosecutors haven't actually made their case yet, so there's nothing to break. But if they do, undercutting Michael Cohen is Todd Blanche's number one priority. I also want to say, Karen was talking about what they noticed, so we have an update. The defense attorney asked whether it was 60 million in unrestricted cash. McConney replied, at least. They're talking about how much money Trump had in his accounts at this time. Trump's decorum in the courtroom, talking about things that jurors noticed has been a complete 180 from what we saw in the civil cases where he would mutter under his breath. He would sort of make sarcastic comments. He was incredibly disruptive, as was his attorney. So they've definitely taken a different approach. The defense attorney notes that the accounting system used by the Trump organization was, quote, \"antiquated\" by 2017, and that it had been designed in the 1990s.",

All this accounting stuff you just laid out for us, did you ever discuss this with Donald J. Trump? He said no. In fact, surprisingly, he said he didn't speak with Donald Trump at all. And I think the year's 2016, '17, and '18. So they're trying to distance Trump.The second thing they're arguing, as to why was this money repaid to Michael Cohen, this $420,000. They're arguing, essentially, Michael Cohen had his hand in the cookie jar here. Michael Cohen saw this sort of antiquated system, with a lot of flux and chaos, where there's an open legal matter, actually, and they're arguing Michael Cohen came up with this scheme to enrich himself basically.",

But I do want to caveat this news with the fact that we are only at this point hearing from Hamas. We have yet to hear from the mediators, from the United States or from the Israeli government. But Hamas did just release a statement on their official telegram channel saying that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, has made a phone call to the Qatari Prime Minister as well as to the Egyptian Minister of Intelligence, Abbas Kamel, and quote, \"Informed them of Hamas's agreement to their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreements.\"Now, as we understand it, there has been this latest Egyptian framework on the table which could see the release of between 20 to 33 Israeli hostages over several weeks that there would be a weekslong pause in the fighting during that time and that ultimately this would lead to a much longer term ceasefire perhaps as long as a year, perhaps even longer. And that is the proposal that was on the table. The Israelis had made a number of concessions in this that they previously had not agreed to, including allowing unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza. But this is a framework proposal. Now, our understanding was that if Hamas agreed to this, there would still be several more days at least of negotiations in order to get to a final deal. So, it appears that Hamas here has agreed to the framework that the Egyptians had put on the table. It's not clear whether any changes have been made to that framework since it was first presented to Hamas over the weekend. And so those are the kinds of details that are going to be really crucial to determining whether or not this is something that Israel can agree to and whether it can actually lead to a final deal.",
