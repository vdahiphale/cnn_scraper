Trump secured the $175 million bond, keeping the state's A.G. from pursuing his assets and bank accounts until after his appeal is settled. This is a win for him.The L though for Trump's legal team, overnight, the judge and his criminal hush money trial slapped the former president with an expanded gag order, saying his rhetoric is a very real threat. Last week, he was barred from talking about potential witnesses, and now the order has been widened to stop him from attacking family members of the judge and the Manhattan D.A. The judge's daughter has a main target for Trump on social media, attacking her by name several times. CNN's Steve Contorno is joining us now. President Trump going back on the trail today, his rallies have really been a place for him to go wild against the legal system. What do you think he's going to do? How will he handle this today? Do you think that the gag order, potentially, he will break it?",

      "sentences": "Sara, we know that the purpose of these events in Michigan and in Wisconsin is to get him in front of voters and talk about issues that his campaign believes will be factors in the November election, especially immigration and public safety. In fact, his speech in Michigan is being marketed as a remark about the U.S. southern border.But to your point, you attend these Trump rallies and they often go on, he speaks for sometimes 90 minutes, and there is a large section of that speech that is often dedicated to attacking the judicial system, the judges, prosecutors who are going after him. For example, I was recently in Rome, Georgia, and during his remarks there, he spent quite a bit of time attacking D.A. Fani Willis there and the case against him in Georgia. So, I would expect that he will continue to find ways to continue that kind of line of remarks and those kind line of attacks, maybe still being careful not to go against the gag order. But there are four indictments he is facing. He is facing dozens of charges, there is ample space for him to attack the judicial system. We have also seen him in the past attack the gag order itself, not only in this New York case, but in another special prosecutor case as well. So, yes, the president and his team especially wants him to talk about these issues that are so important, that they believe will be so important to voters in November. But the former president often goes off script, and when he does, he is on the attack, Sara.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. The prosecution's witness list in this case, we will see several witnesses that are from Trump's orbit around the time of the 2016 election, and that includes people who worked for his campaign team at the time, like you mentioned, Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway.But we also expect to hear from people like Michael Cohen, who is Trump's former fixer. He's obviously been deeply involved in this case from the beginning. We expect to hear from Stormy Daniels. She's obviously the porn star who allegedly was paid these hush money payments to cover up an alleged affair she had with Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. But Hope Hicks is a really interesting potential witness here because of her proximity to Donald Trump at the time. As you mentioned, she is one of Trump's -- she was once considered one of Trump's most trusted confidants, and she also was around and can provide insight into what was happening inside Trump's political operation around the time that these payments were allegedly being made. A federal search warrant actually put Hope Hicks on the phone with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in 2019, around this time, and the FBI believes that those calls were about Stormy Daniels and about payments to her. So, we'll have to see, as you mentioned, this comes as the gag order against Donald Trump in this case has been expanded to include family members of the judge and of the prosecutors. But also remember, too, the gag order applies to witnesses in this case, so we'll have to see if Donald Trump can restrain himself from publicly attacking witnesses, especially ones that were previously very close to him.",

And that's paused until at least September when Donald Trump will start the appeals process and appeal to verdict in this civil case.But, look, I mean, this is effectively a win, as Sara mentioned earlier, for Donald Trump. It's a significantly reduced amount that he had to post for bond. But we'll have to wait and see. I mean, it is a temporary win, though a win for Donald Trump.",

The IDF says that it is reviewing the incident at the highest levels. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Jerusalem.

And when the ratings come out we will most assuredly realize that millions of people tuned in to watch this latest chapter of this on-court rivalry that centers around her and LSU's Angel Reese.It has been so good for this game. These two squads meeting in front of this electric, sold out crowd in Albany, and Clark, as I mentioned, was just ready from the jump. I mean, she hit a three to open up the scoring. She hit nine threes in all. She was completely locked in. She tied the NCAA women's record for most threes in a single tournament game. And then you had Angel Rees. She's got this trademark physicality that is so impressive. It was on full display. I mean, she ended the night with 17 points and 20 rebounds. The game was so fast-paced and you could just see how badly both teams wanted it. In the end it, was Iowa earning a second straight Final Four appearance with that 94-87 win.

I mean, they've had a slew of injuries, which has made what they're doing all the more remarkable.
