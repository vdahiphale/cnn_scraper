Amini died in the custody of Iran's morality police, after she was detained for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly.On Friday, the U.S. and other countries marked the anniversary by announcing a raft of new sanctions against Iranian individuals and entities. Demonstrations went on for months after Amini's death. But over time, protests were viciously suppressed with hundreds killed and thousands detained. Iran has reportedly increased security measures ahead of the anniversary but rallies to honor Mahsa Amini are planned in several international cities. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: Maziar Bahari is a publisher for the pro-reform news outlet IranWire. He joins us live via Skype from London. A very warm welcome. A very somber anniversary a year on. What has Mahsa Amini's death in police custody changed inside Iran and what has it revealed about Iranian society?",

On the contrary, the government, the regime, the Revolutionary Guards, the police, the military have been preparing themselves to stop the protests from happening again. Since a few months ago, I had a chat with a friend of mine -- a couple of friends in Iran this morning and they are saying that the police, the Revolutionary Guards, plainclothes officers, the paramilitary are everywhere in order to stop people from coming to the streets. But on the other hand, we see that people, trying to lead a normal life. In fact, what's the legacy of Mahsa Amini's death and the protests is this aspiration to lead a normal life. Leading a normal life, not wearing your hijab, talking to whoever you want to, studying whatever you want to, doing whatever you want to is a revolutionary act in Iran. Women, when I talk to my friends in Iran, they are saying that almost five out of 10 women in Iran are not wearing the veil anymore. And the police do not have the resources to stop them. So their legacy is really multilayered.",

They live in Iran mostly, so the sanctions are really symbolic. But there are other sanctions that are not fully carried out. Right now, we see many corrupt Iranians with ties to the regime, they have very good lives in Toronto, in Vancouver, in London, in Dubai. And for whatever reason, the local governments do not pay attention to these local, to these corrupt officials with the ties to the Iranian government, corrupt businessmen and women who are bankrolling the government.

But it's not only Mother Nature's wrath that's to blame for these apocalyptic scenes in Derna. KARADSHEH (on-camera): Right up there is where the dams were. When they burst, it unleashed all that water. The floods that swept entire neighborhoods like this into the sea. And you can see the force of the water when you look at buildings like this and you can see how high the waves were. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Waves as high as 22 feet or seven meters submerged buildings and the current so strong destroyed almost everything in its path and washed it all into the sea. The Mediterranean turned into a graveyard for the people of Derna. How many lives lost here? [03:10:00] KARADSHEH (voice-over): No one really knows but it's in the thousands. The ones crystal clear blue waters now murky and brown tell the grim story of a city that once was of those gone young and old. Children, a few months old, elderly people, pregnant women, they're in the sea, 21-year-old Abdel Wahab tells us. With nothing but a rope tied around his waist, he pulled 40 bodies on the first day, he says. There are other bodies, we don't know how to get them out. We just don't have any equipment, he says. Derna's gone, you won't see it again. They've gotten some help since. International support has been slowly trickling in but nowhere near enough to deal with a disaster on this scale. It's mostly Libyans here, volunteers from every corner of this bitterly divided country, foes who fought each other for years, united in grief, doing what they can to mend the wounds of this broken city. Most are here to try and give the dead a dignified end. It's not the time to lay blame for what happened, many say. But the dams had not been maintained for decades, residents say. Had they been, Derna and its people may still be standing. Nearly a week on, emotions here still so raw. Tarek and his family climbed on top of the water tanks on their roof. They all survived but most of his neighbors did not. There are 12 to 15 homes on our street. We lost 33 people, he tells us. He then starts to name the dead. Entire families gone. It's all just too much. Libyans know loss and death all too well. But nothing could have prepared them for this -- Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Derna, Libya. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Of course, Ukraine was one of the global leaders in the production of grain, exported grain. And that all has been curtailed in terms of how they get the grain out of the country. It used to be through the Black Sea but now they have to go through land routes in Europe. What these countries want, is for the grain to be sold locally in their markets. So they are looking for the Ukraine to find a plan in which they will not inundate those markets, which would be punishing to the local farmers. So this is much more about protecting the local farmers, who do not want the extra grain on the market, to manipulate the prices, than it is about punishing Ukraine.",

North Korea, on the other hand, may be in need of more advanced technology. It could need money, food, something to come from Russia. Also worth pointing out, China, where I am, representatives from China and Russia recently made a venture togather to North Korea.
