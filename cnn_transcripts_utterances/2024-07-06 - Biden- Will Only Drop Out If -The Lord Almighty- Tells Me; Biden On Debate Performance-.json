It all illustrates the heightened tension within this party as at the moment as the president and those top party officials are trying to chart the path forward where they want to try to beat Trump in November. But so many questions still swirling for president Biden about the future of his candidacy.

I'm the only guy who -- you know, who can beat, who has beaten him. And I think that there's -- you know, there's that kind of very personal view about why he is digging in his heels. But I also think, you know, there is the dynamic where he has always felt that kind of the party is in a dilemma if he steps aside, where people around Biden have always been uncertain that Kamala Harris could beat Donald Trump, but they've also been uncertain that the party could rally and unify, behind anyone if they go through the process of replacing the first female woman of color, you know, on the on the national ticket.

But I am dubious that a top tier candidate who most Democrats would think would have a better chance would actually get in the race against her, and risk their long term standing with important constituents in the party, including women's groups and civil rights groups and Black voters.If Democrats, who are skeptical of Biden going forward, can scale that first mountain of nudging him out of the race, I'm not sure there's going to be a lot of appetite for climbing up the second mountain of getting past her. I actually think it could consolidate behind her to a much greater and much faster extent than anybody would have thought possible a few days ago.

He says, quote, \"It's time for President Biden to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological testing and share his results.\" Here's more now from Sanjay.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously, it's certainly up to the president and frankly, any patient, whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But I should point out that the testing shouldn't be thought of as something that would embarrass or malign, but rather -- maybe provide some answers to what is driving some of the signs and symptoms we've seen with President Biden and maybe even provide an opportunity for some early treatment. It could provide a baseline something that could be tracked and followed over time so that you could find early signs of any kind of deficit, maybe even before the person themselves recognized it. Or sometimes this testing just provides peace of mind that there is nothing to worry about. I should also point out that in the United States, there is a cognitive exam that is usually recommended for anyone over the age of 65 as part of their annual wellness checkup. Anyone over the age of 65 going through about an hour's worth of cognitive testing, physical exam, patient history to try and figure out are there cognitive deficits that can be addressed early? What I think has been driving some of the concerns since the debate among many of my colleagues in medicine was some of the things they saw for a sustained and sort of protracted time during the debate, the differences in speech, the halting of speech, the confused rambling, sometimes that occurred. But also what they saw when President Biden seemed to not have any facial expression. I think it's why so many people have said cognitive testing as well as movement disorder testing could be potentially beneficial. As you certainly heard by now the White House said, look, it was a bad night. That's basically what it was. It was a bad night. He was jet lagged to some extent. He had not been getting enough sleep and he had a cold. And those things certainly can cause episodes like we saw. But again, the question is, is this episodic or is this reflective of something that is more significant? We do know, finally, that he did have a fairly complete exam back in February. But a cognitive test was not part of that exam. They ruled out things like stroke, like multiple sclerosis, and they made note that he did not have Parkinson's disease. But there are other things that can cause Parkinsonism besides Parkinson's disease, and they didn't really mention that. So I think there are still a lot of unanswered questions. But again, it is up to the president and any patient whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But there are many reasons it could be beneficial. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At the same time, they are preparing potential contingencies in the extraordinary event that the president of the United States decides ultimately not to run for President after all. They have been pouring over briefing books, looking at some of the potential Democratic contenders who may emerge as a replacement for Joe Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and California Governor Gavin Newsom. At the same time, we're seeing a bit of a strategy change from the Trump campaign and his allies when it comes to Vice President Kamala Harris. Both the Trump campaign and an aligned Super PAC called MAGA Inc. have attacked Harris in recent days. They are suggesting that she would carry as much of the burden from the past 4 years as Joe Biden would, and they would attack her equally on crime, inflation and immigration. We've also heard an interesting line of attack from a Trump advisor who said that they would probably try to knock Harris down by suggesting that she was hiding information from the public about Joe Biden's mental acuity and his physical decline. Steve Contorno, St. Petersburg, Florida, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE) [01:40:00] HOLMES: Donald Trump's legal team now aiming to put the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity into effect for their benefit. In a filing on Friday, Trump's attorneys say they want an updated schedule in the federal classified documents case in Florida. They want to argue points related to the Supreme Court's decision last Monday, which conferred broad immunity to presidents for official acts. The new filing is likely to further delay an already slow road to trial in Judge Aileen Cannon's courtroom. The Trump appointed judge has yet to decide a number of pretrial matters. They include a motion from the former president's team to dismiss most of the charges. Trump's lawyers claim he has immunity for his decision to remove classified records from the White House in the final hours of his presidency, and then not return them. Israel says gaps still remain in a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. An Israeli delegation is set to return to Doha next week after meeting with mediators in Qatar on Friday.
