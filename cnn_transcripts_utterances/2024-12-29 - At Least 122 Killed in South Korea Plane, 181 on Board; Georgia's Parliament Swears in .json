I'm Kim Brunhuber.The latest now on our breaking news, investigators have recovered the flight data recorder from the Jeju Air flight that crashed in South Korea, but they're still trying to find the plane's voice recorder. 181 people were on board the Boeing 737-800 when it crash landed at the Muan International Airport. Rescue workers have confirmed the deaths of 122 people. Two crew members were rescued and officials say the rest of the passengers and crew are presumed dead. Now, this video shows the plane dragging along the runway with no landing gear in sight. Moments later, the plane burst into flames. South Korean officials say the jet made a call shortly after the control tower warned about birds in the area. CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio is following this breaking news from Seoul. So, Mike, let's just expand on what I was just saying there about what we were hearing from the control tower. We're getting more details about what might have happened. Take us through.",

      "sentences": "That's right. We have six crucial minutes, Kim, that are coming into focus. This is courtesy of the Land and Transportation Ministry, one of the entities here in South Korea that is involved in this crash investigation.So, we want to bring you to 8:57 in the morning local time. That's when the control tower is talking with this Boeing 737-800 saying, hey, there are birds in the area of one of our runways. There's the possibility of bird strikes. We just want to warn you that this could be a possibility of happening. So, that is at 8:57. 8:59, a mayday is called from the cock. We don't know what exactly happened at that point, but it's a two-minute gap that this happened between the warning and the mayday. And then at 9:03, that's when the crash happens. So, you know, Kim, we've been talking about in the past couple hits with you, as we've been updating our viewers over the past few hours, that people have gone out of their way in terms of emergency responders briefing the media and people who have been in positions of government authority saying that bird strike could be a possibility that led to a cascading series of events that caused this plane to crash. But when we look at the video, we were just talking about this here in the bureau a couple minutes ago, bird strike, you know, these things are potentially intention here. How does a bird strike explain flaps not being up on the wings that slowed the plane down? How does a bird strike explain the plane coming down pretty far down in the runway? How does a bird strike explain so many other things that were part of the final moments of this aircraft? Dave Soucie, one of our experts, for his part, has been mentioning over the past couple hours why there were all of these pieces of equipment at the end of the runway that this plane crashed into. And then we see that huge cataclysmic explosion in the distance that's been recorded by myriad people and, you know, so many channels here throughout South Korea. So, one of the things that could potentially help answer all of these questions are the two people who survived, a man and a woman, crew members of this Jeju Airline flight that were sitting in the back of the plane who did manage to survive. We don't have any confirmation from authorities as to whether or not they have been interviewed yet. We don't have confirmation on what their conditions are. But, again, the miraculous state of affairs exists that they were able to leave the plane and survive this horrible crash. As far as we've also been able to confirm, Kim, we have to Thai nationals and the rest of the people on board are from South Korea, most of the families in the area of where the plane went down. It's about a 3.5, 4, 5, if there's traffic, hour drive south of Seoul, the capital of South Korea. So, still so many questions that remain to be answered, so many circumstances that aren't exactly adding up here. And then I'll leave you with this. We have new information from the Land and Transportation Ministry, and they're saying that this investigation could take up to two, potentially three years. There will be, of course, so much pressure on the ministry to come up with some sort of solution or statement as to what went wrong here because we find ourselves in South Korea, in the context of a country that has gone through martial law for six hours on December 3rd into the morning of December 4th, we're on our third person who is exercising presidential powers. You know, the country has been so through so much to add this on top of everything right after the Christmas season, as we approach the new year, you know, it is weighing heavily on so many across South Korea.

In some cases, I've known investigations to last four and five years, depending on the complexity and whether you've got the flight recorders or not. In this case, I'm certain we'll have the cockpit voice recorder.South Korea, like all nations, needs to make a preliminary report within 30 days. Now, that preliminary report can be as simple as saying we had a plane crash and that's all they need to say. But, clearly, I mean, Korea is a very responsible -- South Korea is a very responsible country, and any safety issues will immediately be flagged. And the other dynamic to this is that Boeing-Jeju Airlines, the manufacturers of the engine, which is CFM International, which is a joint venture between General Electric and SNECMA of France, all of those bodies are very responsible. So, they will be wanting to get out lessons from this terrible tragedy as quickly as possible to the wider aviation community. So, it'll be -- all the information will go out through Boeing and all the engine makers to all operators of 737s and more widely to all operators of aircraft because I think there's going to be some human resource cockpit factors to come out of this terrible tragedy. BRUNHUBER:  Yes, so important, because, as you say, the 737 is such a workhorse in the industry. So many of us use it every day to travel. So, we certainly need answers as soon as possible.

All right, to Tbilisi, Georgia now, where the parliament has sworn in the controversial new president, Mikheil Kavelashvili. He didn't win a general election, rather he was appointed by the parliament. Opposition parties have labeled the procedure illegitimate based on unfair parliamentary elections. The directly elected former president spoke to supporters who oppose what the ruling Georgia Dream Party is doing. She calls it an anti- constitutional farce. And there have been weeks of protests calling for new elections to set things right and to put the country back on track to negotiate joining the European Union. As the Biden administration winds down here in the U.S., newly released images are raising doubts about the president's claim that he never had any business related contact with his son.

So, that completes the two elements of the black box system, the data recorder and the voice recorder that have now been found by authorities.So, they're hoping that with those two components, survivors, the miracle of the morning that with two crew members who survived and the two components of the black box system, that can paint an accurate portrait of what happened with so many confusing elements and things in tension with this storyline. But we do have some clarity as to the tick tock, the minute-by-minute event, of what happened this morning. So, 8:57 in the morning local time, that's when the control tower sent out a warning saying, hey, bird strikes could be possible in and around the runway. Watch out for birds that are near the airport. 8:59, that's when a mayday call, was sent out from the cockpit. And then 9:03 in the morning, that's when the crash happened. Authorities from the Land and Transportation Ministry to the head of the fire department have both said that bird strike could have been a contributing factor to this crash. But, Kim, why that is seemingly in tension with other elements of this crash, a bird strike, according to our experts who have been speaking with us throughout the morning and afternoon, that seemingly would not explain why landing gear was not deployed on the underbelly of the plane, why the plane landed pretty far down the runway, why we don't see any of the flaps deployed on the aircraft wings that helped to slow down the aircraft. So, one of the questions that investigators will be asking is whether or not potentially a bird strike, and we emphasize potentially, could have caused some sort of cascading episode that led to the disaster that we see in all of these catastrophic images. We can also report, since the last time we talked to you, Kim, that one of the surviving crew members has been taken to a hospital here in Seoul, and then the other surviving crew member remains in a hospital in Muan where the disaster took place. Two nationals on board are of Thai citizenship, the rest are from South Korea, in and around the area where the crash happened. So, there are still ongoing work in the area. It's interesting, it was called rescue work, according to the Korean English translation of the last news briefing that we had, I stress rescue work, even though firefighters on the ground have stressed that they do not see any more miraculous situations panning out with anybody else surviving from this horrendous crash. But that was the word or the phrase that was used that rescue work is continuing. The airport is going to be closed at least until Wednesday, 5:00 A.M., New Year's Day, but the briefing that just wrapped up a couple minutes ago said that that timeline could shift ever so slightly depending on the work that's happening on the ground in the days to come.

I was inside the palace gates as she came out to speak. And it was actually a dramatic moment because she was dressed in a white coat, a red shirt, kind of echoing the Georgian flag. There was a very large crowd that was outside at the gates of the palace and she began to speak to them. She spoke for about a half an hour.And to set the scene, this is literally a five-minute walk from the parliament building where at that very moment, the other president chosen by the recently elected parliament was being inaugurated. So, President Zourabichvili said, I am leaving, but I'm taking the legitimacy of the presidency with me. She called the inauguration of the other president a parody and said, as she said many times, that it was illegitimate, and she said that the current government, which is controlled by the Georgian Dream Party in power is trying to divide us just as the Russians did. And then she went on to say that, in spite of this, we will continue our fight and we will win. And she also said that the people who had been arrested at those protests that have been taking place on the streets of Tbilisi and other cities across Georgia for actually a month now, they will help them to get out of jail, but there were not a lot of details exactly how this movement will continue. Nevertheless, she said that it will. And then when she was finished, she walked outside of the gate, literally into the scrum of her supporters, walked through the crowd and then walked back in the direction of the palace. It's unclear at this point, at least to me, where she is. But I think you can definitely say that she is defiant, but she did not go to the point of staying in the palace. Because, remember, the prime minister was saying once there is a new president elected, she would be illegally in that palace. And so she decided not to have that confrontation. Kim?",

On Tuesday, NASA's Parker Solar Probe made a record breaking flyby. The craft passed less than 4 million miles from the sun. It was humanity's closest approach ever to the star that lights our planet. Our Paula Newton has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Here comes the sun. NASA is ending the year on a high, its Parker Solar Probe flying closer to the sun than any space mission has ever done. On Christmas Eve, the probe flew through the sun's outer atmosphere called the corona in a record breaking flyby coming within 6.1 million kilometers of the sun's surface and withstanding expected temperatures of up to 982 degrees Celsius.
