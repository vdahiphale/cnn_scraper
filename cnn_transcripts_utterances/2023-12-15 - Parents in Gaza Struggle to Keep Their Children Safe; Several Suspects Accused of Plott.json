He is also traveling to the occupied West Bank to meet with Palestinian officials. We're live in Ramallah just ahead. The European Union agreed to open talks on Ukraine's membership into the block but failed to agree to multibillion-dollar aid package due to differences among the members. We are live in Brussels and Ukraine this hour. And Prince Harry was awarded close to $200,000 after U.K. court ruled that he was the subject of an intensive phone hacking. The details on that story just ahead. Well, the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is in the West Bank today to meet with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. This meeting comes just hours after in Tel Aviv Mr. Sullivan reiterated Washington support for Israel's war effort. He also spoke of the Biden administration's desire for Israel to shift to a more precise and targeted approach against Hamas amid still rising civilian casualties in Gaza, although he said that perspective would be offered by the U.S. as a partner and as a friend and that the White House would not tell Israel what to do.

And that is ahead in just about 30 minutes right here on CONNECT THE WORLD. An Al Jazeera correspondent and cameraman were wounded in an airstrike in Gaza, according to the network. This is correspondent Wael Al-Dahdouah from a video shot back in October. Al Jazeera says he was wounded along with cameramen Samer Abudaqa in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis. The network says Al-Dahdouah is being treated at a hospital while his cameraman remains trapped in a school where they were on assignment when they came under fire. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on its operations in the area. Authorities in Germany and the Netherlands have arrested several terror suspects on Thursday. Germany's federal prosecutor said authorities had arrested for suspected members of Hamas. Three were arrested in Germany and one was arrested in the Netherlands. In a separate announcement, Danish intelligence authorities said four people have been detained for alleged terrorism offenses. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has the details on all of these arrests across Europe. He joins us now live from Berlin. Great to have you on, Fred. Look, we know that these arrests technically are not connected. But what more do we know about these suspects and, you know, how authorities came to get these arrests underway?",

Yet there are some pretty striking similarities between the two cases. In Denmark, as you've just mentioned, there are apparently still four people who are on the run who have formally been arrested in absentia. As the Danish authorities are now saying they of course have thwarted what they called terrorist activity with those rates that happened across the country in Denmark yesterday. One of the interesting things that we did pick up on yesterday and Danish authorities themselves did not mention Hamas when they were talking about the suspect but it was Israeli intelligence, both the Shin Bet and the Mossad that then came out and said that this was a thwarted, as they put it, Hamas attack that these anti- terror raids were about. It's quite interesting because the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, she also then referenced to the conflict in Gaza, the war in Gaza, and said it was unacceptable for people to take that to Denmark. So, again, right now three people remain in custody, one was actually released, the suspects who were arrested yesterday, but four still at large and Danish authorities say they are looking for them. Here in Germany you have those four formal arrests that took place which is absolutely correct. So that happened by the federal prosecutor's office. We got a statement from them just a couple of minutes before we went to air. And they once again said that they had now formally arrested those four suspects. They did say that one of those who is in custody in the Netherlands, that there is a European order to try and bring that person to Germany to then put him on trial here in this country. And the Germans quite frankly, they're a lot more open about mentioning Hamas. They say that at least three of the people who were arrested yesterday had long-standing ties to Hamas, were formerly members of Hamas, and even had very good contacts, as they put it, to the senior leadership of the armed wing of Hamas, the Al- Qassam Brigade. The Germans also offering more details as to what exactly they believe the plot was going to be. They say that three of the people that they arrested yesterday were looking for a weapons depot. Apparently Hamas had been stockpiling weapons here in this country. They were then supposed to bring these weapons to Berlin for, as the German authorities put it, possible terror attacks against Jewish institutions in Europe. So not just possibly in this country but in Europe of course. As you can imagine, the German authorities very much concerned about all of this. But they do say that they now have these four people in custody, and they believe at this point in time, that things are safe here in this country. So a lot of activity going on. One of the things we have to keep in mind is that this did happen in three countries, but it is very close together. If you're talking about Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, all those countries of course neighboring countries to one another -- Eleni.",

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a truly remarkable result. But Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced that the move, calling it senseless and irrational. We've got team coverage of this story for you. Bianca Nobilo is standing by in Brussels where she's been monitoring the E.U. Summit. And we also have Nick Paton Walsh in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine. So, Nick, let's start with you. Great to have you on. The big holdup as well has got to do with aid. I guess the big question is whether Ukraine can actually stand any kind of chance in terms of winning against Russia if the U.S. and the E.U. doesn't put in more aid.

      "sentences": "A big question. It's a symbolic diplomatic victory. This was something that was an aspiration for Ukrainejust a few years ago. It would have been unthinkable for the country to be at this stage. In fact, when we look back to 2013, it was because of Ukraine trying to move closer to the European Union and signing a European association agreement, that ultimately triggered Vladimir Putin's illegal annexation of Crimea. So Putin's anathema is Ukraine going deeper into the European fold. And this green-lighting of Ukraine moving closer towards European Union membership is a huge victory for Zelenskyy and something which will antagonize Vladimir Putin. But the question is, how meaningful is this when Ukraine is struggling to keep its economy afloat? Now, I'm sure Vladimir Zelenskyy will be in a position of -- it's a critical juncture. He will be anxious about the fact that this $55 billion that was meant -- euros that was meant to come from the E.U. has been delayed until January. Yes, they were saying -- the leaders have said that they're optimistic about their ability to pass that, but they were wrong in how they read the tea leaves ahead of this summit as well. It was a surprise that Viktor Orban essentially abstained from the vote, allowing it to go ahead and the unanimous principle to still be maintained that Ukraine can go ahead and begin negotiations to become a full member of the European Union. And Zelenskyy and Orban are likely to come head-to-head again because Orban has made it very clear that he still has the opportunity to stand in the way of Ukraine's hopes to become an official member of the European Union. The Hungarian delegation saying there'll be about 70 opportunities for them to interrupt unanimous votes between now and the path to Ukraine officially becoming an E.U. member. But officially, on Monday, talks will start between Ukraine and the E.U. to take them further down that path. And then January we may expect to see a visit from Zelenskyy when that new package of aid is discussed. But going into the bleak winter, as Nick was describing, this is a very difficult time for Zelenskyy. Yes, it's symbolic and a diplomatic victory, but when it comes to the actual tangibles and ability to fight Russia off, he hasn't had much assistance this week.",

Thank you.Well, as Ukraine aid package remains stalled in the U.S. Congress, America and its allies are gauging what they described as a potentially debilitating impact of U.S. aid or lack thereof in Ukraine's defense and its longer term prospects of losing the war. One senior U.S. military official describes it this way, saying there is no guarantee of success with us, but they are certain to fail without us. Our chief U.S. security analyst, Jim Sciutto, joins us now from Washington. Jim, we just heard from Nick Paton Walsh saying the same thing. The sentiment is that if, you know, Ukraine doesn't get more aid, and we know which direction this war could be headed.

And it was notable that just in the last 24 hours, we saw some sign of that, granted what happened in Brussels, the result of Hungary's opposition here. But the idea that there is a momentum here, right, that if one stops sending aid or feels capable of doing so or doesn't have the political support to do so, it makes it more likely that other allies will do the same. And again, when I speak about the potential consequences of that, particularly to European officials, particularly to those on the eastern frontier of NATO, they look at this as existential, not just for Ukraine but perhaps for themselves. You speak to Baltic leaders. They say very openly that they would be Russia's next targets if Ukraine were to fall.

There are still significant numbers in the center of Gaza, in the north, we have extremely limited access. We are largely confined to southern Gaza, Rafah right now. So we need that access. We need a reduction in the insecurity so we can get to people. We need to be able to decongest those shelters so we can address the issues of overcrowding, of poor sanitation, of disease risk. And we need a massive scaling up of that aid. Particularly food right now, particularly clean water, and of course the shelter, the warm clothes, the blankets, and the medicine.
