First, the three people killed who have now been identified, and so young. Twenty-year-old Brian Fraser, 19-year-old Arielle Anderson and 20-year-old Alexandria Verner. The 43-year-old gunman, we've learned, apparently did leave behind a note and a criminal history that includes a gun charge. But what is still unknown this morning, the motive, and also how he got the firearm, which was reportedly used in the shooting.",

We're going to take you live to Charleston, South Carolina. And just in, a key report shows that retail sales surged in January, beating expectations. More signs of a very strong economy. We do begin, though, this morning in Michigan with more on the shooting that has left that campus, that community, yet one more campus, yet one more community grieving. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus and Josh Campbell join us. Adrienne, you know, like I said, you look at those pictures of those young people, three young lives snuffed out, their families are suffering, their friends are suffering. What more do we know about them? ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think about those parents, parents who will now plan funerals instead of celebrations. I think about my friends who come back and return to campus. Normally we come here to celebrate homecoming, but now we are focusing on the victims and recognizing their lives. Behind me, this is the Sparty statue. It's at the center of campus. And Sparty is known as a symbol of strength. And strength is what those families are looking for. We heard from the aunt of one of the victims. And we're talking about Arielle Anderson. She was among the killed. Her aunt sharing these beautiful photos, saying in part that her family is broken in pieces. And she asked the question, have you ever met a person who is simply pure in heart? That was Ari, who they affectionately called for short. She never raised her voice past a whisper or a gentle laugh. She also called the shooter a coward. The other two who we are remembering, Alexandria Verner and Brian Fraser. Fraser was the president of his fraternity and Verner was a star athlete in her high school. We heard from their coach and superintendent. Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And she is the mother of Otto Warmbier. He is an American who was detained in North Korea in 2017. And then when he got back, when he was released, he actually died days later. And Cindy Warmbier sat down with Nikki Haley when she was ambassador to the United Nations and she credits Nikki Haley with giving her what she says is the strength that she needed to actually stand up to the North Korean regime after that awful death of her son. She says that after talking to Nikki Haley, she went into fighter mode. And so that will be an interesting story for folks in this room to hear today.And another person that we'll be watching for is Ralph Norman. He is a congressman from South Carolina. He came out just this morning endorsing Nikki Haley. He is the first member of Congress from this state to endorse her. And he has historically been an ally of former President Trump, who is, of course, Nikki Haley's contestant in this race. And what he said in a statement is that America is better off for what Trump accomplished, but he says there's no doubt that a season of change is coming for the party. He thinks Nikki Haley is the best person to be at the top of the ticket for that season of change. But Trump has already gotten a number of endorsements in this state, of course, including Senator Lindsey Graham being one of them. And so the question is, how much support can she garner, particularly early in this race when folks are really waiting to see how the actual field shakes out right now. Some folks who support her say they're just not ready to hop in yet. So, what we're watching for today is for her to tell her story. We're expecting her to talk about the fact that she grew up here in South Carolina. She was the daughter of two Indian immigrants. She didn't grow up as black. She didn't grow up as white. She, in her words, in a video she put out yesterday, was different. She'll talk about those challenges. But she'll also call for the renewal of pride in America. That is something that is a traditional, you know, Republican value. She'll call for fiscal conservatism, securing the border. Traditional Republican values. And then she will make the case of this need for a new generation of leadership in the Republican Party, arguing that she has the expertise, being a former two-time governor of this state, to do that job.",

Good to have you both on this morning. Kristen, I wonder, when you look at Haley, she's long appeared to try to have it both ways. Not publicly condemning her former boss' worst faults, but also not endorsing them. And this is a strategy we've seen other Republicans try to carry out. I just wonder, does that work in a Republican primary? Has it proven so far - and, obviously, we have a long way to go here -- to please anyone? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Nikki Haley's campaign should be about Nikki Haley. It shouldn't be about Donald Trump. And that goes for either condemning or endorsing him. Her campaign should be about the things that she wants to do for the country moving forward. She's someone who for over a decade has been talked about as the future of the Republican Party. So, it's important for her to make the case that the future is now. That there is no more, you know, time for waiting to turn the page, to move to a new era of winning. She talked in her announcement video yesterday about how Republicans have lost seven out of the eight popular votes in the last president elections. That it's time to pick someone who can be at the top of the ticket, bring about a new era of winning to the Republican Party. I think that's a smart message for her to embrace.",

You have the mother of a young man who died at the hands of North Korea. And that woman is saying, Nikki Haley is the person who gave her strength.Then you've got Ralph Norman, a member of the Freedom Caucus, an ally of Donald Trump, saying he's going to stand with Nikki Haley. It's time for a generational change. And then you've got the location. And my colleague, Josh Kraushaar, at \"Axios,\" has been sort of looking into this, that she is in Charleston. She's blocks away from the Mother Emanuel Church, where, of course, those mass shootings at an African American church at the hands of a racist in 2015, not just galvanized the country, it was a national moment of mourning, a bipartisan moment for action, but also prompted Nikki Haley to make what was at the time a very controversial decision in South Carolina, at least to take down the confederate flag at the state capitol. So, in a way she's positioning herself as the next generation, but in a way she's also positioning herself as kind of a return to more of the old school Republican values.",

They believe he should have been president after the 2020 election, and they want to see him return to the White House.But that's about two-thirds of the party left. And many of those folks like Donald Trump. They thought he was a good president. And many of them may ultimately decide to vote for him if there are other options that just don't wind up being as appealing. But I do think that there is an opportunity, if the field can consolidate behind, you know, one or two really strong candidates as we head into the primary, you know, Donald Trump may be tempted to run the 2016 playbook where he just tries to get that 30 percent, and that's enough because the field is splintered.

But even if you look at that, you're looking at huge buying of cars, you know, at restaurants and bars. This is reopening-type consumer activity.In fact, when you look at those numbers, that 3 percent gain, that is a big month to month gain for retail sales. And that's the biggest since March 2021. So, this is a blowout report. And it shows us that the American consumer in polls keep saying how lousy they feel about things and they're worried about a recession, but they're not acting like it at all. They're spending their money and they have the money to spend. We know that minimum wages rose in a whole bunch of states in the month. We know that there was an adjustment in the Social Security checks because of the cost of living increase. Almost 9 percent cost of living increase. And so - in millions of Social Security checks. And we know the job market is still really strong here. So, all of these factors are really holding up the American consumer. And, as you know, the American economy is held up by the American consumer. Two-thirds of economic growth is consumer spending. So, this is a strong number. And it raises big questions for the Fed. The Fed has been raising interest rates trying to cool the economy, and this is a hot number, guys.",
