Chinese dissidents in the U.S. harassed and intimidated from online to door knocks. The FBI says Chinese government agents were trying to silence their words against the Chinese government, even operating a fake cop shop in New York. Plus, outrage in Kansas City as if, after a Black teenage boy shot after showing up at the wrong house to pick up his brothers. CNN is learning that the gunman was an elderly White man and was released after less than two hours in custody. Why critics fear he may never be charged with a crime. And live from New York, it's the House GOP. Their spotlight on crime in New York today in the backyard of the prosecutor who indicted Donald Trump. (MUSIC)",

I'm Jake Tapper.And what appears to be a brazen act of espionage by the Chinese government as U.S. tensions with that country boil over, the U.S. Justice Department announced today three cases suggesting Chinese government agents spied on U.S. soil. Two suspected spies, American citizens were arrested today for operating a, quote, undeclared police station in Manhattan. Both men, U.S. citizens who apparently destroyed evidence when confronted by the FBI are set to appear in a federal court soon. U.S. officials say they operated an illegal Chinese police outpost in the Chinatown area of New York City that was apparently used to harass Chinese dissidents living in the United States on behalf of the Chinese government. In another case, Chinese security officials apparently eavesdropped on Zoom calls in the United States in order to harass Chinese dissidents who were on the calls. They disrupted the calls. They had a spy inside Zoom's corporate operations allegedly, all this is high stakes diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China are reaching a boiling point, over the Chinese spy balloon flying over the U.S., data privacy concerns about TikTok, China's increasingly cozy relationship with Russia and China's continued provocation of Taiwan, to name just a few. Let's get right to CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. And, Evan, prosecutors claim the Chinese government had something of an operative inside the company of Zoom?",

Eight of them had to do with this operation, which was essentially orchestrating with someone who worked at zoom to try to disrupt chats and calls that were being held by dissidents. Anything that was critical of the Chinese government, things like mentioning Tiananmen Square, for instance, which is forbidden to talk about in China. They would disrupt those calls that would end those phone calls, and they would also try to essentially make sure that the accounts were shut down to the dissidents had a hard time doing Zoom calls to discuss things that were critical of the Chinese government.One of the other cases that were announced -- that was announced today is this police fake police station operation that you just mentioned. In this case, two U.S. citizens were arrested today, they're appearing in court as we speak. There were associated with the nonprofit that was operating a police station for the Fujio (ph) municipal police authority. Now, ostensibly, what this -- what they were trying to do, which was to for people to be able to renew their driver's licenses or to do things that the municipal government needed for back in China. Instead, what the FBI says they were doing was they were using the police station to go out and harass dissidents. They would show up at following Funggang (ph) protests, for instance, and harass people there. They door knocked people around the country to try to get dissidents to go back to China, where they would then, of course, face Chinese authorities.",

That last point that you just mentioned is going to be key here in terms of what the grand jury decided the attorney general in the state of Ohio, making that announcement just in the last hour, essentially saying that the offi -- the actions of those eight Akron police officers on that night in June of last year are in fact justified because they -- because of the perceived threats. Not only that Jalen Walker, the 25 year old man that was shot and killed by officers that night, not only did he open fire, shooting at least one time during a vehicle pursuit, but also this perceived threat.The attorney general saying that so called cross draw motion, meaning Jayland Walker reaching towards his waistband after the report of that shot that was fired 40 seconds into the pursuit. That was a massive game changer. And it is because of that reason. That each officer established independently, according to invest state investigators with the bureau of criminal investigation in Ohio, that perceived threat. I can tell you, the big question now is exactly how the community will respond. For weeks now, Akron City officials have been bracing, preparing and trying to inform the community about that grand jury process. The grand jury seated just a week ago, and they've been going over this investigation, have been presented those findings by the Ohio BCI until that decision was handed down today, or at least they voted today. And so, now, we will certainly have to see any potential frustrations in the community, the city even going as far as to block off certain buildings. There was the worst small outbreaks of violence when we were on the ground last summer immediately, following the release of the body camera video members there in the community calling for justice. The Walker family, certainly calling for that. But calling for peaceful demonstrations, and that is no doubt what we will see tonight's and perhaps in the days ahead now that this information is being received by members of the community that the Akron police officers, eight in all, will not be charged after a Summit County grand jury determined that their actions that night were justified when they opened fire, shooting Jayland Walker over 45 times.",

Unlike the grand jury proceedings, where they did not have to speak to grand jurors, here, according to a sergeant with the Akron police department that's spoken a community gathering that long ago, they will be compelled to speak to investigators there with the police department.

And they also want to impose work requirements on Medicaid and other government assistant programs. But, Jake, that could be a really tough sell within the House GOP. Remember, McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes on any partisan bills. Moderates might not want to walk the plank on this bill and support those work requirements. And even if they were able to pass a bill like that, it would be dead on arrival in the Senate anyway. But for McCarthy, the point here is he's trying to force Biden back to the negotiating table for these long stalled talks because so far, the White House official position has been that Republicans should raise the debt ceiling without any conditions, which is what they did multiple times under former President Donald Trump. So they continue to read her that today, but a senior White House official did tell our colleagues Jeremy Diamond and Arlette Saenz that if McCarthy was able to pass a bill on his own to raise the debt ceiling, that then Biden would potentially be willing to sit down and talk to him.

That said, look, Jake, as -- just as a national security issue, just the interest on our national debt is approaching the size of our entire defense budget. You and I were talking about China earlier, that Chinese actually are building in when our economy goes upside down and then solvent as part of their -- as part of their broader strategy to be a global hegemon and be the global leader. At some point, we have to get this under control, and I think to expect just a continued blank check without even a conversation about federal spending about work requirements about some of these things that are pretty common sense. I just don't think this is a bridge that we can't close. Put some common sense reforms in place, and then we can talk about like -- of course, we're not going to default on our debt.",

The U.S. ambassador to Russia was finally, finally able to see him.After meeting Gershkovich in Russia's infamous Lefortovo prison, U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy tweeted, quote: He is in good health and remain strong. We reiterate our call for his immediate release, unquote. Gershkovich will likely stay in the prison, which \"The Wall Street Journal:\" describes as a, quote, sterile facility engineered to keep inmates from ever seeing one another until late May. And today, the harshest sentence yet in Putin's draconian crackdown on freedom and even basic descent over his brutal war in Ukraine. His only crime being criticism of Putin, 41-year-old human rights advocate Vladimir Kara-Murza has been sentenced to 25 years in a Russian penal colony, 25 years on charges of treason. As CNN's Matthew Chance reports for us now, just before Kara-Murza's detention one year ago, he characterized Putin's government as a, quote, regime of murderers in an interview with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION ACTIVIST:  Today, the whole world sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine. The cluster bombs on residential areas, the bombings of maternity wards and hospitals and schools. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was this speech before the Arizona state house that Russian prosecutors used as part of their case against Vladimir Kara-Murza. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine just a few weeks earlier, and the veteran Kremlin critic, like so many others, was incensed. KARA-MURZA:  The war crimes, these are war crimes.",

That's according to Ukraine. And despite Russia's claims that its troops are advancing, footage geolocated by CNN shows that Ukrainian troops are holding their positions in central Bakhmut, all while Russia aims to destroy towns in eastern Ukraine. CNN's Ben Wedeman spoke with some residents who after more than a year of war finally have accepted that it's time to leave. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPNDENT (voice-over): Another family is moving out, leaving the frontline town of Krasnohorivka with the help of the police. Perhaps to lessen the blow to his children, Yevgeny equips, we'll be back. It's just a vacation. Eighty-four-year old Raya doesn't sugarcoat it. It's like torture, she says. But don't worry, we'll survive. Raya has lived in Krasnohorivka all her life. Rustam (ph) and his colleagues venture out to the front line villages several times a week, trying to convince people to move to safer ground. It's dangerous work, but for Rustam, it's worth the risk to get these children out of harm's way. Looking into those eyes, he asks, what else can you do? If friendly persuasion doesn't work, there are other means. There's an order from local government requiring that children be evacuated from areas close to the fighting. This is how Vassily (ph) goes about the job of friendly persuasion, sitting talking, trying to convince those who remain that their lives are in peril. The people in this basement turned bomb shelter have been down here for more than a year, and clearly that has taken a toll. Their homes are here. Everything they know is here. They refused to leave. The eastern end of Krasnohorivka is the hardest hit, yet even here, there's a stubborn holdout. They've come to this building to try to convince an old man to leave. They have already evacuated his wife. As you can see, this area has been seriously smashed by incoming rounds. The Russians are just five kilometers around three miles from here. He didn't want his face to appear on camera. I'm not going anywhere, he says. I was born here, and I'm going to die here. The chances of that happening here are perilously high. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And what makes these areas even more dangerous is that the Russians are now deploying what are known as guided aerial bombs. These were bombs that are launched about 30 miles away from the front line, and they're using them ever more frequently in towns and villages like those -- Jake.",
