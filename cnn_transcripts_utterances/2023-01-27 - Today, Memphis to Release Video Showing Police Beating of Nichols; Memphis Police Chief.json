Sara, it's very interesting that the chief discussed during the initial stop, they still can't figure out exactly what led to violence and to, as she said, the officers being so amped up. They had a duty to de-escalate, that did not happen. So, again, what they're saying -- that videotape, what they've been saying all along, the charges speak to what happened on that videotape but, we're going to see it, but we're not sure we're going to get any answers about what led up to all of this.",

She has looked at several different cameras and was unable to see any kind of aggressive driving. The third thing that stood out, Don, was that she said that this, very much like what we heard from the attorneys for the family, that Tyre Nichols was beaten very similarly in a similar manner to what happened in 1992 in Los Angeles with the police beating of Rodney King. [07:25:011] She said it is if not the same, worse. Those are the things. What it leads to me to ask is did the officers lie when they put forward why they stopped him and what exactly happened. Did they put that down on a police report? And is that part of why they are charged with some of the charges that they now face for official misconduct?",

They are grown people, adults, professionals, but she says there needs to be better training. Obviously, something went wrong. This goes beyond training. She spoke to the -- you know, nationally what they need from the federal government, the type of reform that they need in order to fix these situations.And I also thought it was important, she talked about race as well, being a black police chief and black officers serving a black community. She said it takes for her race off of the table and this is more about being a human being, about acting in a humane way rather than an inhumane way. Sara, thank you. We're going to continue to report this throughout the hour. We'll get back to my colleague, Sara Sidner, here in Memphis as well. She's been covering and speaking to members of the community. She also -- the chief also spoke in this interview about the family of Tyre Nichols, the mother and the stepfather. And in just moments, I'm going to speak with them live as well here on CNN. So, back to my colleague, Kaitlan Collins, who's in this Washington D.C. Kaitlan, she talked about the need for reform and the help from folks in Washington.
