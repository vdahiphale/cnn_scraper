We have cropped out a police officer standing over him and the actual full picture showing the body of the gunman because obviously this is very graphic. But in this picture, it appears he had body armor and several extra magazines strapped on to his chest gear. There by his side an AR-15 style weapon. This whole incident was extremely traumatizing to the many customers and workers at the outlet mall who not only saw the shooter committing this act of mass murder, but also the aftermath, the bodies on the ground. CNN affiliate KTVT spoke with a man who raced through the Outlet mall after his son called him saying the shooting occurred right outside the H&amp;M where he worked. He raced to the scene there and immediately started performing CPR. There were some people he just could not save. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Around 8:00 p.m. we heard from the White House, who said that President Biden was briefed and the White House was monitoring the situation very closely, in touch with law enforcement officials as well as local officials on the ground. Now, you're right. We are still waiting for a more fulsome comment on the shooting in Allen, Texas, from the White House, from the president, but this is something he has had to routinely address as president, particularly this year, talking in depth about the mass shootings happening across the country. One thing we know is that he uses these opportunities to once again demand Congress to do something when it comes to gun control measures, specifically he wants to see Congress put back in place an assault style weapons ban. Now, we saw in that photo just a few moments ago an AR-15 appeared to be close by, where the gunman was. So, likely President Biden will talk about this again when we hear from him. But, of course, we know just looking at the congressional makeup right now that any sort of gun control measure is unlikely to happen in the House or the Senate. So, that leaves President Biden once again trying to act alone. Something that he says he has extended all his executive ability to do and it is congress's time to step up.

You can develop a profile on individuals that are likely to commit these kinds of crimes. This happened in an outlet mall, a huge complex, a lot of entrances, a lot of exits. From a law enforcement perspective how they handled that, if something happened in your jurisdiction, with a facility similar to that, what are some of the steps that you took that worked well? What are some of the things you could have done a little bit better? So, you learn from each one. He was heavily armed. It looks like perhaps he had body armor. Years ago, the tactical training police officers have gone through has changed a bit. It used to be that you shoot only for center mass. If the person is wearing a bullet proof vest, of course, that doesn't work. So some training changed where you actually do try to take head shots. I'm sorry to be so graphic but the reality is you have to stop the threat as quickly as possible in order to save lives.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. NEOMI A. SHAH, MOUNT SINAI HEALTH SYSTEM: A nap is essentially a sleep segment that occurs outside of your habitual sleep hours. The benefits of napping primarily are in the short, acute settings. If you're awake and you're sleepy it is going to help you reduce that sleepiness. The other benefit is it just may make you more alert and allow you to function for the rest of the day. Best practice is to keep that to less than 30 minutes. You want a cool, quiet, dark place to try to take a nap.",

Thankfully, no severe weather at the moment but we can't rule out a few warnings as the system really starts to get going once again with the sunlight.And of course, we're watching round two fire up back in parts of Iowa. That is going to take the same track right on down into the Ohio Valley. So we'll see these areas highlighted in orange and yellow, that's where we are most vulnerable for the severe weather threat. All hazards in play. More of a wind threat with the systems that track across the Midwest and back into the Ohio Valley. We're talking hurricane force wind gusts, 74 plus miles per hour. Isolated tornadoes and large hail cannot be ruled out. There is that wind threat. Areas hashed (ph) in orange, we have that greatest risk for hurricane force winds, again 74 plus miles per hour. And then large hail, 2 inches in diameter. That is just about golf ball sized if not a little bit larger. Again, in that hashed orange area where we have the greatest risk stretching from Des Moines back on over into parts of Nebraska and into Illinois. Areas in red we'll see round one pushing down through the Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley and into the Carolinas later this evening. And then of course, round 2 starts to fire up and then again pushing right on down the same areas, the Ohio Valley and right down into the Tennessee Valley. That is where we'll have the greatest threat through the overnight Sunday and into Monday morning watching that closely. Texas, this is more of a dry line event. We'll see the storms fire up where the moisture really gets going throughout the evening where we'll have that risk for an isolated tornado but hail one of the bigger threats here as well as wind. And that continues on through the morning that's pushing into parts of the south and east. Rain, quite a bit of it. We could pick up roughly about 2 to 4 inches of rain in some of these areas across the southern Ohio Valley. And these are areas where we focus in on more of a flood threat. So you'll see areas highlighted in yellow today just off to the east of Des Moines stretching off to the south and west of Chicago where we'll pick up some heavy rain, 1 to 2 inches in one sitting. Then that threat stretches through the Ohio Valley again where we'll pick up another 2 to 4 inches of rainfall here in the upcoming day. So we'll watch that closely here in the next 24 hours -- Amara, Victor?",
