      "sentences": "There is an inherent conflict of interest. The Department of Transportation has been completely useless in helping the FAA do their jobs. They have continued to take a hands-off approach to this entire matter.My third point is if the leaders of those government authorities, again -- government agencies had done their jobs, investigators would have uncovered a mountain of important information. The FAA would have known Boeing's production processes were a mess, and the safety culture was terrible. The FAA could have prevented an ever-increasing list of production quality defects. Instead, they're surprised each time that occurs. Showing how ineffective and reactive their oversight has become. Just last month, the FAA reported on uncommanded rolls, MAX airplanes due to wiring that is being chafed. Boeing and the FAA have known about these manufacturing defects for more than two years and did not inform the public about this potentially catastrophic condition. There are also Canadian reports of new MAX airplanes with chafe wire bundles containing burn marks and evidence of electrical arcing. Routine -- excuse me. Boeing routinely states that their airplanes meet or exceed all safety standards. This is untrue and misrepresents the safety of the airplanes. The company illegally removed thousands of quality control inspections on individual airplanes without the FAA's knowledge and without the knowledge of the airlines. Although many of these inspections have been reinstated, hundreds of airplanes have left Boeing factories without those thousands of inspections. My last point is the Department of Justice and FBI relied on the slanted results of the first MAX accident investigation to develop an illegal and unjust deferred prosecution agreement. The NTSB chair reiterated to Congress last week that Boeing has said there are no records documenting the removal of the Alaska Airlines door. I'm not going to sugarcoat this. This is a criminal cover-up. Records do in fact exist. I know this because I've personally passed them to the FBI. A few -- a five-minute testimony is not nearly enough time to explain how insidious the story is. Boeing's corporate leaders continue to conceal the truth. They continue to mislead and deceive the public about the safety of the planes. That is the safety culture at the top of the Boeing company right now. The good news is the employees of Boeing, and these agencies can overcome poor leadership. We need them to be successful. They're highly capable. They need to be supported and encouraged. And these problems are fixable, but it starts with telling the truth. Thank you.",

I'm an assistant professor in both Integrated Systems Engineering and the Center for Aviation Studies at The Ohio State University. Prior to teaching at Ohio State, I was an airline pilot. During my time teaching at the university, I earned my Ph.D. in cognitive systems engineering. Although there have been slight variations in the exact definition, one has been for safety culture, one that has been used for years, decades, even in our shared beliefs, assumptions, and norms, which may govern organizational decision-making, as well as individual and group attitudes about safety.[11:40:00] An incorrect understanding of safety culture is that it is commonly referred to as a single concept, but rather consists of four individual specific components, whereas each one provides its own unique actions to the overall concept of safety culture. And without one of these, the element and structure of culture will fall apart. As such, each serves the greater goal of providing a robust, effective. and well-proven safety tool for all high-risk industries, especially given its proven value in aerospace industries. It should be made clear, this culture concept is not only for airline operations but rather any aerospace operation where the risk of injury or death is a possibility to employees and/or customers after product delivery. This is extremely important in determining an organization's overall safety culture as they are all -- as they all complement each other.

The latest one, we heard from Sam Salehpour, who was a quality engineer on the Boeing 787 line. That plane manufactured in Charleston, South Carolina.And he essentially said that that plane is not safe. That the joining of the fuselage main portions of that structure, the gaps are too large. And so, he is asserted newly just last week that those gaps have become too big, and the plane could theoretically fall apart in flight. Boeing has been very much on the defensive leading up to this hearing, knowing that it would be relatively explosive. There's a lot of rehash here, not only about the issues with the MCAS system on board the 737 MAX that caused those two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that led to the killing of 346 people on board. But also, there is a new allegation here about the door plug on board the 737 MAX Nine, which led to its grounding for about 20 days in the U.S. And now, there's this issue with the 787. This is what Sam Salehpour said to this Senate committee just now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're talking five one-thousandths of an inch. That is the width of essentially these two sheets of paper or the width of a human hair.Boeing says in some cases, that's not all that necessary and may have been too extreme in some cases. So, it's allowed itself a little bit of leeway on board these planes. Boeing insisted in this press briefing that I was on on Monday, that its 787 is not at risk of falling apart in flight and it has no evidence of fatigue failure on board its planes, the very strong airplane is made of carbon fiber, stronger than the aluminum structure that has been used in older airplanes. This is the statement from Boeing though, on the record. It says we're fully confident of the 787 Dreamliner. These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate. Boeing also says it has done work to ensure the quality and long-term safety of the aircraft. So, another huge day when it comes to the safety concerns about Boeing here. This one is about quality control issues. That was the issue on board the 737 MAX nine. Boeing came forward and said that was an issue. This is something Boeing insists is not the case when it comes to the 787. Although, we will see as this hearing plays out what the response from Boeing will be.",

      "sentences": "Well, as Pete said too about the fit-up of the 787, I wanted to do -- address that first. Before the press conference, I spoke with the engineers at Boeing about what this means. And like he said -- like Pete just said, it's the width of a human hair, and they fit up, which is where you put the two pieces together and then you measure to see -- you put a feeler gauge in there and you see -- and again, it's five one-thousandths of an inch, to see if it fits to that close. And they do. They fit that properly.The second piece, which I think is the biggest concern, is the fact that as they drill the holes to attach that, there are pieces or shards of aluminum, they get between that fit up. So, then they do that what was called the pull-up. And that's what I think that the whistleblower is referring to, is that that didn't meet the meet-up first, the fit-up before they did the pull-up. So, what he's saying is that that could cause some problems. Now understand, I've worked on assembly lines many times in my life. I've worked for the FAA as an inspector to inspect these processes. And personally, I really think that he's correct that it did not meet those standards before the fit-up. But after you do the pull-up, and those stretch -- those shards are pushed together, I currently don't see a problem with what's happening right now with the 787. I don't think these things are going to fall apart. You said potentially, and theoretically, they could fall apart or crack. I don't see that risk, honestly, in my opinion. But that's just my opinion. We'll have to see what the engineers say about this as they go forward in the investigation.",

We're going to get this report back from the FAA and they're going to tell us what they think about it.But it's clear that there's a culture problem there. And I attribute it to one thing, and that is that the mission statement and the vision statement of Boeing for the last 10 years, did not have the word safety in it. The mission statement, and the vision statement, thing that every employee at Boeing, every employee on the line, assembling aircraft needs to know that they have a direct line of sight to what their goal and objective is, and that is safety. They have quality. They have production. They have leadership. They have all of the other things that corporations want to see in their vision statement. What they don't have is what we want to see on a manufacturing line, which is that word safety. Safety needs to be the driving force, the shining star that everyone goes toward. And that's what's been missing from Boeing. They need to find a CEO that will carry that message forward, and make sure everyone sees that and understands their role in that company. BLITZER: Yes, we all fly. So, this is also so worrisome. Very quickly before I let you go, Pete.

So, things are going to get back to normal. Although we know typically after one of these ground stops is issued, this can cause things a bit of a ripple effect.
