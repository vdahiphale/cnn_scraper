The crisis in the Middle East is escalating fast with a senior White House official now warning that Iran is preparing an imminent ballistic missile attack against Israel. The official says that the U.S. is ready to defend Israel against any attack. Israeli military says that it is on peak alert. And a short time ago, an IDF spokesman said that Israel has not yet seen any aerial threat from Iran, but it's warning that any attack would have consequences. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's ordering people in Southern Lebanon to get out of their homes and move dozens of kilometers away from the Israeli border.The IDF releasing this video of troops conducting what it calls limited and localized raids inside Lebanon. It says that it's been carrying out these raids for months to try to dismantle Hezbollah's weapons capabilities. An Israeli military spokesman says that the operation uncovered plans by Hezbollah to launch an October 7th style attack on Israel. The IDF says that it is calling up 4 more reserve brigades to join the fight. Hezbollah, meantime, denies that Israeli troops are in Lebanon at all. CNN has a team of reporters and analysts across all of these developments. But first, let's begin with CNN's Arlette Saenz. She joins us live from the White House.

If that does happen, it could mark a significant escalation in the region where tensions have already been high.Now the senior White House official said that the U.S. stands ready to help Israel defend itself in, the wake of such an attack, and they also added, quote, \"A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.\" It comes at a time when U.S. officials have been watching the situation in the Middle East with great concern, specifically the potential for Iran to launch some type of attack, perhaps in retaliation for the recent killing by Israel of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Now, the U.S. has been working, with Israel, on joint defense efforts in the hopes that they could potentially deter such an attack from Iran. Now today, a US official tells us that, they anticipate that this potential attack could be in the same scale and scope of what Iran launched against Israel back in April when the U.S. and other countries helped intercept, around 300 missiles and drones, and the U.S. stands ready to support Israel in this process if Iran does launch this attack.",

Most of the ballistic missiles and drones that the Iranians fired at Israel were either intercepted or hit open ground.And, certainly, it may be Iran's way of showing Hezbollah, for instance, that they're still in the game, that they do support them. But in reality, what we're seeing, in Southern Lebanon and here in Beirut is that Israel continues to strike with impunity. Hezbollah doesn't seem to be able to do anything about the airstrikes, for instance, one that took place just over an hour ago. Rather, three airstrikes that took place just an hour ago, and these Israeli raids into Lebanese territory. And, of course, I'm not even going to waste much breath on the Lebanese government, which is utterly helpless, in dealing with this situation. But beyond that, certainly, if we look at the region, I think there is mounting exasperation with an American administration, which as we just heard, is watching with great concern the situation. But, it acts like a passive bystander that can't really do anything. Here we are a year into this war in Gaza, and the United States issues these statements of great concern and whatnot. But at the end of the day it's managed to do nothing to stop the war from -- it started in Gaza, it spread to Lebanon, and then now we're -- there's this threat of an Iranian attack. The war has, as many predicted, expanded into a situation where we are on the verge of perhaps a regional war, and all the United States is -- does is express concern. Rahel?",

All this American hardware in the region is something that inevitably will become involved, either in defending Israel or retaliating against Iran.So the nightmare scenario could come to pass, because of what I said before. The United States sitting on the sidelines, sending its diplomats back and forth to the Middle East, but not using the real pressure it does have, to make the war in Gaza stop, which is where it all started, which would obviously have a calming effect throughout the region. But instead, it seems to have discarded its leverage over Israel and simply is letting this situation deteriorate. Keep in mind that there are permanently based U.S. forces in the Gulf, in Qatar, in Bahrain, within easy range of the Iranian coast, and the Iranians have long worked on developing their capabilities in the Gulf that would target exactly those U.S. assets. And, of course, much -- a lot of the oil of the world passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which is the main pass -- is the way into the Persian Gulf. You have U.S. troops in Iraq. You have US troops in Syria, sitting ducks in the event things really go out of control. And therefore, you know, the danger is sort of staring everyone in the face, but the United States, as I said, sits on its hands, puts out these weak statements from the White House, but doesn't really sort of grab the problem by the throat and solve it.

But this time, Israel has also taken out Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah, a key proxy fighter network for Iran to show that its will in the Middle East.And Israel is also honing in on the tunnel network where it's believed that much of the some 150,000 missiles and rockets are stored by Hezbollah to be used in the event that Israel attacks Iran. The ballistic missiles that Iran has provided to Hezbollah can reach just about any major populated Israeli city, and Israel has known about them for quite some time and briefed reporters like me about them. And we always anticipated that at some point Israel would feel the need to go in and clean this area up. Here's the problem. Last time Iran responded, the fire just came from Iran towards Israel, and it was aimed at military facilities, government buildings. There was also enough time with, the launches to give at least 10 minutes, if not an several hours of warning for Israel and the various allies supporting it to clock where the munitions were coming from and plot how to take them out of the sky. This time, what could be different is if Hezbollah also fires some of its missiles much closer, much shorter amount of time to reach Israeli populated areas, so that's what I'm watching and I'm worried about right now..",

The White House says that it has indications Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel and that it is supporting Israel's preparations to defend itself.Israeli military said that it has not yet identified any aerial threat from Iran, but this comes after Israel launched military operations on the ground in Southern Lebanon. This is what Israel's security cabinet has spoken about as the next phase of its war with Hezbollah. Officials say that it will be a limited ground operation, and they have no plans to occupy Lebanese territory in the long term. In recent days, Israel has been laying the groundwork. Airstrikes have ramped up, one of them on Friday, killing the leader of Hezbollah. Civilians meantime in Lebanon feeling the force of these attacks. Authorities say that more than a thousand people have been killed, countless homes have been destroyed, and around 1 million people are now displaced. Israel's attacks are in defiance of pressure from the U.S. to reach a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. Jim Sciutto, CNN's Chief U.S. Security analyst with us now, as well as Alex Marquardt, CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent. Jim, let me start with you on the ground there. I just want to pick up sort of where we left off there. That this is sort of in defiance of what the U.S. had sort of hoped all along, but even more recently, of a ceasefire. That this is the very thing that U.S. officials have worked, you could say, since October 7th to try to avoid. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: That's true. Let me begin with the situation here now in Tel Aviv. We just heard a boom above our heads, sounded more like a sonic boom, which would be a passing Israeli jet more than an intercept. We haven't seen intercepts yet, but I just raised that because, the city, the country is certainly on a footing now, where it expects, if Iran does indeed fire these missiles, which U.S. intelligence indicates they're preparing to do, that they would do so imminently perhaps in the next several hours. So the city, the country very much on alert for exactly that. We should always caution when discussing that that Israel has significant missile defenses at multiple altitudes, and it also has the aid of U.S. forces in the region, which have missile defense via ships, surface ships, as well as aircraft in the air and other partners in the region such as Jordan that have anti-missile capability. So you have those capabilities. But you have to keep in mind, Rahel, that the warning time with ballistic missiles is just a matter of minutes in terms of travel time from Iran to here in Israel. So there's not a lot of time to prepare, and to shoot them down. That said, the missile defenses are designed to do exactly that. That that's the situation on the ground here. To your point, absolutely, the U.S. has been trying to avoid this very moment for months. It does not want a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. It's not the first time. In April, of course, Iran fired dozens of missiles and drones at Israel. The vast majority of them shot down, but it's been working diplomatically and via other means to prevent that from happening again, and here we are. And, of course, the concern is in situations like this, it's not just how Iran attacks, but then how Israel potentially retaliates, and then how Iran retaliates to that. Right? I mean, you're caught in a cycle of retaliation, which is exactly the outcome the U.S. had been seeking to avoid.",

Several minutes ago, we heard what we think was a sonic boom, likely from an Israeli jet flying that happens when they break the speed of sound.We haven't seen --  it's not clear to us that we've seen any missile intercepts to date, and there are no reports of it. I just want to be clear. But, again, it's just a measure of the level of concern and alert right now as they await for the possibility that Iran follows through on this threat. Again, as I noted earlier, we should always note that Israel has tremendous air defenses and has its allies as partners in those air and missile defenses, and you could be certain that they are on high alert right now as well.",

Israeli officials have said that it will be a limited ground operation and that they are not aiming for a long term occupation of Lebanese territory. Let's bring in retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and CNN Military Analyst, Cedric Leighton. He joins us from Washington, DC. Colonel, always good to have you. Thank you for being here today. Let me just first ask, the likelihood or the possibility that we could see an attack in which not only does Iran directly respond and retaliate, but it does so in coordination with its proxies in the region. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Rahel, I think that's actually a really good question. I think that is a definite possibility because, you know, what the proxies have basically done on Iran's behalf is encircle Israel almost, you know, at least on three sides. And that is something that the Israelis are trying to break out of. And when you look at, the map and you see -- you know, you look at Lebanon and you have Hezbollah there, you look at Gaza, you had Hamas there and, of course, you had the various happenings in the West Bank with the PLO and other elements there. Plus, you have the militias in Syria and Iraq. It's very likely that any one of those actors -- and I guess we shouldn't forget that which is in Yemen either-- any one of those actors can work in coordination with Tehran to attack Israel at a similar or at the same time. So if that happens, the idea there would possibly be to try to overwhelm, the Israeli missile defense systems. And if that were to happen, that, of course, would pose a grave danger for the Israelis. They'd have multiple targets to go after, and they would have to, of course, be very careful which ones they, they hit first. And, of course, the defense of their country would be more -- made more difficult by that kind of a situation. But that is absolutely a possible scenario in this case.",

Those are legitimate targets under the rules of warfare, the law of armed conflict. That would allow basically for some degree of response. Now if the attacks are successful that of course would cause the Israelis to respond probably in kind and go after similar Iranian installations.They did that to a very limited extent back in April when they attacked the facility near Isfahan. And that is something that, you know, the Iranians do have the capability to go after air bases. They did that, during the attack in April as well. They hit one of the runways of, the base that Israel uses -- that houses its F-35s. And that is, I think, one area where we could see some degree of escalation. If there is any good news in that, it means that it's confined to military targets. But, the problem with that is that could very quickly get out of hand. And if something is not targeted correctly or where it falls by accident in a civilian area, that could also trigger escalatory events.",

And then an even further escalation of that would be if we joined the Israelis in some kind of an attack on Iran. I don't see that happening.

They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because in Haywood County, neighbors are helping neighbors. That's what we do here in Southern Appalachia. The only way these folks have been able to survive for centuries being in such a rugged isolated area. So we do have some reasons for optimism. We're seeing more and more supplies come in. Haywood County government has set up some distribution sites. We've got a few water tankers coming in, and so the basic needs of public health are being met slowly but surely.",

I mean, is this -- are we talking about months, are we talking about years? I mean, what are you hearing?VAILLANCOURT (via telephone): I talked to Tony McEwen who's with an organization called the American Flood Coalition. He told me that it takes small cities 3, 4, 5 years to recover from extreme weather events of this magnitude. Large cities tend to cope a little bit better, but looking down the road and with the experience we had in 2021 when we had deadly flooding here, it takes several years for the FEMA processes to work through. County governments and local governments are already spending money expecting reimbursement, but that will take 3 years, if we're lucky.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, as you were laying out there, the stakes of this vice presidential debate are uncharacteristically high because it is likely the last debate of this election and also because the race still remains so close.Now what we do know about the preparations for each of these candidates is that governor Tim Walz was in Michigan over the last few days. He set up a debate camp there where they watched videos of Vance's previous debates as well as did mock sessions with transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg as Vance in those sessions. Now, of course, aides say that the task for him is going to be to cast Vance as just as much as a risk or a threat as former President Donald Trump, but also, as a means to getting to know the Vice President better as voters still have questions about her. Now Vance, similarly, also, a hunker down with his sessions. Now House Majority, Tom Emmer was the one who was helping him with being the stand in for Walz during those sessions. Now Vance is a more practiced debater. He is better debater, and that's something that Harris aides are well aware of. Of course, it was actually one of those debates, the Republican primary for U.S. Senate seat that caught former president Donald Trump's attention and that he was impressed by. So, Harris' campaign is going into this knowing that to be the case, but hoping that Walz's every man appeal, they say, will be what resonates with voters. Now we also know some of the rules for this debate that includes no live audience standing behind podiums and also, those 2 minute closing arguments, of course, they're going to talk about a range of issues, the economy, Israel. We can imagine that the hurricane may be among one of those questions, as well as immigration and health care. So certainly, going to be a debate that hits multiple issues at a critical juncture just over a month from election day. And also a pretty remarkable example of how much, again, this presidential election has changed only a few months ago with the vice president, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was preparing to go up against Vance, during this exact debate. So this has been something front of mind for the campaign now for several weeks and months. Rahel.",

So Walz will be talking about the Vice President's policies, the ticket's policies, and the same goes for Vance. Remember, one of the criticisms of the Trump-Vance campaign has been that the Vice President is too liberal, and the same goes for her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz. So expect that to be, an attack there.Now Harris aides want to keep the focus on the policies, so they want to be able to do what the Vice President did over the course of her presidential debate against former President Donald Trump by pivoting back to issues and making their ticket about the one that cares about the American people. Of course, how this actually unfolds on the debate stage still very much remains to be seen. But what is, notable about this debate is that it is the likely the last time that these two campaigns can present their arguments in front of a large audience, a TV audience that is, at a time where voters still have questions about both candidates and at a time when polling shows that there is no clear leader in this race. Any sort of edge is always within the margin of error. So this is a pivotal moment for both of the campaigns, and it rides on the shoulders of these vice presidential nominees, Rahel.",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has just released a video message asking Israelis to, quote, \"Stand together\" amid the threat from Iran. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (via translator): Citizens of Israel, we are in the midst of a campaign against Iran's axis of evil. I said yesterday that these are days of great achievements and great challenges. What I ask of you is two things. One, to strictly obey the directives of the frontline command. It saves lives. And second, to stand together. We will stand firm together in the testing days ahead. Together, we will stand, together we will fight and together, we will win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So these warnings and these updates from Israeli officials have been coming in. We've also heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a short time ago, also speaking to the Israeli public about this threat, advising them to follow local instructions and guidelines for their own safety, saying that together, they will win, and they are obviously, setting upon very trying days and hours ahead. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching One World, and we begin with that threat of the most dangerous escalation yet, perhaps in the Middle East, and one that could potentially drag the region into a full blown war. The White House believes that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile strike against Israel. Senior officials say the US s actively supporting Israel's defense preparations, and warned that a direct military attack from Tehran will carry, quote, severe consequences. The Israeli military says that it is on peak alert and is prepared both offensively and defensively. (VIDEO PLAYING)",
