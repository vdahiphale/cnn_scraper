      "sentences": "Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan.The flooding in California is really terrifying and the threat is not over. The state's governor said severe weather has killed at least 14 people now; 34 million people are under flood alerts today. More than a foot of rain has fallen in southern California in the last two days. A real threat isn't just the water, it is all -- it is rockslides and the threat of severe mudslides as well that could also very quickly create dangerous conditions. And it is all forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Crews have rescued a countless number of people, including this driver, as you can see in Los Angeles County. Just look at the water flow over his SUV. A 5-year-old boy is still missing today after being swept away by floodwaters yesterday. The search was actually suspended because, as you would anticipate, the weather has gotten too severe for the first responders. Let's get started. Mike Valerio is in Montecito, California, AT THIS HOUR. What are you seeing there?",

This is the Romero Creek here in the middle of Montecito which normally you can't even see in the summer.But this drains out to the Pacific Coast Highway. So if we look this way, where our photographer, Rudy, is pointing, this all drains from the bucolic foothills of the mountains and then goes southward to the beach. Look at the picture as motorists are stopping here. We have a couple of emergency vehicles. We had an armored Hummer that was making sure neighbors were OK before we came on the air. But this matters because we have homes, these beautiful estates, that are just yards away from these floodwaters. These waters were much higher when we came into the area around midnight. So the concern is that boulders, mud, all of this debris could flow from the mountains into here in the middle of the Montecito like it did five years ago. We have neighbors on this side over here, a huge eucalyptus tree the size of a mobile home came down about 10 minutes ago. So they're saying this is very emotional for them. They're debating whether or not to evacuate, even though all of this area is under a mandatory evacuation order, Kate.",

You heard it:  most of the state is under flood watch, we have evacuations; 200,000 people without power. Risk of mudslides and more rain coming. And I think that is probably the biggest concern that we have. We have had five atmospheric rivers come in to California over two weeks. Everything is wet. Everything is saturated. Everything is at a breaking point. And there is more rain coming.",

Our state is very big, we're the most populous state. Every corner of our state is touched by these extreme events, one rainstorm after another.

So that is a big part of the reason why the precaution is being taken.These mass evacuations in Ventura County and down in Montecito and Santa Barbara, it is a very real threat. But again the threats are across the state right now. We see a lot of internal flooding in neighborhoods. Parts of the Central Valley are very flat so once you have all this water and the drainage systems are full, when you get more water, it brings that level up and getting into people's houses. You know, it only takes six inches of water to lose control of a car, to be knocked over. In 12 inches, cars start floating away. And you've heard that several of these creeks have risen 14 feet just in the last day. And in certain areas we've had over a foot of rain in the last 48 hours. (CROSSTALK)",

Let's go back 2017 to 2019, before Joe Biden is president.And he has a job at the university and he has an office that he used. And flash forward to November 2nd, a team of lawyers uncovered fewer than 12 classified documents. They notified the National Archives and we're told that the National Archives took possession of the documents, as they should, the next morning. The Justice Department was notified and now the attorney general has tapped the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review this matter and do a damage assessment. And that is significant, Kate, because the U.S. attorney in Chicago is one of two Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys still serving in government. Notably the other one is in Delaware, overseeing the investigation into President Biden's son, Hunter. The Biden team said they are fully cooperating with the archives an the Justice Department. But at this point, there are a lot of questions we still have. Why did they go to this office? On this date, just a few days before a key midterm? Why were there lawyers searching this office and doing this particular errand? And also is this the only place that there could potentially be classified information?

He wanted the campaign to pay him $20,000 a day as a lawyer. Ultimately, he wasn't going to get that. But he did get, at two companies that he had at the time, about $140,000 reimbursed for travel expenses from Trump-connected entities.

Then there is the issue of cooperation. The Biden team is fully cooperating. And we know the former president and his team have not been very cooperative. They stonewalled and ignored and produced some documents -- and many weren't produced until a subpoena was obtained. And things have been uncovered. It has been very complicated and messy, which led to questions of possible obstruction. He's also under investigation for other crimes. So based on what we know now, these are two very different investigations. But we've only known about the Biden matter for about 24 hours. And we continue to report out the more specific details.",

Former president Trump was number one and what provided the basis, number one, obstruction of justice; number two was mishandling potentially of classified information and, number two (sic), gathering or transmitting or mutilating possibly Defense information. None of that as of right now is present here. Now look, if there is evidence that emerges that President Biden is concealing classified documents at his home and thwarting efforts of law enforcement to get to them, of course they should search his house.
