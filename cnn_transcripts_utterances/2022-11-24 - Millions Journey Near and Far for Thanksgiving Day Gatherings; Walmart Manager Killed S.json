I'm Jim Sciutto.Millions of people on the move for the holiday. The Transportation Security Administration says it screened nearly 2.5 million people at airports just yesterday. That is almost a pandemic-era record. For travelers heading out today, most will see clear skies across the country, but there are storms ahead in parts of the U.S. The middle of the part of the country there could cause some headaches. No problems right now at a beloved Thanksgiving tradition however, that being the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. We have all of your holiday news covered today. We begin with a look at travel around the country today. CNN Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean, he is live at Reagan National Airport. And, Pete, as we've been talk to you these last couple of days, the headline seems to be things have been moving very smoothly.",

The rush has kind of come and gone here at Reagan National Airport, but the numbers have been pretty up until now. 2.46 million people screened by TSA just yesterday at airports nationwide, that number only 6 percent off from what we saw on the same day back in 2019 before the pandemic.The good news here is that airlines have really been able to deliver. Just check Flight Aware. The cancelation numbers very low compared to the highs we saw over the summer when airlines canceled a total of about 50,000 flights. So far, only about 30 flights canceled today, 60 flights yesterday. The big superlative on Tuesday, United Airlines' main line and regional flights network-wide, zero cancelations. Let that sink in for a second. American Airlines delivered 99 percent of its flights, it says, and operated the biggest schedule of any airline on that day. There has been a lot of hiring at the airlines. There has been a lot of hiring at the federal government also to make sure they've been ready for this at the FAA level, air traffic control, also at the TSA. And I want you to listen to TSA Administrator David Pekoske, who says they have been moving workers around. 700 workers, in fact, are going to some of the smaller airports to larger airports where there is a big rush. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Back out to the northwest of there, there is going to be snow on the ground, six to eight inches of snow. Let me take you now day-by-day. By tomorrow, the rain that is here now moves off shore but another storm system there south of Houston moves on up into the same areas. That is the weather that is going to get in the way for Sunday. That low right there will be right here, right over the big airports by Sunday afternoon. Here is how it maps out. Three to five inches of rain across the south and then eventually it gets off toward the northeast. Here is your Sunday.

He seemed to relish in having power over others. They called him standoffish, but said they never imagined that it would end like this. They just thought he was difficult to work with. Talking to the survivors who were in the break room, who survived this thing, the stories that they told are just absolutely harrowing. Now, according to the city, they got the call at 10:12 P.M. Within two minutes, they were here on scene. And less than five minutes later at 10:16, they say they were in the building. That is where they found three bodies inside of that break room, one of whom was the shooter. They found another body at the front and three victims who unfortunately passed away from their injuries at the hospital. Those survivors talk about the moments that they were able to make it out.
