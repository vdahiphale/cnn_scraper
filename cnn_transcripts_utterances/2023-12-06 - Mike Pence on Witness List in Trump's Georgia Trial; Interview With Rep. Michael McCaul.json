And then, Jeff, I think it's also worth noting that this doesn't appear to be a bug, but a feature of the campaign and those around Donald Trump. Kash Patel, who worked in the first Trump administration and is clearly still in the Trump orbit, has been telling Steve Bannon and others that they will go after people in the media and people who crossed Donald Trump.

If you listen to what Donald Trump says, he is talking about his plans for a second term, from the Department of Justice on and on throughout the government, his plan to remake the government. And revenge is a central part of that. So being a dictator is a central part of that. And now what many Republicans who are looking for a new direction, in fact, some of his rivals will say privately, we will see if they say publicly tonight, that they believe that this is even more dangerous in a second term, because the president essentially knows his way around the office, if you will. He knows exactly what to levers to pull. So I do believe this will be a central part of the conversation. And talking to voters in recent days and really for the last several weeks and months, a lot of Trump supporters and voters are looking for something new because of this exactly. Now, they're not saying they won't vote for him in the long run should he become the nominee. But this really is a chance for Republican candidates to make their case. Again, we will see if they choose to do so. But time is running out for them, 40 days before the Iowa caucuses, a week later, the New Hampshire primary.

The international tribunal indicted Mr. Putin for basically taking 25,000 children hostage and then putting them in these indoctrination camps in Russia, which really goes to the heart of genocide itself. And I think the stronger of a case we can make for Ukraine against these war crime atrocities that we have seen come out of the Kremlin, in addition, Kate, the idea that the Putin invited Hamas after October the 7th to the Kremlin to meet with him. So, his unholy alliance with Chairman Xi and now the ayatollah and Hamas, people need to know who our adversaries are.

And here's what Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who has played a kind of a leading role in negotiations with Republicans over the past few weeks, what he said leaving that meeting: \"We are about to abandon Ukraine. When Vladimir Putin marches into a NATO country, they will rue the day,\" he's saying, Republicans, \"that they decided to play politics with the future of Ukraine's security.\" Do you fear that is how this is going to look and could end?",

So I know that Chuck Schumer's trying to move forward without any border security at all. I know, on the House side, speaking with Speaker Johnson, that that is imperative for us to be able to pass. Now, I do believe the majority of majorities, House and Senate, support the Ukraine effort. To your point, I actually raised what you just said with Secretary Austin and Blinken, and that is, if we abandon our NATO allies, and if we abandon Ukraine and allow Putin to take over Ukraine in a week, and then threaten their neighbors, that being Moldova, Georgia, possibly the Baltic states, then where are we? We have to think about this. If we're going to abandon ship on this, just like we did in Afghanistan, what is the end result from a foreign policy standpoint? I would argue it would be disastrous. It would empower and embolden our adversaries that are already emboldened enough, and that being Putin, Chairman Xi in China, and the ayatollah, all in this together. I think it would be projecting the strongest weakness that I have seen in my lifetime. We have a role to play to lead the free world against our adversaries, just like Ronald Reagan did.

I would say we were a little slow to respond, in addition, Houthi rebels, the same situation. One thing is clear. The proxies of Iran are getting very, very energized, very hot, and very dangerous right now. I loved the effort to designate the Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organization. One of the first things this administration did when they came in was to take that designation off the table. I think that was a mistake.

That's what a lot of Republicans, for example, have said. However, that doesn't square with Trump praising people who were attacking the Capitol, calling them patriots, suggesting that he's going to pardon them. That's completely inconsistent.
