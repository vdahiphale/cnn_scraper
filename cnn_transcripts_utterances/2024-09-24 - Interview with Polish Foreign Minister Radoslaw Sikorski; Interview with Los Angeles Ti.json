I'm Christiane Amanpour outside the United Nations in New York, where President Biden today made his final address in that role to the General Assembly. An audience of more than 100 world leaders all grappling with an increasingly unstable and volatile reality. And high on the agenda for President Biden was Ukraine. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The Ukrainian people stood up. I asked the people of this chamber to stand up for them. The good news is Putin's war has failed at his core aim. He set out to destroy Ukraine, but Ukraine is still free. He set out to weaken NATO, but NATO is bigger, stronger, more united than ever before with two new members, Finland and Sweden. But we cannot let up. The world now has another choice to make. Will we sustain our support to help Ukraine win this war and preserve its freedom, or walk away from that aggression, be renewed and a nation be destroyed? I know my answer. We cannot grow weary. We cannot look away and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thousands of people are fleeing their homes in search of safety. These images showing vehicles lined up at the Lebanon-Syria border.

NABIH BULOS, MIDDLE EAST BUREAU CHIEF, LOS ANGELES TIMES AND BEIRUT-BASED JOURNALIST:  Well, at this point, it's hard to say only because Hezbollah has sustained quite a few painful blows in these last few days. I mean, as you've reported on CNN, you've had the issue with the exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. And then, of course, you had that massive strike in the heart of Beirut that struck, I mean, one of the senior commanders and 16 of its elite commandos. And, of course, then we've seen this tsunami of airstrikes that has been hitting really across Lebanon these last two days. So, it's fair to say the group has sustained damage. At the same time, its leaders insist they will continue, right, with this so-called support for Hezbollah. And that now, more importantly, there's an open account with Israel. And none of this, of course, sounds like a situation which is reassuring, obviously. And at the same time, yes, Hezbollah has been perhaps weakened to an extent, but it supposedly still has a big arsenal and, indeed, still has enough cadres to mount a serious challenge, and that's where we are now.

And people, obviously, their savings were wiped out. So, really, they're ill-equipped to deal with the situation. At the same time, yes, there are people who are, of course, you know, against Hezbollah, but even its supporters are feeling the pain the sense that now they've had to leave the Dahiya, which is, you know, the heartland of its support in the capital. They've had to leave the south and also some parts of the east. And you saw the images as well, there's just a mass exodus.

And I mean, that ring of fire around Israel has been effective in terms of a threat. At the same time, right, does this mean that Iran is going to push those various groups to help out if it comes to a big war? Will Iran itself send, for example, troops or the besiege or anything else in that sense? I mean, truth, I don't expect that to happen, but I do think that it will continue to support with weapons and perhaps logistical help with advisers and things of that nature. I mean, the fact of the matter is that right now, even Hezbollah is not really interested in taking this into a wider war, even after all this, right. Despite all the rhetoric, they are still interested in keeping it as it is, because that, in and of itself, is enough to maintain the goal of keeping residents of Northern Israel outside of that area.

What we want, Christiane, is we want the boats to be stopped before they enter the water. And in order to do that, we need, of course, the cooperation of the Turkish authorities. And I'd say we've made progress over the past year in establishing better channels of communication because migration is a huge issue and we don't want to leave it up to the smugglers to decide who enters the European Union or to put innocent lives at risk.

At the same time, it is important for to establish legal pathways to migration and to do so in an organized and disciplined manner, both for humanitarian reasons, but also for economic reasons. Greece, for example, was the one country that accepted hundreds of women from Afghanistan when the country essentially was on the verge of collapse after the U.S. abandoned the country abruptly. So, we have both humanitarian sensitivities, but at the same time, we want to send a message to countries such as Egypt, for example, that we can welcome workers to Greece so they can come and stay, they can come legally, safely, and they don't need to embark on a dangerous trip, you know, across the GNC in order to get to Greece. And I think this has to be the foundation of a modern migration policy by the European Union. The solution is not to bypass the Schengen rules unilaterally. We have a pact for asylum and migration.

Your coast guards periodically have been accused of allegedly forcing people out of your waters and making people, you know, go back out to sea and turn them away from -- you know, from Greece.

And whenever we have incidents where we feel we need to investigate, we will do so. At the same time, we do retain for ourselves the right to intercept boats on the sea border. I need to stress, these are not the open waters. The borders, as you know, are relatively close, and then work with the Turkish Cork out in order to return these people to Turkey with safety.

In Greece, for example, we're using sophisticated technologies, drones, artificial intelligence to identify wildfires as quickly as possible.

So, we need to be ahead of the curve. But this needs to be a European initiative, not just a Greek initiative. And I'm afraid that when you look at the resources that we have available in Europe, we focus a lot on the Green Deal, but we focus very little on short-term adaptation, because once these climate events hit, it is devastating, whether we're talking about wildfires or the big floods, and we need to do more as Europe to convince our citizens that on the path towards climate neutrality, we will stand by them in case we have a catastrophic climate event.",

And I would -- I had opportunities handed to me because of the first book that I wasn't able to take advantage of because I was so broken, and I wanted to change that. And part of that was recognizing that by virtue of some of the work I've done, by virtue of just where Donald and I ended up, diametrically opposed to each other and as far apart as you could possibly be, both literally and metaphorically, I have some power here, too, and I want to use it to help. I want to make -- I want to help change. I want to contribute. And that can be scary, but it's also a privilege.",

It feels like we've been fighting this rearguard action against encroaching fascism for years now, and it weakens us. You know, there's attrition. It leaves us vulnerable. So, we need to strengthen democracy. Actually, I mean, I don't think America has ever been a true democracy. We need to make it one. We need to make this country representative to all of its people who all have the same rights and make this as a level of playing field as we possibly can. But ort of more immediately, I really hope to be part of the conversation that makes people feel that being a fully realized human being, being the kind of country that I think most of us want this country to be, we need to believe that kindness is a strength. We need to believe that empathy is the thing that unites us, is the thing that makes us better. And I would like to see this fallacious notion that cruelty is what makes us strong in the rearview mirror. It's unsustainable.",
