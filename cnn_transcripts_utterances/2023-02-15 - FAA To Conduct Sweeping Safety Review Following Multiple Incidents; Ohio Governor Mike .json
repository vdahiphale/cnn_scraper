And the other thing that I am thinking about here is Trump's response, because he was already referring to her as overly ambitious.

And so I do think that Trump has had a lot of success in attacking and belittling women who run against him, and I guess it remains to be seen whether that's going to stick here.One thing I do want to say to Chapin's point is that I am not sure I agree, because I think that one of the things we saw in the midterms is that when there were primaries where there was one candidate that was endorsed by Trump and then one opponent, typically that opponent had -- did a little better.

That being said, I do think a candidate like Ron DeSantis is going to be fighting for the same votes that Trump is, so it's going to be interesting how this plays out.
