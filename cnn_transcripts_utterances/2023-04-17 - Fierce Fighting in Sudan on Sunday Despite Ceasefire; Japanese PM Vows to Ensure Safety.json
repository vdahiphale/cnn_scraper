The World Health Organization says more than 1,100 have been injured. Witnesses tell CNN they heard continuing exchanges of gunfire Sunday, despite the U.N.-brokered three-hour ceasefire that was negotiated to address urgent humanitarian needs. The sudden eruption of fighting on Saturday forced shops to close without notice and left many people with no time to stock up or prepare. There are reports of water and power cuts and shortages of fuel, food and medical care. Sudan's former prime minister called for both sides to step back from the conflict before the country returns to full-on civil war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDALLA HAMDOK, FORMER SUDANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): That is why we demand for an immediate ceasefire and to reach agreements that will lead to a permanent end of hostility. We need to at least reach a truce that will lead to establishing a humanitarian corridor. That will allow civilians to have access to medicine, treatment and food. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Since Saturday, the forces of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as a Rapid Support Forces, paramilitary group, or RSF, have been locked in battle with the Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan. The fighting comes as Sudan tries to finalize a deal to return to civilian rule after two military coups in recent years, which temporarily united the army and the RSF. In a phone interview, Dagalo, who is better known as Hemetti, told me ruling Sudan isn't his endgame.",

There's a framework agreement between all the Sudanese stakeholders that should be adhered to. I don't want to lead anything. These are all propaganda they are making. MADOWO (voice-over): As part of the agreement, the RSF, some 100,000 strong, would merge with the army. But differences over how long that would take and who would end up with more power aggravated tensions between the two factions, which have since erupted into open warfare. Residential areas across Sudan have become battlefields, with anti- aircraft weapons in the streets, and warplanes hovering overhead. Scores of civilians have been killed. The army blames the RSF for the violence, with Hemetti pointing the finger back at al-Burhan.",

SUSAN STIGANT, DIRECTOR OF AFRICA PROGRAMS, U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE: I think it's difficult to read at this stage, why the humanitarian ceasefire that was called for earlier today didn't hold. It was announced quite at the last minute. It was unclear whether it was a command issue, whether it was just not respected, whether it was a communication issue. Nonetheless, it really needs to be tried again. At stake right now is really fundamentally protection of civilians. There's heavy fighting in urban areas. People can't move from their houses to get food, water, basic supplies. And there's -- there are houses that are getting hit in the middle of Khartoum itself.

Fossil fuels like coal, though, still reign supreme for now, but experts say we may have seen their peak. All right.

WIATROS-MOTYKA: So wind and solar have been growing every year for about 20 percent together. And they are basically winning the competition with fossil fuels. So we expect further growth in line with the average from -- from the last decade or so. And from this year, we expect, therefore, fall in fossil fuel. It will be small, but every -- every following year, it will increase. So now we have over 6 -- 60 countries generating over a 10th of the power from wind and solar. So it is significant. HOLMES: Very, very much so. The report it is striking. I read it all, and it's very thorough in terms of what it looked at. It analyzes data from 78 countries. That represents 93 percent of global electricity demand. And it was interesting, because I read that three of the top five wind and solar generators are in Asia. China, which of course, is a huge polluter, as well. India, the same. And Japan. And, you know, even though China is growing its coal generation. I mean, what is the significance of where the biggest changes are happening? And why there? WIATROS-MOTYKA: So it is very significant, because China alone accounted for over half of the global rise in the electricity demand. So them deploying wind and solar is very important, because that means that they're growing; demand needs will be met by clean electricity. So they will stop generate more planet-warming emissions.
