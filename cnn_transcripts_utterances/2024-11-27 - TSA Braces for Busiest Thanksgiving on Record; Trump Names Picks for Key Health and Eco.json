And a shocking twist in an alleged murder case, prosecutors say a Colorado dentist accused of fatally poisoning his wife was also plotting to kill a detective assigned to the investigation. Good morning. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. All right, good morning. This morning, the journey begins for an estimated 80 million people who will be on the move over the holiday, according to AAA. And the TSA says this will be the busiest Thanksgiving for air travel ever, with more than 18 million people expected to fly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tomorrow could be even more chaotic because that's when a weather system could descend on some of the busier airports. So, right now, though, it's looking very clear.Let me show you the big board here, Jim. This is exactly what you want to see on Thanksgiving. Look at this, on time, on time, on time. Those are the only two words you want to see when you're traveling over at Thanksgiving, especially when there are this many people taking to the air. As you said, 18 million people total probably going to fly over this weekend. Here at O'Hare, it's going to be and -- O'Hare and Midway, which is the other Chicago area airport, they're thinking it's going to be at least 1.5 million people who travel between yesterday and next Monday. The busiest day is going to be Sunday, Jim. They're thinking 254,000 people are going to roll through O'Hare on Sunday alone. So, that just gives you a sense of how big this travel weekend is. And then compared with last year, it's about an 11 percent increase. So, when you look across the board, things could not be more perfect. The weather is holding for today. The cancelations are low, 25 cancelations throughout the country. You know, a few hundreds of delays, but delays don't mean cancelation, Jim. So, this is a -- we're in very, very good shape. Let me show you the clear security line here at O'Hare. Look at this, very, very smooth. They're and that's also TSA pre-check down the way there. But this is clear, very smooth. Let me give you the economy look here, Jim. It's bustling, but it is quick. Right now, the numbers at O'Hare 15 minutes through economy, 15 minutes through TSA pre, 5 minutes if you're flying first class. It can't get any better than that on a holiday weekend, Jim.",

I snapped this picture earlier outside the CNN studios of just how busy the air travel is over the busiest airport hub in America, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.Look all the contrails in the sky. The skies are packed with planes right now and we've got green across the board from the West Coast to the East Coast. Of course, green means go. No major travel delays. However, there is a storm system brewing across Colorado and possibly light flakes to fall from the sky. [10:05:0] This is coming out of Steamboat Springs, where up to two feet of snow has blanketed the slopes, created some tricky travel conditions along I-70, but that energy from that particular storm system is going to move eastward and this is going to be the game changer. Prepare yourself for the long haul. If you're heading to grandma or grandpa's house on the East Coast, things are going to get very interesting on Thanksgiving days. Again, today, you're in the clear. No problems. But tomorrow, 24 hours later, this will be a completely different story. Look at this low pressure rain for the coastal cities, that I-95 corridor, snow the further north you travel into Northern New England. And then that trailing cold front, that could spin up a few powerful thunderstorms across the southeast today. Threats remain across Birmingham and into parts of Mississippi tomorrow. We've got our eyes set on Atlanta. So, keep an eye to the sky as you set down for that dinner table with friends and family. Look at how much snow we can expect outside of the major cities, four to eight inches of slushy, wet snow. Lots of fun to drive on as you head home from grandma and grandpa's. Jim?",

Just three weeks after winning the White House, Donald Trump is quickly assembling his team for a second term. Overnight, the president-elect added a new round of names filling major roles in public health and economic advisers. Notably, he selected businessman John Phelan for secretary of the Navy. He does not have military experience, we should note. And one of the first people to concoct the 2020 fake electorate strategy, Vince Haley, has been tapped to lead the Domestic Policy Council. Another new development to tell you about after weeks of delays, the Trump team has also signed an agreement with the Biden White House that does unlock key transition briefings and cooperation. Joining me now is Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. Congressman, good to be with you, thanks for being with us once again. Let's talk about these cabinet choices. What's your sense of how things are going so far? What's your priority in terms of getting some of these nominees through confirmation hearings in the coming weeks? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  Well, I'm delighted with them, Jim. This is what America voted for. They voted for change. We were going off a cliff economically every other way. Our borders were awash. 14 million people come over in the last four years, the fentanyl crisis, and already with the talks of tariffs, you're seeing the president of Mexico backing off and telling we're going to work on shutting the border down. So, I think it's working very well. ACOSTA:  I do want to ask you about that. I mean, you know, the poll showed America's primarily voted for Trump to fix inflation and the economy. Did the American people vote for people like Matt Gaetz to be the attorney general or a vaccine conspiracy theorists, like RFK Jr., to be in public health roles? Isn't that overreach?",

Last month, Customs and Border Patrol arrested about 56,000 people along the southern border. That is almost 15,000 less or fewer than October of 2020 when Trump was finishing his first term.As you know, Congressman, arrests on the southern border are down.
