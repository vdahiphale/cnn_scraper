I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you live from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, is the tit-for-tat between Israel and Iran over at least for now. Ronen Bergman joins us from Tel Aviv. And as many hoped for a ceasefire in Gaza, I talked to Ryan Crocker, who was ambassador in Iraq and Afghanistan as America fought its battle against insurgents. He talks about what is likely to come next. Plus, The United States says North Korea has sent thousands of troops to train in Russia. I sat down with a former CIA analyst to discuss what the U.S. Defense secretary called a very, very serious escalation. Then recent polls have Trump with a roughly 15-point advantage with men and Harris with a similar advantage with women. Stunning statistics. I talked to the writer Richard Reeves about what is behind them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If Iran react, if Iran retaliates, I think the next move in this ping-pong, from Israel will be much more severe.Fareed, we have to take in consideration this time Israel restrained itself following requests from the U.S. not to go against the energy facilities or the nuclear facilities before the U.S. elections. But we are just there. Maybe after the elections Israel will feel much more -- a better freedom to do and attack these sites and its one specific place in Iran, Israel destroyed the same battery that was guarding the biggest industry park for energy, for gas and oil in the country. Not touching it, but the Iranians told my colleague (INAUDIBLE) simply we understand Iranian officials, we understand this was the hit, that next time this could be on the military industrial civilian complex.",

It didn't work very well, but still I think that some intelligence services will be so successful they tend to confuse between doing something very targeted and trying to inflate massive protests and there are people in Israel who believe that maybe I'll try to convince Prime Minister Netanyahu that it's doable, that they can lead a regime change and if this is the case, then it's not just about teaching a lesson, but we will be looking at something much longer than any kind of people, even if Iran decides not to react this time.",

And of course just a few days ago, we marked the 41st anniversary of the marine barracks bombing.However, Israel would do very well to remember how Hezbollah was created in the first place, Hezbollah did not exist until the Israeli invasion of 1982 and the subsequent military occupation of South Lebanon. That gave birth to Hezbollah and this current invasion and occupation for however long it lasts, is not likely to end it. Just on Friday we saw I think 10 Israeli soldiers killed in south Lebanon. That is a much more potent organization. It was born in conflict and an occupation. It certainly is not going to be ended by that same conflict and occupation.",

The radicalization of the population in south Lebanon occurred during that occupation and the current wave of offensive attacks, which have not exactly been precise in their nature, run the risk of doing exactly the same thing to a new generation of Lebanese who have seen this movie before. It did not go well, not for Israel, not for the United States. Right now whether it's Gaza or south Lebanon. I think there is an urgent need for a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and an effort toward a more stable, if not formal peace. At least some quiet insecurity for both sides of the border.

The male suicide rate has risen by more than a third among men under the age of 30 just since 2010. And we're now losing 40,000 men a year to suicide alone.

My father never questioned his economic role in our family, he was the breadwinner, or in his community.
