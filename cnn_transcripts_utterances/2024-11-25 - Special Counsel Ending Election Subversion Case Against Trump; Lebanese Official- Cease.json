Special counsel Jack Smith has dropped both federal cases against President-elect Donald Trump, ending the election subversion case. That's related, of course, to Trump's actions to overturn the legitimate 2020 results in the lead up to January 6th of 2021, and also the prosecution over his refusal to hand over classified documents after leaving office. Now, Smith said the decisions are rooted in Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president not. This is important, not a reflection of the merits of the cases themselves. CNN national security reporter Zach Cohen is standing by for us. And, Zach, you and I were talking in the last hour or so, not a surprising moment, but enormous. One given, of course, the historic nature of these cases. Tell us about smith's conclusions and what he said here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Isa, this really marks the end of a two-year criminal pursuit of Donald Trump by Jack Smith. He's moving to dismiss both cases. Federal cases against Donald Trump, of course, the one that he charged here in Washington, D.C. related to Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. And, of course, the other one in Florida related to Trump's mishandling of classified documents.And look, Jack Smith, and his team have tried to bring this case to trial again for years now. And we -- we've known for a while that that was not going to happen. That Donald Trump was not going to stand trial in either case before the 2024 election. But, Jack Smith, laying out in these court documents today and making very clear that Donald Trump's election victory just earlier this month requires him to end both of those criminal cases under the Constitution, and as you mentioned, under longstanding Justice Department prosecutors cannot prosecute a sitting president. And, look, he makes very clear that he consulted the Justice Department attorneys on this and that, ultimately, they came to the same conclusion that these cases had to end. He writes in one part of a motion in the January 6th case, he says: After careful consideration, the department has determined that OLC's prior opinions concerning the constitution's prohibition on federal indictment, and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result, this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated. That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof or the merits of the prosecution which the government stands fully behind. And that last part, Isa, as you mentioned, is really important. Jack Smith making clear that this decision solely lies in the fact that Donald Trump will be inaugurated president on January 20th of next year. And not based on the merits or the strength of the case that he and his team have built in either case, the classified documents or the election subversion case, standing by his findings and saying that, look, we've put together a lot of proof that we believe shows Donald Trump committed crimes and he is essentially being let off the hook because he was elected president in 2024.",

Jack Smith's team has appealed that, and now says that they will continue to fight that ruling as it relates to the two co-defendants. So we'll have to see. These are two allies of Donald Trump. These are two people who effectively are charged with helping obstruct a federal investigation into Donald Trump. Donald Trump's legal team has a lot of, you know, reason to want to bolster their defense. But ultimately, were going to have to see if Donald Trump's control of the Justice Department, he just installed some of his former lawyers at the Justice Department, how all that will trickle down and impact this case going forward. [[15:05:04] But I just want to point out, too, both of these opinions and these motions by Jack Smith also request that they be dismissed without prejudice, which does leave the door open technically for charges to be filed in the future related to both these cases against Donald Trump.

Vance, Donald Trump's vice president-elect, tweeting just a few minutes ago that this shows that these prosecutions against Donald Trump were always politically motivated.And so this feeds into that narrative that we've heard from Donald Trump and his allies on the campaign trail. And since he was elected to be the next president of the United States that the Justice Department under the Biden administration was weaponized against him, sort of trying to cast all these criminal cases against him as essentially a political targeting operation against him.

It sits in some sort of ill-defined ether and I don't think that's going to please Donald Trump. And the question is whether he can order his Department of Justice to somehow revive the case and then dismiss it with prejudice.But you're going to have an opinion here its going to come from Tanya Chutkan and she's going to I think, rehearse the things that smith has said about the righteousness of the prosecution, about the DOJ still believing in it, about the override based on the OLC memo but nothing to do with the merits or gravity of the case. So that is a very small kind of, you know, final pyrrhic, I wouldn't even say victory, but little -- little thing, little footnote that Smith has now added to what was going to be a demolished prosecution.",

I think once Trump comes in, you could expect him to try to scrub these pages in support of his narrative that he was innocent all along. So it will come down that report will have important contemporary and historical value and my best guess is, yes, it'll be full and it will be not just about the case he brought, but under the regulations, the cases he didn't bring.

He doesn't want the war in Lebanon. He doesn't want the war in Gaza so. So Trump is a -- Netanyahu is sort of clearing the decks in a way. But there's another piece of the equation here. And I know we've been doing some reporting about this today, about the way the West Bank, the occupied West Bank and the plans for the hard right to annex it. Well, we heard from the defense minister today lay out something that we've been just beginning to hear more of recently from -- from the defense minister saying, we're seeing a big Iranian threat in the West Bank. They're funneling weapons. They're funneling money. They're trying to recruit people there. And this is a growing narrative.

Joining me now to discuss is Ronnie Chatah, host of \"The Beirut Banyan\" podcast and son of assassinated Lebanese diplomat Mohamad Chatah. Great to have you on the show. Your reaction, first of all, to the mutterings were hearing regarding a possible ceasefire. RONNIE CHATAH, HOST, \"THE BEIRUT BANYAN\":  I think there's two feelings that come to mind, and one is familiarity. When the July and August 2006 war ended, eerily familiar in that there was an escalation in hostilities and then very quickly, a ceasefire signed, followed by de-escalation and Israeli withdrawal, as long -- in addition to Hezbollah fighters moving north of the Litani River. You fast forward two decades later, the same resolution is being put into effect. This is 1701, except that there seems to be a more robust enforcement mechanism, which is different than two decades ago, and that the Americans are more involved and it seems like the Israelis along with Hezbollah fighters, this will be a very slow move south and north. It will take 60 days, meaning that there's room for error. And you could see hostilities reemerge. You could also see this not work out and add to that and your correspondent mentioned earlier, we have to see how the Israelis officially respond to the ceasefire deal tomorrow. But on the other end of the feeling is that it seems like, for better or worse, this is a ceasefire between Israel and Iran and that Lebanon is not really at the table. Lebanese interests are not being represented effectively and add to that, the story of how we got here following 2006. Why there was war again the last year has not been resolved and that really has to do with how Iran operates in Lebanon.",

It was Chapter 6.It's the former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Jeffrey Feltman who's quoted as saying, it's 6.5, meaning the Lebanese state was given access to request international support and UNIFIL support, in other words, mechanism in place to ask for robust border patrol, not just along the Lebanese-Israeli border but along the Lebanese-Syrian border as well. This is meant to prevent weapons, sub-state weaponry from flowing into the country. This is meant to give the Lebanese state something they had lost decades ago, which is enforcement, meaning the Lebanese army can do its job in the south. It's easy to forget the Lebanese army was not in southern Lebanon before the July and August 2006 war. It had been absent since the 1970s. Today, you have the Lebanese army. You have UNIFIL, you have one of the most militarized regions in the world, in addition to Hezbollah fighters and now Israeli fighters, as well. But the difference between Iran to 20 years ago and Iran today is that Iran effectively built its crown jewel in the Middle East. It expanded it. It turned Hezbollah not into a Lebanese resistance force against Israel, not a Lebanese deterrence group. It turned Hezbollah into a regional army. And Hezbollah has been active in the region the last 20 years. And it's important to note, for the most part in the last 20 years, the Lebanese-Israeli border was quiet. The last two decades, it was a very quiet border and that means the status quo that Lebanon finds itself in doesn't mean Lebanese Israeli war or Hezbollah-Israel fighting.

Among them are a handful of individuals tasked with writing Project 2025. And that is a conservative governing blueprint that Trump disavowed, if you remember, and distanced himself from during the campaign. And that includes, you can see there, Russell Vought. A key author of the Project 2025 who will return to lead the same office he ran in the first administration, Office of Management and Budget. Joining me now for more with CNN political reporter Alayna Treene who covers, of course, Trump. She is in West Palm Beach, in Mar-a-Lago. And, Alayna, I want to get to Trump's cabinet selection in just a moment. First, I mean, let's speak to the major breaking news that we've been following here on CNN for the last two hours. And that is Jack Smith's dismissal of both federal cases against Trump. Just give us a sense of what the reaction, if any, has been so far from the Trump camp.",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, I think there's no surprise that Donald Trump and his team are celebrating right now at Mar-a- Lago.However, when I talk to some of his advisers, they argue that this wasn't a total surprise. They knew that if Donald Trump had won the election, that this was likely to happen. Now we did just moments ago hear from the president-elect himself responding to these cases being dismissed by the special counsel Jack Smith. I want to read you just some of what he had posted on his social media website, Truth Social. He said, quote: These cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless and should never have been brought. In a second post, he said: It was a political hijacking and a low point in the history of our country that such a thing could have happened. And yet I persevered against all odds and won. Make America Great Again. So, look, this is pretty typical of what we have seen from Donald Trump. Whenever he had a perceived win in this case, very much a win with regard to his legal cases. And we've heard similar things from other people from his incoming White House communications director, from his running mate, J.D. Vance. All to say, though, I do think, you know, pointing out the significance of some of this is so important because I would remind you that this these cases have consumed Donald Trump for several months, it's not even more than a year now particularly at a time when his campaign really had to be focusing on the race ahead of him. They were really embroiled in all of this, even having Donald Trump have to sit in and trial for weeks at a time during his New York hush money case. So I think there's a lot a big sense of relief that this is kind of gone for now. I mean, we'll see if its for now or forever. I mean, it's not going to continue while Donald Trump is in office, but definitely a relief is what I'm picking up from the transition team.",

We saw what happened last week with Representative Matt Gaetz, who had been nominated to be the attorney general, and then quickly decided to withdraw his name. He has now since been replaced with Pam Bondi as the nominee for the attorney general slot.But that just goes to show you how much can change and how quickly things can evolve on Capitol Hill. With that said, you know, a lot of staffers and aides that I'm talking to are really in the infancy of this process. Phone calls are beginning with some of these nominees. You saw Pete Hegseth, head to Capitol Hill last week with the incoming vice president, J.D. Vance, as he tried to help introduce the nominee to some of the senators on Capitol Hill. But many of the members that he met with were really friendly pro-Trump members of the United States Senate who are likely to vote for Hegseth anyway. His really big battle in the days and weeks ahead is going to be trying to convince some of those members on the Senate Armed Services Committee to support his nomination because as part of this vote process in the Senate, you have to first move through each committee. Then they will have a vote. They will decide whether or not to advance someone to the floor of the Senate. It's important to point out that Republicans can lose three members on each of these nominations. They can lose no more than that, assuming that everyone is attending the votes. But that is a really important thing to keep in mind here because each one of these nominees has a lot of obstacles to overcome when they are trying to convince senators. Yes, a lot of Republicans believe Donald Trump should get to choose who he wants in his cabinet, but that doesn't mean that it's a rubber stamp necessarily, to advance these nominees -- Isa.",

The brothers could hear and see what was happening in the court, but we could not see them. At one point, we just heard one of the brothers saying, yeah, we've been able to see video the whole time. That drew a bit of a laugh from the crowd that had been watching technicians trying to set up this video link. But what did happen in court is we heard from the sister of Jose Menendez. He is the wealthy businessman executive who was shot to death by his sons, Eric and Lyle. The mother, Kitty, was also shot to death. Now, Jose's sister in court was very emotional and she said, yes, I loved my little brother. I knew him very well. We were exceptionally close, but these boys have done enough time in jail, 35 years is enough. Then Kitty's sister. So the mother's sister, she also got up and she also said, we want the boys home. She also spoke about the abuse that the boys say that they suffered at the hands of their father, years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse that they say led them to murder their fathers because they were fearing for -- murder their father because they were fearing for their own lives. They were, of course, sentenced back in the '90s. This has really all come back to a head because of a few documentaries, one which claims that a boy band member was also sexually abused by Jose Menendez. That led the Erik and Lyle Menendez legal team to file for a retrial or a seeing a resentencing. So, we were supposed to be seeing a resentencing December 11th for various reasons. That is now going to be at the end of January because everybody needs to get up to speed. And also, we've had a new district attorney elected here in Los Angeles, which has also slowed things down a little bit -- Isa.",
