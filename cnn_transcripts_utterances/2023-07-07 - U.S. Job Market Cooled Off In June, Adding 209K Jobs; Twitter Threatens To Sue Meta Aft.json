And that makes sense because if the numbers are too strong, that suggests that the economy is overheating. You don't want that. Too weak, it signals a recession.You want something between. It seems like that's what we got, 209,000 jobs added in June. Almost 100,000 fewer than in May. And we also saw April and May revised lower. But if you look at the trend on that chart, you can see job growth is solid but it is slowing down and that's what economists want to see. Look at the unemployment rate. On the left side of that chart, it spiked during Covid to almost 15 percent. Now, 3.6 percent. That's historically very low. And another encouraging development from today's report is that more Americans are coming off the sidelines and re-entering the jobs market. Including women. We know that Covid forced millions of women out of the workforce. But now we see that the participation rate for women 25 to 54 is at a record high for the third month in a row. And that is good news. So if you put all of this together, it does speak to Goldilocks. Mark Zandi said on Twitter that this June employment report was close to perfect, not too hot, not too cold. The thinking, Jim, is that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates, including later this month, but hopefully, it's closer to the end.",

Lawyers for Twitter are accusing Mark Zuckerberg's company of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, saying that Meta hired former Twitter employees.

      "sentences": "Popular eating apps Door Dash, Grubhub and Uber Eats are suing New York City over its new minimum wage law for delivery workers. The law takes effect next week and all three claim it does more harm than good. CNN business and politics correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, is here.Vanessa, why are they against this and how does more money hurt the workers? What are they arguing here? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the three companies filed a lawsuit against New York City over this new minimum wage law that's set to take effect next week. Essentially, the companies are saying, by having to pay their employees more, restaurants would have to incur more expenses, consumers would have to pay more. And these companies won't be able to have as many delivery workers who are working for them because they wouldn't be able to afford to pay them at these new levels. Let's take a look at what we're actually talking about when we're talking these numbers. On July 12th, set to go into effect, delivery food workers would have to be paid $17.96 an hour, at a minimum, and that's not including tips. And then by 2025, that jumps to $20. These companies would also have the option of paying 50 cents per minute for the amount of time that these delivery workers spend on a food delivery trip. New York City says there are 60,000 delivery workers in the city. They get paid on average, though, $7 an hour. And many of these workers do not have health benefits. Delivery workers have been around for many years, decades. But over the pandemic, we've seen an explosion in people ordering takeout. That's because many of us during the pandemic didn't want to go to restaurants so we did takeout. Right now, delivery accounts for about 9 percent for all restaurant sales. That sounds low but that grew over the pandemic. And we're still seeing higher levels of delivery and takeout from pre-pandemic levels. Brianna, the city is saying they're disappointed by this lawsuit. They believe ultimately that this law will go into effect. Because, in their eyes, they believe that raising wages and setting a minimum wage for these workers is ultimately in the best interest of these workers that we rely on every single day for our food delivery -- Brianna?",
