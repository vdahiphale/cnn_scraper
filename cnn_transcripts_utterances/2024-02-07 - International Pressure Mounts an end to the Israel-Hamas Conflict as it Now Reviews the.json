And we begin this hour in Israel where America's top diplomat will soon kick off a day of high-stakes talks with top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to press for a humanitarian pause in Gaza, but also discuss Hamas' response to a proposal meant to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Israel is Blinken's fourth stop on his latest trip to the Middle East. On Tuesday, he was in Qatar, where he discussed a humanitarian pause with officials, as well as the ongoing efforts to free the hostages. Qatar has served as a key mediator in negotiations with Hamas and describes the group's reply to the proposal as a, quote, \"positive development.\" Journalist Elliott Gotkine is following developments live from London. He joined us now. Good morning to you, Elliot. So what more are you learning about the proposal to secure the release of these remaining hostages and of course Hamas's response?",

This was with the United States, with the Egyptians, the Qataris and the Israelis.And this was setting out the broad parameters of what a hostage deal would look like now as of yesterday, the Hamas response or proposal for an actual deal was transmitted to the Qataris and the Egyptians. Now, President Biden's initial response was this seems like a little over the top, but we understand from someone familiar with the negotiations that Hamas's proposal is in their words reasonable and crucially, it does not include a demand for Israel to completely end the war in the Gaza Strip and to withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip, something which Hamas had been saying very publicly and which was very widely reported. So that could make it much easier for the Israelis to swallow when they go back with their own counter proposal. For now, the United States and Israel is -- they are analyzing Hamas' proposal and some kind of response is expected in due course. We know where the Israelis have publicly said their red lines are. Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that Israel won't release thousands of terrorists and it won't deviate from its war objective of destroying Hamas. But perhaps if Hamas has climbed down from its maximalist demand for Israel to withdraw troops from the Gaza Strip and end the fighting completely, perhaps Israel may now be leaned upon by Secretary Blinken to do something similar so that they can meet somewhere in the middle and a hostage deal can finally be done. But certainly, Rosemary, we're not there yet. But there is some kind of weary optimism that we could be inching closer, finally, to a hostage deal that would see the more than 100 hostages who were abducted by the Hamas and others on October the 7th in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, and of course, a pause in the fighting and an increase in humanitarian aid that's desperately needed in the Gaza Strip.

Our thanks to Elliott Gotkine, bringing us the latest from London.Well, the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian journalists in Gaza are both reporting heavy fire and raids across multiple parts of Gaza over the last two days. The IDF says its operations in and around Khan Younis in the south are continuing, where it says more militants in civilian clothing were killed Tuesday after preparing to attack Israeli forces. [03:05:05] Meantime, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza is accusing the Israeli military of tightening the siege of a medical complex near Khan Younis, where thousands of displaced civilians are staying. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comment on its operations around the hospital. In northern Gaza, we're now getting a look at the scale of destruction left by months of war. This drone video from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency shows dozens of buildings razed to the ground. Earlier I spoke with CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton about the war in Gaza and Israel's goal to defeat Hamas and wipe out its leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE: The betting right now, at least in IDF circles, is that the leadership of Hamas, especially the top three, are still in Gaza. Now there's always a chance that may be wrong and that they may have escaped somewhere. They may have interspersed themselves within the refugee population, which is quite numerous, as we know in Gaza, and they could have potentially escaped. But I think right now the betting is still correct that they're in Gaza, probably in one of those tunnels and more specifically in the tunnels around Khan Younis.",

El Nino is also, with global warming, both are pushing temperature upward, and extreme temperatures are contributing to these kind of fires.At least they are boosting fire risk and increasing the potential for these type of fires once it needed, intensified rapidly and spread faster. So the forecast was there and the money was there. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the last season saw an increment in the budget allocated for fighting fires of about 50 percent.

And you can't be worrying about something where you're doing the right thing, but if it doesn't work out, you're going to end up in prison. REED (voice-over): The judges on Tuesday batted down that argument and slammed Trump's alleged efforts to stay in power, despite losing the election, as unpresidential and an assault on American institutions. We cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes. Former President Trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches. In a statement today, the Trump campaign argued that without complete immunity, no president could properly perform their duties for fear of retribution. If immunity is not granted to a president, every future president who leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. But the court also rejected any suggestion that prosecuting Trump in this case would have a chilling effect on future leaders. Past presidents have understood themselves to be subject to impeachment and criminal liability, at least under certain circumstances, so the possibility of chilling executive action is already in effect. Trump is vowing to appeal, and the Supreme Court will likely have the final say. The justices, though, were already set to hear arguments on Thursday in another case with huge implications for Trump on whether his actions after the 2020 election disqualify him from the 2024 ballot.",

Thousands of people have been coming through here since 1 p.m. local time, eager to see their favorite pop star take over that stage and sing and dance.We have seen so many fans dressed up in these very colorful outfits, each one representing a different era in Taylor Swift's discography. We've also seen fans exchange friendship bracelets. I've actually gotten a few of them from Swifties myself. Very kind, very sweet. And also, of course, people dancing and singing and cheering. I joined in myself. I had to. I couldn't help it. And you know, Taylor Swift is so famous in the United States, but her fame transcends international borders Rosemary. Of course, fans are just so eager to see her. All the tickets have sold out to her concert. Concert organizers tell us that the concert tickets sold out within the first 30 minutes that they went on sale, which is just incredible. She's also playing for four nights in a row here in Tokyo, which is a first for any foreign female artist in Tokyo Dome. That is just how in demand she is. Of course, we also have to remember that the last time Taylor Swift was playing in Tokyo was back in 2018, nearly six years ago for her Reputation Tour. So of course, fans are Swift deprived. They wanna see her. We actually spoke to a super fan earlier today who had a very different way of celebrating Taylor Swift. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
