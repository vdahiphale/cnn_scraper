Dozens of people have been killed in a crowd surge during a Ramadan charity event in the capital Sanaa. Some officials have described what happened as a stampede.It all took place at this school where local merchants were giving out cash donations to mark the coming end to the holy month of Ramadan. There are different accounts of what triggered the crash, which left at least 78 dead, dozens more so badly hurt. Authorities are now ordered an investigation. And the two businessmen who organized the event had been arrested. Naseh Shaker joins us now from Yemen's capital in Sanaa. Sir, thank you for taking the time to bring us up to date with everything that happened. We understand this was a distribution event for financial help. You were there at the scene a short time ago. Can you describe what you saw? NASEH SHAKER, JOURNALIST (on camera): Well, actually, I was there nearly four hours ago. The location was surrounded by security forces and relative authorities are conducting investigation to what's happened. -- from the spokesperson of the incident inside (PH) that actually said that 78 people were dead. 77 of them arrived at the nearby hospital. That is Al-Thawra hospital, which is nearly 20 meters away from the school where people where people gathered to get a cash donation nearly $10.00. So, the investigation was underway, and 77 others were injured. The health authorities said 30 of them are in critical condition while the rest were already discharged (PH) from the hospital because their injuries were minors. So, this is a tragic event. This is a tragedy. And I think this is because the parties are not ready to offer concessions that work and stop and all restrictions and blockading them and can be lifted. Because it's hard. This is a disaster to find people ready to sacrifice their lives for just $10.00 because I'm sure that a lot of people, many of those died are public servants because employees will not pay since 2016. So,people are very hungry. People are very poor. And we have just finished celebrating the exchange of prisoners. Nearly 900 people were released last week, and happiness were across the country. But this strategy is going to finish or execute that happiness. Mourning is now in Sanaa Yemen, because this is a tragic.",

Well, in Sudan, a second ceasefire in as many days has collapsed within hours, leaving residents in the capital hunkering down, afraid to leave their homes as clashes between rival military factions were reported late into Wednesday night. Many have been left for days now without electricity or running water, many are without food as well. The World Health Organization says nearly 300 people have been killed since the fighting broke out Saturday. Sudan's army says the leader of the rival force has lost control of its troops, saying they're acting like criminal gangs attacking and looting homes and businesses. Thousands and are fleeing the Capitol heading for safer ground at different parts of the country, while the United Nations is demanding an end of attacks on civilians, as well as aid workers.

And they know they were clear, much more clear. But now I think, based on Taliban's experience of negotiating with the Americans before, during their talks in Doha, they know that they can get anything they ask.

      "sentences": "Absolutely, John. But let me just tell our viewers that, according to the United Nations, India and China together will account for more than a third of the estimated global population in the months to come. Staggering facts there.But contrary to public belief, John, it's also important for our viewers to know that the population growth, both in China, as well as an India, has been on the decline. But here's where the contrast, and a stark contrast, lies. You have the labor force in China shrinking when compared to India that has more than 60 percent of its population under the age of 30. And we spoke to some of the young Indians here in Delhi and in neighboring states about their aspirations and their dreams, while India will very soon be getting that undesirable global title of being the most populous country in the world. Here's a report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUD (voice-over): In a village outside New Delhi, a doting mother attends to her little girl. Mahi (ph) is just two days old. Her cries mark a symbolic moment. India is expected to surpass China as the world's most populous country. Mahi's (ph) father, Vizpaul Singh (ph), and mother Lakshmi are school dropouts. The family's had little income and many children to feed. Singh, a farmer, started working with his father in their fields at a young age. He says he'll do whatever it takes to help Mahi (ph) achieve her dreams, he said. \"Even if I have to sell my field to educate her, I will. One of the biggest challenges she'll have to face is the country's growing population. There's stiff competition,\" Singh tells me. India's birth rate has slowed, but the country is still quickly adding to its 1.4 billion-strong population.",

Do it wrong, and this is going to be extremely worrying for the Indian economy and India's youngsters.SUD (voice-over): Twenty-eight-year-old Sunil Kumar (ph) has a postgraduate degree but doesn't hold a steady job. For years now, he's been sweeping the floors of a school in his village in Haryana state and doubling up as a tutor for young students. Despite his education, Kumar (ph) barely makes enough to support his ailing father and the rest of his family. Sunil (ph) says it angers him that he doesn't have a steady job, despite his educational qualifications. Across India, the most highly-sought-after jobs are more competitive than ever before. Pursuing their dreams, tens of thousands of students from small towns move to big cities to be coached for the coveted civil services exam. Some, like Serra Nutaval (ph) have been trying to crack the exam for four years now. Nutaval (ph) says his younger brother is sponsoring his education. \"They could have bought three to four cars with the money they've spent on me,\" he says.
