They said her best moments are when she is drilling down on somebody, so we've lost that, and it takes a big thing off the table for us.So now as the Vice President is hunkering down in Pittsburgh and spending the next stretch of days really doing debate prep ahead of next Tuesday night's debate against Donald Trump, I'm told by the source that a big mission for the Kamala Harris team is going to be finding ways to remedy for that and showing that prosecutorial side of her. Often allies of the Vice President will point to moments from committee hearings when she was senator, when she was grilling, for example, Brett Kavanaugh or Bill Barr as being exemplifying sort of her biggest political strength and her messaging strength, and this is the side of her that they had very much hoped would come out next week on the debate stage, that she would be able to respond to and question and even interrupt Donald Trump in real time. They also hope that the mics being on would be able to show Donald Trump as more unhinged. This is what the Kamala Harris campaign believes, so they are hoping that the fact that the mics are going to be muted is not going to make Donald Trump seem more disciplined than they think he is.

The country's foreign ministry announced Thursday that no more Chinese children would be sent abroad for adoption. The only exceptions will be those who already have a family connection.For decades, overseas parents have adopted thousands of Chinese children, many of whom were abandoned under the country's draconian one-child policy. The move comes as China looks to reverse the country's population decline. China and the United States are facing off in an economic battle over Africa. This week, Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted a summit in Beijing with delegates from more than 50 African countries. Xi vowed to elevate ties with them to levels of China's most trusted diplomatic allies. He also promised more than $50 billion in financial support, the creation of one million jobs, and tens of millions of dollars in food and military aid. Now, other powers, like the U.S., are ramping up their efforts to boost ties with African countries and secure critical resources. Gilles Yabi is founder of the West Africa Citizen Thick Tank and a non-resident scholar at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and he joins us live from Dakar, Senegal. Thank you so much for being here with us. Good to see you again. So, take us through what's behind this more aggressive Africa strategy by China.",

      "sentences": "Well, good morning. Pleasure to be with you again. I think that for African countries, for the leaders and for the population as well, the most important thing is to have a condition for more economic progress, more stability, more security, a lot of structural challenges that African countries face, and the idea, of course, of a global competition between the U.S. and China. But it is clear that, I think, for Africans, the primary concern is not the competition between global powers. It's actually not to pay a heavy price for this competition, as it was the case in the past during the Cold War.",

You know, some years ago, I remember John Bolton, who was a National Security Advisor to the U.S., with a full speech which was supposed to be about U.S. relation with Africa, and actually it turned out to be a full speech about the aggressive policies of China and Russia in Africa.And I think that, again, the point for African countries is not to be just seen as a puppet or object of competition between global powers and over middle powers as well. The primary concern, again, for the African countries now is to be able also to offer a better living condition for the people, and that means probably to have balanced relationship with all important players in the world, including China, who is the number two in the world, and who has a lot of relation with the U.S., with Europe. China is the trading partner for, I think, more than two-third of the countries in the world. So I don't really see why African countries should not also have -- you know, want to have good relationship with China, which doesn't mean that they have to renounce their relationship with the U.S. or the West.",

It is very important for, I think, citizens in Western countries to be aware that we are talking about basic infrastructure, we are talking about food, we are talking about industrialization, so that the youth in the most populated, well, the most growing continents in terms of people, Africa, we need jobs. And that's one of the reasons why relationship with China is so important, because there are some offers in terms of infrastructure development that can be quite appropriate for African countries.And again, I think African countries are aware that they don't need to go fully into the hands of China, because they are a lot of concern also about the condition for this cooperation. But it is the primary, again, responsibility for the African countries to develop the capacity to negotiate with the U.S., with Europe, and with China, and that is, of course, the major challenge.",

But I think that in this global world, with a lot of change happening, geopolitical changes, it is very important to respect the need for African countries, again, not to pay the heavy price that the continent has paid in the past for competition, for resources, and for influence on the African soil.
