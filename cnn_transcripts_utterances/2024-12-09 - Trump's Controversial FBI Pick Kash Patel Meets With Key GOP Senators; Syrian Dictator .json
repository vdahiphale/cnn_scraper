And happening right now, Kash Patel, President-elect Trump's controversial pick to lead the FBI, is on Capitol Hill meeting with the Republican senators whose support he needs to get the job. This is new video right here just into CNN. Among those senators, Texas Senator John Cornyn, he'll be meeting with Patel just about now. And he recently told \"Politico\" that Patel, quote, will be confirmed as the next FBI director. Manu Raju joins us now. So Manu, Kash Patel was once an attorney in the Obama-era Justice Department, but it's his closeness to President-elect Trump that has him on the threshold of running the FBI. Tell us more.",

This is Kash Patel's first time on Capitol Hill meeting with senators. We know that he's meeting with Senator Cornyn.

He's been a prosecutor. He's been a public defender. So he really brings an outside-in approach to reforming the FBI. And it's important to point out, Pamela, that the public really voted for President Trump's reform agenda. They're tired of seeing the politics that's at the FBI level, that's at the DOJ, where I think Pam Bondi is going to do a great job of cleaning up that agency, that we need a breath of fresh air. That's what I think Kash Patel is going to bring. And you notice, as Manu set up in the introduction, Republicans are very bullish about Kash Patel. And they're very optimistic about him getting through this process.",

And I will tell you, Pamela, I have even heard from folks inside the building. So, yes, FBI, the call is coming from inside the building. See, there are so many good FBI agents that are working at the FBI, so many people who are dedicated about keeping the American public safe, and they're sick and tired of what they have seen at the upper ranks of the FBI, of this politics influencing decisions. American -- the American public's tired of that. They want that out. They want a clean slate. They want people to focus on keeping American safe, including as we talk about the growing threat from China, as we talk about the growing threat, obviously, with Russians, we talk about a number of different foreign actors, and especially as we talk about these transnational gangs, such as TDA, that have taken over way too many communities in the United States.",
