With winter fast approaching, it appears Russia is trying to freeze Ukrainians into giving up. Moscow launching renewed attacks on Ukraine's energy and other critical infrastructure. Residents of Kyiv are being urged to conserve electricity and water. After two more facilities there were hit on Tuesday. Three people were killed President Zelenskyy says that nearly a third of the country's power stations have been destroyed in just over a week. More than 1100 towns across Ukraine are reportedly as I speak in the dark, no electricity. Meantime Kyiv's Mayor says the body of a fifth victim has been found under the rubble of a residential building hit Monday, in a so called Kamikaze drone strike both Russia and Iran denying claims that Iran has been supplying those weapons. And on the ground in Russia, at least 14 people are dead, including three children after a Russian fighter jet crashed into a residential building in the Port City of Yeysk, on Monday. Russian state media and authority said the jet was doing a training flight when one of the engines caught on fire during takeoff. Let's bring in Nic Robertson, who's joining us live now. He's following all these developments from Kyiv. So Nic, let's just talk about energy. You've got Russia here carrying out the sustained sort of coordinated attacks re designed to ensure that Ukrainians have as difficult of a winter as possible walk us through that.",

And they're switching it now to the cities to what Russia thinks is a pressure point on the Ukrainian population. That is, you know, if they deny them, they denied them electricity, deny them water, they'll somehow give into Russia's demands and claims. So in the City of Kyiv right now, two power plants were struck this morning by missiles and over there behind me what's known as the Left Bank inside of the city here, that area now has limited supplies of electricity and some parts of it and limited supplies of water or low pressure water, and that's being replicated elsewhere in the country. In the East, in the West, and further South, there were more strikes on power plants. So this attrition seems to be designed to increasingly deplete Ukraine's energy producing electricity producing capability. However, what the Ukrainians are saying is that within about 48 hours, they're getting those areas that have been hit those power plants have been hit back up online, but clearly over time, it's going to put pressure on them to do it, because the spare parts that will be required to, to repair what's been damaged, those will be depleted, as well. And the timing of these attacks just before winter, very, very clearly creates the impression that Putin is using the change in seasons and the cold weather coming to inflict this severity on the Ukrainian population.",

So they need to sort of coordinate with the competition authorities in the EU to try to make this work. She wants solidarity, essentially, gas sharing to become mandatory between countries in case of an emergency, even when they don't already have bilateral agreements in place to share energy with each other, and what also emerge from this is that clearly the current energy market was designed for an era when both supply and prices were stable, that is no longer the case. So they're also trying to redesign the energy market, they want to come up with a new benchmark to replace the current Dutch benchmark in the EU. And until that happens, they also want to come up with some way of limiting prices and volatility on the market. Gas prices have come down a lot, but they're still historically very high, not much more in the way of detail about how they're going to do that. But meanwhile, European storage facilities for gas are actually filled more than 92 percent, which is ahead of schedule.

Many are fleeing to Iraq, where some are joining armedopposition groups to support protesters inside Iran. CNN's Nima Elbagir reports from Northern Iraq. I want to warn you though some of the video in this report is disturbing to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In a remote area in Northern Iraq's Kurdish region, an all-female fighting unit belonging to the armed Kurdish Iranian opposition party pack continues to train. These women have been pulled back from the front line. For the last three weeks the area they patrolled in the Northeast of Iraq has been hit by shells sent from across the border by Iran. This unit is part of a larger fighting force for every single one of these women this war is personal. Rayzan (ph) not her real name crossed the border from Iran with the help of smugglers just over a week ago. The city of - which she calls home, is in Iran's Kurdish majority western region. And in recent weeks has been likened to a war zone according to its residents as protests have erupted here and across Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian. Rayzan just a teenager joined these protests. We were treating casualties but we were also like most people participating in the revolution in the uprising. Everyone who suffered from the oppression of the Iranian regime came down to the streets and market and defied the government. I was also participating and I had no fear of death. Rayzan says that while she was dragged by her uncovered hair, she passed prone lifeless bodies. And even after she left she says she's continued to receive information about people she knows who have died. Like this man Yahya Rahimi (ph), a newly married 27 year old, murdered by Iranian regime forces for sounding his horn in solidarity with protesters. ELBAGIR (on camera): What is happening with your family? ELBAGIR (voice over): My family told them that no matter how many members of my family they arrest, and for as long as they oppress my people, I will not surrender to the invading Iranian government. We are ready to die. When Kurdish Iranian Mahsa Amini died in police custody, her name became a symbol of the oppression of women across Iran. But Mahsa is not her true name. Her Kurdish name is Zhina name Iranian authorities barred her family like many other ethnic minority groups from using. The regime only legally registered Persian names. Yet in her last recorded moments, Zhina resorted to begging her captors in her Kurdish mother tongue and treaties which were ignored re-enforcing the fears of Iran's Kurdish minority. Hundreds of Iranian Kurdish families have crossed the border to Iraq seeking refuge from the most recent regime crackdown. But even here, they're not safe. This family fears the long arm of the Iranian regime after what they saw inside Iran.",

This is a protest that was cooled by several unions to protest against the cost of living, rising inflation in France, they said make it impossible for them to earn the living that they need to live. As you can see, the police have come out in fairly strong numbers to make sure that it remains calm. But it is the impressive number of people on the streets that we've seen today. I think that is the most interesting. There was a strike called as well, by transport union, mostly but essentially transports kept going much more than they would have liked. It is this though the large number of people on the street for the first time Zain in a couple of years, not only because the yellow vest protests had run out of steam in 2019 ahead of COVID, then there was COVID, then the war that has added this pressure to energy prices.

Not only because this kind of protest and the strikes we've seen it refineries and the queues and the petrol stations have emboldened the opposition and meant that he's going to have to pass his 2023 budget, through a mechanism essentially that allows him to avoid a parliamentary vote, adding to the sense of anger and political crisis. It's also that one of his major reforms have been pensions reform, one of the most divisive you've ever suggested.

And I realized I need to translate not just only the words, but the core cultural subtleties, and somehow tell the story about what's really happening. So I realized I have to be there as a bridge just at the bridge the voices inside Iran, I need to be the Echo, I need to hold this voice so that it doesn't just go away somehow.",

This is very, very important. And this is what the ayatollahs pretend that with their departure, nobody's capable. Nobody's capable to govern the country and the foreign forces; the enemy is going to just facilitate this breakup, which is absolutely not true. Because, first of all, there's so many capable people in Iran, in prisons inside Iran, this revolution that can - that is very much capable of creating a democratic, Iran. And Iranians would never allow anybody to break up their beloved country. And who is worse than this Ayatollah, as these are much worse than any foreign forces anywhere they have touch has been destroyed, the environment is destroyed.

Of course, at one point, they are going to bring something as a reformer; they're going to give up some of this stuff. But I don't think it would be accepted by this generation. This leadership needs to be from inside Iran, this is very, this is a very complex thing because us outside Iran, we are, we can only echo what is happening inside Iran, we cannot call them to do anything because we are not there. And we are also seen as people that are not there. They are victorious, because now they have given the Islamic Republic a handicap, and Islamic Republic will not walk again properly, it's done. It's like they took a leg of the Islamic Republic, it cannot run it cannot kill. It cannot be the Islamic Republic it used to be, so every day they are victorious.
