We begin in Niger, where despite growing pressure fromneighboring countries and from around the world, leaders of the coup show no signs of backing down. In fact, just nine days after toppling Niger's elected leader, the junta is instead digging in its heels. Already in the past 24 hours, they've walked back years of diplomacy, dismissing Niger's ambassadors to several countries, including the U.S. and France, revoking military pacts with France and blocking French media outlets. All of this with a deadline looming. The West African bloc, ECOWAS, on Sunday giving the junta one week, one week to release and reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum, ECOWAS saying it would not rule out the use of force if those demands are not met. But following a meeting between the ECOWAS delegation and junta representatives on Thursday, the junta warned military intervention would be met with retaliation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMADOU ABDRAMANE (through translator):  ECOWAS being impersonal, any aggression or attempted aggression against the state of Niger will be met with an immediate and unannounced response by Niger's defense and security forces.

It shows you that this coup certainly hasn't settled into a clear indication that the coup leaders are, if not 100 percent in charge, have the full support of the entire military and are able to necessarily withstand the intense pressure from ECOWAS, from France, from the U.S. and others. What you've had, as you said, is the coup leaders in particular striking out at the French government, saying they are going to remove themselves from all those defense pacts, also throwing out the ambassador and kicking out the French media, state-funded French media in the country. For their part, though, the French are saying, well, this is null and void because this is a unilateral decision coming from those who aren't the democratically elected head of Niger. So, it is a volatile situation. I think you have to watch very carefully what the Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu does in the coming hours as the leader of ECOWAS at the moment. What he says and what the Nigerian military do in particular is very critical, and that clock is ticking towards that initial deadline set by the regional bloc for when they said they may start contemplating, sending the troops and to take over by force.

Healso said obliquely that they don't want to see any major change that we have seen in Niger, but certainly not coming out fully throated, condemning the coup leaders. I think one thing we haven't spoken about is the U.S. And that's a critical component here. The U.S. has a large force component in the capital and Agadez. And more importantly, it's not something the coup leaders are speaking about much. They've railed against France. They've made sure to have protesters out there that appear to be orchestrated by the regime or their supporters to go against French colonialism and the perceived misdeeds and current misdeeds that the population see, but very little about the U.S. And it's intriguing that a Pentagon spokesman said yesterday that the U.S. base is still operational on some level and they're still working with the Nigerian army. I think that raises two questions to me. One, is the Nigerian security forces completely behind the coup leaders? And two, where are they going with this when it comes to the U.S. involvement? Because if they consolidate their power, that will end U.S. involvement because of U.S. law. In the meantime, the diplomats who were recently associated with Niger are speaking out saying that this could be a disaster. Take a listen.

These social media images appear to show a crippled vessel listing heavily in the Black Sea. And, take a look at this. This footage allegedly captures the approaching drone. A Ukrainian source says that Kyiv is responsible. The port is just across the water from Russian-occupied Crimea, where Moscow says it thwarted a separate overnight attack. The Novorossiysk drone strike comes just days after the Ukrainian president warned the war will gradually return to Russia.

The former New Jersey governor also visited Bucha, once occupied town outside of the capital where Russian forces are accused of war crimes. Christie has defended America's support for Ukraine. And his unannounced trip underscores sharp divisions not only within the Republican Party over Washington's support for Ukraine, but possibly within the broader U.S. population as well. A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows that 55 percent of Americans don't think Congress should authorize additional funding for Kyiv. They think that America's actually already done its part, while 45 percent say that it should. U.S. and European officials are concerned that American politics could play a big role in the trajectory of Vladimir Putin's war. Sources tell CNN the Russian leader is taking the 2024 presidential election into account. And he's hoping that a Joe Biden loss would cause Washington to curb its support for Kyiv and improve Russia's negotiating position. But sources say there's no explicit evidence to back this up. CNN's Kylie Atwood joins us live now from Washington. So, Kylie, it does beg the question, what happens to lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine if Donald Trump wins next year? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I think, that is the ultimate question, right, because the former president, who is the leading contender on the Republican side in this primary that we're seeing play out right now for the presidential election. Trump hasn't committed to supporting Ukraine in this war specifically. He's even said that, you know, he could resolve the war in 24 hours if he were in office. Of course, that comment has drawn quite a bit of criticism. But our reporting here is that U.S. officials, European officials, are quite concerned that President Putin is watching those comments closely and essentially that it's incentivizing him to draw out his approach to the war, staying in the war in Ukraine past the 2024 elections, sort of banking on the possibility that, if President Biden loses to Trump or one of the other Republicans, that U.S. support for Ukraine would decrease and, therefore, that would benefit Putin. Now, as you said earlier, it's not like there is a concrete intelligence assessment of Putin's mindset here. This is just what U.S. officials are thinking about right now. And when you talk to them about this, what they say is that it makes it even more important for the U.S. to continue to provide support to Ukraine now and also long-term support to Ukraine, so that even if there is a changeover and maybe in the long term, you know, some U.S. support does decrease, that the Ukrainians still have what they need on the battlefield.",

That's when the judge is expected to set a trial date. The hearing will be just five days after the first Republican primary debate. No word yet if Mr. Trump will participate in that forum. CNN's Jessica Schneider is following that story for us from Washington. So, Jessica, I mean, just the fact that you have a hearing at the end of August, five days after a U.S. presidential debate, how does that change the dynamics?

      "sentences": "Yeah, Zain, so really remarkable charges here brought against two U.S. Navy sailors. We shouldnote in separate cases but the cases against them seem very similar. So, in one of the cases, a U.S. Navy sailor named Jinchao Wei, he was arrested after arriving for work at the Naval Base San Diego where he was operating essentially as an engineer on the USS Essex, which is a Navy ship. And he was also responsible for repairing other navy ships at that base. And what prosecutors are saying is that he engaged in the agent handler relationship with a Chinese intelligence officer beginning in February of 2022 and began providing him with photos and videos of these navy ships as well as dozens of technical and military manuals relating to the layout of these ships as well as the weapon systems that these ships have on board. And in return, he allegedly received thousands of dollars from this intelligence officer. Now, notably, he was apparently applying for U.S. citizenship at the time that he was working with this Chinese intelligence officer and that officer actually congratulated him on obtaining that citizenship according to the indictment back in May of 2022. Then you have the separate U.S. Navy sailor who has been arrested and indicted on very similar charges accused of providing a Chinese intelligence officer with information about U.S. training exercises in the Indo-Pacific as well as information, photos, data about our U.S. radar system that is stationed on a U.S. military base in Okinawa, Japan. And that U.S. Navy Sailor, he was essentially responsible for managing electronics and dealing with, you know, electrical issues on various military facilities around the world. So, he had access through his security clearance to a lot of this information that the Chinese military frankly would find pretty valuable according to prosecutors. And that is really the issue they sought to drive home in their press conference yesterday, is that this really underscores just how aggressive China is getting with regard to targeting U.S. service members and trying to get sensitive military secrets. But it's also a big problem, Zain, for the U.S. military. This is the third time, if you take those cases together, this year, that the U.S. military has seen service members improperly release classified and sensitive intelligence. Of course, we saw earlier this year when a U.S. service member stationed at the Air National Guard in Massachusetts posted classified intelligence online. So, something really that the U.S. military is grappling with very seriously, Zain.",

We have to remember that Lebanon is a country that really hasn't seen accountability for decades. In 1975, you had a civil war. The current leaders of the country rose to power during that civil war. They gave themselves an amnesty at the end of it. Since 2004, 2005, you've had dozens of assassination attempts on senior politicians, security figures, and there's never been a shred of accountability for any of that. A lot of people hoped that the August 2020 port explosion would mark a shift, but unfortunately, it hasn't. And the reason is that though Lebanon is a democracy and has a parliament and has elections, the institutions don't really rule the country. You have a group of very small men, a very small group of men who, in fact, make informal decisions between themselves. And that's how politics is done in Lebanon. And since the explosion took place, there's been a concerted effort to prevent accountability from taking place. There were charges filed against some of the most senior people in the land, top security chiefs, the senior aides to top -- to politicians. Even the former Prime Minister, none of them went in for questioning. They simply ignored the summons. And today we're in a place where three years later, there is no justice.

There have been attempts to get the U.N. Human Rights Council to establish such an investigation that hasn't worked so far. Internally, there's also attempts to sort of amend laws in the Lebanese parliament that could open the door to the investigation moving forward, but parliament is largely controlled by the same actors who have locked the probe for two years. In the meanwhile, Lebanese are sort of left with very few good options. Some people try to ignore it. Anger has turned to apathy. Other people have tried to fight on the streets or via other means, and so far, don't have much to show for it. Many people increasingly are just leaving and becoming part of the massive Lebanese diaspora who maybe visit in summer or in winter, you know, come back to their country to meet their loved ones. But other than that, really try to forget about this place. And that's unfortunately increasingly what we're seeing. Many put hopes on future political change. They say that the people are more aware of those who have harmed them now than ever before. But that's sort of a long-term process that you really sort of have to have a lot of patience for. And many people have lost their patience.",

He's been in Portugal this week for World Youth Day. This hour, he's expected to take part in the Stations of the Cross with young people. All right, gunshots will ring out again at a Florida high school five years after a massacre there. It's a reenactment at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School where 17 people were killed in a school shooting. The re- enactment is part of a civil lawsuit filed against a former sheriff's deputy who stayed outside during the shooting. He was found not guilty of criminal charges back in June and he said he couldn't tell where the shots were coming from, but victims' families and the survivor say they don't buy that. CNN's Carlos Suarez is in Parkland, Florida, with the details. Carlos, what more can you tell us?",

The reenactment, as you mentioned, is being supported by several of the family members of the victims as well as the survivors who say that the reenactment is going to prove, according to them, that there's no way that this School Resource Officer Scott Peterson did not know where the gunfire was coming from the day of that shooting. As you noted coming out to me, Peterson was found not guilty of criminal charges back in June in connection with his inaction the day of the shooting. Now, his attorneys were able to successfully argue during his criminal case that Peterson took cover outside of the 1200 building where this shooting happened for more than 40 minutes because he did not know where the gunfire was coming from and he felt that there was more than one gunman at the school. Now, earlier in the day, nine members of Congress, members from the Republican and the Democratic Party were out here and they were able to tour the 1200 building alongside some of the family members. Some of these family members were up in Washington, D.C. just last week lobbying some of these very same lawmakers trying to get support for a piece of legislation that would enhance school safety across the United States, as well as secure additional funding for school resource officers as well as an increase in funding for mental health services. From here, the members of Congress met with some of the family members at a hotel, not too far from where the school is located, where they're having this discussion about coming together and trying to pass some of these school reforms. It is our understanding that after that meeting is done, some of the family members, as well as the members of Congress, are going to share what it was like to be inside of the 1200 building where all of this happened back in 2018. Again, it does appear that this reenactment is underway. We're told that at least 140 rounds of live ammunition are being fired inside of this building. And we're told that this reenactment is being recorded on video, as well as audio. And all of this is in connection with a civil case against Scott Peterson and a number of other defendants in connection with what happened here in 2018.",

Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expectedto decide whether to approve a new medication for new mothers after childbirth. A daily pill taken over the course of two weeks, if approved, this would be the first approved medication in the U.S. specifically for postpartum depression administered as a daily pill. CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard joins us live with more. So, we're still waiting for FDA approval, for that to be announced, but just walk us through how this drug is different from other antidepressants that are already out there.",

      "sentences": "It's interesting, Zain, because what sets this drug, Zuranolone, apart? It appears to work quickly, muchfaster than some of the other commonly used antidepressant drugs. And there was one clinical trial that recently found among 196 women, 57 percent of those who took Zuranolone experienced huge improvements in their depressive symptoms, improvements of 50 percent or more. And that was compared with only 38 percent of women in the trial who did not take the drug. They took a placebo. But among those women who did take Zuranolone, some of them said that they experienced those huge improvements in depressive symptoms within just three days, which is much faster than some other commonly used antidepressants. And another thing, Zain, that sets this drug apart. It is specifically for postpartum depression because it's similar to a metabolite of the hormone progesterone, which we do know drops in levels after a woman gives birth. So that's how this drug works. But it will be interesting to see how the FDA decides on this drug today. Will the FDA approve it or not, here in the U.S., that's what we're waiting on, Zain, in moments to come.",
