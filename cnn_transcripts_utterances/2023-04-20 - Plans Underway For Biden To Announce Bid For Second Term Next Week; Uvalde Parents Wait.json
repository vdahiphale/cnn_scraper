What they weren't clear on was when that would actually happen.And it seems, like now, we have some sense of a timeline that to some degree, it has taken a lot longer than people expected. The President is planning and may go forward, with a decision, to launch his reelection campaign, as soon as Tuesday of next week. Now, that date is important because it was -- it will be the four-year anniversary, of the day he launched his 2020 campaign, a campaign that he framed, as the Battle of the soul -- for the Soul of the Nation, a campaign where he eventually defeated then-President Donald Trump, somebody who may be his general election opponent, again, in 2024. Now, advisers say this will be a video announcement, and a fundraising appeal. It will not be some grand, staged announcement. And they make clear that the course for 2023 will be a building process. Behind-the-scenes, there have been intensive efforts, underway, to build the infrastructure, of the campaign, to work through personnel, to work through the location, the campaign headquarters, in Wilmington, Delaware. But they also acknowledged there's significant work to do, going forward. 2023 will be very much about testing things, whether it's messages, data, digital, trying to get everything set, for what they expect to be a very intense, very complicated battle, in 2024. Now, they acknowledge the President is very obviously the oldest president, in American history. Would be 86, if he wins a second term by the time he would be done in office. But they make clear, while there's an age issue there is also what comes with that, experience. Experience that they believe led to the most significant legislative accomplishments, in decades. In his first two years, accomplishments he will spend much of this year, selling, talking about making clear will have very real tangible effects, for the very people, he wants to vote for him, in 2024. Now, they caution, no final decision has been made yet about the exact date. But it very much looks like they're leaning in that direction, Pamela.",

So, I don't think anyone is shocked at that. But the other thing is, you mentioned that poll, about Biden. I haven't actually seen another poll saying, \"And here's the other person everybody wants.\" And I think that's always going to be a problem, for the party. If there's not some other names that they're coalescing around, well, then, of course, why wouldn't he run? Whereas, at least, on the Republican side, we're watching DeSantis' fortunes, his fortunes rise and fall. We're watching what's going on with Trump. There's sort of a lot of people, in the mix, and you can have that dialog. That's not really happening, on the Democratic side.

Because, if we want to win a majority of voters, if we want to finally win the popular vote, in 2024, we've got to talk about sensitive issues, which is one of the reasons I've been so vocal, on women's issues. I want to hear our Republican candidates talk about what they're going to do, to support women, and families, and those kinds of issues, because I come from a very purple district, a swing district, a bellwether district.

And now, I think he's under-hyped. Like, the press gets so caught up in this daily cycle that they make these straight-line predictions, into the future. So, he has a bad week, and all the sudden, they say \"He has no chance of getting a nomination.\" Three weeks ago, there was all this talk about how he could get -- he was locked to get the nomination, or at least two months ago. I do think, speaking of 2016? Look, 2016, at the end of the day, we, this country nominated the two candidates, who were so unbelievably unpopular, that they were the only candidates, who had a chance to lose to the other one. And I think we really -- like Hillary Clinton was the second most popular politician, in America, Donald Trump was the most unpopular. It's very possible we'll have a very similar situation, in 2024, where we have two people that the vast majority of Americans do not want to see, reelected, to the White House, competing against each other, which I think is going to open up all sorts of weird possibilities, about, third parties, from the No Labels crowd, and all the rest. And it creates an opportunity for Republicans to say, \"Look, Trump can't win the -- Trump can win the nomination, but he can't win the presidency. I can.\" I don't know why DeSantis isn't positioning himself that way. Instead, he seems to be positioning himself as Ted Cruz 2.0.",

Now, the weapon used here, was purchased legally, about a week before, the AR-15 purchase, about a week before this shooting actually happened. And we reached out to the family attorney, for comment, on this latest reporting. And we haven't heard back. But they have said in the past that they are testing -- the family is testing the shooter, for CTE. Those symptoms could include loss of impulse control, sometimes, suicidal thoughts, though it's not limited just to CTE. The family also has said that this is a shooter that had multiple concussions, in the past, going back to as early as middle school. So, all of these things are part of the investigation, on multiple fronts, to get to the answer of a simple question that we ask every time, we see, one of these types of mass shootings unfold. Why?

When Dylann Roof went to go buy a gun, and murder nine Black church members, at Mother Emanuel, he was 21-years-old, when he bought the firearm, and carried it out. But there are things that I believe that we can do that Republicans and Democrats can agree on. My kids and I, two weeks ago, we're a mile down the road, from a mass shooting, where six people were shot. And the first thing -- I think the Police were nearby, all six people survived. And no one died. But the first thing, out of my kid's mouths, was \"Hey, Mommy, why isn't there some sort of an AMBER Alert system, to tell us we're near a mass shooting, and maybe not leave the house, maybe not walk out,\" because we didn't know what's going on. And we were in the car, at the immediate aftermath, blocked from the intersection, where it happened. And we saw the immediate aftermath. All the Police vehicles, the EMS, everybody rushing to the scene, had no idea what was going on. But why can't we have some of those commonsense things?

They realized that resentment, and anger, and feeding people what they want to hear, rather than perhaps what credible journalism would lead, one to believe, they should be aware of that that was the business model that worked. And the Dominion case proves that because Murdoch himself acknowledged that \"We didn't want to go down a path of saying that these election lies were all BS. We didn't want to go down that path because our viewers were turning away from us, and turning to even Trumpier outlets, like Newsmax, or OAN.\" So, this isn't about journalism, and telling people what -- look, we're all flawed. It's, we make mistakes. We have blind spots. But the general idea is to try and present a fair and reasonable assessment as best we can determine it, of what the story is, with all of its texture. And that means that if there's a narrative that appeals to someone, at CNN, but there are pertinent facts that don't align with that narrative? That has to be included too. That critique is legitimate. But when the answer to that is this nonsense, this kind of Trump propaganda stuff, the cult of Trump? Look what's happened to the Republican Party. When you ask, what would be different? Look what's happened. The Mitt Romneys of the world, the John McCain, even when he was with us, they'd been marginalized. CPAC used to be a place, where thoughtful conservatives, like Jonah Goldberg would show up, to commiserate, and to make their points.

The problem is you're asking a lot of people to vote on something that may not pass, and then they're out there, putting their necks out for a package that is going to make it much easier, for people, to run against them on. And so, it's a difficult thing, for McCarthy to do, with only four votes to spare. I see these arguments, about the debt ceiling thing, very much like the arguments about like the judicial filibuster, right? It's like Democrats do it. And then Republicans say \"That's outrageous that you're doing that.\" And then, the parties in power switch. And then, Republicans do it.
