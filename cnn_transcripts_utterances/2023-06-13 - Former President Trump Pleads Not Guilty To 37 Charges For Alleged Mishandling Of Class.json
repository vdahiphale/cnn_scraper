Tonight, he held a campaign fundraiser and addressed his cheering supporters with a litany of lies against his perceived enemies. We begin the coverage this hour with CNN's Evan Perez, our senior justice correspondent, he's here with me in Miami, and our correspondent Kristen Holmes, who's in Bedminster, covering the former president. Tonight, I want to start with Evan because he was indicted when Trump was arraigned today. What did you see, of course, not just what happened in that courtroom, but also what we saw after, as he was making that stop at a mass restaurant near Miami?",

He was sitting there while he was waiting for the judge to appear. He was sitting there with his arms folded, twiddling his thumbs a few times, talking to his attorney, not the performer that we are used to seeing. And certainly when he showed up in Little Havana, just west of here, at Versailles Restaurant, that is where you saw the energy of him being around his adoring crowd, the clergy members praying for him and so on.Look, the former president, I think you can't help but like when you get into a moment like this, you're sitting at that table that says, the defendant, the defense, it is hard for you to just dismiss that. As much as the former president is trying to do that, it is very hard to just dismiss that. It is a serious moment, again, a historic thing you just talked about.

The idea the you can't discuss the case with witnesses, which is pretty much everybody around him.The question that arises, and the reason why the lawyers, I think, would raise so many concerns, is that they know they have a client who is not disciplined. And so you want to make sure you protect him, and you do have to raise those objections in court because you want to make sure that those restrictions aren't so tight that the former president maybe accidentally breaks those rules.",

The mood of his team is very different tonight than it was after that Manhattan arraignment. And I asked them why that was. They seemed a lot lighter. They told me that day that it was one of the most emotional days of their lives. I have heard that from several advisers of various forms about. Tonight, they seemed lighter, seemed easier. They were talking to reporters. They're walking around. And they said that, essentially, now they have the playbook down and that they believe this is going to happen again, that he will be indicted again, and they are going to use the same playbook over and over again. And one other note, and I'm jamming all of this in, but it's important to note that not only was Walt Nauta on the plane back, but so was Walt Nauta's attorney. And that is something that we just learned. All the attorneys were on the plane after this.

And you don't want that if you're a lawyer that's concerned about your reputation. And lawyers in Florida have to come back to this courthouse and practice again in front of these judges. And if they have a client who wants them to go out and say things publicly that they don't agree with or attack the prosecutors, like he's doing himself, you don't want to be anywhere near that if you're a defense attorney. And then there are the other issues, which this case would take a lot of work. Whoever takes this case is going to have to basically drop their practice for a significant period of time. And it's not just going to be one lawyer. So, it's going to be an undertaking because if the president is going to mount a defense, it's going to be a complicated one, dealing with attorney-client privilege issues and national security classified information issues. It's going to be a lot of briefing, a lot of writing, a lot of appeals. So, I think that a lot of that is contributing to the fact that he is not been able to get much support here locally so far.",

That's utterly impossible. The goal is to find 12 people who you believe can put aside whatever their personal or political views are and judge the case on the evidence alone. So, jurors will be asked explicitly that. Can you put aside whatever you believe and just base your decision solely on the facts and the evidence in this case?

I personally would put together the best team of lawyers possible and then find a Florida lawyer who is familiar with the demographics, who's going to help with jury selection, who's respected by the court if possible, and go from there.

As I've said before, I represented a socialist candidate for president in 2020, and I represented the Democratic Party all of last year.

I think there will be a motion to strike those, because I think that Judge Howell turned them over in wholesale fashion without giving a chance for redaction by the lawyers and so on.
