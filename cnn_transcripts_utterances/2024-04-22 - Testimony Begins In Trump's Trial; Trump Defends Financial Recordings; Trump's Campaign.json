Erin Burnett is outside the courthouse in New York. Today, the former president was in court as his longtime friend, the tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand. Prosecutors say he was a co-conspirator in the scheme to pay adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her silent about her alleged Trump affair. Prosecutors allege false business records were used to cover up the payment, but Trump says it was standard bookkeeping.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They called a payment to a lawyer, a legal expense in the books. They didn't call it construction. They didn't say you're building a building. They called a payment to a lawyer because as you know Cohen is a lawyer. He puts in an invoice so, whatever, a bill and they pay him and call it a legal expense. I got indicted for that. What else would you call it? Actually, nobody's been able to say what you're supposed to call it. If a lawyer puts in a bill or an invoice and you pay the bill and in the book, it's a little line that's a very small little line, I don't know if you could even write more than two words. It's not like you could tell a life story. They marked it down to a legal expense. This is what I got indicted over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But outside the court, when he walked out today, he did have plenty to say about the witness testimony today and about how the trial he says is cutting into what he wants to be doing with this time right now, which is campaigning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Even during that cycle, he occasionally had several events, but it was very rare. So that is not really impacting the schedule. But I will tell you, talking to senior advisers, particularly now that it's dawned on them that they are resigned to the fact he is in this courtroom nonstop for four days a week, there is a little bit of concern. We have seen Donald Trump utilizing the cameras. But when I talk to senior advisers, they're just not sure that that's going to be enough. Now, we saw him and his team celebrating after he had this politically motivated stop at a Harlem bodega last week. But then they were dealt a blow when he was supposed to appear in North Carolina for a rally that was then canceled for weather, because there's not a lot of wiggle room here. There are only two real days that he can do any sort of campaigning, any sort of fundraising right now. So we talked to various advisers. They tell us two things.One, you have the people who continue to insist that this is going to be good for him, that this is going to help with fundraising like we saw during primary season. This is going to help secure voters. But there are others who really aren't so sure. They know that we are in uncharted territory. They're not entirely sure how this is going to be managed on the campaign trail. And whether or not this could actually sway voters towards Donald Trump or away from Donald Trump, that's a big question for them. So right now you're seeing his team really huddling together, trying to figure out how exactly they are going to manage this schedule, looking at possible events within the New York area. But, of course, no area in New York that would possibly be more popular for Donald Trump or more conducive to having Donald Trump there, like Staten Island, for example. But now they're really trying to come up with those ideas that they hadn't really gone through before.",

Michael Cohen does have at least one prior conviction for lying under oath. Now, everything he's expected to say is likely to be corroborated by, number one, documents, and number two, the testimony of other witnesses.

All right. Our chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid, is with me, along with CNN anchor and chief domestic correspondent, Phil Mattingly. So, Paula, I want to talk about the notes in just a moment. But first, the people sitting in that room, you've got 12 jurors, you've got six alternates. Juror number nine goes up to the judge today, or the judge has a conversation with juror number nine because this person had expressed concern about media coverage.

But here you had juror number nine come forth and say that they were concerned about the media attention. This was very much expected because we thought, OK, the jurors have had a couple of days to really absorb the task in front of them, the risks associated with this, both for them and for their families.

The way this trial is going to play out, the intensity of it, and I think the stakes as everybody kind of sits there and recognizes this moment and what it all means and what it's going to mean over the course of the next five, six or seven weeks. And it's only going to get more intense. And I think there's very real concern when you talk to people kind of in the political sphere is if names start coming out, people can quickly identify who's who, if they're missing from the office, if they're missing any of these types of atmospherics. There's real concern about what that would mean going forward. I guarantee you these individuals understand that. And if they don't quite have their hands around it yet, it's certainly going to become quite apparent in the weeks ahead. 12 and six, that's a lot of people. This is going to be a lengthy trial.
