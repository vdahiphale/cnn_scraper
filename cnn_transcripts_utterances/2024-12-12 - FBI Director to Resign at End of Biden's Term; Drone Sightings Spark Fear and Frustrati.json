If he's the individual who could potentially be the next secretary of defense, I think it's -- I mean, I'm not just the senator for Pennsylvania for my voters or Democrats, it's for all of us.

You can go after these people.It puts a little more teeth into it. Because I think everyone's trying to do their best, but they say that the law seems to be a little vague on what they can and can't do. But I know a judge has a lot more power to enforce. So, that's where we asked for the FBI directly. We're not hearing anything from the FBI. To be honest with you, Jim, I'm not sure this is the FBI's baby. This is FAA.
