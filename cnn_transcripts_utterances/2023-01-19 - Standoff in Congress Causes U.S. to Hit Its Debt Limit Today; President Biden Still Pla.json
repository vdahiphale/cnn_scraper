They can do accounting moves to keep the bills flowing until maybe June.So June is when you really have a problem here. But we've already sent a message to the rest of the world that, you know, the United States does not have its fiscal house in order and is now going to be arguing about whether to pay the bills it has already spent. This is not about future spending when the rest of the world looks at us. This is about paying for the bills that are already there. There are a couple of things that can happen as we get later in the year. They can start maybe give an IOU to Social Security recipients, an IOU to people who work in the military. They can defer different kinds of payments. But what they must continue to do is pay the interest on our debt.

And the moment that you are seeing right now play out is everyone is retreating to their corners.If you remember, Kevin McCarthy, to get the job for the speakership, he agreed to a key concession from hard conservatives on his right. They were arguing they wanted to use the debt ceiling to extract maximum concessions on spending from the White House. Meanwhile, the White House and Democrats are saying they are not going to negotiate. They are not going to have a conversation about spending cuts as it pertains to raising the debt ceiling. So everyone really dug in. And a few players to keep a close eye on. One of them is Chip Roy. He's a Republican from the state of Texas who was part of this negotiation with Kevin McCarthy and has really been a fiscal hawk for a long time up here on Capitol Hill. Another person I'm keeping a close eye on is Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader who has often come to the table and found a way out of these crises in the past. What role does he take on and at what point do those talks really start to gain some steam? Right now everybody is sticking to their political talking points. At some point over the next five months that is going to have to change. It may take several weeks, even months before we get into really strong discussions, though, up here on Capitol Hill.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna and John, advisers to President Biden say that they are undeterred when it comes to a possible 2024 reelection announcement saying that a launch could come after the State of the Union Address on February 7th. That is the timeframe that his advisers have pointed to in the past, saying that it was likely after the State of the Union that President Biden would announce a bid for the 2024 run.Of course advisers are still awaiting that final signoff from the president but they have been putting mechanisms in place should he decide to go ahead and run for re-election once again. Ultimately advisers here at the White House believe that the situation involving the classified documents from President Biden's time as vice president, that ultimately that will blow over. And what they believe is so much of the conversation around this is centered amongst what they call the D.C. elite, and ultimately they believe that if they continue stressing their message, that is what is going to resonate with voters heading into the next election. I want to read you a quote from one of the advisers who said, quote, \"It's a matter of public record what Americans' highest priority issues are from polling, other research, and the most important poll, the midterms. The economy, cutting costs, fighting inflation, creating jobs, standing up for reproductive rights, fighting for gun reform. The American people care a hell of a lot about all of that.\" Now so much of the sentiment that you hear when you talk to advisers to the president dates back to his time during the 2020 campaign when President Biden, then candidate Biden, was counted out. You all remember those devastating losses that he suffered both in Iowa and South Carolina only to have his campaign resurrected once he made his way to South Carolina. There's kind of this fighting-from-behind attitude that they had during the campaign that they still carry over to this White House. And one thing that officials have also said over the course of the next few weeks, even as all of this classified documents saga is ongoing, they're going to stick to their messaging. One of those things is touting bipartisan work. Tomorrow the president will be hosting a bipartisan group of mayors here at the White House. So simply put, at this moment they believe that they will be able to ride out this storm of the classified documents saga and move closer to a reelection bid in the coming months.",

Well, what's notable in this next aid package for Ukraine which we do expect to be one of the biggest so far is both what's new and then what's also not in it despite repeated ongoing requests by the Ukrainians.Now what's new and what really stands out are the inclusion of the Stryker combat vehicles. These are armored vehicles that can carry Ukrainian forces across the battlefield, giving the Ukrainians a new mechanized capability. Those will be added to the U.S. Bradley fighting vehicles that were committed to Ukraine earlier this month in what was the biggest aid package to date. The Strykers are lighter and faster than the Bradleys. But taken together, combined together, they really give the Ukrainians a major boost in terms of their ability to advance and carry out offensives, to take back territory that has been held by Russia. What is not expected to be in this latest package are two big things that the Ukrainians desperately want. First, long range missiles called ATACMS that have a range of around 200 miles. Also not expected to be in this package are U.S. tanks. Ukraine desperately wants Western tanks and the U.S. wants them to have Western tanks. But the American-made battlefield tank called the M-1 Abrams just doesn't make sense, many people say, for logistical and maintenance reasons. Instead, the U.S. is pressuring Germany to not just send their Leopard 2 tanks but also allow other European countries who have those German tanks to commit them to the fight in Ukraine as well. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he is in Germany today meeting with his German counterpart among others. A U.S. official traveling with Austin said that they are very optimistic that they will make progress on this issue by the end of the week when the United States is hosting the Ukraine contact group in Ramstein, Germany -- John, Bianna.",

Why would Kohberger be in that home? Why would he have an item that shared skin cell?The other thing that I think is important is the hair. Did the hair have any roots attached? If it did, they can get DNA from it. Did he have some transfer DNA from those victims that he brought home with him? And so we're not just looking at blood. We're also looking for things like transfer DNA because we are to the point in science that we can actually get DNA off of skin cells.
