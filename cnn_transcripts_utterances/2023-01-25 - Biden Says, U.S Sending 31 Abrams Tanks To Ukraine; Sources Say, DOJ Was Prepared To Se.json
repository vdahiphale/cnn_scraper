And that is deeply concerning for the Ukrainians. If this goes into stalemate, if the Russians can freeze those frontlines from the Russian perspective, that ultimately will be victory. Victory from the Ukrainian perspective, of course, is the complete destruction or evacuation from their territory of every single Russian soldier.

Colonel Leighton, first to you, is it fair to say the Leopard tanks coming in from Germany, are for this upcoming phase of the war, and the Abrams tanks are part of a much longer strategy? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It seems to be the case, Wolf, because the Leopard tanks, not only are they in Europe, but they can be more easily employed by the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have some idea of how to operate them. They have also worked already with, of course, the combined training center at Grafenwoehr in Germany, where they've learned combined armed tactics. And the Leopard tanks can be integrated very easily into those kinds of tactics. When the Abrams tanks come in, they are then going to be used as kind of a back-filler for everything that has happened, any gaps that occurred as a result of defensive or offensive operations, and that's the kind of thing that we can expect to happen. But it seems like it is going to be a phased approach and that's a pretty wise decision, in my opinion.",

They don't take these threats. So, we've heard these threats over and over and over and the allies have moved on anyway. The allies have pulled together.

But the fact is this is a very fundamentally different case from what is happening with Donald Trump's investigation. That is a former president who knew he had documents and refused to produce those unlawfully possess documents whereas the Biden administration has been cooperative every step of the way.

What is critical, and you said it in your intro, is we have got to make sure that we're helping the Ukrainians plan and prepare for the fighting that we think that they're going to be facing in the spring and summer months as the weather gets better.

Remember last week, we reported that Trump's lawyers has sent a letter to Meta asking for a meeting to talk about Trump being reinstated for Facebook.Now, what we have learned happened tonight from the same source who has briefed on the meeting is that Meta reached out last minute to Trump's lawyers asking for a meeting and they were actually still in that meeting when Meta released this news publicly that they have decided to reinstate Trump. Now, there are still some questions, because I've got to tell you, there was a number of aides and advisers who actually didn't know about this until they saw the media reports or heard from us, reporters, asking them for comment. And they're still aren't really quite sure about all of the restrictions and all of the timeline of when this is going to happen because they feel like they're just getting all of this information. They have to discuss it with the lawyers, figure out what exactly this looks like. And one other thing to note here is remember that Trump is still on Truth Social, and he does have a contract with them. So, that's something else that the lawyers are working through right now.",

Will he have different guard rails right now that other users, when it comes to Facebook, for example, and we know recently Twitter decided to reinstated him as well?O'SULLIVAN:  That's right, Wolf. Facebook is saying it's going to put new guard rails in place. It's kind of saying that they won't allow Trump do what he did last time they had him on the platform. And, look, we have just seen from Trump on his own social media platform recently continuing to spread lies about the 2020 election and even recently calling for the jailing of journalists. But, look, obviously, many Republicans are going to be celebrating Trump coming back, at least MAGA Republicans and Trump's supporters. We've heard from Democrats, like Congressman Adam Schiff, criticizing this move. But I do think it's important to point out the ACLU have weighed in on this in just the past few minutes, and they said that this is the right call. Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. They go on to point out that they have many issues with Trump but they believe that Meta has made the right decision here because voters and Americans should be able to hear from Trump, the good, the bad and the ugly.",
