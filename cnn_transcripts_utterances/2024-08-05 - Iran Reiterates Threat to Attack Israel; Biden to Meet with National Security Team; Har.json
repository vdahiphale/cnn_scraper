And I was talking with Congressman Bera just a short time ago on this program, and he said his concern is that you could have Israel come under attack, not only by the Iranians, but Houthi rebels, Hezbollah, all of the folks you mentioned.We saw back in April, you just mentioned it a few moments ago, that test of the Iron Dome defensive system that the Israelis have, can it withstand that kind of multi-pronged attack if that were to take place?",

It is meant primarily for missile and an artillery round attacks within a small region. The Israelis also have David's Slang and the aero system. But they need reinforcement. If you're talking about literally hundreds of weapon systems coming from multiple directions, like you just said, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, perhaps even the Yemi -- the Houthis in Yemen, you're talking about a multi-pronged system of approaches to attack.Last time they were not synchronized to be the most effective. They all came in one barrage and it was -- they were easily shot down. But if those are synchronized in a way that could overwhelm the system, yes, it's going to be very problematic.

We've been watching this all morning. The plummet is fueling fears of recession amid a global market meltdown. Tech stocks are driving this nose drive -- nose dive, I should say, as investors are selling off all of those equities as well as crypto and oil stocks also contributing to the drop Friday's disappointing jobs report and an unchanged Fed interest rate.All of that happening as three men are emerging as the front runners to be Kamala Harris' running mate this weekend, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly met with the vice president for what's expected to be their final interview in the vetting process. Today is likely decision day for Harris, who is launching a week-long battleground blitz with her running mate tomorrow starting in Philadelphia. Let's discuss with CNN political commentators, Maria Cardona and Shermicheal Singleton. Maria, I do want to talk -- we're watching the stock market. We -- I do want to talk about the veepstakes, but I suppose there is a political concern about the markets if this keeps going in this direction.",

That every other indication is that the economy is stable, solid, strong. And so, we'll just have to see this through, see what happens.And frankly, you know, the majority of Americans are not in the stock market. And so, what I believe the vice president will continue to talk about is how she's going to expand the middle-class, how she's going to make this economy work for everyone and refocus on Donald Trump's plan, Project 2025, and how almost every economist across the spectrum has said if he imposes that plan, it would be a disaster for Americans across the board, and especially for low income and middle- class Americans.",

And so, I'm not convinced, to Maria's point, that the Fed will lower rates by the next Fed meeting, which is in September. Again, this is difficult if you're a Democrat trying to run on the idea that the economy, generally speaking, is strong. By all metrics that is not the case.
