There is also this video, which has been geo-located by CNN and shows the moment of impact from that attack earlier today. We have also obtained exclusive pictures that show missile debris from the strike. A source says the fragments picture do not necessarily belong to one missile. All of this, of course, happening in a week of creeping escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine. The Kremlin, for its part, isn't commenting on this latest strike.CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all the developments for us from London. So, Ukraine still trying to determine whether this was an ICBM. What more do we know so far, especially now that we do have these pictures and videos?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. There is still no official designation or comments, Erica, as to what exactly it was that Russia fired. Originally, we got word from the Ukrainian Air Force, definitively they said that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile. There were later comments that sort of couched that, a foreign ministry spokesperson saying that it had all the characteristics, that they were waiting expert conclusions. Similar comments came from President Zelenskyy, saying that, again, that it had the characteristics, he said, speed, altitude of an intercontinental ballistic missile. But, meanwhile, we had a Western official telling CNN that they believed it was a ballistic missile, not an intercontinental ballistic missile.So, I think, look, there are weapons in Russia's arsenal that sort of blur the lines when it comes to what exactly would class as an intercontinental ballistic missile. That is generally a range classification over 5,500 kilometers of range. But, as I said, no official comment as of yet. But, I think if you look at the scale of this strike on the city of Dnipro, which is a city of almost a million people, the fourth largest in Ukraine, the message from Moscow is very clear and very significant, given that they don't shy away from verbal nuclear saber rattling, usually, that they've decided to say nothing about this today, the Kremlin using the well-worn tactic of referring all comments to the Defense Ministry, who also do not respond to requests for comments. And we got a really extraordinary insight into the sort of transmission of that policy. Take a listen to what happened midway through a Foreign Ministry press conference today, a regular Foreign Ministry press conference with the spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (Interpreted): Hello. VOICE OF UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): Masha? ZAKHAROVA (Interpreted): Yes. I'm having a briefing. VOICE OF UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): On Yuzhmash, the ballistic missile strike, which the Westerners started talking about, we are not commenting at all. ZAKHAROVA (Interpreted): Yes. OK.

He is a CNN military analyst, and the former Commanding General of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. Good to see you, as always. Picking up on what we've seen here, there is still the back and forth, right? Ukraine initially saying the air force that it was an ICBM and sort of backtracking it had the characteristics. I know you've seen the video. We've shown some of these pictures. Based on what you see, what do you think was fired? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: A couple of things, Erica. I mean, you're going to be able to track through satellite what kind of missile it is and what location it was launched from. When you're struck by it, like the city of Dnipro was today, you just know that it's coming out of the exo-atmosphere and striking the ground. The thing that struck me the most in watching the films that occurred, and hearing initially that it was an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile, first of all, I thought, OK, that's a huge strategic raise by the Russian Federation. But, what's interesting, if it's a medium-range ballistic missile, as your reporter was just talking about, those were supposed to have been destroyed by the Russian Federation several years ago under a treaty. So, both cases have some meanings. The third thing that I'd say is, when you watched the film, as you're showing right now, you're going to see multiple strikes, both intercontinental and medium-range ballistic missiles can be what's called MIRVed (M-I-R-V), and that stands for Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles. So, each one of those missiles can carry several, and I counted six strikes in this film, but they can count several missiles coming out of one missile or one -- excuse me, several explosions, several warheads coming out of one missile. Both countries, the United States and Russia, have these MIRV vehicles like this coming out of missiles. Truthfully, they're designed primarily for nuclear war, to deliver multiple nuclear weapons across the continent, but they can also carry high explosive weapons and chemical weapons to a target, and I think that's what Russia is relying on. The one last thing, if you ask, why is this happening now? Well, with the delivery of the ATACMS missiles, the use of the UK Storm Shadows, as you were just talking about, that is pushing Russia back away from the frontlines with Ukraine. So, they are going to continue to look for ways to fire these kinds of missiles or other kind of bombs from extended distances. And you can't strike all the locations where they're coming from, because, as -- we got to remind ourselves, there is 11 time zones across Russia. It's a huge country, thousands of miles. They can keep moving back and avoid having their attack location struck by the Ukrainian forces. But, it is pushing things away from the frontlines, and it is causing Russia to use different kinds of munitions.",

The court also issuing a separate warrant for Hamas commander Mohammed Deif, an alleged mastermind of the October 7th attacks. Israel says he was killed in an airstrike in September.Mr. Netanyahu calls the warrants against him and Gallant \"absurd and antisemitic\", many Palestinians calling it a key step toward justice and accountability.

But, it is laying the responsibility at the feet of the Prime Minister and of the former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been the key decision maker in deciding how the war in Gaza should be prosecuted.He has -- he was warned, the government was warned by the ICC back in October last year to sort of follow the international norms and standards of warfare. Otherwise, don't complain if you're called out on it later, was essentially the warning, and this is what's happened, and precisely what the ICC is accusing the Prime Minister of, and has issued these arrest warrants because they believe that there is evidence to support that the Prime Minister is responsible for war crimes in using starvation as a method of warfare, of crimes against humanity, by murder, by persecution and other heinous acts. So, this is very strong language. It's very legalese language. It's very strong language, and it's really for the Prime Minister, the strongest international rebuttal for what Israel has been doing, the way it's responded to Hamas' brutal attack on October 7th last year that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 other hostages. But, the consequences for the Prime Minister, a huge, 124 countries as signatories to the Rome Statute, which means those 124 countries are obligated to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he lands in their country and send him to the ICC for trial. It puts the Prime Minister in the same position as, for example, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who didn't go to the BRICS summit in South Africa this year because he is afraid, because he also faces an ICC arrest warrant that he might be extradited to the ICC from there.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think one of the key things, Erica, to keep in mind is that, well, one, we seeing a lot more new details in this police report. It's not exactly the same account that we know Pete Hegseth has been saying publicly and also telling the Trump team there are far more details in this than were revealed before. But, I think one important thing to keep in mind as well is that a lot of these allegations caught Donald Trump's team off guard, and remember, they moved on his process very, very quickly. Donald Trump had essentially put his name out there and decided to have him go down to Florida to interview with him at Mar-a-Lago, and then really soon after he made the pick, or he made the announcement about Hegseth public and said it publicly.And so, there wasn't a lot of vetting, is what we've been told that went on when it relates to Hegseth specifically. And again, they weren't totally prepared for some of these allegations to come out. Now, we have heard them responding, Donald Trump's team, to this today. There was a statement from Karoline Leavitt, one of his spokespeople, that -- our future Press Secretary, I should say, that essentially lays out and makes the claim that since he was not charged with any crimes, that this doesn't make a difference, that they are moving forward with Hegseth as Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon, and that it doesn't change anything in their eyes. And I tell you as well, I've spoken privately with some of Donald Trump's top advisors. They've kind of made the same case to me that essentially this hasn't changed things, at least not for now. Now, of course, the big question is, what you just posed, how will Republicans respond to this? Because at the end of the day, they really do have the ultimate say on what will happen with Hegseth and if he is going to be able to get through those very important confirmation hearings. And the other thing I will just note as well that, apart from all of these allegations of sexual assault or misconduct that relate to both Hegseth but also Matt Gaetz, there is other things too that are creating an easiness on Capitol Hill, and that is, are they even qualified for the job in and of itself?

We saw Bill Hagerty, who, of course, is in the running, we know, and has been interviewed for the Treasury Secretary role in a Trump -- in a second term for Donald Trump. He came out saying that he supports Pete Hegseth. It's very similar to what we saw Matt Gaetz do yesterday with J.D. Vance.And I do want to talk about, though, J.D. Vance's role in all of this, because one thing that's been very interesting is that over the past two weeks, we've rarely seen the Vice President-elect in public. I've had a lot of people, a lot of my sources, calling me, asking me, where is J.D. Vance? You've seen a lot of Elon Musk. You've seen a lot of RFK Jr. and Donald Trump Jr., but not a lot of J.D. Vance. What I'm told is that really this re-emergence of him on Capitol Hill being this unofficial Sherpa to Matt Gaetz and to Pete Hegseth is really kind of him showing his new directive off, which is Donald Trump has tasked him directly with being his point person on Capitol Hill. He wants J.D. Vance to be the one who not only helps ensure that his cabinet picks get through, but also that nobody stands in the way of his agenda. And that all ties back to what we know Donald Trump and his team believe, which is that they were given a mandate. Some people questioned whether or not that's actually the case. But, they believe that the people voted for him and that he deserves to be able to enact the policies that he wants, and they want J.D. Vance to be the one to ensure that that happens. So, this is a really big test for him, these two days, and how these meetings go. Erica.",

So, some of those responsibilities are undertaken by the USTR, the U.S. Trade Representative, and some of them are under the umbrella of the Commerce Department and other agencies within Commerce. So, you may recall, for example, that Trump's first term, he had Wilbur Ross as Secretary of Commerce, and Wilbur Ross basically oversaw an investigation, saying that steel, aluminum and even automobile imports were threats to national security. Trump ultimately acted on two of those three. So, it's not entirely unusual here.However, Howard Lutnick, Trump's choice for Commerce, who had been in the running for Treasury Secretary, and I guess got this as something maybe of a consolation prize, has been very enthusiastic about Trump's tariff plans. So, I think we should expect to see more aggressive action coming from that department going forward. The other thing that I would point out is that in addition to oversight -- or responsibilities related to trade, Commerce is essentially a collection of a lot of independent statistical agencies, many of our major independent statistical agencies, almost everything, except for the agency that produces the jobs report, so, the agency that produces GDP, our population counts, weather data, scientific standards, all of those things, they're all under the umbrella of Commerce, and those were all, again, supposed to be independent, and I think that there is a reasonable worry that under a more politicized Commerce Secretary, that some of that independence might be compromised, and as a result, there are threats to potentially the integrity of those data.

Another was ongoing in the tendering process for another Adani company to take over the running of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, that's the main airport here in the country. There had been widespread anger at these two deals, and many people on the streets had been calling for them to be scrapped, calling them corrupt.But, President Ruto did not do that until the overnight indictment of Gautam Adani and some associates in New York. It's only after that happened, President Ruto saying, based on new information from partner nations, he is canceling those deals. And some reaction, really, from social media, from Kenyans, saying he was not paying attention to what they were saying until another jurisdiction said that there was probably corruption involved in this company that he canceled that.

There have been many calls on the streets and more recently online for people saying Ruto must go. Even though he dropped those unpopular tax proposals, he fired his cabinet, then reconstituted the cabinet. Half of the cabinet came back. He added members of the opposition.

I mean, what's really fascinating about Gabbard is that if she is confirmed, she will be the most publicly anti-surveillance official to ever lead the very part of the U.S. government that is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence, for collecting information on America's adversaries. Back when she was a Democratic Congresswoman, Gabbard introduced several pieces of legislation that are almost antithetical to how the intelligence community sees its role. She introduced two pieces aimed at really defending Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor, who revealed bulk collection by the NSA on America's data in 2013, as well as Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, both seen really as kind of enemies of the state within the intelligence community.But, Gabbard, we're worthy of protecting from prosecution, she also introduced a piece of legislation that would have wholesale repealed one of the most powerful and sweeping authorities that the U.S. has to collect foreign intelligence on foreign targets overseas, over concerns that that authority also allowed the intelligence community to sort of collect Americans data through what's known as a back door, and may have violated -- in Gabbard's view, violates American civil liberties. So, in some ways, she fits this kind of pre-existing political coalition of both libertarian-leaning Republicans as well as progressive Democrats who have concerns about American surveillance authorities that are meant to target foreign targets, but in fact, also may -- could arguably said by some of these critics to violate American Civil Liberties as well. But, Gabbard's in sort of insistence on wanting to sort of wholesale remove this authority is a pretty extreme step. Right? This isn't about reforming. This is about removing that authority. And so, I think for members of the intelligence community, that raises a lot of questions about how she will approach sort of the rules of intelligence gathering once she is in a position to control both the budget and the priorities that govern these 18 agencies.",

I am fascinated by this move by the current Justice Department wanting Google to break up with Chrome, which seems like that would be a tough thing to break up. I could be wrong.

As we're looking at all of that play out, though, of course, there is a lot of expectation about what would happen today, following Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday, third quarter revenue reaching just over $35 billion. You can see how that's playing out. The company's popular semiconductor chips are key to AI technology. Nvidia's -- Nvidia estimates, though, that its fourth quarter sales will reach $37 billion.CNN's Anna Stewart joining us now live from London with the latest. So, this is one that sort of everybody was waiting for, because Nvidia has had so much attention over these last several months. How are we seeing it play out, especially as they talk about what's ahead?",

      "sentences": "Well, it was interesting. Today, there was an expectation that perhaps the share price wouldn't do so well. It actually popped on the open and now it has dropped, as many people expected. And this is despite this being the world's most valuable listed company in the world that has released an earnings report for the third quarter that is, frankly, quite stellar.Let me run you through some of the numbers. For the third quarter, revenue was up 94 percent compared to a year before. But, if you look at where we were at this time last year, Q3 of last year, it was actually up more than 200 percent year-on-year. So, what we have here is essentially Wall Street having not just lofty expectations for Nvidia's performance, but actually kind of stratospheric expectations here. They're expecting it to keep rising. The outlook is also good. Actually, revenue for next quarter, the outlook, it kind of beats the analyst consensus, and there is a lot of hope for a new chip that it's brought out for the Blackwell line. It's a new generation of chips, and expect to be able to sell far more than even have demand for. So, it's all very exciting. But, clearly, I think investors want to see a bit more. And actually the industry as a whole, there is perhaps some feeling that maybe there has been a bit too much hype in the sector.",

This has been an interesting narrative that we've had even for the likes of Ilya Sutskever, who is one of the founders of OpenAI, suggesting that, particularly if we look at generative AI models like ChatGPT, that perhaps we're not seeing the same sort of improvement model-to-model, that there is a limit as to how much human data you can actually put into these models, and that even if you kind of throw more computational power at them, will they improve much more?I would say, if you look at AI more broadly and what it's going to do and what it is already doing with healthcare and medicine, the progress is huge. And of course, Erica, the Holy Grail that all of these big companies are working towards, artificial general intelligence. You can see it as the Holy Grail or the end of humanity, depending on what your risk outlook is. But, there is a lot of progression there. So, while some skeptics about some of the commercial aspect of AI, there is a lot of exciting stuff to come, particularly for Nvidia, who will build all of the structures there, all the infrastructure.",
