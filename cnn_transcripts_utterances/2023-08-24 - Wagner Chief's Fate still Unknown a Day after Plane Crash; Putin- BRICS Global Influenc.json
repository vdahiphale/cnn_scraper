Coming up, questions swirling over YevgenyPrigozhin's plane crash, how it happened and whether it was truly an accident, we'll take a look at the Wagner Chief's legacy and ahead to what his presumed death will mean for Russia going forward. Well, a new era for the BRICS bloc is emerging. Six other countries including where I am the UAE have been invited to become members starting next year, giving the group outsize economic clout that it hasn't seen before. Now in just hours from now, a U.S. President set to walk into an Atlanta area jail to be arrested on racketeering charges. Donald Trump stands accused of trying to steal the 2020 election in Georgia. That was just one of the subjects of last night's first Republican presidential debate which Donald Trump decided to skip. Well, from a forest to the morgue, Russia says it is looking for answers in the crash of a plane said to be carrying Wagner Boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. The debris spread over two kilometers north of Moscow. Russia says Prigozhin and other Wagner top mercenaries were among the 10 people listed on board and last word eight bodies have been recovered. They have now been taken for forensic testing as we understand. Well, this comes of course two months to the day, after Prigozhin's failed mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was already outspoken against Russia's defense machine in Ukraine then CNN's Fredrick Pleitgen tells us the Mercenary Chief may have risked it all. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Probably the last moments of Wagner Boss Yevgeny Prigozhin this jet an Embraer Legacy 600 seen falling from the sky, a wing appearing to be missing Russian authorities confirming Prigozhin was onboard the aircraft. CNN is unable to confirm the authenticity of this video but we anonymously claimed it was the moment that an Embraer air jet fell from the sky and the terror region north of Moscow. Flight data shows the plane traveling from Moscow on a heading to St. Petersburg before it suddenly stops transmitting. Russian media say 10 people were on board, all of them believed dead, and that Prigozhin's name was also on the passenger manifest. The Wagner Mercenary Group fought bitterly in Ukraine, notably in Bakhmut gaining some territory but also incurring heavy losses. Prigozhin ripping into Russia's Defense Minister and his top general accusing them of withholding ammo leading to further deaths of his fighters you think you were the masters of this life, you think you can dispose of other lives? You think because you have warehouses full of ammunition that you have that right? In late June Prigozhin went a step further launching a rebellion he said aimed to unseat the leadership of the Defense Ministry. Prigozhin finally relented and Wagner's troops were ordered to Belarus but days later Putin took aim at Prigozhin himself.",

The problem with people like Prigozhin is that these people are way more adventurous than say government officials. And it looks like for Putin now is became a big problem.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's here in an undisclosed location in Africa that the Wagner Boss Yevgeny Prigozhin recorded what's believed to be his last undated video message, a recruitment promo for his private mercenary company and its operation in several African countries.",

Once known as Putin's Chief Prigozhin largely disappeared after his failed mutiny and quickly Russia sought to assure its allies, especially across Africa, that Wagner presence in their countries won't be affected. In the two months between his mutiny and presumed death in a plane crash Prigozhin's fleeting messages were mostly focused on Africa. A photo on the sidelines of a Russia Africa Summit with a visiting African official, an audio recording on a Pan-African channel, and many audio messages on his telegram channels Wagner has been expanding in West Africa for years. CNN filmed and mercenaries trading security forces in the Central African Republic. They are also active or have been linked to Libya, Mali, Mozambique and Sudan. Huge countries with vast natural resources, some of which Wagner are exploiting. Over the past two years, investigations by CNN and human rights groups have established Wagner's involvement and complicity with atrocities against civilian populations. And the French say the group is also behind a smear campaign against them. In Niger, supporters of a July military coup were burning French flags and waving Russian flags across the country.

Putin could have advanced the betrayal of an old ally and his top lieutenants.

I do think that there could be a move and they said this explicitly towards trying to do some trade between BRICS nations in local currency but they just practical difficulties to doing that in the world financial system.
