New polls show Vice President Harris with a narrow edge in two key swing states. Also ahead, the fallout from racist remarks at a Trump rally over the weekend are having an impact in crucially important Pennsylvania. I'll speak to a radio station owner there who says many of his callers are fuming. And Israel begins strikes on a historic Lebanese town as behind- the-scenes Israeli-American and Lebanese officials are reportedly pursuing a short-term ceasefire deal. We're live from the region this hour for you. But first tonight, six days from the election, both campaigns are making their last-minute pitches to undecided voters while also doing -- well, some damage control here. Kamala Harris is campaigning in three battleground states today, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris is trying to stay laser-focused on her plan for the economy and a pledge to unifying the nation if she's elected. But that message is being overshadowed by some of these comments made by President Biden about Donald Trump's New York rally. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At this point in the campaign cycle, the Trump campaign and their allies feel that any sort of movement, any sort of gaffe could be expanded into something with a real ripple effect. And you know, the hope among Trump supporters and Republicans at large is that this is the so-called deplorables comment moment for Harris herself. Now, let's be clear here, Biden is not the candidate, Biden is in the Winter of his life and is prone to gaffes, and this has been true for decades with Biden.

Yes, the economy is the top focus it seems for voters, and you could argue that forthe White House or for Kamala Harris' campaign, it probably doesn't get much better than this solid growth for the third quarter, obviously, it's backward looking, but we're not expecting that much different in the fourth quarter. And the key element of this is consumer-spending. Yes, it was supported by government spending. Yes, it was supported by American business exporting, but the real driver of the American economy continues to be consumer spending, and that was very much the story today. And why does consumer spending continue to be strong wolf for the most part? Because the labor market remains strong, and that was the other piece of data that we got, a far better-than-expected jobs number today too. We were expecting to see perhaps some concerns due to the hurricane impact over the past month or so to the strikes over that big firm, Boeing, of course, too. But that's not what we see in this data. So, when you combine the two of those, the U.S. and American economy is on an incredibly solid footing going into this election. The problem is -- you and I have discussed all the way along is, even when you've contained, the price rises for the average American consumer that's still struggling with the fact that over the course of this administration, average prices are up around 17 percentage points, and that really hurts --",

This is the scene in Baalbek, a historic city that is home to ancient Roman ruins. A regional governor says intense raids are underway. Roads out of the city were jammed with cars, as you can see there, as residents fled in panic. Israel's army said it's targeting Hezbollah interests. Hezbollah's new leader, Naim Qassem, gave a televised address today, saying Hezbollah is capable of fighting for months, but would accept a ceasefire under certain conditions. Meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with his security officials on Tuesday to discuss ceasefire efforts. An Israeli official telling CNN, Israel, the U.S., and Lebanon are pursuing a deal that would stop the fighting in Lebanon for at least a month. And just days after the U.N. warned that Israel was separating families in northern Gaza and taking men and boys away by the truckload, a disturbing image has surfaced. Let me show it to you. Here you see more than 200 Palestinians, some elderly, some wounded, crouched, as you can see, in the ruins of Jabalya. Most, as you can see, are men. Many are also almost naked. Witnesses tell CNN Israeli forces detained them as they were fleeing their homes under evacuation orders and forced them to strip. Israel's military won't comment on this photo but acknowledges routinely detaining and strip- searching people as part of combat operations. I want to bring our Jeremy Diamond who's live for us in Jerusalem. And, Jeremy, let me focus first on what is happening in the north of Lebanon.

KING (voice-over): Early voting here runs through Friday, and more than seven in 10 Nevada voters live here in Clark County, that's Las Vegas, and its fast-growing suburbs. One big difference this cycle is the Republican embrace of early voting. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on hand in Vegas for a Veterans for Trump event to kick off the final week. One in five Nevada voters is Latino, and a big election year focus at Fiesta 98.1 is urging listeners to flex their political muscle. Rafael Cerros Jr. is one of the owners.
