He argued that they needed to step up and do something in order to help defend him against his recent legal matters.

Now, the judge ultimately ruled on Saturday that Donald Trump's team must respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon.

The only cities that are likely to see some relief are the ones that are getting rain showers, and that's really going to be focused across the Midwest, spreading into the mid-Atlantic region over the next 24 to 48 hours. The problem is it's not just some summer rain showers. You're also looking at the potential for some severe storms. The main concerns for a lot of these cities are going to be damaging winds, large hail, but flooding is also going to be a concern, especially for hard-hit states like Kentucky and Tennessee, which have seen a tremendous amount of rain just in the last 48 hours. Now we're adding more rain on top of that. So, areas like Cincinnati, Nashville, St. Louis, even stretching down to Atlanta, all have the potential more those severe storms on Sunday.

The annual remembrance ceremony was held at Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park on Saturday. The people including children, remembering the 70,000 people who died from the initial blast and the approximately 70,000 others who lost their lives from radiation exposure years later. Well, the movie \"Oppenheimer\" about the scientist who developed the bomb is a blockbuster hit in the U.S. But as our Michael Holmes reports, many Japanese say they have no interest in Hollywood's take on the dawn of the atomic era.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL NEWS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  In Japan, this was one of the only structures still standing in Hiroshima after the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city 78 years ago. A second bombing, this time on Nagasaki, followed three days later. The attacks ended World War II, a global conflict in which tens of millions of people died and the price to end it would be even more lives. CILLIAN MURPHY, ACTOR, \"OPPENHEIMER\":  This is a national emergency. HOLMES (voiceover):  Sunday is the anniversary of the attack on Hiroshima, but it's the mastermind behind the creation of that infamous weapon of war, the physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the biopic detailing how he and his team designed and developed the atomic bomb that's captivating audiences. \"Oppenheimer\" is packing theaters and getting rave reviews in the U.S., but some critics say something is missing. The film focuses on the scientist's own inner anguish after the bombings and doesn't delve into the horrific consequences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but those memories are still palpable in Japan. In Hiroshima, an estimated 140,000 people died, either directly or indirectly from the blast. A second atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki killed up to 80,000 people. And out of respect for them, some people say they don't want to see the movie even though it's not being released in Japan yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  There are still victims and bereaved families around, so I think it's possible for the film not to be shown out of consideration for those people's feelings. HOLMES (voiceover):  Others say, they're curious about it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I definitely want to see it. I'm really interested in what kind of things are included from the American point of view. HOLMES (voiceover):  But beyond the film itself, it's the buzz over \"Oppenheimer\" and another summer hit movie \"Barbie\" that's causing a lot of anger in Japan. The films were released on the same day in much of the world, and fans created memes under the hashtag \"Barbenheimer\", but some have shown images that many Japanese find offensive like pink mushroom clouds. Even the Warner Brothers Film Group which is owned by CNN's parent company, apologized over what it described as insensitive social media engagement. So far, there is no scheduled release date for \"Oppenheimer\" in Japan, but some people believe it is important to see it as it's part of the country's history and better for younger generations to learn about it and never forget the horrors of nuclear war. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  78 years went by and people are starting to forget. So, it's a good moment to make a movie and remind us about what happened. I think that's good.

And this meet is so important because it is the last chance to qualify for the U.S. nationals in San Jose, and then later on in the fall for the world championships, and all of that leading, of course, to the Olympics. Biles has been registered for all four events. And people keeping a close eye on how she does after this two-year hiatus. And that's the last time we saw Simone Biles compete was in Tokyo, where she shocked the world by withdrawing from all of her events after suffering from the twisties, that's a spatial and a mental block that gymnasts can suffer from where they can't tell what's up and what's down when they're flipping in midair. So, certainly, problematic for an elite gymnast. She, after Tokyo -- after the Tokyo games disappeared from competitive gymnastic. Now, so many people are excited to see her back.
