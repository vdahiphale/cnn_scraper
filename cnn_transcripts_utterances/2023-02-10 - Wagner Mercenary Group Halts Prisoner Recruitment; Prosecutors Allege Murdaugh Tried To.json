He didn't give any reason but one possibility might be that the Russian Defense Ministry has sidelined Wagner and is now fully taking control of recruiting convicts. At least that's the view of prisoner advocacy group Russia Behind Bars. OLGA ROMANOVA, RUSSIA BEHIND BARS (through translator):  Prisoners are difficult to deal with. Some Russian soldiers might not like fighting alongside prisoners in trenches. But there's big potential and it's easy to recruit masses.

He could simply be running out of people willing to go, even in Russian jails. Certainly, it seems as though word is spreading that the attrition rate for convicts recruited by Wagner is extremely high. It could also be a shift in Russia's strategy that makes that kind of warfare less effective on the front lines. It's really unclear and certainly, we're not hearing from Moscow as to what the reasons could be. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
