Hello and welcome to our extended CONNECT THE WORLD here from Abu Dhabi, two hours out of the UAE.The world is reacting in a big way as China fully ditches its zero COVID policy during its biggest ever coronavirus outbreak. Millions of people in China will be on the move soon. Beijing's pandemic rules end on January the 8th. The Lunar New Year is two weeks later. Well, that has prompted some countries, including the U.S. and India, to impose new restrictions on travelers from the world's second biggest economy. In Brussels, today, the E.U. talking about a possible joint response after Italy said nearly half the passengers on two flights this week, from China to Milan, tested positive for the virus. Italy was amongst the first European countries hit by COVID when it arrived on the continent in 2020. Well, as you would expect here on CNN, we are covering this from all angles. CNN's Kevin Liptak is with the U.S. President in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Barbie Nadeau standing by in Rome and Paula Hancocks is live in Seoul in South Korea with the China end of the story. Kevin, let me start with you, U.S. health officials announced concern over, and I quote them here, \"the lack of adequate and transparent data\" in China. Can you just take us through the U.S. response at this point?",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly American officials have been growing alarmed at this surge in cases in China. Andmore concerning to these officials than the numbers themselves is what they say is a lack of transparency coming from Beijing. Specifically, about the genomic sequencing that they are seeing, about what potential new variants may be spreading in China and that is what led to yesterday's announcement that they would impose these new rules on travelers from China. And so the new rule is you need to present a negative test that was taken no more than two days before you board your flight, that is from China but also from Macau and Hong Kong. And it not only applies to Chinese citizen but to every traveler that is coming to the United States from China. It will apply to flights, both direct flights from China to the United States but also travelers who are transiting through third countries. You can take a PCR test but you can also take an at-home antigen test that is proctored by a telehealth official, sort of on the webcam there. But I do think that these rules, they came together fairly quickly and they do reflect sort of the growing alarm in the United States that they don't have a good read about what is exactly happening on the ground there in China. And what they say is they have only received about 100 sort of genomic sequencings that were uploaded to public data websites from China, which is such a relatively low number, given the huge spike in cases that you are seeing there. And so until the U.S. has a better handle on what variants might be circulating on the ground there, they want to be extremely precautious to prevent new variants from spreading in the United States. And what a federal health official acknowledged yesterday is that they are not going to prevent COVID cases coming from China to the United States completely but that this could help mitigate the potential risk, versus all has echoes of the earliest days of the pandemic. And it really does show you the mistrust between the United States and Beijing, specifically when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, Becky.",

And they are sequencing a great number of these samples to try to understand if there is a new variant in play here. So far, the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that it seems to be Omicron is the most present in the samples that have been tested so far. But the one thing that is kind of up in the air here is, after they do these tests, you test before you leave the airport and then it is up to the person, if they test positive, to isolate. And that is a matter of trust. There is no law enforcement involved in making sure they isolate and quarantine; they are just supposed to do it. They are supposed to be the phone number, the authorities can check up on them. But the government is trying to figure exactly what to do to make sure those people who are testing positive when they get off the plane are isolating and not spreading the virus further. But Italy is not taking any chances. There is a lot of deja vu in the situation right now. I remember very well almost three years ago, talking about restrictions on flights from China before anyone really knew what was coming. The other big thing they're looking at are the vaccines. A lot of people in China, Chinese nationalists, have taken their vaccine that has not proven to be as effective as those in the rest of the world. So they're looking at the type of vaccine people have had and what potential variant they may be carrying, if they are positive, Becky.",

We just learned that at least two people were killed in the Kharkiv region. A local official there says that the all of the attacks targeted the critical infrastructure. Similar facilities were hit in Lviv, leaving 90 percent of that city without power. The mayor said there could also be disruptions in the water supply. And in Kyiv, this is what is left of one residential area. At least three people in the capital were injured and the devastation could've been so much worse. Ukraine's military says that it managed to shoot down 54 of the 69 missiles that Russia fired across the country. Ben Wedeman is live in Kyiv for you. Ben, what has been the response of authorities? Is this something that they had anticipated? And if so, how robust is the response at this point? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This was not a surprise for Ukrainian officials or ordinary Ukrainians. They were expecting that, at the end of the year, close to the New Year, that the Russians would launch something along these lines. And also keep in mind, three days ago, there was a strike on the Engels 2 air force base, well inside of Russia. The Ukrainians did not claim responsibility. But it is widely assumed that was it. And the assumption also was that the Russians would respond in a major way to that strike. So not a surprise. And of course, as you look at those numbers that have been put out by the commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, 69 missiles fired, 54 intercepted. So that certainly represents a fairly good percentage of errant missiles -- or rather missiles that did not hit their targets. They also said that they managed to down 11 drones, many of them these Shahed Iranian-produced drones that the Russians have purchased. Nonetheless, despite those positive numbers, we see, yes, two people dead in Kharkiv; here in Kyiv, you have three ,injured including a 14 year old girl and damaged houses and other facilities. And here, 40 percent of the city is without electricity. Oftentimes, the authorities will shut off the electrical grid in anticipation of these strikes that are focused on the infrastructure in order to prevent further damage to them. So it is a mixed bag. But by and large, the Ukrainians have emerged from this difficult day. Officials saying that we did well, we managed to prevent most of those missiles from hitting their targets. But they've still caused losses in life, injuries and serious disruption -- Becky.",

A short time ago the Knesset confirmed the cabinet and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now serving his sixth term as prime minister. To reach a majority, Mr. Netanyahu cemented alliances with hard-right parties opposed to Palestinian statehood. His far-right allies are aiming to expand settlements in the West Bank. The new government now includes Israel's first openly gay parliament speaker, Amir Ohana. As the cabinet was being sworn in, about 2,000 protesters gathered outside the Knesset. There is also pushback from more than 100 former Israeli diplomats, warning today that the new government will seriously damage Israel's foreign relations. Elliott Gotkine has been watching all of this unfold today. He's connecting with us this hour from Jerusalem. Benjamin Netanyahu said he wants to expand the circle of peace with Arab countries. Critics of the new government are skeptical. Palestinians warning of dangerous escalations at this point.

It is always pretty rambunctious.But we have even had members of the Knesset, at least five or maybe six were physically ejected from the Knesset plenum for heckling Benjamin Netanyahu as he was outlining his government's plans for this new government. The priorities that he talked about today, preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, boosting public transportation, reducing housing costs, as you say, expanding peace agreements with other Arab countries as well. So a number of priorities to focus on today. What he did not talk about today so much, which was in this government's agenda that was published yesterday, was, as you say, plans to build more settlements in the West Bank as well as developing and boosting development in the north and south of the country. They talked about boosting development in all of the land of Israel. And then also talked about the Galilee in the north, the Negev in the south and Judea and Samaria, AKA the West Bank. That is something that will undoubtedly raise hackles in the White House, in the Biden administration, also among other allies of Israel. They also -- one thing they also didn't talk about today but was also in their agenda, published yesterday, Becky, was to allay concerns about any change in the status quo at holy sites; in particular, Temple Mount, as it's known to Jews, the holiest site in Judaism, or Haram al-Sharif, which is the third holiest site in Islam. There were concerns because Itamar Ben-Gvir, who heads the Jewish Power Party and is now interior minister, he has in the past advocated for a change in the status quo, so that Jews will be allowed to openly pray on Temple Mount, something that has really been an explosive issue and could have led to even more of a conflict than we have right now. But Netanyahu in his government, in that agenda, was at pains to say that the status quo will not change, that those things are not going to change and, therefore, Jews will not be allowed to pray on Temple Mount, as things are right now, Becky.",

There has been a steady barrage of artillery since we got here just over an hour ago and a never ending stream of people just desperately trying to cross to safety. President Putin has said his army is not targeting civilians. But the exodus from Irpin tells a different story. Everyone steps in where they can, including us.
