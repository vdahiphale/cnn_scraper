      "sentences": "From London, this is the CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Richard Quest, and these are the stories that you need to know.The suspect in the deadly car attack at a Christmas market in Germany had a history of troubling social media posts. A 50-year-old from Saudi Arabia earlier this year made threats against Germany and the German people, posting about renouncing his Islamic faith and accusing Germany of promoting the Islamization of the country. Police in New York have arrested a suspect accused of killing a female subway passenger by setting her on fire. Authorities do not believe the two knew each other and say they didn't interact before the attack. At a speech to conservative activists in Arizona, President-elect Trump has pushed back on attacks from Democrats who have referred to Elon Musk as President Musk. Donald Trump said he would consider retaking control of the Panama Canal. Panama's presidents responded, saying the independence of his country is not negotiable. Donald Trump's pick for border czar also fired up the crowd at that same conservative conference. He pushed for an aggressive crackdown on immigration. Now, it appears Tom Homan's plans is to go into sanctuary cities and prosecute anyone hiding undocumented migrants from law enforcement. He says illegal immigrants who have committed crimes will be the priority, but they won't be the only ones that the agents are looking to arrest. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM HOMAN, DONALD TRUMP'S PICK FOR BORDER CZAR: So I'll send a whole bunch of agents into your community and we'll find the bad guy. And when we find the bad guy, he's probably going to be with others, others that aren't a priority apprehension. But guess what? They're getting arrested, too. So you'll get exactly what you don't want, more arrests in your communities. I don't want to do that. I'd much rather be safe with the agents arrest the guy in the county jail, but they don't let us in. Fine. You're not going to stop us. We'll go to the community and we will find him. You're not going to stop us. Put all the roadblocks up, roadblocks you want. It's not going to work. We're going to do this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It was earlier this week when we learned that the House Ethics Committee had a secret vote to release its report into the conduct of former Rep. Matt Gaetz. And now we know when, multiple sources telling CNN the report will be released Monday. The release is a stark reversal by the committee, which just last month voted to shelve the report after Gaetz resigned from Congress once he became president-elect Donald Trump's pick for Attorney General.Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration of that role after Trump called him to say Gaetz didn't have the votes in the Senate to get confirmed. This report concludes a years-long probe by the Ethics Committee into numerous allegations against Gaetz, including whether he engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor, whether he paid for sex, used illicit drugs, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, and more. Gaetz has strongly denied all of the allegations and has said the committee's investigation is a witch hunt, saying this on X after reports of the committee's decision to release this report. He said, quote, The Biden-Garland DOJ spent years reviewing allegations that I committed various crimes. I was charged with nothing, fully exonerated. The Post went on to say, It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now. We should note that it is rare for an ethics report to be released after a member has left Congress, though it has happened on a couple of occasions in the past. Gaetz has said he has no plans of returning to the House next year. As a result, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the report a moot point and advocated for it to not be released. But here's what Gaetz said Sunday at a conservative conference. MATT GAETZ, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER PICK FOR U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: And some of you throughout this conference have even given me a few suggestions. My fellow Floridians have asked me to eye the governor's mansion in Tallahassee. Maybe special counsel to go after the insider trading for my former colleagues in Congress. It seems I may not have had enough support in the United States Senate. Maybe I'll just run for Marco Rubio's vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks.",

We've reached out for comment from Israel's military.Now, overall, Gaza's health ministry is saying more than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's offensive started last year. We can't independently confirm that number. The humanitarian crisis across Gaza is worsening, with food prices rising dramatically. These are the video of the chaos at an NGO facility in central Gaza. People are pushing their way just to get a meal. One woman said she was there to get food for her children. She said the situation would be unbearable without such assistance. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is speaking out after Houthi rebels fired a missile at Tel Aviv this weekend. According to Israeli military, several attempts to shoot it down failed. The prime minister says Israeli forces will continue to target Houthis in Yemen in the same way they've dealt with other Iranian proxies. The U.S. has launched a series of strikes against Houthis, part of an ongoing effort to shut them down and their military operations in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): As we acted forcefully against the terror arms of Iran's evil axis, so we will act against the Houthis. Only in this case we are not acting alone. The U.S. and other countries see the Houthis as a threat not only to international shipping, but to the international order. Therefore, we will act forcefully with determination and sophistication. I tell you, even if it takes time, the result will be the same result as against the other terror arms. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Apparently, they said all weapons in the country will now be controlled by the state.

After all, I spoke to Jasmine El-Gamal, a former Middle East advisor at the Pentagon, and she says it won't be that easy for Donald Trump to just ignore what's unfolding there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASMINE EL-GAMAL, FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER: This is one of the things that we've seen time and again with U.S. administrations saying this is not our fight, we need to get out of the Middle East, the Middle East is quiet, and yet time and again they end up being dragged back in, because actually what happens in the Middle East does affect U.S. interests, and it does affect U.S. allies. So Donald Trump may very well want to stay out of this, but the fact is, at the very least, at a bare minimum, we have 40,000 ISIS fighters, women, and children who are in Syria. There's a U.S. counter-ISIS mission in the northeast of the country, and they're going to be looking at that situation and trying to figure out how do you make it so that these ISIS fighters don't pose a threat to U.S. interests and allies, and that's just at a bare minimum.",
