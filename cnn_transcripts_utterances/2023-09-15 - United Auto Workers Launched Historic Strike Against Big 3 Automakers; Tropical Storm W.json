I mean, I think that Ms. Rodgers actually articulated well the issues with this case and especially in light of the Supreme Court ruling. The fact is, I actually represented somebody for lying on an application about a year ago. And the difference between that case and Hunter Biden's case is he wasn't because he was an addict, it was because he was out on bond for alleged domestic violence and other things. And so, that was a different type of issue and he ended up being sentenced and served. It was a plea deal of 18 months. That was a different set of issues than it is with Hunter Biden. I think the problem that Republicans have in trying to lift this up and trying to target Hunter Biden is two things. The first thing is that addiction touches nearly every family in this country. And we know Hunter Biden is an addict. And we know these charges are flimsy. And I think that most Americans will see through that. The second thing to charge this president's son with this bad behavior when you know individuals like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr. actually pilfered Washington, D.C., manipulated and grifted their way through D.C. when they were in the White House with no accountability.

BUSH, AND LONGTIME FRIEND AND ADVISER TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL:  Yes, absolutely. I mean, if you're going to go forward with this -- which by the way, I think they should. This is an impeachment inquiry. They're not impeaching Joe Biden yet. And I'm dubious that they ever will, honestly. But this is, sort of, a souped- up investigation beyond what they've already been doing. And it's an investigation for good reason, I might add. If you're going to move forward, you have to do it under pen by evidence, by, you know, we turned over every rock. Here are the documents. Here is the narrative. You know, here are the things that prove the narrative that we have. That's how you win the public opinion fight at the conclusion of an investigation. [06:45:00] Painting a very clear, you know, equation for the American people. A plus B equals C. The way you lose a public opinion fight would be to say, they did it to me. Now, we do it to them. And you know, basically I view politics and government as a mechanism to punish my enemies. That is -- that may thrill some parts of your base. That is not how you're going to win a public opinion fight over this. So, if that becomes the narrative, that will be a problem for the Republicans. If they choose to go down the path of finding actual information and facts and documents, which I think they have so far, that'll be good for them. But it's really hard for the House Republicans to do that because, as we know, Donald Trump sort of sets the public opinion narrative of the Republican Party whenever he opens his mouth.",
