It's continually improving. We're using it. We're studying it. We're trying to get better at it. But, indeed, a skillful radiologist is still your best protection. And the biggest protection is to make sure you get your imaging. About half of the people who should be getting annual mammography are not getting it right now, which is really an awful thing. And we had a big slowdown because of the pandemic, too. So the most important thing is get a mammogram -- that's number one -- and also, go to a good radiologist.",
