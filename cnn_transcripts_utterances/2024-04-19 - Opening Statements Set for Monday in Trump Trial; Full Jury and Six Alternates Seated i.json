Our reporters and experts are all standing by to break down all of today's most important developments and look ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in The Situation Room, the Trump Trial, today.

The judge overseeing Donald Trump's criminal trial says opening statements will begin on Monday, jury selection in the case now officially complete.

Prosecutors want to do that to try and discredit Trump. But his lawyers were saying that some of the events they want bring up, such as the E. Jean Carroll allegations, are attenuated to what is at trial in this case.Now, the judge has said that he would rule on this on Monday, but it also came as Trump's legal team made a last-ditch effort to try to stop this trial before it starts. They went to an appeals court today asking a judge to issue an emergency motion -- to grant their emergency to stop the trial, so they could challenge it over venue, because they have been arguing they've been unable to find a fair and impartial jury in New York. Now, this coming that like within hours of the judge actually empaneling 12 jurors and 6 alternates after they selected the final five alternates in this case, which is expected to kick off on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCANNELL (voice over): Opening statements now plan to start Monday in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial after jury selection concluded, seating12 jurors and six alternates. We have our full panel, that announcement from Judge Juan Merchan after jury selection concluded. 18 Manhattanites, 12 jurors and 6 alternates have now been seated. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long. This is going on for the week, and this will go on for another four to five weeks. That is very unfair.",

      "sentences": "Trump appeared bored much of the trial Day 4 as attorneys on both sides probed potential jurors until they filled the remaining five alternate seats.In court, a handful of prospective jurors became emotional. One was excused after she told the judge she had anxiety and was worried as the trial goes on more people could know she's part of a jury, saying, I might not be able to be completely fair and not emotional, so that concerns me. Another was dismissed after she began crying, saying, I'm sorry. I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either. I don't want you to feel I've wasted anyone's time. This is so much more stressful than I though. A third was sent home after noting she was feeling anxiety and self- doubt, as she listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses. At the defense table, Trump set flipping through papers with charts, photos and graphics. He whispered and passed notes with his lawyers and at some points was hunched over with his elbows on the desk. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger started off questioning potential jurors telling them this is not about Mr. Trump being a former president. It's not about his being a candidate for the presidency. It's only about whether the evidence proves he's guilty. During her presentation, Trump leaned back in his chair, at one point, his eyes closed. Trump's attorney Susan Necheles focused on bias against the former president. She told those in the jury box, you all bring biases, and you particularly bring bias about someone who is as publicly and outspoken as President Trump. There's nobody that doesn't know him in this room. (END VIDEOTAPE) SCANNELL (on camera): Now, Trump's lawyers tried once again to get the prosecutors to tell them who the first witness will be that they'll call in the case. But most prosecutors said they would do is tell him on Sunday. And the prosecutors said, if former president tweets or makes any comments about that witness, it will be the last time they give them a heads-up. Wolf?",

The judge said, we're not pausing this trial.Now, Donald Trump's key argument is he is very politically unpopular in the borough of Manhattan, in New York County. And he is correct, as a factual matter. If we look back at the 2020 election, Donald Trump got a little over 12 percent of the vote in Manhattan. And that's the only borough where we're drawing our jury from. Just by comparison, in Staten Island, Donald Trump got 57 percent of the vote. We go to Queens, he got 27 percent of the vote. He got 22 in Brooklyn, and he got about 16 in the Bronx. That said, this is not the test for moving a case out to another venue. It's not about whether a person's popular or unpopular. It's about whether the person can get a legally fair trial. And the prosecutor's team today pointed to jury selection. They said, look, we just weeded out hundreds of people who said, I'm too biased, I can't sit on this case. And they argued the jury we ended up with was the result of a fair process. Therefore, the case should stay in Manhattan and in Manhattan it shall stay.",

Draw whatever conclusion you will from that. Number four reads the Times, Reuters, BBC, and is a contract specialist. We have another person who is a professional. And then our last two alternate jurors, one of them works for a clothing company, gets her news from Google. The last one is a project manager. Interestingly, her father was convicted of a federal crime. Not clear which way that would push. But, Wolf, it's important to understand, if we do have to dip into the alternates here, alternate one will be the first one in, then number two. So, as we go farther and farther back in these alternates, it becomes less and less likely that any of these folks will ever actually make it onto the jury.",

And here, the argument is really focused on his civil matters. And I think it's going to be difficult for the defense attorneys to keep out a lot of this conduct because there's so much overlap with the case itself.Their strongest argument seems to be, look, there's a different standard, preponderance of the evidence. That is much lower than a criminal court. It could confuse the jury. But, for example, when it came to the Hillary Clinton lawsuit, the judge just said, look, if this isn't Sandoval, if this isn't relevant, I don't know what is, so not a great sign for the defense team.

The defamation is about him lying about E. Jean Carroll. The civil fraud case is about him lying about his financial assets. The frivolous Hillary Clinton lawsuit is about him being reckless with regard to the truth. All of those things, I do think, would bear on a defendant's credibility if they took the stand.",

Only two later changes mind, say, that his lawyers talked him out of it. There's actually only one time that he said he was going to take the stand. He wasn't forced to. It was in the E. Jean Carroll case. He stepped up there. It was very quick, very brief. He just wanted to answer one question and then got off the stand.

This isn't fraud. These aren't falsifying documents. He was, as it says in these documents, doing work for the Trump family, for the Trump Organization. He was doing what he had always done.

But at least out of the gate, I would expect Donald Trump's lawyers to really be hammering on Cohen and basically saying, this man is completely unreliable.

They're seeing pool reports, and they are not going to have the same restrictions that say, we do our limitations. That's going to apply to both jurors, but also attacking Michael Cohen. They are going to work to paint him as a liar.

On the other hand, the probative value is high on some of these things. So, the prior finding that his testimony was not honest before Judge Engoron, that goes directly to credibility and honesty. The same is true of the -- yes, the same is true of the defamation case, because, by definition, you can't commit defamation unless it's false. If it's truthful, it's not defamatory. So, by definition, it's false, so that also goes to honesty, credibility, veracity. So, I expect he will certainly let those two in. Now, this recent lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, it's frivolous. I'm not sure at best it goes to credibility. That one to me is closer, but he'll probably let that into.

And my guess also is that it will be a presentation in front of the client, in front of Donald Trump himself, who will in a position to critique and amend and make suggestions as to what he thinks the opening should be. So, there will be plenty of time over the course of a weekend for the defense team to perfect that opening statement. And it's a very important moment in the case, as Elie just mentioned, the most important thing to drive home and remind the jurors is that, at the end of case, the defense will be asking for a verdict of not guilty. The government has the burden of proof to prove beyond a reasonable doubt unanimously to the satisfaction of all jurors that the defendant is guilty before they can reach a verdict of guilty. And the presumption of innocence is an important legal concept in our judicial system in a criminal case given the fact that potentially imprisonment is on the line, and the seriousness of the case will be something that will be a theme from Todd Blanche. I mean, obviously he'll have a critique of the evidence about what the defense expects to show during the course of trial, but he will remind the jurors that the defendant doesn't have to do anything. He has no burden of proof. He doesn't have present evidence. He doesn't have testify in his own defense, and it remains the obligation of the government to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt.",

In most cases, defendants don't testify and they don't, because of the reasons that I just suggested, that is that the government has the burden of proof, and the defendant doesn't have to do anything.Depending on how the evidence goes in at trial, if the lawyers and client think that it went well and they rely on the presumption of innocence and that fact that government have the burden of proofs, usually it behooves the defendant not to take the stand. That's advice that is often provided by defense counsel to the client, and sometimes they take that advice and sometimes don't. I will say that if Donald Trump decides over the objection of his lawyers to take the stand, my guess is that the lawyers will make a record before the judge out of the presence of the jury that that was the advice that they gave and that the client decided to reject it in favor of testifying in his own defense.",

And at that time, Trump appeared to be leaning back at times. He's closed his eyes. Other times, he was flipping through pieces of paper that didn't have looked like they were the questionnaire. They seemed to have charts or graphs on them. But then when his attorneys began questioning the jurors and asking them specifically what their opinion was of Donald Trump, again, he turned his chair in their direction. He was craning his neck, so he would be able to see them, engaged again at that moment when they were being asked specifically their opinion of him. Wolf?",

Preet, thanks very much for joining us. What's your reaction to Trump's demeanor today and him saying again, he would take the stand in his own defense? PREET BHARARA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Well, taking the second question first, I don't believe it for a minute. He has been talking for years with respect to various investigations of him, including by Special Counsel Bob Mueller, and impeachment inquiries that he would sit and give testimony. He's not going to do it. I think he likes to pretend that he has the fortitude and the courage to do that. I don't think he will. With respect to his demeanor, I will tell you that it may be the case that at rallies and at other political functions, when he acts and overacts and makes faces and does his thing, people enjoy it. But this is not a MAGA rally. It's 12 jurors who are sworn to uphold their oath as jurors, a sacrosanct duty, civic duty, and in my experience, they will be watching the defendant, in this case, Donald Trump, very carefully. And if they detect that the defendant, Donald Trump, is not taking the proceedings seriously or is contemptuous of them or is not comporting himself with respect towards the judge and the others in the room, that adheres to his detriment. And I guarantee you, Todd Blanche, who I know very well, I used to work with him at the Southern District of New York, is mortified that his client is making faces and doing things like that. And, obviously, the jury's going to take into account the evidence as it comes in, but they're human beings.

They've obviously had some exposure to the jury pool because there was a voir dire process. But it's the opening statement where the prosecution gets to set forth the basics of the case and the evidence that they're going to show.And I think they want to resist being overly dramatic. They want to resist being histrionic. They want to be plain and simple, here are the facts, here's what the evidence will show. But they also need to be careful not to overpromise. They have some interesting witnesses that have been mentioned on your show in the last hour, including Michael Cohen. It's unclear, and I probably believe in the minds of the prosecutors, it's unclear how smoothly that will go, both on direct examination, cross-examination, and redirect examination. So, they will want to tell the jury, we have these witnesses coming forward, including Michael Cohen. He's going to tell you this, that, and the other. But they want to understate it a little bit and see how the evidence comes in. They don't want to gild the lily. They don't want to call names. They don't want to be overly aggressive about it. This is a plain and simple case. Here's what we're going to prove. Here's how we're going to prove it. And listen to the instructions of the judge, and use your common sense, and you'll come to the only verdict that is appropriate in this case, and that's guilty. It should be a good, workmanlike opening statement, in my view.",
