And just look at Russian state television, to see the celebration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): What's happening in the U.S. is beneficial for us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Ukraine is losing. Russia is winning. This is it. Their funding and weapons came to an end. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): As of now, well done, Republicans, for standing firm. That's good for us. Even Mitch McConnell, well done, gramps. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Well done, gramps. Russia is winning, you heard them say. But the fact is this, if Washington cuts Ukraine aid off, it's huge, it's absolutely huge for Putin and it will be a huge win for Russia. Zelenskyy could be at the end of the road in that case which is why he is now in Washington to make a desperate plea for aid, as Putin is choosing this moment to flaunt Russia's power today. Putin appearing in frigid zero degree temperatures to show off two new nuclear submarines. You can see them there. As Russian military today launched one of its biggest attacks on Ukraine's capital, there were eight missiles, 18 drones that we're aware of. It was an offensive that follows Russia's plans to include for illegally occupied regions of Ukraine in its next presidential election. I hesitate to use the word. It's an election, of course, that is propaganda, a staged event because any real opposition to Putin has already been destroyed, literally so in some cases. I mean, look at Alexey Navalny. You know that story. We've all been following it so closely here. His spokesperson says the opposition leader is now missing. He failed to show up at a court hearing today. Of course, Navalny has been being held at one of Russia's harshest penal colonies known as IK6. Now, even there, where his lawyers has been able to see him, he's been able at times to send out messages, which include details about his treatment. Most recently his team posted that Navalny is being tortured with his hands twisted behind his back as he is dragged around the prison, and, quote, every day, I undergo investigative procedures. But tonight, Navalny is now missing from IK6. Now, we are aware that he was supposed to be transferred to an even more dangerous facility at some point. They never have an exact time there. The facility known as a special regime penal colony is where he was headed. But all we know tonight is that he missed a court appearance today. His lawyers have been denied visits with him for the past week. And the Russian government will not answer any questions. Navalny's team say they expect checked with a colony that is closest to when he was last being held. That special regime colony known as IK7, but he's not there. Now, he could be another reported 30 special regime colonies, some much farther away. But Russia is not saying. And Navalny's spokesperson is now tonight saying this, the fact that we could not find Alexei is especially alarming because last week he became ill in his cell. He became dizzy and lay down on the floor. The colony staff immediately came running, lowered the bed, laid Alexey down and put him on an IV. Well, in a moment, I'm going to speak to Maria Pevchikh, who is part of Navalny's inner circle. She's going to share the very latest here, some new details with us. But first, Nick Paton Walsh is OUTFRONT live. He is in central Ukraine tonight. Nick, Ukraine's president, of course, is headed to the United States to make that final plea for aid. What is the latest, though, on the ground where you are?",

And, Maria, we all so much appreciate your time tonight. So, we were just talking about those billboards. Do you think Navalny's disappearance has anything to do with them and with Putin's reelection efforts? MARIA PEVCHIKH, HEAD OF INVESTIGATIONS, NAVALNY'S ANTI-CORRUPTION FOUNDATION: I think so. It's very likely scenario if you just look into the timing. Navalny disappeared in Tuesday last week and the official elections were announced on Thursday. And this was also the day when we announced our campaign, our anti-Putin anti-war campaign. And this lovely billboard, they said that is in Russia. They are part of our campaign, if you scan the QR code, you will get to our website, and this was our little fun project. So, of course, Putin wants his reelection to be as smooth as possible. He likes his opponents to be silent. And I think it is possible to connect Navalny's disappearance to that.",

Now, the special counsel really wants to keep Trump's trial date on schedule. And in doing that, he wants to begin that in less than three months. So, that's why he did this incredibly rare thing, going to the court to resolve the issue definitively, skipping their appeals process. Former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb is OUTFRONT now. So, Ty, special counsel bypassing the appeals process, going directly to the Supreme Court, asking it to weigh in on Trump's historic prosecution for the first time.
