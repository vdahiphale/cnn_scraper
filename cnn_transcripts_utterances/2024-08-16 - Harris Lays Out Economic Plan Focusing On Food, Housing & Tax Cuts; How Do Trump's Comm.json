They're asking for a day-to-day solution.What Harris proposed in the last few hours is going to play well with voters, at least initially, because they're looking at their wallets and their pocketbooks and they're saying, I can't afford day-to-day life. Trump would be much better off comparing inflation under his administration versus the Biden/Harris administration. Much better off talking about the cost of a Thanksgiving meal because that's something we can all relate to rather than accusing her of being a communist, which is simply not credible. And this is this is what has happened in the campaign over the last few weeks.

John McCain is the one who immediately comes to mind. What Frank saying there, being loose with talk on this type of stuff, does it -- it's bizarre. Does it have any effect? ERIN PERRINE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, AXIOM STRATEGIES:  It can certainly have an effect on a number of voting blocs, depending who he's directing the attack at and what the attack is. This is the time in the campaign were carefulness is so important. I actually give Kamala Harris and her team big credit for really not putting getting her out there that much, by not having her do interviews, by not having do sit-downs or pressers because right now, she's so nicely controlled as compared to where Donald Trump does these freewheeling pressers. And to his credit, he's not afraid to take a question. He's not afraid to engage with a reporter or push back or talk about any number of topics. But that carefulness with which the Harris campaign is operating right now is why you're seeing that climb in the polls for her is because they're giving her a look and say, this is someone who is measured in her response. And that is the way we like to hear things right now. It's about feelings and right now, the American people are feeling better about her delivery, than about his more bombastic delivery.",

I love pollsters, but they think women care about abortion and veterans get me care about -- I'm not a veteran. I never finished the Boy Scouts. Okay.But I honor those who have served, and Mr. Trump, he refused to visit a cemetery in France where better man than he gave their lives so that he could be free. He refused. He said that John McCain, he was sitting with Frank Luntz when he did it, by the way, that John McCain was not a hero because he had been captured, the POW. Whether this was an insult, I think it's a closer call. It really is. But when you contextualize it with him, he stood in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery over the grave of a man who gave his life for our country. And told the guy's dad, a four-star marine general himself, I don't get it. What was in it for them? And calling are dead -- war dead, suckers and losers. He said, he didn't want wounded worse at his events because he said, I'm quoting him here, no one wants to see that. I mean, that -- so you put it into context and so it may not be that this was a deliberate attack on our veterans.

But there has been more kind of broader concerns. And at a Wyoming retreat at the Four Seasons with top GOP leadership, I heard that peppered into these conversations. There were concerns about whether this moment for Harris is a baked in the race or whether it's a honeymoon period because Republicans are worried and they're worried what that means down-ballot for them.

I let -- let's not forget, Phil, that if you look at Trump record on inflation, it -- when he left office, inflation was one-and-a-half percent and then 18 months later after Biden and Harris spent $5 trillion, we had 9 percent inflation rate.And so, it's obvious that if you've done about inflation on bringing prices down, Trump has a much better record. In fact, the average inflation rate under Trump in his four years in office was 1.9 percent, which is actually below what the Fed wants as a target. Meanwhile, under Harris and Biden, you've had an average inflation rate of six-and-a-half percent. And the reason that's its important by the way, I think the reason that Harris is fighting back on this is because the average American has lost $2,000 of income since Biden came into office.

Matt McCaffrey is a combat veteran who served in Iraq, and in an op-ed for the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\". He wrote, quote, Trump spits in the face of the sacrifice we veterans made, and I cannot believe I brought myself to vote for him in 2016. He goes on to say: I'm not offended by him. I pity him and I don't trust him to be president again. Matt McCaffery joins me now. Matt, I really appreciate your time. You say January 6 was a tipping point for you. You also pointed to Trump saying Senator John McCain, a wounded Vietnam veteran, was not a war hero, calling Americans killed in combat, quote, suckers and losers. And now you can add to it last night. Trump said the civilian Medal of Freedom is better than the military Medal of Honor, because soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor our severely wounded or dead.

Our viewers have sent in on the topic. Sanjay, some folks like Ana in Mexico are asking about the potential for cancer from consumer artificial sweeteners. What does the science say here? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, this is really interesting, Phil. I mean, decades ago, there was some studies that came out looking at artificial sweeteners and finding a connection to cancer, but it was specifically bladder cancer and rats. But that caused all sorts of concerns. Subsequently, there were these studies in humans where this did not pan out. So really, no, no associations between these artificial sweeteners and cancers in humans. I will say one thing just sort of broadly speaking, when you have things that are widely used in this case, artificial sweeteners, there's associations that pop up. They're much more common, lee found in things that are widely used. So, WHO, for example, has been looking at the concerns around aspartame and its called that a potential carcinogen. The FDA disagrees with that, and the six approved artificial sweeteners at the FDA has says that there is no association with cancer. You can see those artificial sweeteners on the screen and it can pay attention to anyone else. But for the most part, they are safe. That is not a concern really.",

Sanjay, Kaye Thomas in Kansas City, look, I think this is a question a lot of people have when it comes to artificial sweeteners, weight gain or weight loss when it comes to using them. Is there a direct connection? How's this work? GUPTAeating calories or I'm meeting very few calories and I'm still gaining weight. How is that possible? Well, it's interesting. I mean, there is something to this. First of all, there was this big study came out of Minnesota, 3,000 people. They followed these people over 20 years. So long term study and they were people who were using artificial sweeteners. And what they found was over that time, they gained more visceral fat, fat in their abdomen versus people who weren't using these things. Part of the issue is this: these artificial sweeteners are really sweet. I don't know if you know this Phil, but if you look at something like Stevia, it can be 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar. And essentially that's sort of playing a trick on your brain. Your brain is thinking, hey, I just got all this sweetness now I'm expecting all the energy, all the calories to come with it, but I didn't get it. So as we've talked about in the past, that's why people will drink diet sodas all day long. And then maybe go get ice cream at night because now they're searching out for those calories. So that's part of the issue, that's part of the trick on the brain that these artificial sweeteners can play. If you're just using these artificial sweeteners, but not changing of the things in your life his style, you may gain weight and you may gain that visceral fat, which is the most, the most troublesome kind of fat. But if you make other changes in your life as well, having normal healthy diet, exercise, all the things that, you know to do, then they can be a really powerful tool, Phil.",
