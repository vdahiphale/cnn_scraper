Expect President Biden to apply pressure to the new House speaker to not only keep the government open but put a bill on the House floor to get military aid to Ukraine.CNN's Dana Bash is joining us right now. You know, the speaker is really in a hard place right now because he's facing a lot of pressures from sort of all sides. Talk a little bit about that. DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Both sides within his very fractured Republican Conference, which is not a new phenomenon. I mean, this is part of the reason why Kevin McCarthy lost his job, and why Mike Johnson is in there to begin with. And what I'm talking about, of course, is the very big difference of opinion over government spending. And that is first and foremost when it comes to the funding of the government generally. And that's what we're looking at with this potential partial government shutdown in the near future -- in the next couple of days, but also about Ukraine. I've been talking to sources on Capitol Hill this morning. And pretty much to a person on both sides of the aisle, Wolf, the feeling is that it's the Democrats who hold much of the leverage because it is a must-pass, it is a political loser for Republicans broadly to be responsible for the government shutting down. And so, the question is, how is Mike Johnson going to get out of this pickle that he is in, particularly when, as you sort of alluded to, Wolf, the conservatives in his caucus are so angry at him for even the notion of continuing the government spending bill without trying to get some kind of give from Democrats. Democrats don't feel that they have to. They -- again --",

And then you go up to March 9, that's government funding for the military, for the -- for the State Department, for other very big parts of the federal government.And yes, it is the constant threat of a shutdown that because of the politics inside the Republican Party in the House. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate are pretty much on the same page about not wanting a shutdown and about how to do it. It's in the House which has been the storyline of government funding, really, since the Tea Party took over. BLITZER: Yes. And you covered Congress for a long time.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, it wasn't clear if this appearance, this deposition by the president's son would ever happen because Hunter Biden and his attorney said he would only testify and answer questions publicly because they were concerned that Republican lawmakers would selectively leaked parts of his testimony. But as a long road to get here, over the past few months, we have seen political sniping. We have seen several unannounced appearances by Hunter Biden on Capitol Hill, threats of contempt, and some hardball negotiation tactics that have resulted in Biden agreeing to do a behind-closed-doors deposition, but not without too significant concessions from Republican lawmakers.First of all, this interview will not be filmed. Even though the interviews with other witnesses related to the Biden investigation have been filmed. Then there's also the issue wolf of the transcript. Now there were some concerns again, that there could be selective leaks if the majority party got the transcript first, but we're told that the transcript is going to be simultaneously released to both parties and then released possibly to the public within 24 hours. Now, both of these concessions are ways to allay those concerns about GOP members. The committee is trying to release certain aspects that would help their narrative. But Hunter Biden's appearance comes as one of the key witnesses -- one of the key allegations in the investigation into the Bidens has been attacked by federal prosecutors who have charged one of the witnesses Alexander Smirnov with lying when he said that Hunter Biden and President Biden received millions of dollars in bribes. Smirnov is now facing federal charges for lying. Now, it's unclear how Republicans or even Hunter Biden's side are going to deal with that particular event. But we'll be watching. It appears Republicans, they're trying to ignore it, move on, and insisting they have uncovered significant information in this investigation.",

JANET MCLAREN BOUKNIGHT, ALABAMA FERTILITY SPECIALISTS: To have to cancel a treatment is just devastating. And you know, our patients trust us to take care of them.

And so, we expect to hear from him a focus on the importance of really solving this from a federal level. We've also heard from, of course, Senator Tammy Duckworth who has introduced legislation trying to protect IVF.
