It's been a bit choppy, but thegains are small, and they seem to be holding as we go into the last hour of trading. The markets and the main event that we are following today. Israel says it's eliminated two more senior Hamas members with fierce fighting underway now throughout Gaza. Jabs and one-liners at the Republican presidential debate. Was it more heat than light? And did anyone make any progress? And Lord Cameron, the British foreign secretary, to US politicians for supplying more funding to Ukraine and prevent a win for Putin. Tonight, in Dubai, live from Dubai on Thursday, December the 7th, I am Richard Quest and in Dubai as elsewhere, of course, I mean business. Good evening. It is a milestone of sorts. It's now two months that the war between Israel and Hamas has been ongoing. And there is no end in sight. The Israeli military is fighting in all areas of Gaza. These images will give you an idea of the scale, the aftermath of a strike in northern Gaza from across the border. And the IDF says it's killed several senior Hamas members, releasing this photo showing 11 members of the northern Gaza brigade -- five of them labeled as eliminated. The Israeli forces also say they killed two other senior members of Hamas's intelligence command center. Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot. The common popular view early in the war was that Israel would keep going for as long as likely and possible before the US/EU or anybody else would force it to back off. But they -- I mean, I don't know whether that holds true still, bearing in mind the intensity and ferocity of the fighting underway.",

Israel will say that they are proportional strikes and that there is an acceptable level of civilian casualties based on the military targets they're going after. International organizations very much disagree with that picture. And we are also watching as the humanitarian situation in southern Gaza is beginning to deteriorate much as it did in the north in terms of hospitals running out of medical supplies, lacking fuels to carry out their operations, humanitarian organizations saying the shelters are overcrowded.

He aired those same grievances you just heard him say there. Yes, it is going to be pretty much the same thing. Yet he is still going to take the stand. He will have to be careful what he does say. That gag order still in place, one that he had violated twice already. Also very important to remember here, Richard, in this case as we are winding up, this is -- the judge has already found that Trump and his codefendants are liable for fraud. He has already listed some of the penalties that he wants the Trumps and the Trump Organization to face. He is deciding how much money in disgorgement he will have to pay back to the state. That is what the attorney general is asking for is $250 million. We will see where the judge lands on that. There is a lot at stake here. And it is certainly winding down. We still probably won't know the answers to those questions for another month when the judge makes a final decision. But like you just said, Monday is going to be another interesting day here in downtown Manhattan.",

It follows Republicans in the U.S.Senate blocking funding for the country as they wanted to tie it to changes in U.S. border policy. Earlier today, Lord Cameron spoke to CNN ahead of his meeting with the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID CAMERON, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY:  I just absolutely know that this money will make a huge difference to a Ukrainian campaign that actually is, in many ways, far more successful than people give them credit for. They have taken back half the land that Russia stole from them. The other night they destroyed 20 percent of Russia's attack helicopters in one night, thanks to American equipment. They have driven the Russian navy back across the Black Sea. They are exporting grain again, so their economy is growing again. This is an investment into their success. And the worst thing in the world will be to allow Putin a win in Ukraine, not just because that would be bad in and of itself but he would be back for more. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Congress is really punting on it, tying it to what is a domestic issue, border security and immigration policy. There is Democratic openness. The president said it himself yesterday, to concessions on immigration policy to get this through. But the two sides remain far enough apart. Then we have Christmas coming. Congress is going to go home next week. So genuine fear that they do not get this done in time. I have spoken to Ukrainians who say they are already rationing weapons in the field.

But I watch this, looking for serious policy points, particularly about international affairs but also about domestic policy. And you don't hear a lot of serious policy points. You hear a lot of volume, a lot of personal attacks. It was Chris Christie on the screen now who made the most spirited argument, that Trump is not fit for office. But a lot of the back and forth just seems disconnected from, at times, the facts. And at times the seriousness of the issues involved. And it remains to be seen whether these debates mean much.
