She is from South Carolina. Her campaign for their part says that they are not focused on racking up endorsements that they claim don't matter. They're focused on a strong showing in New Hampshire. They're not defining exactly what that means.

They want ultimately to trade the 130 photographers (ph), how often do they have both dead and alive for an asymmetrical number of Palestinian prisoners and the cessation of hostilities. Right now, I see no way out of that particular conflict. And as we've talked before, Iran, I think, is benefiting from this regional escalation. And through its proxies is creating the maximum amount of trouble at least, it can while avoiding the direct confrontation with the United States. I think the balancing mechanism here is neither Hezbollah nor Iran nor the United States, and I would add to the list, although there's some who are arguing for preemption against Hezbollah in the north, I don't think the Israelis wanted two front war right now, either.

So for the country, who rely on a more on China's market and we felt more or less negative effect, particular for the country who export a lot of their resources to China such as a minerals or fossil fuels. They will find more lower demand from China. So this is a short term effect. And they use a longer term I think for China of -- that declining work -- declining population, especially, we were accelerated this decline of labor force will directly reduce China's economic growth. It means, I mean to reduce means slow down China's economic growth. So China we will definitely you -- we'll going to say I think, China we work -- we cannot say the high growth rates are like 8 or 10 percent experienced in the last two or three decades. These are high economic gross period. It will most likely be over. The normal, we will we say normally China gross will be around 3 to 5 percent, so this will be normal because the declining labor force will directly reduce economic growth as well, one of the primary factor. So I understand that these are labor productivity will also increase will -- the increase -- [02:25:25] NEWTON: Right.

You've got temperatures in the single digits down to Nashville even in the teens.As far south as Atlanta, daytime highs won't break freezing for many cities like Chicago and Cleveland and St. Louis. Temperatures in the 40s in Atlanta is still a good 10 degrees below average. But look at what happens when you look at the four-day forecast. You start to find the other side of the hill with temperatures starting to warm up. We start out the workweek with temperatures a little bit closer to average. And then look at these numbers in the 60s by Wednesday in Atlanta, some 40s are from D.C. to New York. We'll keep things again on the chilly side on Sunday. You see these temperatures still about 10 degrees below average. We're closer to average by Monday and Tuesday. And then all the oranges start to spread and you're looking at temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average by Wednesday and Thursday nearing 70 degrees from Atlanta and Charlotte. Temperatures again very warm and thawing out for this time of year, I mean look at Atlanta seven-day forecast. Overnight lows below freezing in the 20s over the weekend, and then we'll warm up with daytime highs up around 70 degrees with some showers and storms. That's what's going to pull in some of that warmer air. And even for a place like Cincinnati that won't hit 70. You're still looking at a huge warm up where your overnight lows are in the teens, and then they warm up to the middle 40s which is warmer than your average daytime high which is around 39 degrees for this time of year. Your daytime highs will get near 60, so big thaw, a big warm up for a lot of the U.S. is coming.",

The match would then be restarted after about a 10-minute delay. During the game AC Milan taking to social media and posting on X, there is absolutely no place in our game for racism. We are appalled. We are with you, Mike. And then right after the match which Milan won 3-2 in dramatic fashion, his club sending a picture of their keeper with the words quite simply, and very powerfully, we love you, Mike. The Italian said they are sending a statement condemning any form of racism as well. Saturday was not the first time that Maignan has been racially abused by supporters in Italy as he was targeted by a Juventus fan in September of 2021. Italian football authorities are sure to look at this incident and likely issue out a punishment you would expect in the coming days.
