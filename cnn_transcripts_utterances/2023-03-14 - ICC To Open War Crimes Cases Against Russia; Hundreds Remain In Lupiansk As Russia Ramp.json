Here's CNN's Melissa Bell. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is what the war has left of Kupiansk, a city in eastern Ukraine that the frontline has never strayed far from. The police called by a civilian who found this, a cache of Russian ammunition. Six months after they were driven out, Russian forces now less than five miles away. You hear those explosions, says the police chief, those are rockets flying towards the civilian population. People here are suffering. Yet overcoming the human instinct to run, Liuba and her husband refused to leave. Artillery destroyed their neighbor's house a month ago narrowly missing them. Heard that noise, that noise. The worst she explains is at night, so she and her husband hold hands. It keeps them safe. This is their home, she says, not the Russians. Besides, she says, it's getting warmer now with the rainwater they collect in buckets, they will survive. Kupiansk was one of the most strategic wins of Ukraine's full counter offensives, but at huge cost. Now, with Russian forces closing in again, civilians are being evacuated to safer parts. Residents leaving Kupiansk and its neighboring villages with not much more than their keys, a heavy heart and the hope they will return. Those left surviving as best they can. A city of around 27,000 now reduced to two and a half thousand, according to local police. It's because the main market in the center of Kupiansk has been entirely destroyed, that this makeshift one has been created. The last couple of days we're hearing have been a little bit quieter. And that's why people here are selling what they can, while they can. Of course, we're afraid, says Lida, who says she now knows the sound of artillery, both outgoing and incoming. We won't go anywhere, she explains. We're not rats, we won't abandon our city. If we do, who will take over? The last civilians of Kupiansk determined like some of its buildings, not to be blown away by the shifting winds of this brutal war. CNN, Melissa Bell, Kupiansk. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, according to an update to Britain's Foreign Policy Framework, China poses an epoch defining challenge to the type of international order we, as in the U.K., want to see both in terms of security and values.Well, Russia, according to this review, is the most acute threat to the U.K. security, which is now intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine. You know, this echoes what U.S. intelligence officials told lawmakers last week on Capitol Hill. But in terms of national security challenges, Russia was always sort of considered to be kind of like the weather. And China has seen more like climate change, if you like. But in this review, China is sort of not branded as a threat to the U.K., essentially, for economic reasons. So, can China threaten to close to you know, create global danger and disorders, this report that says and not be considered a threat?",

So we can't see that in danger, just looking purely at the economics of it beyond the larger political and geopolitical question. So, you know, I think it's fair to say that Russia is the most immediate threat and certainly, for the U.K., being in Europe, Russia is the neighborhood threat. But China is a much more powerful country in the long term, and a larger threat in the long run, I think, to the international order, but not as acute and immediate danger as Russia poses.",

So, the U.K. is, is clearly doing more than its bid and the U.K. has also been one of the leading donors to Ukraine. So, I think that the British contribution is a good one. But there's no doubt that British defense capabilities have atrophied over the last several decades. And that needs to be plussed up now that it's clear that we are under a new age of great power conflict and the U.K., the U.S. and other countries, we can no longer size our armed forces by the need to fight counter insurgencies in places like Iraq or Afghanistan, we need to be ready for a great power conflict.",

The leaders of the United States of the U.K. and Australia, they unveiled this very ambitious plan for a new fleet of advanced nuclear powered submarines. And under this plan, this is what we've learned, at the beginning of the next decade, Australia will receive at least three advanced submarines and the first batch it will receive American made Virginia class attack submarines. And then a decade later, it will receive British design submarines containing American technology and then Australia will be able to use that design and manufacture its own advanced submarines without manufacturing to take place in Adelaide. In the meantime, U.S. submarines, including the USS Missouri, would be able to rotate through Australian ports.

We just haven't seen anything like that where portfolio companies are telling their companies to take their money and make the run out. That's kind of unheard of.

Isolated higher amounts are definitely possible, especially along the coastlines, and you'll see that. Highlighted in red, we have that excessive rainfall outlook on Monday overnight on the Northern coastline of California, then stretching down through the Southern foothills of the Sierra Nevada, parts of the San Joaquin Valley and canyon, and then right on down the Southern coastline. We have a higher risk of flooding in elevations that are roughly about 5,000 feet or lower when we tie in the rainfall on top of the melting snow. So there we have the forecast showing you the heavier rain expected to roll through on Tuesday. And, then of course, we ride up into new England, where the Nor'easter is expected to bring in quite a bit of snow through the higher elevations here. And flooding along the coastlines. So there you'll see that heavier snow ramping up on Tuesday afternoon and into the evening, wrapping around. Boston may even see snow. Snowfall totals, expect them over 2 to 3 feet in parts of the Adirondacks, as well as the Catskills. And with that, 2 to 3 inches per hour. And then that's heavy snow with the wind.
