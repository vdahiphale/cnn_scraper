More on today's major Supreme Court decision in minutes. But up first, Donald Trump is preparing literally and seriously you might say, Trump is deep in policy sessions and rehearsing answers, including on questions about the January 6 insurrection. After months of question, Joe Biden's mental fitness, he's suddenly talking up Joe Biden's debate game.

We'll see if he's ready. He has not done a debate during the primary debates. We'll see how he does next week. This all comes of course, as there has been a massive fundraising haul, really up on both sides. But even more so from Trump and the aftermath of his conviction. He is now dwarfing Biden. Remember for months, why Trump has been struggling to keep up with Biden's fundraising machine. It's not a little bit of the other way around in May, the fundraising haul 141 million for Trump compared to 85 million for Biden.

And it's -- look, each side has their billionaires.The question here we need to ask is what are the agendas and interests of those billionaires? A lot of the billionaires supporting Trump are some of these hedge fund magnets, oil and gas magnets. And with Biden, it's Mike Bloomberg, it's Melinda Gates Foundation. The key is, how are they going to spend that money because to MJs point, Biden has already had months that you cannot replace of creating all of these grassroots offices across the country. When we all know that advertising dollars are worth less and less in this fragmented environment. So even if the Trump campaign pours a lot of this into advertising, it's hard to say that this gives him a big advantage or even brings them to parity because of all the investment that's been made already by the Biden campaign.",

The problem is, it's a very confusing vision. I think we're -- we took a mess, and we made it a little bit messier. Now, we've backed away from that hard Bruen stance to some extent, but to exactly what extent who knows. There are a number of other prohibitors in the federal gun law that that will likely come in front of this court in the next few years. If there's anything you could predict, it's maybe those prohibitors that are reliant on a specific condition, like if you're a convicted felon, or if you've renounced your citizenship, those are maybe more likely to pass muster.

And therefore, this indictment should completely be tossed. Now, one of the arguments that we heard today was from Emil Bove, who is one of the former president's lawyers. And he called Jack Smith, essentially a shadow government, which is something that Judge Aileen Cannon push back on. She said, that was a little ominous in terms of language. But the fact that we're having this hearing in the first place is a bit unusual. This is an argument that defendants have made in a number of other special counsels. Notably, Hunter Biden made similar arguments, both to judges in California and in Delaware. Those went nowhere, but Judge Cannon wanted to have a hearing. And right now, they're hearing that -- the court is back in session, where she's allowing outside groups -- left-wing and right-wing groups to make arguments on this issue. These are groups that have nothing to do with this case, but she's allowing them to make those arguments for a couple of hours this afternoon. This is one of three hearings that we have on tap, Manu, for -- after today. On Monday, we're going to have arguments on the special counsels' request for a gag order on the former president. He's been making very, very incendiary remarks about the raid or the search of Mar-a-Lago back in 2022.
