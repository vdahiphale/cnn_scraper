New polling suggests voters aren't pleased with his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. The president is also struggling with a critical block of voters, at least as far as polls show. And that's why we've got CNN's Harry Enten who joins us now.Look, it appears he's struggling based on the polling. But what is the polling at this point? What is the scope of what we're talking about here?",

But take a look at the Biden versus Trump margin among likely registered voters. If you were to just take one of these poll numbers, they're all within the margin of error.But put them together and you get a real clear picture. \"Fox News\", Trump ahead by four. \"NBC News\", Trump ahead by two. Quinnipiac University, Trump ahead by two. Marquette University, Trump ahead by two. There are, in fact, only two incumbents. Two incumbents, historically speaking, who have trailed for re-election at this point over the last 80 years. One of them was Donald Trump in 2020. He didn't go on to win re- election. Joe Biden is the only other one who trailed for re-election at this point. The average incumbent, Omar, leads by about a little bit more than 10 percentage points. So, the fact that you have all of these polls showing Biden behind, that is a very poor sign as we head into Biden's re-election year next year.",

Ronald Reagan held the lead in the polls, but it was maybe, you know, maybe two or five percentage points. He went on to win re-election by nearly 20 percentage points.So, we're looking right now at a case in time, right? We are not at the election. Donald Trump, at this point, trailed Joe Biden by about 10 percentage points in the polls. He only lost by about four and a half. So, the fact that we see these polls right here, it's a slim margin. It's within the margin of error of one particular poll. Altogether, I have very little doubt that Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden. But we're a year out. A lot can change, Omar. JIMENEZ:  And I think hitting that moment in time, the particular moment we're in, we're seeing crises on multiple fronts, including overseas, where the president has had to walk a very fine line here as multiple groups have been pressuring him for a solution here. Can't wait for you to come back. We're going to see how these numbers change potentially, but also as we get towards 2024. Lots to talk about.",

Also new in this, now more than 500 OpenAI staffers are threatening to quit themselves over how this whole thing was handled.CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich and Clare Duffy are here with more on this.

Of course, they're going to say they're doing it in a responsible way, but they want to move quickly here. I think the other big question I have right now is there are many, many third-party companies that were building on top of OpenAI's technology. They were building out AI applications. That work is probably now all on pause because is OpenAI going to continue to exist as a company? And so, what does that mean for all of these third-party developers that we're building AI technology, using OpenAI's infrastructure?
