We've just learned some of what Merrick Garland plans to tell lawmakers accusing him of politicizing the Justice Department. Plus, Israeli's Benjamin Netanyahu about to meet with President Biden in New York. Why no White House invitation. And real life comedy or is it tragedy on Capitol Hill? Closed door GOP spending talks apparently yield nothing, reminding some in the room of a show about nothing. (MUSIC)",

Thank you for getting an EARLY START with us this morning.First up, Attorney General Merrick Garland ready to face critics on Capitol Hill. Republicans accuse his Justice Department of political bias. Garland has appointed special counselors to oversee cases against Hunter Biden and former President Trump. And this, just in to CNN, excerpts of Garland's prepared remarks revealing how he plans to take on his critics today. CNN's Zachary Cohen live here in Washington for us this morning. Zach, very grateful to have you here for this breaking reporting. What are we expecting Garland to say?",

He's going to hit back at his critics and primarily congressional Republicans, house Republicans who have criticized him for just about everything so far in their tenure as majority.And look, he's going to make clear to them that he is not the president's lawyer, he is not Congress' prosecutor. In fact, this one excerpt really hits on me. He says that directly, he says I'm not the president's lawyer, and I will also add that I'm not the Congress' prosecutor. The Justice Department works for the American people. He goes on to say that the Justice Department doesn't do what is politically convenient but rather -- doesn't take orders from the president or Congress or anyone else. They decide who to criminally prosecute. Now, obviously, this comes as the Justice Department has pursued charges against Hunter Biden, the president's son, also charged the former president, Donald Trump and really has been criticized by members of both parties for either moving too slowly or not aggressively enough.",

Democrats like you said do have their criticisms of Merrick Garland. Some feel that, you know, the Justice Department moved too slowly to pursue charges against Donald Trump related to January 6.You know, others feel maybe the Justice Department has overreached in some of its other investigations. But really the thing to watch is going to be how Garland interacts with House Republicans. You know, Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, known, you know, outspoken, has criticized Garland directly. And you can expect a lot of questions about the Hunter Biden investigation from Jim Jordan and other Republicans who really have made that a central theme of this impeachment inquiry that is coming up down the road.",

According to \"The Times\", when Trump learned that federal officials wanted to speak with Michael, he told her, quote, you don't know anything about the boxes, end quote. Those would be the boxes that according to a federal indictment were openly stored, you can see them here in the picture, in Mar-a-Lago, in a ball room and in a bathroom, see the sink there, among other places.

It was very clear from the interview with Wolf Blitzer that Zelenskyy again trying to project some confidence that his counteroffensive has been making progress. He is very positive about it.But when pressed about whether there would be a major breakthrough in the coming months, he says no one knows really. And that really speaks to the difficult dilemma that Zelenskyy has. Now, he's heading to D.C. because on the one hand, he wants to show that the U.S. aid is going somewhere. And it is worth investing in this counteroffensive. But on the other hand, he wants to know that he needs more, he needs more help and that he needs to be continued to be supportive in the coming months if there is to be a breakthrough. And this is really the difficulty he's going to face as he heads to Capitol Hill, with lawmakers there, some debating whether this funding should still be going to Ukraine rather than going to domestic issues. And one of the other thing Zelenskyy mentioned in his interview is how you cannot compare it with the existential threat that Ukraine is suffering from. Have a listen to one of things he told Wolf Blitzer.
