I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York City sitting in for Christian Amanpour. As Russian airstrikes continue to claim lives of innocent civilians in Ukraine, NATO leaders are gearing up to hold their summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. The obvious issue hanging over the meeting is the much-debated topic of Ukraine's succession into the alliance. But speaking exclusively to CNN over the weekend, President Biden poured cold water on that happening anytime soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then, you know, we -- and I mean what I say, we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made, no matter what. If the war is going on, then we're all in the war. You know, we're at a war with Russia, if that were the case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

NATO was principally a defensive alliance, about creating peace and security in Europe.

It's a bit surprising to hear him talk about Turkey and the European Union now, when for so long Turkey was not interested in pursuing a serious application to join the European Union. A lot of things would have to change in Turkey for it to qualify, just purely about economics. So, I think that that is a bit of a surprise now. We'll see whether he is serious about it or not.

We are in favor of the independence of Ukraine, the respect of the severity of Ukraine, due to our own history, but we cannot -- in our constitutional terms, Mexican law, we cannot send weapons, for instance, to Ukraine or impose sanctions against other countries unless this is a decision of the United Nations Security Council, which is not the case, unfortunately.

And when our thermal comfort zones change, we move. And you know, that has profound implications throughout the world, both in the sense -- the obvious sense of people fleeing hot areas and moving into other countries, the whole problems that migration and immigration are causing. We see it on the Mexican border, here in the U.S. We see it, you know, in the Netherlands, in Europe, throughout that.

But I -- and I was also lucky enough to grow up in an environment where education is everything. You know, the lower middle classes and the working classes. And it was very much so an important part of our culture, was to try to get educated to raise your kids to become professionals in that sense. But I didn't go to Oxford or Cambridge, or any of the elite American universities and I had no idea when I started off becoming a journalist that that would be a difficulty, that that would make it a lot harder to get in the door, as you would say. I managed to get my first few jobs in journalism, and I moved to the Middle East. But then the financial crisis happened, and that tended to compound that same problem for young people coming up trying to get into the business, trying to move ahead and find paying work as journalists. It became incredibly difficult because it became apparent that there really is a filter for young people trying to get in where if you haven't gone to an elite college or an elite university or you don't have connections in the industry, it can be extraordinarily difficult.
