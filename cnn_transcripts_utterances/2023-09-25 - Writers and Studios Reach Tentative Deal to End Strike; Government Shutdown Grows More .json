      "sentences": "Well, from one place where there is a tentative deal to one place where we're not sure what on Earth is going to happen, and they only have under six days to figure it out. Obviously, this is the Capitol building and a shutdown at this point is looming.Where is all the pressure at this point? Well, there's just one person you need to pay attention to. That's Speaker Kevin McCarthy. It is within his conference, the intraparty warfare that has been playing out not just for the entirety of Kevin McCarthy's time as speaker, but also in a very acute manner over the course of the last several weeks. So, where do things stand right now? Again, this is the Capitol building. Here's what you need to know. This is the United States Senate over here. The U.S. Senate has been waiting for House Republicans to act so far. They haven't, and so the U.S. Senate on Tuesday is going to start, in a bipartisan way, moving its own short- term bill, a short-term bill that would have bipartisan support, and would need bipartisan support in the House, which is over here. And where are they? Well, they worked throughout the course of the weekend, and we don't actually know where they are at this point in time. They are still trying to find a path forward because while the Senate is operating in a bipartisan way, the House, at least at this point in time, is not, Speaker Kevin McCarthy very aware of the threat to his job if he brings Democrats in. So, what is McCarthy's tentative plan at this point in time? Over the weekend, working through the idea of passing full-year spending bills, at least a package of them initially, that would have steep cuts to where the current baseline is, and in the middle of all that, pass his short-term stopgap bill and add border security to it. Let's be abundantly clear about this. None of this has any pathway forward in a Democratic-led Senate or with a Democrat in the White House. They're just trying to do something to get into negotiations. Again, they only have less than six days. Here's something to step back and keep in mind here. There was a deal that was supposed to make this process a lot easier, the debt limit vote that happened back in May. This passed with significant bipartisan support. It's supposed to set the baseline for the appropriations negotiations. And what I want you to focus on here is this breakdown of the actual vote itself. These are Republican votes in favor of the deal. 149 Republicans voted in favor for the deal that set the groundwork for all of the appropriations process going forward. About two weeks later, Speaker Kevin McCarthy, with pressure from conservatives, walked away from that baseline. Here's the problem. Senators were still operating on that baseline. Democrats say that's the deal. Stick to that baseline. The White House does as well. Apparently, Republicans do not. And that is because hardliners, House Freedom Caucus members have asked for steeper cuts, saying that was the reason that they allowed Speaker McCarthy to become Speaker on the 15th vote back in January in the first place. So, they've walked away from a deal that existed entirely. Here's the other problem McCarthy has. While he's getting pressure from conservatives and hardliners, a handful of members won't even vote to move forward on procedural process. These are 18 members of the House Republican Conference that come from districts that President Biden won by a sizable margin. Of these 18 members, all but one, George Santos, supported that debt limit vote. All but one basically supported right now a structure that House Republicans have walked away from. Those are the members that gave Kevin McCarthy the speakership and the majority. Those are the members he needs to protect. One thing to keep a very close eye on as this week goes forward, that's the moderates right here, Don Bacon, Brian Fitzpatrick, Dusty Johnson, David Valadao. There's a couple more as well, members of the bipartisan group, the Problem Solvers, they are working to find some type of pathway forward. But as it currently stands, no pathway forward for McCarthy if he wants to go Republican only. He's going to need Democrats eventually. The question right now is, when is he going to come to that conclusion? Poppy?",

Let's take a look at some of the actual consequences to this debate on Capitol Hill. First, air travel. During the 2019 shutdown, hundreds of TSA officers called out of work, many of them, to find other ways to make money. The White House now warning there could be potentially a significant delay and longer wait times. What about public health and safety? The White House says the FDA, quote, could be forced to delay food safety inspections. There could also be risks to drinking water, as the EPA rolls back most of its inspection activity at facilities. Also food assistance, the Department of Agriculture says people enrolled in SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, will receive benefits through October. But what happens after that? Very unknown.
