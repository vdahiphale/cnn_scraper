In Damascus, university students toppled a statue of late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, the father of the ousted leader, before standing on it and dragging it through the street. The statue had been standing at the university for decades.Meantime, Christians in the Syrian capital attended mass on Sunday expressing hope that a new government would respect the rights of minorities in the country, though many said the future was still uncertain. And a return to normalcy for students in Damascus as schools reopen their doors, students and school faculty are expressing optimism for the future. The world is watching to see if Syria's new government can stabilize the country and move toward a smooth transition. And in the hours ahead, Syria will be on the agenda at an E.U. Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels. The U.N. Special envoy for Syria, who met with the new caretaker government on Sunday, says he supports the lifting of sanctions on leading rebel group HTS. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEIR PERDERSEN, U.N. ENVOY TO SYRIA: We need to see that this is fixed quickly. We will hopefully see a quick end to sanctions so that we can see really rallying around, building up Syria again. And then my last point, we need to see, of course, justice and accountability for crimes, and we need to make sure that goes through a credible justice system and that we don't see any river. The Israeli government has approved a plan to expand settlements in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that Israel has occupied for nearly 60 years. The plan put forward by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is drawing condemnation from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who say the move could derail Syria's chances of restoring stability and consider it a violation of international law. The Israeli leader had this message about Syria. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have no interest in a conflict with Syria. We will determine Israel's policy towards Syria according to the emerging reality on the ground. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But how difficult is the task ahead for this new Syrian government?AL-ASSIL: That's a great question, because the task is really difficult. The state virtually has collapsed across Syria and there is high level of poverty across the country. People just need some security, electricity and water, and they just want to be able to send their kids to schools these days. However, there are also other challenges on the political level. What you just said, as a transitional government, many people now are starting to question that. How transitional is it? Is there really a roadmap? There hasn't been real talks about a roadmap to see some mileage milestones or some dates of what will happen next and if there is -- if there will be any sort of a national dialogue to probably include other political parties and other political actors in this government.",

Special envoy for Syria says he supports the lifting of sanctions against the leading rebel group HTS. How critical is that these sanctions are lifted, and how likely is it that will happen? AL-ASSIL: It's very crucial for the country because there is no way for Syria to move ahead and to move forward and to stabilize itself without support from the international community. And for that support to arrive in Syria, sanctions need to be lifted. But we're not only talking about sanctions, we're also talking about delisting Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham from the terrorist list. And now the talks are on these two paths about lifting the sanctions and also about delisting the Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham from the terrorist list so they can talk to other international actors. But of course, there are different conditions, including being inclusive to other actors inside Syria and including them in this political moment.",

The rebel group HTS has clarified that they want to ensure peaceful relations with their regional neighbors, and they are committed to Syrian territorial integrity. But what about this issue of an inclusive government? How big a challenge will that be? And could the lifting of sanctions be leveraged here to get them to be more inclusive?AL-ASSIL: Right, so the international talks have focused on these two levels. One of them is about the foreign affairs of the new Syrian government. And here we can see some alignment between Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and the international community that they do want to have peaceful relations with their neighbors and the world. But when it comes to the domestic issues and how they are running the current government, we see some divergence here. We haven't heard much talks about any roadmap for elections in the future or for launching some national dialogue inside Syria where other political actors are welcome to come to Damascus and participate in these talks or any sort of laws to establish political parties inside the country. So there are certainly priorities when it comes to security and economic development. But also economy wasn't the only problem inside Syria. The political environment was a huge challenge. And to be able to include different actors inside Syria so they feel they are part of this new system is totally crucial, especially for a government that does not have a strong army. And its legitimacy only comes from what we can call a revolutionary legitimacy that sooner or later will be drained and people will ask for different type of legitimacy that's built on including other actors on the ground.",

And also if we take a step back and we look at the social contract, many people inside Syria, even if they come from an ethnic or religious majority, they don't necessarily feel included in this new social contract. And that's why a national dialogue is extremely important, because there is a collapse of the social contract inside Syria and there is a need to regenerate that by launching these political tracks of Syrians probably meeting each other for the first time in a country that has been divided for over a decade.",

And there is probably less room for officials to break from Trump and his agenda without facing some consequence.Now, you know, senators tend to win their primaries, but they don't like to have them in the first place. The real threat, I think, is that Trump, in fact, I think many of these senators recognize that if it came down to it, even within their own state, more Republican voters are probably aligned with Trump than with them if there is an argument. So all of them, I think, recognize they have limited leeway here. Not zero, but limited.",

The fact that Mike Gaetz got out before anyone had to cast a vote against him kind of, you know, allowed that, didn't take one off the board for them. And I think that Republican senators will be more comfortable voting against nominees they can criticize from the right, like Tulsi Gabbard, Potentially, maybe even RFK Jr. given that anti-abortion groups are still uneasy about him.

I mean, he started off in 2016 with the strongest performance among white voters without a college education since Reagan. I believe in '84.In 2020, he made some gains among non-white working class voters. And in this election he made further gains among non-white working class voters. And in that sense, Romney is right. The piece he didn't mention is that there is also, you know, a thin layer of super wealthy, really the top, you know, 1/10 of 1 percent, like Elon Musk, like many of the Wall Street and Silicon Valley titans who allied with Trump and who have enormous impact over his agenda. And so there is this still this conflict. I mean, Trump did improve among working class voters, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and were hurt more than upper middle class voters by the inflation of the last few years. They hired him to do one job, above all, get their cost of living under control. But it's very unclear whether his agenda will really move in that direction. In fact, most economists have looked at it think the combination of big tariffs, mass deportation and large tax cuts aimed at the top are more likely to rekindle than to suppress inflation. So I think the question of how lasting these gains are is very much tied to the actual performance over the next four years just as Biden's gains in 2020 were washed out by discontent over his actual performance over the previous over the last four years.",

We're looking at a level four out of five when it comes to impact for the atmospheric river, meaning it could be potentially hazardous. Some of that rain will be beneficial, but with the amount of rain coming in a short amount of time, we could be looking at some hazardous conditions. I mean, look at how healthy these rain chances stay as we go into the workweek, especially Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. For a place like Eugene, Oregon, two to four inches of rain is likely some isolated totals up to six inches possible. You can see all that moisture start to move in as we go into the workweek starting on Monday. Rain and snow from Washington down towards Oregon and northern California. Even as that clears, another round comes in going into Tuesday as the atmospheric river continues to pump in some of that moisture. Overall, rain totals will be about two to four inches, some of those totals up to six inches are possible. And we're going to add to the snow depth in the mountains as well another one to two feet of snow possible on top of what they already got. Winds will also be gusty as well.
