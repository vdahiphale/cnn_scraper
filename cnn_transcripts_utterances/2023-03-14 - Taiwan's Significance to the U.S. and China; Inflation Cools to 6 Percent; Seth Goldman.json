However, this is what DeSantis is saying now as a 2024 hopeful. But back in 2015, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea, DeSantis was a congressman, this is what he said then talking about President Obama. Quote, we, in the Congress, have been urging the president to provide arms to Ukraine. They want to fight their good fight. They're not asking for us to fight for them. And the president has steadfastly refused. And I think that's a mistake. As he is now saying, F-16s, long-range missiles should not be going to Ukraine.This really is one of the biggest points of the 2024 race. This is a very big deal that he came out and said this.",

So, we are seeing the 2024 race shape up, even though Ron DeSantis hasn't officially thrown his hat into the ring.

If that happens, the U.S. has vowed to fight in Taiwan's defense.

China going to the Middle East, which traditionally has been a stronghold of U.S. diplomacy, and trying to broker a deal - they're not the first, obviously, trying to broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran.But it is a message to the United States, the fact that they were specific and clear that this -- none of the language would be in English when they were doing these negotiations. So that just goes to show that in and of itself China's rising influence whether the negotiations will be successful. You know, it's also happening in Africa, where China is making economic investments. So, it's economic and diplomatic power and military power. And you have the U.S. and its allies and you have China and Russia and other authoritarian countries really gearing up here for this showdown, both sides trying to outmatch the other.
