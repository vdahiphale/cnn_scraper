But they have been processed by Border Patrol agents, and they have permission to move elsewhere in the country while they await their immigration proceedings. All of this is playing out on the streets because there's so much pressure on the bus system and the transportation system that it's taking many of these people several days to get their tickets and to get them moving. That is one of the things that local officials are most concerned about here as we are just days away from the expected lifting of the Title 42 public health rule, which allows Customs and Border Protection officials to quickly expel migrants because of public health reasons. If that rule goes away on Wednesday, as it is expected to happen, that is creating a pressure on this area where they expect thousands more to be coming. Right now, local officials say they've been seeing about two to 25, 2,000 to 2,500 people a day. They expect that number to jump to 4,000 to 5,000 people a day in the weeks ahead. They say the number-one challenge and the best way of alleviating the pressure on a lot of these border communities is getting people moving through these border communities as quickly as possible. To bigger transportation hubs in like Phoenix, Denver, Dallas, and Houston where they can then get other transportation to their final destinations. That is the one thing they're focused on. That is the one thing they believe will help them get through this situation as best as possible. And avert what they hope does not become a humanitarian crisis and disaster here on the streets of the city -- Pamela? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The gate number would not show up on the board. And I went to the ticket agent and said, is the gate number going to show up or is this flight canceled? And she said, oh, no, keep watching, it will be up there. And the plane was due to leave at 8:55. By 8:00 p.m., we finally got a gate number. But then about 15 minutes later, I started hearing a lot of commotion, people yelling in Spanish, you know, up by the ticket counter. So I went up there to find out what was going on. And the police said you have to leave. [20:05:04] And we were just astounded. We said what's going on? They said the airport is closed. All the flights are canceled. You have to leave. And at the end of a trip, normally you don't have much of the currency left because you try to -- you know, so I had very little Solace left. And I contacted a few people in the U.S., family members, you know, to get their opinion on what to do. And I also called the only two people that I knew, my two guides that I had done tours with, to find out what should I do. They said go to the police line outside the airport and have them get you a taxi. So we found a taxi and I didn't have Solace to pay him. Thank goodness he accepted U.S. dollars. Went back to the hotel where we were originally staying. Thank goodness they had room here. We contacted the U.S. embassy to get directions on what to do the next day. And they said to shelter in place. Do not travel. They said do not go on the roads. It's much too dangerous. And we saw from the local news why it's so dangerous. The roadblocks have trees, tires, fires. They'll come after you. It's very, very dangerous. So we've been sheltering in place. My sister contacted all the Arizona representatives there, Kyrsten Sinema, Mark Kelly, Ruben Gallego, and they were all very communicative, and they've been keeping track of us. I've watched the last interview that you had with the woman that had to get out of Machu Picchu and how hard it was to get the plane flights. I have had just a terrible time. But I spent hours online and I finally got a flight for Sunday. And I heard, like she did, that the protests are going to start back up on Monday. So we are crossing our fingers and praying we get out safely tomorrow night. There shouldn't be any more protests this weekend. So we'll see what happens.",

Because today, this weekend, it seemed like things are getting a little bit back to normal. But you could hear the protests outside. You could see that the city was empty.

Former President Trump will likely learn Monday if the January 6th Select Committee thinks that he should be charged with any crimes. A CNN source says that he is facing at least three criminal referrals when the panel meets for the last time publicly. We're told they would be for obstruction of an official proceedings, conspiracy to defraud the federal government and insurrection. It's the DOJ's call whether to return those referrals into actual charges. I talked to a former federal prosecutor about this.

Huge amounts of evidence, huge amount of witnesses that have been identified. I think it's the detail that accompanies the referrals themselves and the report that will give a road map for DOJ.

Astronomical winter begins this week, and it is certainly going to feel like it for much of the country, especially over the next week.You're really going to start to see that cold air set in place across the northern plains before spreading elsewhere in the coming days. Now, overnight tonight, we really start to see that surge of cold air. By Sunday morning, take a look at this, the feels-like temperature in Bismarck, minus 13, Fargo, minus 23. It's actually going to get even colder than that in the coming days. Take Fargo, for example, the high temperature on Sunday topping out at only four degrees. Once we get to Tuesday, that high temperature will likely only make it to minus six. When you factor in the wind, that windchill is probably going to feel a lot more like say minus 25 to minus 30 in that early morning hour. But even though it's starting here, you're really going to see a lot of that cold air spread out across much of the eastern half of the country over the next five to seven days. In all, roughly 80 percent of the U.S. population is going to be dealing with temperatures at or below the freezing mark at some point in the next several days. It starts in the Midwest, but then begins to spread. So even a city like Atlanta, for example, will get that cold air. It's just going to be later in the week. High temperature in Atlanta on Thursday, 52 degrees. By the time we get to Friday, we'll barely make it into the upper 20s for a high temperature. And the thing is, even as we edge closer to the Christmas weekend, these temperatures are expected to stay well below average. So, again, Pamela, many may hope for a white Christmas.

I know for a fact that we aren't all out fly fishing, because we have, you know, enough in our pension plan. What's really happening is people augment that once they leave the service, that if they make it all the way to a military career, they'll augment that with other jobs they'll have secondary even third careers. And it's a, you know, a different thing. But that shouldn't dissuade anybody from coming into the American military. There are certain benefits there.

I saw it in IMAX, you know, in the Dolby Theater, which is really where James Cameron is pushing people to see this film. And it's really incredible. But like I said, you have to really find the time to see that.I want to talk to you about the numbers. So, Avatar: The Way of Water is coming in under its projections. Opening day, 53 million, like you said. It's expected to make between 130 to 150 million this weekend. I want to put that into perspective for all the viewers at home. That's less than Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That's less than Black Panther: Wakanda forever, Thor: Love and Thunder. Now, these are opening weekend movies that I'm naming. But I have been talking to experts in this industry and the film industry who are saying that this is going to be a slow burn. We can't really judge Avatar: The Way of Water's success until after Christmas weekend or after New Year's weekend, because people are actually going to be setting aside the time to see the movie. And, you know, Cameron has been really pushing for people, like I said, to see the movie in IMAX, in 3D in these Dolby theaters. And to also put this into perspective. There are only 157 of those auditoriums in the U.S. in order to see Dolby 3D. So that's another part of the problem. There's a high demand and a low supply, Pamela.",

And I don't want to just try to direct the president or the administration to what to do with reform because I couldn't give you the answers. But we are working on probation and parole because I was affected by it. And I'm from a community where I see mothers and fathers leading kids all the time in their house, because they may have smoked marijuana or got addicted to a Percocet or went to cross the Philadelphia New Jersey state line to take their children to football practice.

But of course, with a lot of followers, even on Instagram and on Facebook, but the most important followers were those scientists that have been tracking him for years. And they say that about a month ago, they started to see different changes in his behavior. He was going deeper into the urban areas he was chasing and attacking dogs, even some that were on a leash. So people were getting a little bit worried. They love him but, of course, it was getting a little bit dangerous.And those experts said that they believed that he was in distress. So they were able to capture him and have him go through a medical evaluation. Unfortunately, they thought he had been hit by a car. And they say that medical evaluation did show that he had trauma to his head, to an eye, to some of his organs. And then they also said they found pre-existing illnesses. He had kidney disease, he had a skin infection. And so all of these things were taken into consideration. And that's when they decided to put him down. Some of the experts that have been tracking him though they spoke out this week and said that his data will live on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
