Many have also been hospitalized with heat stroke and other heat-related conditions. CNN Scott McLean joins us now with an update. And, Scott, officials are fearing that the death toll could climb even higher. And you have some disturbing images of what it looks like on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. There's new images that were getting in that show bodies lying on the ground, Boris, and these Hajj pilgrims walking past them.And we're talking about a huge number of people who have died, at least in part, because of the very extreme heat. Obviously, the Saudi Arabian desert is hot at any time of year, but it is especially hot, unseasonably hot even for right now. We're talking, as you mentioned, temperatures that actually, on Monday, briefly reached 125 degrees Fahrenheit. And even at nighttime, we're talking about lows of 87 degrees. And look, a million and a half people or so, officially, are going to this year's Hajj. We're talking about something that's an obligation for Muslims under Islam to do this, at least once in their life, at least if they're financially or physically able to. And so there's not going to be much that will stop people from doing what they feel is their religious obligation. Obviously, Saudi officials have tried to do what they can to try to accommodate people with water stations and misting systems, things like that. But we're talking about something that is, by and large, outdoors and there's some physicality to it as well as people walk from the various sites involved. But you mentioned that the numbers are likely to rise and that is because, well, for a few reasons, some people that are hospitalized may yet still die. Some are unaccounted for. And some are not registered as official pilgrims, which may also explain some of the discrepancy. We've been able to confirm around 500 or so people had been killed. But there are reports that suggest the true number is over 1,000. Saudi Arabia, because of events like what happened in 2015 where there was a deadly stampede, more than 2,000 people killed, have tried to count the number of pilgrims coming in, and given caps of different countries. But look, in this day and age, to get to Saudi Arabia, you don't need a special Hajj visa. You can go there on a tourist visa. And it seems a lot of these people are doing that. It just doesn't seem like perhaps you have access to all of the amenities that the official pilgrims have. Like, for instance, an air- conditioned tent in the desert. You actually have countries like Jordan and Egypt now actually investigating some of the companies that help get some of these pilgrims to Saudi Arabia through these unofficial routes -- Boris?",

And the third, with insults, violence and death threats.And this is a probe that is also going to look into the question of whether the fact that the girl was Jewish contributed to her being attacked. And it comes as you say, at a time when France has been grappling with rising anti-Semitism. And the figures are pretty stark. When you look at 2022 to 2023, there was a rise of 284 percent in the number of anti-Semitic incidents recorded in France. And what we've seen as a result of the war in Gaza -- this is a country, remember, that, in Europe, has both the largest Jewish population in Europe and France, and the largest Muslim population in France. And the tensions in the Middle East have really been exacerbated here. And seeing a sharp rise. Again, in the first few months of 2024, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose threefold, Brianna, compared to just a year before.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Boris. This is very much an ongoing situation. These back-to-back cyberattacks on CDK Global are causing disruptions across North America because this company's software powers thousands of auto dealers.Now some of those auto dealers are being forced to resort to pen and pad to process sales and repairs. And listen, the timing here is awful, right? This is the first official weekend of summer. Normally, a lot of these auto dealers would be packed with car buyers. Now some of those car buyers are going to face delays. Some of the dealerships are going to lose some business. So here's what happened. CDK suffered a cyber incident. They announced that on Wednesday. They were able to bring their systems back online. But then they suffered a second cyber incident that evening. Now, the company is telling dealers that systems could be down for several days. That's according to two sources briefed on the situation. Here's why this is such a big deal. CDK powers about 15,000 auto dealers in the United States and Canada. They rely on this company's software to process sales and repairs and other critical functions. One executive from a Maryland dealership told CNN that this is a major hassle. And he worries that customers are going to go across the street to other dealerships that are not having the same trouble. CDK put out a statement where they say they're working with third- party experts to try to assess the impact. They say, quote, \"We've remained vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual, as quickly as possible.\" I know there's a lot of car buyers and dealers that are hoping that's going to get back to normal very soon. And listen, at the end of the day, this is another reminder of how disruptive and costly these cyber incidents can be. I mean, here you have a situation where thousands of auto dealers, countless car buyers are being impacted by a cyberattack on a company that those of us outside of the auto industry had never even heard of -- Boris?",

And now most of the pieces of the space shuttle, you need, OK? So there aren't too many spare parts like (INAUDIBLE). There's nothing. So what -- we got pictures of it. And what NASA is really good at is, once they have a problem, to work and figure out what's going on, they have a team of incredibly smart people that can really dive in and do a lot of testing and a lot of analysis and figure out what's wrong. They -- within an hour, they knew exactly what that piece was that floated away from the space shuttle. It turned out to be one of the very few things you don't need. And we came home and everything was fine. They're working really hard diagnosing what's wrong with Starliner right now. They've got some good test results. And they know what's happening. They're not -- they would like more data. Engineers always want more data. And they want to know not only what is going wrong, but why, what is causing it to happen. And so there's still a little bit of concern. But again, everything right now is, with the exception of one, out of 28 thrusters is functioning just fine.",

There's always one more picture you want to take or.And also, they're helping out with the operation of the space station. So the space station program is pretty happy to have the extra hands on deck. So there's some silver lining. And at the same time, Boeing is happy and NASA is happy because, actually, with a longer period of time up there, they are getting more data from this Starliner. Which is -- this is a test flight. So they're getting more and more information the longer it's up there. Not only on the thrusters, but how the electrical power system is working and all the other systems on board. So there is a silver lining to this. But whatever there's something questionable about your vehicle, that is in the back of your mind. And Suni and Butch are both professionals, are both test pilots. They know how to compartmentalize that. And there'll be fine. But it's there. And we're all aware of that.",
