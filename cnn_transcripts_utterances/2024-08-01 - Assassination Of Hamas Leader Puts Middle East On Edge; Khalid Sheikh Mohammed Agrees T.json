There have also been protests across the region after his death, which has been attributed to an Israeli airstrike. According to a spokesman for Hamas, Haniyeh was killed in a direct airstrike in his room inside a government guesthouse in the capital. Israel has not claimed responsibility. But the New York Times quoting already and sources reports Iran's Supreme Leader has ordered a direct strike on Israel in retaliation. And his assassination appears to be a stunning security failure by Iran and has triggered fears of greater turmoil across the region. There already been protests in a number of cities in the Middle East. And then his assassination could also derail efforts for a ceasefire and hostage relief deal in Gaza. Haniyeh was a key player in those negotiations led by Qatar and Egypt. And Qatar's prime minister has asked how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not mention Haniyeh on Wednesday featuring a national address, talked about Israel delivering a crushing blow to its enemies, and says he won't give into calls to end the war in Gaza. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following developments live for us from London. She joins us now this early hour. So Salma, we had these protests, sorry, mourners rather gathering on the streets of Tehran. This seems to be a fairly large turnout for her dear which says I guess what a lot about the mass popularity in Iran. I mean, it does seem, yes, he's lived in Gaza and yet we're having this huge turnout in Tehran.",

But it is also a test of the relationship between Israel and the US. Already strained by the ongoing war in Gaza. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It's something we were not aware of or involved in. SCIUTTO (voice-over): Close observers of the region see an Israeli leader who now feels unencumbered by a U.S. president. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We're prepared for any scenario and will stand united and determined against any threat. SCIUTTO (voice-over): Who's viewed in the region as a lame duck following his withdrawal from the presidential race. In the near term, the strike very likely disrupts the tenuous negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages. President Biden has made completing the deal a central feature of his final months in office. More broadly in ordering assassination strikes abroad, the Israeli leader is showing his willingness to risk broadening the war. A senior U.S. official told me the Biden administration views such a risk as limited. The assessment is it none of the players Israel, Iran or its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas truly want a regional war. On Wednesday, White House senior adviser John Kirby downplayed escalation fears.",

As each side retaliates against the other and increasingly aggressive ways the danger of escalation grows. To that point today, a senior Iranian official tweeted, undoubtedly the Israeli occupying regime will pay a heavy price. Enter one final variable to the calculus Benjamin Netanyahu himself. Even some Israelis questioned whether he wants to extend the fighting to delay any political reckoning for the October 7 attacks at home. Jonathan Dekel-Chen's 35-year old son was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, he says Hamas and the Israeli leaders don't truly want peace and the stalling only helps Netanyahu's political future.

They all want a ceasefire, their ceasefire idea is that Israel stops, Israel does not attack them, that we all allow safe havens for terrorists. And Ismail Haniyeh was the same on that one. Was he more willing for them to stop their immediate fighting right now, perhaps, but it wasn't like he was saying, OK, stop everything, get back the hostages, which is what they should have done in the first place.

And this is a case that stretches out over more than two decades. KSM was captured in Pakistan in 2003, along with several co- defendants, and then held in CIA black sites, and then in Guantanamo Bay for years. He was arraigned and charged back in 2008, with a number of charges, including conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, and much more. But from that point on, the case itself began to drag out, first in a debate over whether it should be a military trial or in U.S. civilian courts, and then questions about torture that Muhammad faced as he was held at those CIA secret prisons in the early 2000s. And whether evidence obtained during that time would be admissible in court. All of that delayed the trial that was finally set to begin in 2021, before it was delayed, once again with the resignation of two judges, and then the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. And that brings us to where we are now. For two years now the U.S. has been pursuing the possibility of a plea deal with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his two co-defendants that announcement coming now. The plea deal itself allows the U.S. to avoid what would have been a very long and complicated death penalty trial. And it makes sure that KSM will remain in prison for the rest of his life. One open question is where will he serve out that term along with his co-defendants. It has been a major point of the Biden administration to try to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility they have repatriated over the past several years, a number of the detainees held there, but there are still dozens left and that process seems to be a long way out. So at least for now, it seems a possibility that KSM will remain at that facility. But long term that's certainly one question we'll look to have answered. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Iran's duty is to avenge Haniyeh's death because he was killed whilst on Iranian soil. Haniyeh is expected to be buried in Doha, Qatar on Friday. The targeted strike on Haniyeh has caused tremendous outrage with mass protests across the region. A Hamas spokesperson says Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room of a government guest house where he was staying in Tehran. He was visiting for the inauguration of the new president. Hamas vowed Israel would pay the price calling it a heinous crime. Israel though has not directly claimed responsibility for the strike, but the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu certainly alluded to it on Wednesday.
