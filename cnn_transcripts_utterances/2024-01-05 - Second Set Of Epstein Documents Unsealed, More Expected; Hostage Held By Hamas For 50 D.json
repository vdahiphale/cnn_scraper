PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHORrevelations from the latest batch of unsealed documents connected to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Now, according to these documents, Epstein and Virginia Roberts Guiffre allege that former President Bill Clinton pressured Vanity Fair not to cover the allegations about Epstein. In one unsealed email from 2011, from a reporter from the U.K. publication Mail on Sunday, Guiffre expressed her concerns about sharing the story with the publication, writing, quote, \"Considering that B. Clinton walked into Vanity Fair and threatened them not to write sex-trafficking articles about his good friend J.E.\" -- Jeffrey Epstein.",

A Clinton spokesman told CNN they had no new comment about the allegations. Thursday's release follows hundreds of pages of documents unsealed on Wednesday with more expected in the coming weeks. Joining us now is investigative journalist Vicky Ward. She was one of the first reporters to investigate Epstein and spoke with him for many hours. She was contributing editor to Vanity Fair for 11 years. So, first, this allegation -- Graydon Carter just saying this did not happen. Can you give us some context here? VICKY WARD, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, HOST AND CO-PRODUCER OF DOCUSERIES \"CHASING GHISLAINE\", FORMER VANITY FAIR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR:  Sure. I never heard that happened. What I wonder is if Virginia Roberts is hearing gossip and getting it slightly wrong.

I did hear about the story of two sisters, Maria and Annie Farmer, and they were on the record detailing to me at the time the abuse they had suffered at the hands of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. When Jeffrey Epstein realized that I was in possession of their allegations he appeared in the offices of Vanity Fair. I knew about this because the fact-checker who was fact-checking my piece at the time sent me an email saying oh my God, he's standing here in the office. And I've said before that the (INAUDIBLE) allegations were suddenly cut from the piece that was ultimately published. I suspect -- you know, I never met Virginia Giuffre until 2019, long after these papers were filed. I never spoke to her. I didn't know of her existence. I wish that I had because, in fact, she was escaping from Jeffrey Epstein's clutches at the exact time that I was trying to deal with him and write this profile. But I suspect that some version of the story I've just told you probably reached its way to her and that might be what she's referring to.",

I think he said there were more than 30 in that house in Palm Beach, and that was going on in real-time as I was dealing with Jeffrey Epstein. And that is really a very frustrating and horrible thing to feel as the journalist who was assigned to him at the time. I -- you know, I was also assigned to look at how this man got his money and why all these powerful bold-faced names that we're reading about now were drawn to him. And I think that these papers don't really explain that. They -- you know, Virginia Roberts does allege that she was sent out to sleep with -- you know, she says Prince Andrew, and she names other men. But the other women really took the depositions on the whole. They talk about the fact that they were bringing in each other to sleep with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, which still leaves this question. Why were all these scientists -- why were, later on, names we know -- Bill Gates -- why were these academics -- what did Jeffrey Epstein have that attracted them all to him?
