      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is a stock that is basically in freefall mode right now. Trump Media was trading above 50 bucks as recently as May 30. Of course, that's the day that Donald Trump was convicted here in New York.And within seconds of that conviction, we saw the stock price plunge. And it's just snowballed. Since then, this company has now lost over half of its value in just three weeks. It's staggering losses. The spark for this week's sell-off was the fact that regulators gave a green light to investors who owned what's known as warrants to buy extra stock in this company. It's a move that could allow Trump Media to raise extra money, but it's also going to water down existing shareholders. And that has spooked some investors. I don't want to sign too much logic here though, to the stock moves. Because remember, experts have said that Trump Media is basically a meme stock. It is trading on hype and momentum, not fundamentals. It's valued in the billions of dollars, even though it generates very little revenue. Now, no matter the cause, this sell-off has wiped out a huge chunk of the value of the stock of the company's chairman and leading shareholder Donald Trump. This stake was worth about six billion dollars as recently as three weeks ago. Now, it's down to around three billion dollars. And this selling may not be done. I spoke to Jay Ritter. He's a finance professor at the University of Florida. He's been studying capital markets for 40 years. And he said, despite this sell-off, this stock is still \"wildly overpriced.\" Remember, its main product is the conservative social network, Truth Social. It's a very tiny player in social media. It is dwarfed in terms of the number of users by its rivals, including Reddit, Elon Musk's X, and even Instagram, Threads. And Trump Media, it generated less than $800,000 in revenue in the first quarter. That is very tiny. Normally, a company with that kind of revenue is valued in the millions of dollars, not the billions. Wolf?",
