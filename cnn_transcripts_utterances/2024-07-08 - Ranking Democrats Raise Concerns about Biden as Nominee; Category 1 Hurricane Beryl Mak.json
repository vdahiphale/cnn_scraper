      "sentences": "Yes. Sharing -- sharing the dangers of this storm with our viewers this morning, Jim.Yes, we are witnessing and feeling the brunt of this first hurricane strike of the Atlantic 2024 hurricane season, and it's got quite a bite to it. A lot of sting to these tropical-force gusts that come through the Port Lavaca region where I'm located along the central Texas coastline. There's already been gusts of 89 miles per hour at the Matagorda Bay inlets. There has been two to five feet of storm surge above normal tide levels. Galveston Bay at four feet above tide levels now and rapidly rising. I want to show you the current radar and satellites. The storm has moved on shore. That means it's lost its energy source, which of course, is the ocean. But it is pulling in a lot of that moisture from the warm Gulf of Mexico. And this is new to CNN. If you're in Houston, you've got a rude awakening after a long holiday weekend, currently under a flash flood warning just issued by the National Weather Service. This encompasses just under three-and-a-half million people. That is the majority of Harris County, which of course, includes the Houston metropolitan. There has been significant rain that has fallen in and around the Houston region. That was discussed yesterday from the National Weather Service at Houston and Galveston, that we needed to monitor the bayous in the Houston area. And of course, with the rain that has moved into the region, that will be a concern. Street flooding, rapid rises in rivers. That's why we have the flash flood warning. Here's some of the rainfall totals we picked up on. That's over a half a foot of rain along the coastline. And of course, it's not done yet. It's nowhere near done. So, the potential there for local amounts over a foot certainly exists. Here's the radar. We call the right quadrant of a hurricane the dirty side of the hurricane. There's a reason for that. It's dangerous, because it has spin-up tornadoes that can form at a moment's notice, and they can cause damage very, very quickly. I mean, aside from the hurricane-force wind gusts that are present within this area, the tornado threat is there and ever-present from Houston all the way to the coastline, to the Port Lavaca and central Texas coast where I'm located, as well. That wind threat, this is a new graphic I want to show you, as well, because the National Weather Service constantly is assessing the situation, updating the storm on the ground. And look at that shade of red from Bay City all the way into Houston metro. That indicates winds of 74 miles per hour. That's Category 1 strength in Houston metro. So we go back a few weeks. Remember what happened when the straight- line winds knocked out all the windows in the high-rise buildings. That was with winds of hurricane force. So, if we get a repeat of that today, we know what that did a couple of months ago. We don't want to see that again. Now, this storm is a fast mover. That is what -- one of the positives we have working for us. So, it is going to make a beeline towards the U.S. and Canada border by midweek. So, this is different than Harvey. This is not going to produce 50 inches of rain on the ground in Houston, because Harvey sat and basically meandered around Eastern Texas for four days after landfall. This system is going to be up and out of here rather quickly and then bring rainfall to the central parts of the country. But in the meantime, the real threats are here along the Texas coastline, now moving inland as Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season here in the U.S., makes landfall -- Jim.",
