I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. This is CNN New Central. New this morning, a web of chaos at home and abroad. Donald Trump is smack in the middle of that web. In fact, in most cases, Donald Trump is spinning the web, our thanks to cnn.com Stephen Collinson for that metaphor. Although House Speaker Mike Johnson might be saying, no thanks, his grip on power is growing more tenuous by the minute. He faces open revolt over his support for a surveillance bill that Donald Trump helped spike with a social media post that was factually wrong. It will be fun for Speaker Johnson to discuss when he goes to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow. Also, CNN has learned that European officials are frantically trying to speak to people close to Trump in dark Washington D.C. corners because they're desperate to know what he would actually do if he becomes president again, especially on Ukraine. And this does not even touch the chaos over abortion caused by the overturning of Roe versus Wade with Republicans in Arizona blocking attempts to change the 1800s near total ban about to go into effect there. Let's start in Washington on a Congress in chaos, even by its own chaotic standards. CNN's Lauren Fox is with us this morning. Boy, it looks like it's fun in the House right now.",

It's coming from specifically Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is someone who is closely aligned with the former president. Now, allies for Johnson have been working behind the scenes trying to get Donald Trump to support Speaker Johnson or at least stay out of the way, but obviously, he's still meddling in some of these issues with the Ukraine funding, with the FISA reauthorization. And as we have seen in the past, being aligned with Donald Trump doesn't necessarily help you. Kevin McCarthy was quite close to Donald Trump at times, and yet it was another Trump ally, Matt Gaetz, who took McCarthy down.",

We heard from him on Monday saying that it should go to the state, but you've looked at sort of the history of what his position has been. Has he flip-flopped a lot? CONTORNOFast forward to 2015, 2016, when he was trying to convince Republicans that he could be their standard bearer, suddenly he was an anti- abortion candidate. In fact, he once supported a ban at the federal level at 20 weeks. Well, now he is running for president again, he's a nominee and he is looking ahead to November. He now says that he would not support -- would not sign into law that ban that he once supported. So, if you look back at all the statements, we found at least 15 times where he has shifted his position and it has evolved over the years. Democrats and the Biden campaign saying, don't believe what Donald Trump says. The only thing you can look at is what he has done and what he did was put in the justices in place that helped get rid of Roe v. Wade.",

CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us now from the White House. When you look at this and what this will do, this has been a huge issue. How many people selling guns would this actually affect in this case?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. So, there are two different kinds that Consumer Reports looked at that are being included in the school lunch program, turkey and cheddar and extra cheesy pizza. And what they found is that actually the school versions of Lunchables contain more sodium than the versions that you can buy in the store.The levels for the turkey and cheddar, 930 milligrams of sodium in the school version, versus 740 in the store version. For pizzas, schools were 700 milligrams and the stores were 510. As a reminder, the recommended daily limit for sodium for kids under the age of 14 is 1,800 milligrams. And so you're getting quite a lot of sodium there. Now, in addition to sodium, Consumer Reports looked at 12 different lunch kits, including Lunchables, but also some other brands, including from Oscar Meyer and from Target, at sort of lunch kits that you can buy in the store. They also looked at levels of lead and cadmium, as well as these chemicals known as phthalates in these lunch kits. They looked at 12 of these. They found all of them had either lead or cadmium or both and all but one had phthalates. And so they're warning about those, even though they noted that none of the levels of lead or cadmium exceeded federal limits. They just warned that some of them are getting close to half of California's maximum allowed amount, which is one of the most stringent requirements. And so they warned that if you're eating this and then other things throughout the day, that can add up. And so they warned the combination of sodium in the school lunches that they tested and the warnings about lead and cadmium in the store- bought ones. They are warning about these products, guys.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It probably has to do with the changes that the company had to make to make them fit the nutritional requirements for student lunches. They had to increase protein, for example, so maybe making the protein size bigger. If you're making lunch meat bigger, you're potentially adding more sodium that way.You know, we did hear back from both the USDA and from Kraft Heinz about this Consumer Reports petition to ask them to remove Lunchables from the school program. The USDA noted that their requirements addressed the overall content of meals, some of them on a daily basis and others on a weekly basis. So, they noted if a school is going to serve a higher sodium meal one day, they've got to balance it out the next day. They also have to offer fruit, veggies and milk, for example. Kraft Heinz said about Lunchables that all of their foods meet strict safety standards. They say they happily feed them to their own families. They say they're proud of Lunchables and stand by the quality and integrity that goes into making them. And they noted, of course, they've made those tweaks to meet the standards. John?",
