Kevin McCarthy's quest to become House speaker is on the brink.Time is running out ahead of tomorrow's big vote. And the FDA could decide this week to green light an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer's. That is what we're watching At This Hour. Thanks so much for being here. Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington in for Kate Bolduan today. And we begin with new developments in the investigation into a machete attack near Times Square on New Year's Eve. CNN has learned the 19-year-old suspect was added to a terrorist watch list more than two weeks before the attack, which injured three NYPD officers. Sources telling CNN FBI agents interviewed the suspect in mid-December after family members grew more concerned about his plans to travel to Afghanistan to join the Taliban. We begin our coverage with CNN's Gloria Pazmino, who's live in Times Square with the latest. And Gloria, we learned the suspect was carrying a diary with him. What did authorities find inside?",

We have been learning more about Trevor Bickford, 19 years old, from Maine, and as you said, he was carrying a diary with him on the night that he attacked those three police officers, the night of New Year's Eve.He ditched a backpack near the scene, which contained that dairy. In it, Trevor Bickford wrote about his desire to travel to Afghanistan, his desire to join the Taliban, and about his willingness to die for his religion. That's all according to law enforcement sources. We've also learned that it wasn't that long ago that Trevor Bickford got the attention of the FBI. That was after his mother and his grandmother became increasingly concerned about Bickford's plans to travel to Afghanistan. That triggered an investigation. In fact, FBI officers in Maine interviewed Bickford last month and put him on a terrorist watch list. Now, that's important to highlight, because Bickford traveled here to New York City via Amtrak train and did not trigger any kind of warning or red flag in the system. He traveled here to New York City on Saturday. He checked into a hotel in the lower east side of Manhattan, and then he traveled here to the area of Times Square, one of the most recognizable spots in the world on one of the most watched evenings on New Year's Eve, thousands of people were pouring into this area at the time. He approached a security checkpoint where he tried to attack these NYPD officers, striking one of them on the head with a machete, injuring a second officer. And then a third officer fired a gunshot from his service weapon. Those three officers are expected to recover. Trevor Bickford has not been officially charged yet, but we are waiting to learn more from federal authorities and local law enforcement as the investigation continues, trying to figure out what exactly was the motivation behind this attack.

He has no visitors. So it appears he's working alone. But that's not going to be the answer until they get through every computer, every e-mail, every phone message, everything they can get access to in this investigation to determine was there someone else that he was either in contact with, sharing information about this plot with and so on. But stopping short of overturning, you know, every rock and looking underneath it appears right now that he was a lone offender, which is typical in a growing sense in these cases. They respond to propaganda, and the propaganda says act alone.",

In this case, his family came forward to the FBI out of concern, and law enforcement went and interviewed him. Basically he told them, no, I want to travel overseas and help, you know, fellow Muslims, but I'm not planning any attack, and I'm not part of any terrorist group.And in fact, the Taliban, because of the politics of dealing with the Taliban diplomatically, is not a designated foreign terrorist organization. If he'd said ISIS or al-Qaeda, and that's what he wanted to join, that would be material support of terrorism. All they could really do is document the interview, open a full investigation, and start to look into other avenues to see what could be done about this direction. And I think that's one of the challenges the FBI faces, which is people can come on their radar, but that doesn't mean that they can take them into custody. There's no such thing, nor should there be, as preventative detention, nor is there the ability to keep people under surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They gave the travel warning to Customs and Border Protection, flagged any attempts to travel, but that didn't stop him from coming to New York on a train.",

The focus today is Republican leader Kevin McCarthy's bid to become the next speaker. Hours before tomorrow's vote, McCarthy is making some concessions, but it may not be enough to get him there.CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox is live on Capitol Hill this morning. And, Lauren, we know that McCarthy has been working behind the scenes for weeks now to secure the votes that he's made some concessions along the way. But I guess at this point, has anything he's promised made a difference? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think that's the real trouble for Kevin McCarthy right now, Jessica, is the fact that he has made some very important concessions. And he announced one of them last night on a call, a private conference call of Republicans, where he told them that he had agreed to reduce the number of individuals it would take in the House to try and oust a speaker. Basically, right now, the rule is that you cannot bring up that vote unless you had a majority of the conference, but he would change that threshold to just five members. That is a key, key important distinction for a lot of conservatives who have been fighting for that. But Matt Gaetz, one of the Republicans who is opposed to him, said on that call he was still a hard no, Jessica. And then after the call, nine Republicans released a letter saying they still had concerns. Just to remind people back home, you can only lose right now, just four Republicans if Kevin McCarthy is going to become the next speaker, he has far more than that he has to convince before tomorrow, Jessica. So a lot of stumbling blocks. It'll be very important to see whether or not McCarthy can cement those votes before tomorrow's vote or if they go to the floor really uncertain about the outcome.",

He's traveling to Kentucky on Wednesday, and there he will be joined by Democrats and Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine. The President will be there to promote the bipartisan infrastructure law that he signed, as some of the funding from that will be geared towards a bridge that connects the state of Kentucky and Ohio. This is just one of those measures that the President is expected to be touting in the weeks heading into the State of the Union Address. Of course, last week or last year, the President did have some bipartisan wins. In addition to that infrastructure law, there were investments for the semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States, also getting gun safety reform passed in Congress, as well as more aid for Ukraine.

So there is actually a group of Republicans that actually want to work on immigration. Number two, we've got to work every single day to win back the House in 2024. We are in a much stronger position than were, than people thought were going to be. We're going to work every day to win back. We've only got a handful of seats that we have got to win.

And so we're optimistic that all of that is going to happen and that we're going to fight every day for it.
