Give them the opportunity with the bureau to say, hey, search wherever you want, look at everything you want to look at and you tell us what you think maybe needs to go. Put it on them.

Ukraine says it has repelled dozens of Russian attacks across the eastern front.

Since the Russian invasion last February, there's been turmoil in the Orthodox Church. Pre-war, Ukraine's Orthodox Church was split into two, one independent branch and the other traditionally loyal to Moscow and its controversial Patriarch Kirill, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Russia's invasion. Shortly after the war began, the Moscow-supporting part of the church publicly cut ties with its northern neighbor.

They're not only protesting Benjamin Netanyahu's new right-wing government. But specifically what's really gotten them out onto the streets were these proposed judicial reforms that were unveiled a few weeks ago. And part of them would allow the parliament -- and that would mean really the party in power -- to overturn some of Israel's supreme court rulings. There was other reforms would include allowing politicians to have more of a say of what judges are appointed. And for many of the people out on the streets, they see this as a destruction of the independence of the judiciary, changing the balance of power. And for some of them, they even call it the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy. Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies say that these reforms are a long time coming, that the supreme court has overreached in its rulings, that it will restore balance to the three branches of government. And Benjamin Netanyahu says this is the will of the people who voted on those November 1st elections and brought in this right-wing government into power.

But one of the things that we are seeing is that a lot of nurses, who were approaching retirement, retired early during the pandemic.That we're seeing numbers of nurses in various surveys that maybe would have stayed in the workforce for another three to five years, who decided that they did not want to work during the pandemic and left early. So that was an immediate hit to the workforce. We're also seeing in various parts of the world and country in the United States that some of the nursing education programs have had a really hard time maintaining their enrollments. And the reasons vary a lot. In some places, it's been a lack of funding or a lot of challenges and pivoting to remote education. In other places, the challenges have been more around prospective students not wanting to have a hybrid education or being hesitant about pursuing nursing. So you've got an inflow that may be declining.",

And I'll paraphrase him as best I can.He said that there are multiple layers of it. There are a lot of nurses who watched their colleagues die. So straight out, that's a trauma. They also often watched family members get very sick, so there's a secondary trauma. And then you add to that having so many colleagues go out on quarantine or sick leave and that led to higher workloads in the workplace. So you have all of this trauma from loss. On top of that, you also have just a high level of change fatigue. You've had changing pandemic protocols, you've had changing health care protocols. You've had changes around, do you mask, do you not mask? What's required in front of your patients? How do you make sure your patients are safe? How do you make sure your family is safe? And that's just exhausting. And for people in health care, it's been even more so, because they have all of these work protections in addition to family protections. And that has -- you know, that's just exhausting. So when you add the workplace stress and fatigue to the home and general societal fatigue, for nurses, they've been at the crux of a lot of stress.",
