They finally got it off in this beautiful launch and everything's looking good and Boeing's breathing a sigh of relief. Then they developed these helium leaks. They had one when they took off and that affected the thrusters on the craft. That seems to be how it played here.Think about this. In a zero gravity environment, when you have fuel in a tank or microgravity environment, it may not be carried by gravity to where it needs to burn. So helium is used to pressurize it and force it to where it needs to burn. Without that control, you can't fire the thrusters to undock or to come out of orbit. So they can stay up there for 45 days if they need to, but this is interfering with a lot of things right now. And of course, it is interfering with a lot of the plans for Boeing to become a regular supplier of this. They need to solve this problem and get that spacecraft out of there. They say it could go now if it had to go now, but they just want to be extra safe. And the pilots, the astronauts who went up on this, said the Boeing craft handled wonderfully, but this is not what anybody wants to see. Space is about predictability where you can get it, and they're not getting it right here.",
