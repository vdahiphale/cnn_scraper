This hour, America's top diplomat is arriving in the Middle East for the sixth time since the start of the Israel Hamas war. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due in Saudi Arabia soon and later in Egypt, where he'll meet with senior leaders to discuss what he calls the quote, right architecture for lasting regional peace. Just within the last few hours we've learned Blinken is also expected to visit Israel this week that stop was not initially on his schedule. In blunt comments yesterday, Blinken all of Gaza is suffering with severe levels of acute food insecurity his comments that come amid dire warnings of a looming famine in northern Gaza. And we are seeing some aid make its way into Gaza including this shipment from World Central Kitchen arriving as you see here by boat. U.N. officials though say it is not nearly enough. There is growing concern and agreement for a temporary truce could be complicated by Israel's rate of Gaza's largest hospital earlier this week. CNN's Nada Bashir is live in London at this hour. So Nada, we are going to touch on that hospital raid in just a moment. But first, what more can you tell us about Antony Blinken's latest Middle East tour?",

And of course, we have seen back and forth discussions shuttle diplomacy ongoing between Cairo and Qatar both of whom have been crucial mediators between Hamas and Israel over the last few weeks and months. Don't know we know of course, that we are also expecting to see a delegation from Israel traveling to the U.S. to meet with U.S. White House Representatives early next week, according to the White House. But really what has been primary focus for the White House in the Biden Administration has not only been these ongoing negotiations and discussions around what would sit to be a prolonged truth in fighting looking at around six weeks. We know of course, that Hamas has put forward a proposal that there have been ongoing discussions around the terms of that proposal, the number of hostages and the timing of hostages to be released by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but we haven't seen any breakthroughs just yet. But also there is mounting concern, particularly from the U.S. government over Israel's plans to carry out a ground incursion a ground operation rather in the southern city of Rafah. We know of course, that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that that military operation has been approved by Israel's leadership that they believe this is -- in there was a crucial aspect of their fight against Hamas that they are targeting Hamas battalions in Rafah. But of course, this is an area where some 1.5 million people are now displaced. The Biden Administration as of other international allies has raised concern over the protection of civilians there. The White House has said it will be unable to support any sort of ground operation in Rafah without evidence that Israel is doing all that it can to protect civilians there. And while the IDF has said it has been directed to prepare for a mass evacuation of civilians from Rafah, the White House has said that it has not yet seen any sort of credible plan to suggest that that is what is taking place at this current point in time. And of course Blinken in the Middle East we are expecting to see further talks and negotiations focused on that ceasefire they'll but also crucially on the situation in Rafah.",

It's fittingthat this law has kind of created this legal whiplash that we've seen play out over the last several weeks. But essentially, what is at the heart of all of this is a Texas law that was signed by the governor in December called Senate Bill 4 SB4. And what it does is that it gives local law enforcement officers the ability to arrest people they suspect of entering Texas illegally. And it also gives judges the ability to deport people who've entered Texas illegally to Mexico. Now critics of the law and those who have brought the lawsuit against the law say that, look, immigration enforcement is the sole responsibility of the federal government, that if states were allowed to create their own laws on how to handle immigration, it would sow chaos and confusion across the country, which is essentially what the Biden Administration is arguing right now. But here Texas officials say they have the right to defend themselves to sovereignty to defend itself from migrant what they just -- they've been describing for several years now a quote unquote, invasion of migrants and drugs. So that is kind of the backdrop under which we find all of this. And but for a few hours yesterday, this law was actually in place and we got a real sense of the confusion and what it would look like in reality? You know, one thing is to talk about what this law says on paper. The other thing is the reality of how it's carried out by law enforcement agencies on a day to day basis. And Erica, many law enforcement agencies we were able to speak with yesterday seemed very confused and not quite committed to enforcing this law because of manpower and jail space issues. So there's a real questions about exactly how this law would be carried out, in practical terms on the ground. But for now, once again, the law is on hold more legal challenges and arguments expected to be heard in federal court here in the United States again today. So again, the legal whiplash could very well continue in the days and weeks ahead on this particular law, Erica?",

They say he should not be able to face any charges or be prosecuted. And they want the Supreme Court to dismiss the case against him in federal court in Washington D.C. for criminal charges. This brief is the opening salvo in the arguments. We're in that phase now. What happens next, as the Special Counsel's Office of the Justice Department will file a response brief, they will push back quite strongly against what Donald Trump is arguing here. Trump will get to respond. And then there will be arguments near the end of April before the Supreme Court. In this brief, Trump's team is arguing that there is a bleak scenario for the American republic, if there isn't immunity around the presidency, they're saying that a president could face blackmail extortion while in office, if they have the threat of prosecution after that there would be post office trauma for anyone who serves in the presidency. And it would spell the end of the presidency as we know it. Now, so far, Trump has lost all of these arguments in court. And the courts have said actually the reason that there are laws is because they encourage people not to break the law and commit crimes, including if you're serving in the presidency. We're just going to have to wait and see exactly how the Supreme Court responds to this though.",
