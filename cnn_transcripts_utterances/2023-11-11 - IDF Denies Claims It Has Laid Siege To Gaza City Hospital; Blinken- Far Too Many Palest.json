This, as intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants continues around Gaza's biggest hospital Al-Shifa. Doctors Without Borders, which has staff inside says the clashes are stopping them from evacuating patients and that the hospital has lost power. The director of Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza says two babies died after a generator was damaged in that hospital. The IDF says it is working on a plan to help evacuate infants from the hospital's pediatric unit and denies claims the hospital is under siege. Israeli officials say the military can \"coordinate\" with anyone who wants to leave the hospital safely. In the meantime, the Red Cross says Gaza's healthcare system has passed the point of no return. As the clashes continue near the Al- Shifa Hospital, intense fighting is taking place over the streets of northern Gaza. Let's go straight to CNN correspondent, Oren Liebermann, who is live in Sderot, Israel with war on this. Oren, what are you seeing right now?",

      "sentences": "Jim, there is at least a brief lull in the fighting and the strikes we're seeing from where we are on the northeast corner of Gaza, essentially just a few miles from the Gaza Strip.I do hear a drone overhead. We have heard some intermittent artillery fire. It was much more intense and much more consistent a couple of hours ago. We have also heard fighter jets overhead. Now crucially, we haven't seen the results of those strikes, meaning we haven't seen the impact point, and that would at least seem to suggest that they are taking place a bit farther south from our vantage point here. Jim, as you rightly point out, much of the fighting right now focused in northern Gaza around the Shifa Hospital. Officials from the Hamas- controlled Ministry of Health say the hospital itself is surrounded, in dire need of food, electricity, and water which is making a critical humanitarian crisis inside the Strip and a medical crisis, even worse, as you point out, Doctors Without Borders says that the situation there is getting to the point of no return in terms of the ability to treat patients there. The hospital itself treats about 400 patients, but just as importantly, there are some 20,000 people taking refuge within the hospital. Officials there say the hospital itself, the main complex hasn't been struck but some of the outer areas in the intense fighting around there have been damaged, the maternity ward, external clinics there. Doctors Without Borders also says that bodies are piling up and that in and of itself is becoming a danger from disease. On the point about the neonatal intensive care unit, I'll get a bit more into that quickly. Now, the generator was damaged. That generator powered the incubators and when those incubators went down. As of the last update, a total of three babies died in the neonatal intensive care unit there. Israel says there is no siege on the hospital and that the east wing of the hospital remains open for those who want to evacuate. The IDF says they also assisted with evacuations from Rantisi and Al-Nasr Hospitals, and as you point out, they'll get ready to evacuate the pediatric unit or part of it tomorrow from the Shifa Hospital. They say they've taken over, at this point, 11 Hamas military posts in northern Gaza, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promises the mission to take out Hamas and to remove them from power there will continue. The next challenge is going after the underground infrastructure, and that Jim, will be an incredible challenge, indeed.",

We are on day 36 of the war and 239 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza. Regarding the hospital, we are in contact with local authorities in Gaza, with the manager and others, and assisting them and then informing them where they can go in order to evacuate from the area and we are also trying to coordinate the safe removal and transport of the remaining patients that are still inside the hospital. I want to emphasize, we haven't struck the hospital and we are not surrounding it or applying any pressure on it, and we have troops in the vicinity, but we have not been engaging with the hospital or any parts of it.",

The main road is Salah al-Din, the main thoroughfare of the Gaza Strip, but then also Al Rashid Street, the coastal road, we've opened that up as well, during select hours of the day -- daytime hours, which allows Palestinians to move and to go to relative safety in the south, again, under our commitment not to strike civilians and out of a respect for the sanctity of human life, which is much more than what Hamas is doing at this time.",

It's against the Geneva Convention. They are endangering the protected status of the hospital by doing so.And what we have done, first and foremost, is to inform the Palestinians and also the world that we know that Hamas is using the hospital for military purposes, we know that it is full of Hamas combatants that are seeking shelter and trying to hide away from our forces underneath the hospital.

I cannot go into further details about what when and where it will be done. I can say that it would be best for everybody involved, including those who will need the hospital the day after the war for Hamas to come out of their hidings and stop abusing civilian infrastructure for military purposes.

We try to do everything we can to get them out of the battlefield so that we can focus on fighting Hamas.And I think that the government and the military, and we're talking, you know, at the military level, we're communicating with our military counterparts, we are not only telling them what we're doing, we're showing them what we're doing, and what Hamas is doing, their violations and how they are using the civilians as human shields and we are showing what we are doing, the measures that we are implementing, in order to minimize the damage to civilians. I definitely hope that, you know, these numbers can come down and what we're achieving is basically, we're emptying northern Gaza of civilians temporarily, exactly in order to minimize and lower the amount of civilian casualties, that is our aim, because we seek that operational freedom to be able to go after Hamas. Hamas is under pressure. You know, they're under pressure. Now, they're indicating that they're under pressure. There have been reports of them shooting at evacuees, and all kinds of efforts by Hamas to stop evacuations in various locations.

What we already have done, also responding to those requests and statements made by the president and others is to add hours. It started with four hours, and now it's five, maybe it will be expanded more. We added another route, right? It was only the central route, and now we've opened up a northern route as well along the coast, Al Rashid Street in addition to Salah al-Din. So we are definitely listening. We're definitely trying to find good ways of evacuating civilians to minimize the effect on them, while still doing what we need to do. And this is important, we're not in Gaza, for the amusement of it. We are there because we are fighting Hamas.

They are using them as leverage in order to get the IDF to back off and relent in our military pressure.I think that is what has been clear, there won't be any kind of ceasefire before we get hostages back. Talking can be done, that's all fine, but there needs to be continuous pressure on Hamas. That is the only thing that is effective. And by the way, maneuvering on the ground, creating that kind of friction on the ground between us and enemy forces, creates intelligence and creates other opportunities that hopefully we will be able to leverage in order to get our people home.",

He's also been interrupted twice during speeches by people calling for a ceasefire, and you also see this growing calls internationally for the president to sort of change course, somewhat. The French president, Emmanuel Macron today saying that a ceasefire would benefit Israel and saying that bombing of civilians is not justified, saying that he hoped leaders, including in the United States would join him in those calls. We also saw last week the majority of this Democratic Caucus in the Senate writing the White House, asking for more details about the $14 billion request for emergency military assistance to Israel asking for what the US can do to guarantee that Israel is mitigating the civilian deaths. And so President Biden certainly still standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel in this conflict defending its right to defend itself, saying it has a responsibility to go after Hamas. But you are hearing Biden and other administration officials injecting more caution into their language. Certainly, you heard that from the president's top diplomat, Antony Blinken this week saying that far too many Palestinians have died in this conflict, saying much more needed to be done to prevent civilian deaths. What the president has done is pressed the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on what he calls humanitarian pauses, and Israel did say this week that it would begin those four-hour pauses daily, but when the president was asked about that earlier this week, he said that he had hoped Netanyahu would have agreed to them a little earlier -- Jim.",

A pause is in fact, a stop, at least for a temporary period of time. And a ceasefire also, is a stop, usually, for a specific period of time. Israel has the right to protect itself. I personally believe that the aerial bombardments from rockets or from airplanes dropping bombs has to stop. There seems to me to be no reason for that. The ground action that is taking place has to be very, very carefully done, and the Palestinians in Gaza have to be given time to evacuate whether they're in a hospital or in a building.

So there is a lot of harm going on here.My personal opinion is that the aerial bombardments, whether they are by rocket or plane must stop. And there must be a pause in the action so that civilians can get out of the way. It's clear that the IDF is going to continue to pursue Hamas fighters in Gaza and I believe that can be done with a minimum of civilian casualties by very carefully conducting it, taking time. It has to be block by block. That's all understandable. With regard to the hospital, the hospital has to be protected. Bottom line, the hospital has to be protected. And that can be done at the same time that Israel is either preparing for the next action following a pause or if it's a ceasefire for whatever period of time, then with the hospital protected, and with the civilians given the time to get out of the way, then Israel will, in my view, be able to pursue the Hamas terrorists in a way that reduces casualties and could be successful.",

One will keep the government funded until - part of the government until January 19th. The rest will go until February 2nd. This plan doesn't have any spending cuts. It just keeps levels where they are. There's no additional aid for the wars in Israel or Ukraine.And now, Jim, we're already hearing mixed reviews about this plan. There are at least three Republicans from the far right of the House Republican Conference who are against this because there are not enough spending cuts for them. Republicans can only lose four votes if all Democrats vote against the bill. But we're unclear where Democrats in the House stand because there aren't spending cuts in this bill, though.

This just shows that what Speaker Mike Johnson is navigating is very similar to what former Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to handle when - leading up to the September 30th funding deadline. Of course, McCarthy ended up putting a bipartisan bill on the floor and we know what happened next, McCarthy was ultimately ousted. Will Johnson face a similar fate? Unlikely.
