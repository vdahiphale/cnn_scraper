Now the Ukrainian say at this site alone, two people were killed. But dozens were also wounded. We saw that videos of the first responders and hospital staff trying to come and dig people out. However, in total, in Kyiv alone in Ukraine's capital, 29 people were killed in those strikes which were rare daytime attack. Let's have a look at what happened.

And from my experience here, and I've seen it firsthand on the road and here in Washington D.C. If the national security team needs to get to the president, they get to the president. And it doesn't matter what the hour on the clock says he's always there. He's always available, and they have ready access to him. And he also knows that the world doesn't take a breather after a certain time of day, those things to keep going on, just like we saw this weekend in Ukraine. And he's constantly peppering the team with questions again, around the clock. That's the commander-in-chief that I've seen.

He also wants a faster path to join NATO. And this is something that is said before and it appears as if there will be some language in that direction, likely won't go far enough and fast enough for him his feeling as these things are immediate. There's a great sense around the table as well there or there will be in Washington, particularly from the Baltic States, probably from the Nordic states, as well as the new joiners like Finland and Sweden. And as well from Poland and some of the others that are close to Ukraine and close to Russia. They feel that the threat there is growing, and it's imminent. So this really does put so much focus on Ukraine, but it won't just be focused on Ukraine. I think in the final communique, we should look at the language that's being used about Russia. It was pretty tough last year and last year's communique. Expect more of the same, but see where the nuance and detail is see what they have to say about Russia's modernization of its nuclear weapon systems that was mentioned in last year's communique, and also about the strengthening of the ties to counter NATO, if you will, between China and Russia. That's something again we should look at see where the dial is moving for NATO on that. And I think again, we can expect the language on that area to be tougher.",

China positions about freedom of navigation and et cetera. In the Indo- Pacific, this is clearly a reference to China of course, but a lot of concerns on the international front. You know, what, Keir Starmer will get out of this trip to Washington is pretty powerful and big for him just a few days in office, and to be amongst so many world leaders is a real chance for him to you know, to flex his own diplomacy. It begins in the White House with President Biden about what he wants strengthening of the transatlantic alliance, which is very important, he said, But he goes in there knowing that he is the foreign secretary who is just appointed to State Foreign Affairs, David Lammy has been very clear. And Lammy, let's not forget, in just the last few days, has been to Norway, and has been to Poland, and has been to Germany. And this really doubles down on his messaging that the UK needs to look to Europe and Europe needs to look to itself for its own security and in an environment where the United States is becoming, perhaps a tad more insular, but certainly more focused on the Indo-Pacific.

Prosecutors have said that under U.S. law, even an accident can still be a crime. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (voice-over): October 2021, Alec Baldwin was rehearsing on the set of Rust in remote to Mexico, seemingly just another day in the life of a megastar with four decades in show business. He's handed a real revolver as a prop and told its safe, then an unexpected gunshot. Hours later, cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was dead, another crew member injured and the film's production in chaos. Baldwin's involved into the shooting and alleged safety concerns on set suddenly thrust into the spotlight. Flash forward 2.5 years later, the movie's armor is sentenced to prison for involuntary manslaughter. And Baldwin who's an executive producer on the film, he's facing the same charge. He's pleaded not guilty and in a 2022 interview with CNN denied any criminal liability. He blamed armor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Assistant Director David Halls for the live round that was loaded into the gun. As his attorneys argued the shooting was an accident. And Baldwin is not criminally liable. MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, NEW MEXICO FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Just because it's an accident doesn't mean that it's not criminal. CAMPBELL (voice-over): The convoluted path to trial has itself all the makings of a Hollywood drama. Months after being charged in 2023, Baldwin's case was suddenly dropped by New Mexico special prosecutors citing quote, new facts, but the actor was indicted in January with involuntary manslaughter, this time by a grand jury. His attorneys tried and failed at multiple attempts to get the case dismissed. At one point alleging improper destruction of evidence arguing the gun was virtually destroyed by FBI testing.",

That is a position that they rarely actually stick to in practice, they have continued negotiations, even as the Israeli military has expanded its military operations inside of Gaza. And it seems that the negotiations are continuing despite the fact that the Israeli military is now conducting several operations, not only continuing its military operation in Rafah, where it's been for over two months now, but also in -- and in Gaza city in northern Gaza. And we are seeing the impact that those operations are having on the civilian population, as well as rescuers say that they are having trouble reaching the dead and the wounded as a result of those military operations, as a result of the ongoing fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, saying that their medical points and emergency clinics are now out of service amid the intensified fighting. Now as it relates to the negotiating table, and what we're seeing, we've seen over today, and yesterday, we've been seeing negotiations happening in Cairo, the CIA Director, Bill Burns, who arrives in the region, usually at very sensitive, very critical moments in these negotiations. He met today with the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, they discussed obviously the state of those negotiations, as well as some of the security conditions, which is important to note that one of the key things that needs to be resolved in these talks is what happens to that Egyptian- Gaza border. What happens to the Rafah crossing that Philadelphi corridor that the Israeli military has said, it has been used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza from Egypt. But also we know that tomorrow, they're set to convene in Doha, Qatar, both American, Israeli, Egyptian, Qatari, all of the top negotiators set to be in the same place as along with Hamas as well, to try and push this deal forward. And they are indeed, in that phase of detailed negotiations, which is somewhere that they have not been in the past, at least not since the last truce fell apart in early December. But now of course, it's also becoming a domestic political story, as the Israeli Prime Minister faces criticism from his right wing, who are keeping him in power, about the state of these negotiations, about the deal that is on the table, while those in the center and the left in Israeli politics are urging him to stay the course and make this reality, Becky.",
