Just ahead, terrible damage in Odesa after a third straight night of Russian missile strikes in the Ukrainian port city. We're live on the ground with more on why this city is being targeted.Then angry scenes in Baghdad as protesters stormed the Swedish Embassy there will tell you what sparked the unrest. And the Women's World Cup has kicked off I'll speak with a Former star player about why this year's tournament is already unlike any other? On a day when New Zealand was supposed to be celebrating perhaps its most important moment on sports world stage, the country is instead reeling in shock over gun violence. A man with a shotgun opens fire at a construction site in downtown, Auckland Thursday, just hours before the opening match of the Women's World Cup. He killed two people and injured several others the gunman was also found dead. Gun violence is rare in New Zealand especially since a 2019 mass shooting led to much stricter gun laws. CNN's Angus Watson has been tracking the story joins us now. And Angus I know play has been well underway on the opening day of the World Cup despite this incident this morning. But tell us more of what actually occurred during this gun attack and how much that has been overshadowing events today?",

For the two people killed and the several others injured in this horrific mass shooting event in Auckland in downtown areas of the city where several teams are staying.I might add a lone gunman entered his place of work a construction site with a shotgun firing as he moved his way through the levels of this construction site killing two and injuring several. One of those people injured was a police officer police were commended for their bravery arriving at the scene just moments after the man started firing. Incidentally, in the end, that man was shot and was killed. Found at the bottom of an elevator shaft with a bullet where now team U.S.A. was one of the teams that were in the area at the time. And they gave a press conference in which they mentioned they were asked about the tragedy of gun violence. Take a listen to what player Lynn Williams had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNN WILLIAMS, U.S. WOMEN'S WORLD CUP TEAM: -- like in the U.S., we've dealt with this far too many times. But there was definitely a sense of like, let's come together. We still have a job to do, but also recognizing that there were lives lost and that is very real and very devastating. So we were just thankful that we were safe, that the first responders came in and everything was very quick. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was not a terrorist attack or ideologically motivated, unlike, of course, the memory of 2019 still fresh for New Zealanders when a white supremacist terrorist targeted two mosques in Christchurch, killing 50 people.This time, the gunman is thought to have acted alone. And the games went ahead, Christina, but of course with this dark cloud over them. Let's hope that the tournament can get ahead soon some and we can go ahead with enjoying the football instead, Christina.",

That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips and all of these military checkpoints to prevent people from being able to go in or come out. There's a reason why this road has tank traps.Basically, if tanks were to come rolling down, they would blow up to stop an invasion from the north to the south. And the North has similar booby traps set up as well. So obviously, it's a highly secured area. [08:05:00] How did this U.S. Army private just run across? Well, we're learning that on Monday at Incheon Airport about 90 minutes' drive from where I'm standing right now. He was supposed to get on an American Airlines flight to Dallas but he told after going through all of the procedures, all the security right at the gate to the plane, he claimed that he had lost his passport. And was escorted back outside of the airport somehow made his way here on Tuesday where he was able to board, get on a tour, he had booked a tour. It was apparently the passenger manifest was approved by the United Nations Command. And he along with about 40 other people took a bus down this road over this unification bridge. And less than five miles that way is the Joint Security Area where he was able to basically according to others, who were on the tour with him run across ignoring the calls of guards and get into a North Korean van where he was whisked away now where he is now after being in North Korean custody for Wednesday. And now Thursday, still an open question because the North Koreans have not released any information publicly. And it may be quite some time before we officially know anything about his soldiers, whereabouts or when he might have a chance of getting back to the U.S., Will Ripley CNN in South Korea near the DMZ.

      "sentences": "Well, Christina, this raises a lot of very uncomfortable questions for the U.N. Command, for example, for the soldiers that were there, watching this tour and making sure that nothing untoward happened because when you go on these tours, whether it's a military sponsored tour, or whether it's one of the commercial tours.You have South Korean soldiers who are stationed just by the border, they have their back to North Korea, and they're watching you. That is their job to make sure that you don't do anything that could cause any kind of an incident. So the fact that this individual was able to make a run for it is really quite remarkable. Now, as we've seen, it is a very short border, you can just step over the border as we have seen President Trump and also the Former South Korean President Moon Jae-In doing in the past. But once he is beyond that border, there is nothing that the U.S. soldiers and the South Korean soldiers can do. That is where their jurisdiction ends. Now, in the past what we have seen, for example, when there was a North Korean soldier back in 2017, who ran across into South Korea, he was shot multiple times by his own soldiers, so and he was hit five times. But he did survive that encounter. There are no guns at Panmunjom anymore. That was a deal made back in 2018. So there is no way of the U.S. and South Koreans stopping him from getting across once he has actually made that decision. Now, of course, what's happened to him now is a very interesting question we understand from eyewitnesses and from U.S. official speaking to us. He was bundled into a van and driven off. The North Koreans haven't acknowledged this. They haven't mentioned anything about this. They haven't even said that they have him. Of course they do, because there's nowhere else he could be. But I suspect they are trying to figure out what to do at this point. They are trying to figure out if they can debrief him if he is useful to them if you can give intelligence and as he was quite a low ranking soldier and haven't been there very long. I suspect he won't be able to and then they have to decide what to do.",

And the Swedish Ambassador asked to leave the country. Iraq says the Iraqi Prime Minister rather says that this is in response to the Swedish government repeatedly permitting the burning of the Holy Quran and insulting Islamic sanctities.Now the demonstration that is in question here is underway. I must emphasize this is a single individual, one lone man carrying out this demonstration in front of the Iraqi Embassy in Stockholm, but it begins to show you just of course, these ripple effects, how controversial, how inflammatory his arcs are. Now this one man which I have to mention, he is himself an Iraqi he moved to Sweden about five years ago. His name is Salman Momika, he had engaged in the burning of pages of the Quran just about a month ago that caused widespread condemnation. It even threatened at one point of Sweden's bid to join NATO when Turkey stepped in with its discontent. That leader of course, went ahead but that lone individual is yet again right now outside the Iraqi Embassy in Stockholm. He has a live stream going last day look some 55,000 people were watching and we've already seen the repercussions of today's event last night. I know we have images to show you have hundreds of protesters storming the Embassy of Sweden in Baghdad. These were followers of Moqtada al- Sadr, of course, the very prominent Shia cleric in Iraq who spoke about these acts as being highly offensive who blamed Swedish police who said that there must be a response. But right now, I think many eyes are on that live stream to see what takes place. Swedish police have emphasized rather that they have given permission for a demonstration, but they don't give specific permissions for the happenings within that demonstration. So unclear what will take place but again, a lot of eyeballs on that live stream and a lot of concern about the response to one lone individual's actions in Stockholm today?",

FIFA has said that this World Cup is on track to be the most attended women's sporting event in history. The prize money is also breaking records, but it still falls far short of what the men get and is a long way from achieving parity.
