That is typically voted along party lines. But there are some Republicans who are threatening to vote against it. Johnson on the floor can only afford to lose three Republican votes. If they vote against that, to scuttle this on its first procedural vote, then Democrats will have to come to try to push it over the finish line. But what do Democresponse.in response? What concessions do they ask for? Will they simply go along for it? All questions here, as they race to avoid a government shutdown by weeks end -- Brianna.",

But the meeting is also playing out against the backdrop of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. And the Indonesian President had -- has been quite vocal in calling for a ceasefire.Now he is coming here to the White House after meeting with Arab and Muslim leaders in Saudi Arabia. And he has told reporters that he is here to convey their belief that this war needs to stop and that a ceasefire must be conducted. Now, President Biden notably has refrained from calling for a ceasefire. They've simply been calling for humanitarian pauses. And national security adviser Jake Sullivan just moments ago acknowledged that there are quite a few differences in -- specifically when it relates to the Israel and Hamas conflict between the President and Indonesia. But Sullivan also stressed that they will also be working towards moments of progress. Now one of the goals as President Biden invited Widodo here to the White House, is trying to launch this comprehensive strategic partnership. That is elevating the status of relations between the U.S. and Indonesia. It's actually putting it on par with the same tier that Indonesian holds its relations with Beijing. And all of this comes at a critical time, as President Biden is about to head out West to the APEC leaders Summit, which will include a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Now in this meeting here at the White House today, they're expected to also talk about improving ties between the U.S. and Indonesia when it comes to critical minerals and climates. But those differences about the approach to the conflict between Hamas and Israel are expected to come up with national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying that they will respectfully exchange their views.",

A Secret Service agent on security detail for President Biden's granddaughter Naomi fired a weapon while trying to stop some people from breaking into a government vehicle. It happened last night in the Georgetown neighborhood here in Washington, DC. The Secret Service says it believes no one was hit. Both the agency and DC police are now investigating.Also, the Trump International Hotel in Waikiki is ditching the former presidents name and will debut a new name next year. This comes after the Trump Organization announced it reached a buyout of the hotel management and licensing agreement with the hotel's owner. With the departure of the Hawaiian Hotel, the number of Trump. Hotels and resorts is down to eight across the world. And today in Atlanta, police used tear gas to confront dozens of protesters who were marching to stop the construction of a controversial police training facility dubbed, \"Cop City.\" Video shows demonstrators blocking the roads as officers tried to stop that crowd from moving forward. No one was injured or arrested. The project has faced strong opposition over environmental and social justice concerns -- Brianna.",

So some swaps we can make. If you like a bagel and cream cheese for breakfast, maybe swap that out for oatmeal. Or if you like your salad tossed in dressing, sorry, but maybe ask for dressing on the side. You know, sauces and dressings are sometimes hidden sources of salt.So these are just some small tweaks we can make on our daily diet that could actually yield major benefits for our health -- Brianna.",

Yesterday it was 1,000 earthquakes in that same area. So they are saying the seismic activity has decreased a little bit but they obviously say still the threat of a massive eruption is still very high. Because under that town there's a huge river of magma that wants to make its way to the top. That's why we're seeing all those earthquakes there. And that's why an evacuation order for that place is still very much in affect. The residents of that area, they've been able to go back to their houses today, but only for a short period of time and only with the local police and with other first responders as well. Because they say that they have to get out of there as fast as possible because that massive eruption could happen at any time -- Jessica.",

Of course, that spewed ash well high into the air and planes just simply couldn't fly past there.Right now, the authorities in Iceland are saying they don't really see that as a scenario, but they're still not really sure where exactly this eruption is going to take place. If it's going to take place. And how strong it's going to be. But definitely, you know, when a lot of businesses around the world, when airlines around the world, when they hear volcanic eruption in Iceland, possibly very strong volcanic eruption.

This lion roamed the town for about five hours.A local mayor calling for people to stay inside. Make sure their domestic pets were inside. Their children were safe. While they tried to capture this male lion. Now they were finally able to shoot it with a dart which had a geolocator on it and they were able to sedate it while they captured it and returned it to the circus. Now the use of live animals in traveling circuses, which are very, very popular across Italy, has been widely condemned by animal rights groups. Now they have even more reason. It's not just the welfare of the animals they can complain about. It's also a danger to the local community. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
