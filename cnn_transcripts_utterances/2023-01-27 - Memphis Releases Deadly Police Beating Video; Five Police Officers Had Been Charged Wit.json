The Memphis Police chief who has viewed it calls what we are all about to see together heinous and inhumane, but we've decided and we believe that it is important to watch this, together, because we've been told this video shows a man pulled over for a traffic stop, beaten to death and five police officers had been charged with second degree murder in the case.We do believe this is of great public importance. The family and the police chief all want the world to see this video. Here it is in its entirety. OK. As we were saying, you're going to have some parts where you hear and some parts where you don't. It begins in this first clip. It is silent This is the police officer's body cam who is approaching the traffic stop which is already in progress. So in a little bit here, the audio will start and you will see him pull up to the actual traffic stop and that's in about 15 or 20 seconds. But I just want everyone to understand your TV's working fine. You're not hearing it because there isn't audio. That audio is going to begin here in just a few seconds and we're going to just sit all back together and watch this, as this officers pulls up. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

One of the officers attempts to hit him by taser and fails.You then hear the chase play out on the radio. So now let's get to the second part of the video released by the city of Memphis. This one -- this one is from an elevated camera mounted to a street pole. All right. I'm sorry. Let me -- let me be clear. This is all coming in. We're doing this together. This is actually going to be from another body cam. So let me just play this for you again. This is another body cam from one of the officers on the scene. So everyone understands here. Audio will start in just a little bit, but I have -- we do know here generally what's about to happen again. Police body cam. This is from one of the officers. We don't know which one. We do believe that what you will see here when the audio begins is where the actual beating of Tyre Nichols took place. So you should be aware that that's what you're about to see if you want to see this. We're watching this all together. We have not seen it and the audio is going to start in just a few seconds. So this is an officer driving up to the scene, as you know, Tyre Nichols, we just saw had run away. A police officer tried to hit him with a taser, failed to do so. He ran and a chase ensued. This is the most disturbing one. We are told that we are going to see of all this footage, so let's listen in now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And what you're about to see here is an officer who's going to run to the scene where police are struggling with Nichols. And this is crucial because you're going to see the paramedics respond as well, we are told. Again, what you're about to see is graphic and difficult to watch. It starts silently and then you will hear the audio. But, again, this is going to be the crucial part of when the paramedics came. What did they do and didn't do? We do know, of course, the two of the firemen who had responded to this have also been fired. We don't know their role. We don't know much about what happened at this crucial moment when the paramedics arrived. After this, there is still another clip where you're going to see the sky cam footage from above. And you will also see, we understand, the beating of Tyre Nichols in detail from a different angle. So we're -- that's going to give us a lot more information.

And that's where an officer starts with the lowest level of force, which is merely their presence, then it elevates to verbal commands, and then physical and then it goes to pepper spray, a baton, and the worst-case scenario is deadly physical force with a firearm.I don't foresee the need for the elevation above the physical force. I see a baton was used. I see officers kick this individual in the ahead. It's clearly excessive. But what's even more troubling is no officer was willing to intervene and say stop. I mean, there's a point where you have to intercede and say either stop or physically step between the officer that's assaulting the person. And that actual individual and that didn't happen, so --",

They not only sprayed him, they sprayed themselves, because you could see him getting water flushed -- to flush their eyes and so forth.The second video, I couldn't pick up a whole lot from there. I caught a little bit of it, but the pole cam video is the one that is really justifies the charges that have been placed. I mean, is it beyond anything in terms of policy training or anything else? Nobody trains for that. And, you know, I mean, these guys are acting so far outside of a bounce that, you know, you really can't explain it. Now you see him standing around. You know, one officer kicked him so hard and so much that he's limping around. The other when Nichols was handcuffed. I mean, he's throwing hook shots at him, punching him in the face. You know, I mean, it's as bad as it was described. I mean, there's no way of describing it any other way. I've not seen -- I was looking to see if I ever saw a sergeant or any supervisor at the scene. It's nighttime. So it's very difficult. I was looking for Chevron's or something that would indicate a supervisor. I haven't seen that yet. But that's something that I guess the police chief would know whether or not there was a supervisor on the scene, but I haven't seen one yet.",

I mean, the officers -- listen to -- they sound like they're hanging out that a barbershop or outside of a bar talking shit. That's what they sound like. They don't sound professional. They sound like they're just, hey, man making up excuses. Yes, and he did this. And he did that.I can't believe that these are professional police officers. And from the very beginning, the police chief is right. They started, they were amped up. And I believe that your panelists, Joey, all of these guys are right. All they had to do was explain to him why they were stopping him. He said, why are you stopping me? You all are doing a lot. All they had to do was tell him why they were stopping him and they didn't do it. They kept going. So what I may have run to if a bunch of people just ran up to my car and try and pull me out and became aggressive. I might do the same thing. So he runs and then they find him. It is obvious the man is trying to run home to his mom. That's what he's trying to do. So they get him in the neighborhood. And then they catch -- they put him on the ground and you hear them talking crap again, your mom, she can't hear you, as if your mom can hear you, and I'm going to tase or pepper spray the shit out of you. I'm going to baton the F out of you. They're saying all of these things -- it doesn't sound -- why? What is the need for that? And then they get him on the ground and this pole camera is -- you're right, it is the most damning. Now listen, I have to be honest. This is bad and that this man -- young man is dead. Is it Rodney King? I don't believe. I think this is Tyre Nichols. It's different. Rodney King was beat for baton for minutes. If you go back and look at the Rodney King video. Rodney King was on PCP. Says -- gives you this extra strength that police officers can tell you about. It is different. Is it just as bad? It's worse, because this man was killed. Rodney King wasn't killed. He ended up dying eventually from something else. This is awful in its own. This can stand on its own. So we don't need to do the comparisons to Rodney King. This is different. But then -- but then when he is unconscious on the ground, after they beat him and kick him, they leave him there. They prop him up against the car, he falls over, they prop him against the car, he falls over, they prop him against car, he falls over. And you have all of these people on the scene and not rendering help. This is awful. This is a failure, not only in policing. It's a failure in humanity. And I'm uncomfortable actually watching it. And I know this is my job as a journalist, but this is uncomfortable. We're watching a man being beaten to death on live television right now. It is a tape, but we're live doing it. Shimon has been sitting -- Shimon Prokupecz has been covering this. He's been standing here. We've been watching this. Both of us outraged and on the verge of tears.

And, you know, as a -- as a trauma surgeon, trauma neurosurgeon myself, you know, sometimes we'll see patients who are brought in, but we never really see this part of things.I was keeping very close track of things, both in terms of what was happening, but also the timing of things. And he was -- he was sort of dragged over to this car in handcuffs and laid up against the car. That happened around 8:33, according to the clock. It was about eight minutes later that you first saw a fire truck pull up. But nothing really happens at that point. That's what sort of stunning. I guess that's what you and Shimon are both sort of alluding to 8:55. So 15 minutes later, roughly, is when the first time he seems to be assessed, someone actually has a bag and is trying to assess him, but it's not till nine o'clock. And I don't know if we've seen this in this video yet. I watched some of that earlier, when you finally see people starting to actually administer some sort of care. So it's about a half an hour. And, you know, when you watch this, there's all sorts of different injuries he may have suffered. I mean, so many of the injuries to the head. I mean, you saw kicks to the head, you saw these, these blows to the head, punches to the head. That's obviously very, very concerning. And what can happen in that situation is that the brain may start to swell. And that's why this timing is so critical, because if the brain is swelling, he's still -- he's still seemed like he was talking at some point, but he's obviously getting worse, the brain starts to swell, then you're not getting enough oxygenated blood to the brain anymore. And that's what causes the big problem and what can lead to death ultimately. Don't know. All we've been told from the pathologist so far and from Benjamin Crump's office was that he had significant bleeding associated with the beating. We know that. We can see that. My concern is that so much of that happened inside his skull, Don. And I mean, it was just -- it was just really, really hard to watch.",
