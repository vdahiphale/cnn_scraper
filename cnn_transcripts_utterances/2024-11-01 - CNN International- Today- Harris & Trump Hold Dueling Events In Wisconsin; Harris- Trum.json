And Donald Trump, meanwhile, is using their alliance to tell his supporters that it's evidence that Republicans and Democrats have lined up against the American people, and they need someone like him to shake up the status quo.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And I wouldn't be surprised if we hear from Harris about those comments from Donald Trump about Liz Cheney. Wisconsin is a place that Harris has actually campaigned with Cheney over the last few weeks. Cheney was born in Wisconsin. So, I wouldn't be surprised if she uses that moment to address those quite alarming comments that Trump made about the firing squad. And Harris has, over the course of this campaign, tried to respond in almost real time to some of the most outrageous comments that we've heard from Trump. And so, that will be an interesting moment. Of course, part of her campaign in this final stretch is about consolidating support among women, and particularly conservative women in the suburbs.She has tried to use Liz Cheney to that effect, and Wisconsin is one of the places where that will be most critical, as she tries to build up her margins among women voters. That has been something of an imperative in this final stretch of the campaign, whether it's conservative-leaning women in the suburbs or black women or white women, really, all of these constituencies that she hopes to win over, and that will be part of her closing message in the final stretch of this campaign, where we are learning more about exactly where she will be spending time in these final couple of days, and it is in the blue wall states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all of them sort of critical, as she looks to consolidate support there. In Wisconsin today, she'll be speaking with union members. That's a critical constituency, as she looks to run up her margins there, and then it's onward to Michigan later in the week, and she will close her campaign on Monday with a bunch of stops in Pennsylvania. So, it does give you a sense of where the Harris campaign sees this race going, where it sees its winning path to 270 in the closing stretch. They do say that they have a number of different pathways, but certainly, the easiest and the most likely, in the view of the Harris campaign, is through those blue wall states, and that's why she will be campaigning so heavily in those states in the lead up to Election Day.",

And the real hope among Democrats is that voters who are turning out, who have reproductive rights on their mind as their number one issue, as they turn out for these ballot propositions, that they will also cast their vote for Harris.But, in her remarks, she really did sort of ramp up the warnings about what a Donald Trump presidency might portend for women.

So, I wanted to find the entire clip. I found the entire clip, and I did end up posting it on my personal social page, because I think the context matters.Now, you obviously don't want a candidate phrasing a topic as sensitive as this the way Donald Trump did, for obvious reasons, but I think the premise of the point which is that you have war hawks that have traditionally made very poor decisions in terms of foreign conflicts that have led to thousands of deaths, I think there is some legitimacy to that argument. But, I think that argument has lost, Rahel, based upon the way Donald Trump phrased the premise of the point. And so, we're not talking about that. Instead, we're talking about him saying, well, if Liz Cheney were to go to war and had a bunch of guns pointing to her, maybe her decisions would be different. And that's not what I think you want the argument to be at this closing stage of a campaign. SOLOMON: Paul, what do you think? Because of the context that I've seen, the war hawk was included, and so, it has been contextualized where I've seen it. But, talk to me about your reaction and what we just heard from Shermichael. PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yeah. Look, I bitterly opposed that war, but I didn't call on violence against the people who supported it. Mr. Trump should know better. Thank God he has survived two assassination attempts. Anybody should understand it's him. And Rahel, it's really just a math problem. OK? 73 million people voted for Mr. Trump. Shermichael and I are both from Texas. So, we know lots and lots and lots of people who support Trump. And I would say literally, 99.9 percent of them are really good people, the patriotic, the kind, by the way, they're not all bunch of bigots or any of that stuff that you hear. But, let's say one tenth of one percent could be moved to violence, that's still 73,000 people. Mr. Trump knows that. There is a tiny fringe in this country that loves him, and it was in all the papers. Some of them were so moved to violence that they attacked police officers at the Capitol. They attacked Officer Michael Fanone, who is a friend of mine. They tased him until his heart stopped. OK? So, it's a tiny, tiny fraction, but he should know better, and he does know better. He is doing it because he wants to incite violence because he thinks he is losing the election. That's what I mean.",

Why wasn't he trying to reach out to moderates, independents, to bring in more women, white voters, for example? And when Trump makes comments like that, or when he says things like, I'm going to protect women, whether they like it or not, when J.D. Vance says things like, Trump may earn what he called the normal gay vote, Shermichael, does it suggest that maybe they're not trying to go after independents or moderates?

And you'd much rather have Kamala's problems and potential than Mr. Trump's problems and potential. Trump is baked in. He got 45.9 percent against Hillary. He got 46.9 percent against Joe. OK? He is going to get 47 percent nationally. The question is, will that be enough to win? It was against Hillary. It was not against Biden. So, he is baked in and he just -- he is doing nothing to reach out to voters he doesn't already have.Kamala, meanwhile, she is holding together a coalition from AOC, who is a socialist, to Liz Cheney, who was a war hawk and supported that war. By the way, when I was opposing that war, I never saw Donald Trump speak out. He was hiding in the tall grass when the war was being pushed on this country. So, I'm a little skeptical of that. But, there is a piece of data that you should know, and I got it from a private source. So, I did this for a living. In Georgia, 19 percent of the early voters, key swing state, 19 percent, one in five did not vote in 2020. They're new voters. So, you dig into them, and we run through the data analytics, and the Democrats are winning those new voters by over 20 points. So, these are -- they tend to be younger. They tend to be female. They tend to be people of color, and Trump is doing everything he can to alienate them, and Kamala is doing everything she can to welcome them. And the key here is to try to get those the low-propensity voters, that Shermichael talked about, on your side to come out, and the data is telling me that Kamala is doing it and Donald has not done it yet.",

And for the first -- this was the first time in nearly a week that we have actually seen Israel carry out strikes in the Lebanese capital.But, it is part of a trend of what we have seen over the last week, in particular, as some of these diplomatic discussions have intensified, of the Israeli military intensifying its airstrikes in Lebanon. We saw, of course, not only the strikes in the Lebanese capital last night, but over the past week, we've seen strikes in southern Lebanon, as well as in the northeastern city of Baalbek, where 19 people were killed in a series of Israeli strikes there. We should note that these strikes overnight came following a particularly deadly day of Hezbollah rocket attacks in northern Israel. Seven people were killed in both the border community as well as just north of the major northern city of Haifa in the series of rocket attacks, and beyond that, of course, the intensification of Israeli military activity in Lebanon isn't necessarily an indication that Israel isn't serious about these ceasefire talks. Instead, Israeli officials have really made clear to me that they believe that this is kind of hand in hand with that diplomacy. They believe the military pressure that they are bringing to bear on Hezbollah in Lebanon has brought Hezbollah to the negotiating table, has brought them to abandon their previous position where they weren't going to stop firing rockets unless the war in Gaza stops. Now, they seem to be willing to engage in standalone ceasefire talks related to the Israel-Hezbollah war.

But, the Israeli government is still working to try and better understand Iranian decision-making at this juncture, and it still seems unclear whether or not Iran has truly made a decision to carry out a strike in retaliation for Israel's retaliatory strike last week that targeted Iranian military sites inside of that country, including in and around the Iranian capital.But, even if Iran does carry out some kind of a strike, it's really going to be a question of, what kind of strike actually does that look like? How -- is it escalatory? Is it de-escalatory? Is it kind of a tit-for-tat? That's going to determine whether or not Israel then feels compelled to fire back and whether or not this cycle of attacks between these two countries will continue, or whether perhaps it could be stemmed with some kind of a symbolic move by Iran.

As you pointed out, 12,000 jobs added net for the month of October. That was just a tenth of what we were expecting, even with the impact of the strikes over at Boeing, of course, and the impact of two hurricanes. So, it does, on the surface, look like a pretty weak number. We also saw downward revisions to the months of August and September to the tune of 112,000 jobs. It's a signal of a cooling labor market. We know that. We've seen that in other data. It's not collapsing despite that headline figure, which I appreciate, is pretty jarring for people.What's also interesting, though, and you pointed it out, a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, unchanged from September. So, I think if you take a step back and you take a deep breath, that's perhaps the number that you focus on here, because that shows that there doesn't appear to be that much impact, if any, from these strikes and storms on the overall unemployment rate. So, hold on to that. Take a look at the sectors too, and you can see the impact very quickly. Manufacturing, we saw a big plunge there, as you would expect, down some 46,000 jobs. Temporary help services also down 49,000 jobs. Government and healthcare, the big gainers. A jarring jobs report, Rahel, I will say it.

The two held dueling rallies in Nevada on Thursday, taking shots at one another, and urging voters to cast their ballots as soon as possible, and they'll do the same today in Wisconsin. In a new CNN Poll of Polls among likely voters in Wisconsin, there is no clear choice for President or a clear leader. Harris has 49 percent. Trump is close by with 46 percent.Let's get to CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is in Milwaukee, where Trump and Harris will both be today. Jeff, great to see you. I feel like whenever we talk about these states, they always feel so important. Georgia feels really important. Pennsylvania feels so important. But, how about where you are and how important that is to both campaigns? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Rahel, there is no doubt that Wisconsin is as important, if not more important, than some of the seven battleground states, and here is why. It was the closest margin of victory for Joe Biden and defeat for Donald Trump four years ago. It was the same eight years ago when Donald Trump won over Hillary Clinton in 2016. So, the sort of specter and the ghost of that campaign still sort of is informing this campaign. That's why Kamala Harris is coming back to campaign today. But, we've been talking to voters as they make up their minds, exhausted by this noisy campaign. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Let's start big picture here. It has been an especially wild week with the controversial comments from both Democrats and Republicans. How are you viewing things now four days out? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\", &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It's been an especially wild year, I mean, the most tumultuous, unpredictable presidential campaign in the modern era. I've been paying close attention since 1980. You know what's amazing, Rahel, is that nothing seems to have mattered. There have been so many ups and so many downs and so many things we could never have anticipated or foreseen, and yet, the race is pretty much where it was pre-Biden-Trump debate when President Biden had that unfortunate night. I most want to know, I most want to know if the Donald Trump vote is being underreported, because when you look at the data, in comparison to 2016 and 2020, he is in the strongest position that he has ever been. And in 2016, he was undervalued. And in 2020, the same deal. So, on one hand, you could say he is going to outperform the polls again, and he wins. On the other hand, you could say, perhaps there is a shy Kamala Harris vote or that the pollsters have corrected for their past mistakes. That's X, the unknown.",
