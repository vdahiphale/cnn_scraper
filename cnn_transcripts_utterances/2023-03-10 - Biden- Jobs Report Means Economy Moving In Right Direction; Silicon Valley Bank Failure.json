This is the biggest failure since 2008, the second biggest failure ever since Washington mutual in September of 2008. This is a major lender to tech start-ups. The FDIC said insured depositors will have full access to insured deposits by Monday morning. Insured deposits, that means up to $250,000. We know that some small businesses, some startups, some individuals have more than that $250,000. It's not clear if they'll get all their money back. This is not sitting well in the marketplace. We see the Dow is down by more than 250 points. Banks are leading the way lower. The good news here is experts I'm talking to are hopeful that this is an isolated incident, that this is not part of a broader systemic issue. Mark Zandi told me, the chief analyst at Moody's Analytics, he told me he doesn't think this failure is symptomatic of a broader problem in the banking industry. Let's hope not.

Also the author of \"The System, Who Rigged It and How We Fix It.\"Secretary Reich, always good to have you. Let's start where Matt ended, with this Silicon Valley Bank. The FDIC now in control. There were some stumbles from Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America. What does this mean for people outside of the Silicon Valley bank universe? What does it mean for the average borrower, if anything? ROBERT REICH, FORMER U.S. LABOR SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON: So far, it doesn't mean anything. The big question is one of contagion. ,That is what we saw in 2008 was when one big bank, then a couple others started to fail, could not pay what they owed and they were closed and regulators had to move in very, very quickly. We ended up with a financial crisis because, you know, one big banking card easily starts tipping other cards. It's a house of cards. We don't know yet about contagion. What we do know is this bank was overextended. And this is related to the Fed. As interest rates went up and this bank was lending to a lot of start-ups, this bank could not handle it. I think this is the biggest economic news today. It's not this jobs report. The jobs report was good. And it signals to me a soft landing. But I think, in terms of what the Fed is going to do, this bank implosion, this potential contagion, may reverse Jerome Powell's direction. It may lead instead of a half point increase, it may lead to no increase. It's conceivable that interest rates stop dropping out of a fear that we'll be in deep trouble.",

The key here is the direction. If inflation were increasing, that would be one thing. If inflation is starting to slow down and we're seeing it going in the right direction, then it's not clear that the Fed has to keep raising interest rates and risking a recession that's going to hurt everybody.",

The FDA is now recommending all mammogram centers inform women if they have dense breast tissue because it poses a higher risk for break cancer. GOLODRYGAfully understand the complex issues around breast density. We're joined by Dr. Esther Choo. She's a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health and Science University. Doctor, thank you so much. I believe knowledge is wealth and women should have access to this information. The question is, why isn't the FDA taking the extra step in saying not only should women be told if they have dense breast, but should be advised by doctors to have an additional sonogram after the mammogram? DR. ESTHER CHOO, PROFESSOR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE, OREGON HEALTH &amp; SCIENCE UNIVERSITY: Thanks for having me on. This is a complicated issue. It comes down to individual total risk and decision making. Basically, what this dense breast tissue means is, one, they have increased risk for future issues, and also that the mammogram that detected this breast density, more fibrous tissue, made the mammogram less sensitive. This still remains one risk factors among many. The increased risk can be between 1 percent and 4 percent. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to jump in and add a bunch of other modalities, whether ultrasound or MRI, but it means it will prompt a conversation between the patient and their health care provider about their total risk and what to do going forward. For some women, instead of going to, say, spaced out mammograms at a certain age, that they'll continue to have annual mammograms and continue to screen many women.",

The risk goes up astronomically as you get older.Women who have a strong family history of breast cancer may opt to get screening mammograms earlier. However, in general, if you start young, you will be more likely to pick up false positives that can lead to a ton of unnecessary testing and cost and do more harm than good. Understand that this issue of breast density has been known by radiologists for many years. It's just that information hasn't been well translated to the public, communicated directly with patients. They didn't know to incorporate it into their understanding of the breast cancer risk.",
