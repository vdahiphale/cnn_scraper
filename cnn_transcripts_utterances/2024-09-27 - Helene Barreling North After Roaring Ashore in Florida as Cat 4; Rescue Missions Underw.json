A life and death situation after Hurricane Helene made landfall as the strongest hurricane on record to hit Florida's Big Bend. I'm John Berman in Tallahassee Florida this morning where it's mostly just messy. This city did not see the worst of it.The storm made landfall near Perry about an hour from now as a Category 4 storm with 140-mile-per-hour winds. It is now a tropical storm as it moves over Georgia. This is affecting so many states. And as everyone wakes up this morning, we're only beginning to get a sense of the impact. This morning, first responders, they are seeing scenes like this. This was South Pasadena, Florida, a flooded home on fire, dumpsters floating through the floodwaters. In Steinhatchee, Florida, a house just floated away on the water. Just part of the aftermath of just a record breaking storm surge that has impacted coastal communities. Nine feet in some areas this morning, nine feet of storm surge. And overnight deputies in Lee County began going out to check on people who stayed behind. At least four deaths now have been reported from Helene, two in Georgia, one in Florida, one in North Carolina. Power is out for nearly 3 million people in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. Happening now, dozens of airboat rescues are underway in Citrus County, Florida. That is about 170 miles from where I am in Tallahassee. It's between Tampa and Cedar Key. With us now is Sheriff Mike Prendergast, the sheriff of Citrus County. Sheriff, thank you so much for being with us. I understand water rescues have been taking place all night long. Give us a sense of what's happening now.",

      "sentences": "John, we're getting pounded by rain right now. This is probably the heaviest amount of rain that we've received in the last four or five hours or so. We believe that brain total now is above eight inches with the last 48 hours or so. This was a very dry city for the last 60 days. We've got a cold front that came through and dropped a lot of rain and now we have this additional rain coming from the storm.I want to point in the distance here. You can see we're at an apartment complex that has dealt with flooding issues. And you can see those cars over there that are underwater. That gives you just how dangerous this has been recently. But we want to show you this video from an early morning water rescue that has taken place just in the last hour or so. We know 25 rescues have been performed by the Atlanta Fire Department. They've had to use boats to go rescue citizens from their homes or their apartments. We know that they've had to get pets. They've had to get infants out. Because this rain is falling so fast and it's accumulating, there have been several creeks that have overflowed. It is creating a pooling situations with the rain. And so when you put that on top of the idea that we have all these large trees in the area that have been dry for quite some time, several trees have fallen throughout the Atlanta area creating power outages throughout the Metro. But the real concern right now is the fast moving water. In fact, just in the distance here, we've had seen several people trying to use jeeps to get to friends who live in this apartment complex and now they're trying to back out. But you see how heavy and how fast the water is accumulating here on the ground. They're trying to tell people to stay home. Mostly the roads are clear, but there have been people who have been venturing out in the last half hour or so, John, to see what's going on. Obviously, you want to tell people to stay home until at least first light so you can see the roads ahead of you. Because this area here, you would not know it's flooding until you're right up on the water. So, that is the situation right now in Atlanta with the water continuing to fall. The good news here so far, not heavy winds that were anticipated to come through here. There have been gusts above 25 miles per hour, but not the consistent 25 to 35 mile per hour winds that with the combination of the wind and the rain could knock down trees in the city that has a great tree cover all over the area. Also talking about the airport, we know there's been more than 100 canceled flights so far, but this is a fast-moving storm. There is a belief that maybe by this afternoon, this will push its way through this area. But right now, the real concerns are the rescues that are going on with first responders getting out here at night, saving people from their homes. John?",

It's been a long time since the city of Atlanta has had to deal with a tropical storm. Got to think about how far we away from the coast.We're several hours away from where you are.

      "sentences": "Right, that's right. And I want to emphasize here, John, the storm has made landfall, but this does not mean it's over. In fact, for some of these areas, portions of Georgia and the Carolinas, the worst is actually yet to come. You can see now the bulk of the storm starting to spread into the Carolinas still has sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, and that's what's triggering a significant number of power outages here. Over 3 million people spread out from Florida, Georgia and into the Carolinas, all without power as of now.And it's not surprising when you look at some of these wind gusts. Perry, Florida, not far from where the storm made landfall, 99 miles per hour. But here's an interesting point, Douglas, Georgia, more than 90 miles away from the coast, also had a 90 mile-per hour wind gusts. So, that's why you're seeing these power outages even very far inland in some of these communities. Right now, you've still got several areas, Augusta gusting up to 60 miles an hour, Atlanta around 40 miles per hour, Charlotte about 45 to 50 mile-per-hour wind gusts. So, you're going to continue to see those power outage numbers unfortunately go up in the next couple of hours. Rain has also been a huge concern here. You can see the bulk of it still across portions of Georgia and now spreading into Tennessee, a lot of heavy rain still across the Carolinas and even some tornado warnings that we still have valid. These watches are in effect for a few more hours and they could even expand northward just because that's where the threat is going to be today. But flooding by far is the greatest threat that we have for a lot of these areas. The green is a flood watch where the potential exists for flooding. The red areas, this is where we have flash flooding, ongoing flooding concerns right now. Anywhere you see these white boxes, including the one around Atlanta and then several here in Western North Carolina, these are flash flood emergencies. That is the highest level of threat that you can possibly get in terms of a flooding scale. And look at this. We're all of these white boxes in and around Western North Carolina. This area has had over ten inches of rain, some areas over a foot of rain in the last 48 hours, and it's all come down quickly. There have been reports of landslides. There have been reports of numerous car water rescues, not to mention how many streets in these areas that are just entirely underwater. The unfortunate part is for these areas more rain is on the way and will be for hours, John. This is not just another 30 minutes. There will be hours more of rainfall on top of these communities.",
