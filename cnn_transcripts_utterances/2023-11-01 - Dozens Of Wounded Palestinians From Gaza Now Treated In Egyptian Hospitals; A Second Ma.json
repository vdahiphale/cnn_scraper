      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right, Bianna and Zain. It's been more than 300 already. And let me tell you, it's been hard to figureout exactly what the strategy of the Israel Defense Forces is. During the second week of the war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant were sending signals about a possible all-out massive ground incursion. Then we learned about targeted raids where special forces would go in, strike a target in Gaza and then leave. They were defined then as limited in scope. It was not until the last several days that there was a true ground incursion, but not as big as you would have expected. Earlier today, the Israel Defense Forces said it had struck over 11,000 targets belonging to terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip since the war started on October 7th. And that's an average of more than 440 strikes per day for the first 25 days of the war. As for the last 24 hours, the IDF said its combined troops struck several targets throughout the Gaza Strip including operational command centers as well as Hamas cells. And the most controversial military decision yet -- and we were talking about this just before with Salma -- the IDF targeted the Jabalia refugee camp. This is the largest one of eight in Gaza. The Israeli military explained its decision, saying, that there were several Hamas terrorists who barricaded themselves in a multi-story building which was located near a school, a medical center, and government offices in the Jabalia area. They also said a top commander was hiding in a network of tunnels there. That building was subsequently struck by the Israel Air Force. And the IDF has also released video of strikes on multiple locations, as well as soldiers on the front line moving through the Gaza rubble. But again, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly, especially what the end goal is going to be and if it is to eliminate completely Hamas. As the Prime Minister has said, how they're going to go about doing that exactly, especially considering what happened yesterday in the Jabalia area. Bianna, Zain.",

And we know that Hamas has proposed a deal, which is very, very difficult for Israel to accept. If this is true, the deal that they have proposed is all the hostages for all the prisoners in Israeli prison. We're talking about 7000 people, including 559 Palestinians who have killed Israelis and are serving life sentences -- some of them multiple life sentences. It includes 130 of the terrorists who were caught inside of Israel after October 7th, who also committed brutal murder. It includes 20 to 30 percent of the prisoners being members of Hamas. The overwhelming majority are from the West Bank, not from Gaza. So, there are a few questions that are unknown. One is, is Hamas willing to release all the hostages at one time? If it's done in phases, then no one in Israel would agree to it. And the second question is, what do we do with all the prisoners once they're released? How does their release endanger Israeli citizens from suffering further death as a result of the prisoner release? Now, we don't know for sure that this is the deal, but it is 100 percent sure that the only way to get all the hostages home safely is through a deal with Hamas. And this is an impossible dilemma for the Israeli government. And we lack, I think, the kind of public pressure that existed at the time that Gilad Shalit was in captivity. And we lack the strong prime minister than Netanyahu was at that time. Netanyahu has never been weaker. And I'm not sure that he and his government have the moral courage to make the decision to save the lives of all the hostages, that they have a moral responsibility to save.",

Gershon, there's so little that we do know, and understandably, it's very difficult to take Hamas at their word in terms of where these hostages are and how they are doing. There are some in Israel who are worried that perhaps many of these hostages may no longer be alive. Which brings me to my question -- yesterday, I spoke with a man named Moshe Lavi and he joined me to talk about his brother-in-law, Omri Miron, who is one of the hostages that is being held. And he had just been told that Omri is alive. So, I'm curious where that type of information would come from. And obviously, that would be very welcome news.

We can assume that they're spread out into small groups throughout the enormous network of tunnels underneath Gaza. My sense is that we have days, not longer than that, to have a deal to save them. Once Israel enters the tunnels, once there are forces going in with whatever weapons they will use, the hostages are going to be between the Israeli troops and the Palestinians who are holding the hostages, and then they're in direct harm's way, and the possibility of a deal being made is much, much smaller.",

Exactly who is being prioritized, how that list is working, we don't really have any clarity on. There are images coming to us from the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing of families desperately trying to see if their names are amongst those being allowed through. Clearly, for them, this has been an extremely long wait. You're talking about families who very quickly moved south in the Gaza Strip after hearing noy just the Israeli order to evacuate the north of the Gaza Strip, but also the IDF from none other than the State Department, in the case of the Americans, that those with dual or foreign nationality would be allowed to make it through the Rafah crossing. Ever since, those families, those dual and foreign nationals have been at the Rafah crossing, often under Israeli bombardment, since it's been Gaza- wide over the course of the last three and a half weeks and facing so many of those difficulties that we've been covering ever since the war began -- the lack of food, the lack of water, there is no sanitation inside the Gaza Strip. And the wait for them has been an extremely long one. Still, this is an important development, and it is really remarkable. The breakthrough we heard about this morning -- it is the result of a deal that would have been extremely complex and was certainly shrouded in secrecy. We had heard nothing about it even yesterday when we spent the day at the Rafah crossing with the Egyptian prime minister, a deal broken, as you say, by Qatar in coordination with the United States between Israel, Hamas, and Egypt. Many of those parties don't speak directly with one another. Getting here was remarkably difficult. The process now is also very logistically complex. Still, as you mentioned a moment ago, Zain, four Italian nationals -- what we know about them is that they were working for international aid agencies inside the Gaza Strip. And I think this is a lot of the profiles that you're going to see coming out -- people who are working with the agencies. You're also going to see foreign nationals, regional nationals who've gone in to visit family or were living inside Gaza when the war broke out. Very quickly after it broke out, Israel announced that total siege, and ever since, they simply haven't been able to get out. And I think what's going to be important over the coming hours and days as we await the rest of those foreign and dual nationals is to get an idea of their stories, to hear exactly what they've been seeing and what's been going on because of the difficulty of getting any information out of the Gaza Strip. There are still a few journalists, those who were in there before the 7th of October, who were able to operate. The aid agencies, of course, giving us precious information. But it is those stories from the people coming out that are going to be of critical value to us to get an idea of what is happening to the so many Gazans who remain inside under that strict total siege and with so many difficulties when it comes to day-to-day lives. I would add, Zain, that in addition to those dual and foreign nationals, we've also seen 81 Palestinians, the very first Palestinians -- the very first Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, allowed out today to get emergency treatment for some of the most severely wounded.

So, the problem from the Israeli intelligence point of view is not just to rescue the hostages, soldiers and civilians as dangerous as it is, but also to know where they are. And they are scattered all over. And they are investing enormous effort. What we saw, this specific targeted point operation to rescue the soldier was the result of massive collection of intelligence by hundreds, if not more, of Israelis defense officials and experts trying to identify where exactly are they holding it and if it is possible with reasonable risk to free any of them.",

So, the New York Attorney General has sued Donald Trump and those two sons alleging thatthey had inflated the value of their assets on their financial statements that were given to banks and in exchange they received favorable interest in loans which helped enrich them. So, today we are actually hearing the testimony of the Attorney General's expert witness in this case. And he has just testified that through these inflated state financial statements, which the judge has already found to be fraudulent, that the Trumps had benefitted by the tune of $168 million. Now, remember, James had sued seeking $250 million in discouragement and damages. So, this is their expert now saying that they actually benefited by at least $168 million on four specific loans at issue in the case. So, that when this is under cross-examination and after his cross-examination wraps, that is when Donald Trump, Jr. will take the stand, the first of the Trumps to testify in this case. Now, Donald Trump, Jr. had signed the financial statements at issue here since 2017. When his father became president, he also signed annual bank certifications saying to the banks as part of these loans that Trump's net worth remained above $2.5 billion. So, he's expected to be questioned about that. Now, he has testified in a deposition last year where he said that he had no recollection of being involved in the preparation of the financial statements. He said he didn't approve them. He didn't review them. And when he signed those bank certifications, he said he did so after speaking with lawyers and accountants. So, his testimony last year was distancing himself from these statements at the heart of the case and we expect that he will continue with that posture today. Now, this cross-examination will continue once we get to the after the lunch break, which goes for about an hour. They estimated that they could have another hour's worth of cross, so Donald Trump Jr. could get on the stand just before the end of the day or it could lead into tomorrow. Bianna, Zain?",

That same year, Mau Mau freedom fighters led by Dedon Kamathi rebelled against British rule. London responded by declaring a state of emergency, and its military rounded up more than 90,000 Kenyans who were tortured, maimed and or killed, according to the Kenyan Human Rights Commission. Their death warrants signed by the British hang in the tunnel of martyrs in Nairobi today. Those who died in the resistance are honored here at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, along with all of Kenya's fallen heroes. King Charles coming here to lay a wreath. But for many Kenyans they want more than gestures. FOSTER (voice-over):  The British government did concede in 2013 that it sincerely regretted the abuses, but it hasn't accepted responsibility or liability. But it has paid out a settlement of $30 million to more than 5000 Kenyans who claimed human rights abuses. This mural depicts Kemafe.
