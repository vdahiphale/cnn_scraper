Let's take a look at the aggregate to see if we have that same trend line. And yeah, we do, Sara. You know, Trump had a small advantage, again, within the margin of error back in February.

I expect it to be much larger.I think a lot of Joe Biden fans expect to be much larger, ergo, he could easily exceed those expectations and perhaps gain the polls. But in fact, it's just Trump by five. That's not much different where we were going into the first debate back in 2020 in September, where Trump was favored by just one point in a USC poll. So basically, debate expectations here are about in line with where they were four years ago, Sara. Trump with a small advantage. Of course, I will note that Biden easily won in the post-debate polls back in 2020. We'll see if the same thing occurs right here.",

And I think that is something to really look at.And a lot of people are saying, how are people changing their mind at this point in the game? Well, I think what you're seeing is that support for Joe Biden is a little bit soft. And there's some people who are tepid about supporting Donald Trump because the issues that matter most to them about the economy and immigration are important. But when they look at what's happened with his convicted status and when they look at what's happening otherwise, they're like, I'm just not sure that I can vote for Donald Trump. The other thing that I think is really important is we're starting to hear Joe Biden talk more about these potential two Supreme Court justice vacancies that are going to come up in the next term. I think that is incredibly important to independent voters, in particular female voters who are going to go out and vote on women's rights.

And a lot of parents have children who are alcoholics or addicted to drugs or have other issues. The one thing about Joe Biden that I think everybody understands is he really loves his son. And as a father, if he conveys that love for his son on the debate stage, I actually think it's a net positive for him because it's the same struggle that a lot of parents have. Look, I wouldn't disown my son if something happened to him. That was really awful. And I think most parents wouldn't either. And I think that's something that Biden will convey.

What really is relevant is some of the bigger concerns that we have about Joe Biden himself. And I think that's a smarter strategy. And if I were Donald Trump, rather than going after Hunter Biden at all, what I would be doing is leaning into some of the messaging that he's been doing that's working, interestingly enough, where he's wearing his conviction as sort of almost a badge of honor saying, I'm doing this as my patriotic duty. I'm going to fight for the Constitution. I will -- you know, and somehow, and I'm not sure that I quite fully understand and appreciate it yet, is that voters are finding that, you know what, he's willing to fight for us and we've got to fight for him.

The focus of his documentary, The Last Alzheimer's Patient, which is now streaming on Max. Here with us now seen a Chief Medical Correspondent and Neurosurgeon, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.Sanjay, great to see you. So this question comes from Gita in Houston, asking, can daily mental exercises or doing words with friends or paper-based crossword puzzles reduce your odds of getting dementia? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, look, there's a lot of questions about this, and people often use brain training exercises with the hopes of reducing their risk. The truth is there's -- there's not a lot of data on this to suggest that actually reduces your risk of dementia. What crossword puzzles and word games are probably really good at is making you better at crossword puzzles and word games. What you -- think of it like this, what you need to be doing to really build what's called cognitive resilience in your brain is doing different sorts of activities, taking up a new hobby, learning a new instrument, learning a new language, learning to paint, for example. So something that you can do that's a hobby that preferably includes some sort of motor component, something with your hands. Those are going to be better things, instruments and painting, for example. The best evidence, John, interestingly, is really around movement. When we are moving, when brisk movement, you tend to generate more growth of new brain cells. If you do that with somebody else, cultivating that connection at the same time, even better. So, John, for you, take a brisk walk with Kerry, your wife. That is probably going to do more for your brain in the future than doing a crossword puzzle.",

It's sort of preordained. I can't act on it. So it's just going to cause me worry and anxiety. I think both those things are changing.The testing is getting better and it's becoming clearer. There are things you can do about it. First of all, keep in mind, a quarter of people who have Alzheimer's do have some sort of family history. But that also means 75% of people who have Alzheimer's don't. So there's a relationship here, but it's not a really strong relationship. Having said that, getting your genetic testing, I think, could be important because I think there are ways to act upon that now. But also keeping in mind that there is a strong relation between the body and the brain. So all these modifiable risk factors that you see on the screen, those are really important to control. We typically think of those as related to heart disease, but now we know they are strongly related to dementia as well. One of the -- one of the ones I'll highlight, John, number two, their hearing loss. It's very interesting how many people come in with their families saying, I think my loved one is developing signs of dementia. Do a hearing test. And you realize that, in fact, it's been undiagnosed hearing problems for a long time that could be contributing to those symptoms. So don't jump to the diagnosis of dementia. Realize there are modifiable risk factors. And I think at this point, it's good. It's good information to go ahead and get the testing.",
