You've got to converse with - with all people up here and all sides, with different opinions. First of all, we have to recognize we have a $31.5 trillion debt that's not getting any smaller. And we're in a - we're, right now -- we said we're writing checks our children can't cash. So, we have a responsibility to say this debt, in the last two decades, has grown over $20 trillion to $25 trillion. It's unacceptable. It's just wrong. So, we have to, sooner or later. And this is a time, it seems like, of the high theatrics can go on, but 2011 didn't - didn't work out well for anybody. And a lot of people were harmed. And we shouldn't go through that again.

The mother of Tyre Nichols, the father of Tyre Nichols, Benjamin Crump, the family attorney, also saying that this needs to be a blueprint of how to move forward in these cases and that there needs to be better training and that our laws need to be changed.

She'll never be able to hug him. She's going to miss his smile.And we were talking just about the pain that that family is feeling and, you know, what the potential reaction is going to be to this video. Senator Manchin was talking about training for officers and what that needs to look like. And, you're right, there are -- we are hearing these calls from a lot of these officials about what needs to happen here in Washington, how they believe that needs to change. But it is remarkable to see the interviews that you've done this morning, you know, with the police chief, with the family, talking about what the reaction in that community looks like.",

You and I talk about cooking. I told you that my mom was in town and I was gaining weight because she was cooking red beans and rice. And so it became very relatable to me when she said I'm no longer be able to cook for my son.These are human beings. They're families. They're just like you. They're just like me. And just like the folks who are watching. And so I hope that our viewers take away the humanity in all of this and realize that there are -- no one is perfect, as the mother has been saying. The officers, obviously, aren't perfect and the people who come in contact with police officers. And we need to figure out how we can bridge the gap between the two so that a routine traffic stop does not lead to death.",
