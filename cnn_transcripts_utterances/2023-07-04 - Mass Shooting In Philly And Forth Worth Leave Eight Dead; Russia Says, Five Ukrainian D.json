Philadelphia authorities captured a suspect they say wore body armor and a ski mask as he shot and killed five people and injured two children. While just a few hours later, in Fort Worth, Texas, a gunman indiscriminately fired into a crowd, killing three.Also tonight, the Kremlin claims it foiled a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, calling the attempted strike a, quote, terrorist attack. This as Russia's relentless shelling kills two in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson. CNN is live on the ground in Ukraine. Plus, today is not a holiday for Republicans hoping to move into the White House in 2024. They're hitting the campaign trail and parade routes in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off. I'm Alex Marquardt, and this is a Situation Room special report. We begin this hour with the two deadly mass shootings, bringing the U.S. total for the year to 346. Philadelphia officials announced the suspect there will be arraigned on murder charges on Wednesday at a press conference a short while ago. CNN's Senior National Correspondent Ed Lavandera has the details.

Last year, over the July 4th weekend, there were 17 mass shootings, one of which was Highland Park. You have several factors that converge in the summer. You have a lot of people off from work and school. You have the heat. Alcohol is a factor. But most importantly, you have easy access to guns. And that one really makes a difference, because this is a distinctly American phenomenon. It's also a recent phenomenon.So, I was looking through Gun Violence Archive, and we've actually had 348 mass shootings this year so far. We've had two since I've been sitting here. A decade ago, we had by the end of the July 4th weekend, 118. So, that's a 200 percent increase in ten years. We have now three times more mass shootings than we did a decade ago. And it's not really a mystery why this is happening. Gun production is ramping up to record levels. Just since the first year of the pandemic alone, we've had 50 million guns produced for the domestic market, which means guns purchased for protection, for self-defense, are now readily accessible in times of conflict and crisis.",

If you're looking at a place like Baltimore or even Philadelphia, I think there are people who have been dealing with this issue for so many years and decades that, unfortunately, they know to spring into action. There are moms across the country who have lost children to gun violence, who when they see this sort of news, they know it's time to mobilize.Now, in places where this, quote/unquote, isn't supposed to happen or doesn't happen as frequently, you know, which is code for like a white suburban area, like a Highland Park or something, the reaction -- I think people are more likely to look to law enforcement for answers, to really call for assault weapon bans in the immediate aftermath. So, it's certainly a mix. But one thing that remains a constant throughout these situations is just the devastation, as Ed said. It lasts for years and decades. And I'm particularly concerned about the impact this is going to have on children and teenagers. They're constantly exposed to gun violence. And during the summertime, we know that young people don't always have the ability to go to the recreation center every day. If they have some sort of school-based program, that's only in the morning and early afternoon. So, I really think it's incumbent on our state leaders to make sure when these kids get back to school, they are able to talk about these things in a professional and safe environment to process what they have seen early in the summer, and, unfortunately, based on the way the U.S. has been set up lately, what they'll likely see over the next few months before they return to school. So, each community is utterly devastated, but the responses will vary and are on state leaders to ensure that they happen.",

And so it makes it more difficult.But despite all that, we have a problem with just people, just violence, the violent nature of some people who would just take a firearm, AR-15, semiautomatic, and just randomly spray a crowd of people. Just -- I mean, it is totally ridiculous what's going on now. I mean, there are so many guns out there, but part of the problem, also the people that don't hesitate to use a gun to commit a violent crime. So, this is something that has to be addressed. We haven't done a good job. We talk about it. We pray about it. But we don't do anything about it. And it's not going to stop. It's going to continue, and the numbers are going to continue to rise until finally we wake up as a nation and realize this is not normal. We cannot accept it.

An adviser to the president said there's a 50/50 possibility of something happening there. And we got a statement from the army saying that they have observed foreign items similar to explosive devices being put on the roof of two of the plant's power units. Now, we've heard previous talk from the head of Ukrainian intelligence that some of the cooling ponds at that plant are mined and that the Russians have deployed explosive-laden trucks outside of four of the power plant's six reactors.

Unfortunately, neither Israel learned the lesson nor the international community nor the U.S. administration.

And, of course, a lot of these GOP presidential hopefuls who were marching, among them Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who made multiple stops across the state here in New Hampshire over the course of today, meeting folks on the ground, hand shaking, doing what a lot of these candidates do in stops like these, trying to make truly on-the-ground inroads into what has been a large shadow over the GOP field at this point.By that I mean polling has shown former President Trump far and away the leader by choice, at least so far in this early contention field. And it's even why a spokesperson for the pro-DeSantis super PAC never back down acknowledged that they feel they are way behind when it comes to polling. Not that they feel this race is unwinnable, but they clearly have their work set out for them. It may be why we saw DeSantis over the course of today with his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis in Florida, and his family as well, trying to maybe make inroads there as opposed to the stark contrast of President Trump, which for him approaching 80 years old. So, trying to paint potentially a contrasting picture there. But DeSantis wasn't the only one out and about. We also saw South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, former Texas Congressman Will Hurd trying to do the same things, again build on what has been or cut into what has been a pretty sizable deficit in the polling. But also just to make some name recognition, likely for a lot of these voters who are getting to know these candidates for the first time. And when you look at tent poles, the first tent pole that really everyone seems to be gravitating around is trying to make it on to the debate stage in August. They hope any performance this can propel them into when voters here in New Hampshire actually vote in early 2024. But you've got to get on the ground here, and these are some of the first steps that we've seen from these candidates, at least here in New Hampshire. Plus, what's more American than running for president and campaigning on the Fourth of July?",

But then actual person- to-person campaigning is probably more important in Iowa than in New Hampshire, where the total turnout is smaller. New Hampshire is a primary, it's bigger. Ultimately, it is moved by national currents and kind of national developments.We have had, you know, in Republican primaries going back to 1980, which is really the modern era of the primary system, the front-runner has always been defeated in either Iowa or New Hampshire. It's happened every time back to 1980. Then South Carolina picks one of those two winners of those first two states, but one has then won South Carolina, and that's the nominee. Front-runner has almost always come back and succeeded if that way, but there is traditionally an opening in these early states. Could be more likely in Iowa than New Hampshire, given that Iowa is so heavily tilted toward evangelicals where there might be room for an alternative to Trump. But this is what you see, if you're one of those other candidates, you have to break through in one of those first two states to have any chance at dethroning Trump.",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, these retail politics are important. Meeting as many voters as possible in these early states is vital. These states that hold the early nominating contests, they aren't that big.And when you speak to Republicans in Iowa, they expect to meet these candidates not once but multiple times to get to know them, to get to know their families. Governor DeSantis' wife is going to be campaigning in Iowa later this week with the governor. These are helpful to him. But I will say that even though he's clung to the cultural battles, red meat, and that is really going to help him in this Republican primary, he's already taken positions on abortion, a number of other issues alienating to a general election audience. I was speaking to a Republican donor, for instance, who was supporting Governor DeSantis, abandoned DeSantis, now supports Senator Tim Scott, and says to me that he thinks that Senator Scott has a better chance of winning in a general election if he clears this Republican primary. MARQUARDT: And Trump does have, as we've been saying, such a commanding lead, double digits in this race, Ron. So, how much does the president, the former president rather, really need to get out there and join the rest of the Republican field for events like this in Iowa and New Hampshire?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, look, his lead in the Republican primary is as big as we've seen any frontrunner have this far from the voting in either party. And he, in particular, is recreating and even enhancing the coalition he had in 2016 when he won the nomination. Once again, he's only winning a third of Republicans with a college degree, about what he got last time. The rest of them are not unifying behind one alternative as happened last time.And he's winning even more Republicans without a college degree than last time, over 50 percent, incredible number in a field this big. And partly because of the way Trump has reconfigured the party, may be even bigger share of the primary electorate in 2024 than they were in 2016. So, he is in a very strong position and the onus is clearly on the others to find a rationale and argument to dislodge him. I think DeSantis has taken steps, running at him mostly from the right, which could be a problematic strategy if he succeeds to the general election. I think the others, other than Chris Christie, they're just milling around. Donald Trump is in position you have to give Republican voters a clear reason to move past him despite all the red flags about him as a candidate again in light of all the indictments.",

But we still have a lot of lightning across the Deep South even at this hour, and the potential for severe weather, Minnesota, Nebraska and Kansas.Look at the number here on the screen, 724. That's the number of lightning strikes from clouds to the ground in the last minute. One minute's worth of lightning. That's going to change, it's a rolling total. But that's how much lightning is striking the ground, mainly across the Deep South. Things have moved away from the Northeast, going to dry up for Fourth of July. Pretty decent across Philadelphia, had one big storm earlier here. Camden County, a severe storm and flash flooding going on, but D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, Virginia, much, much better. One little storm just popped around Atlanta, especially on the south side. But across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and even almost to Memphis, we have all of this lightning still flashing out here. You have to be very careful with this. The true severe weather tonight is actually happening across parts of Nebraska, probably Omaha in a couple of hours. Columbus, Nebraska, all the way down into Kansas. Some of these hailstones has been as big as tennis balls. So, you don't want to look at fireworks and have to run to your car. Keep that in mind as this weather moves off to the east. And then Omaha, 9:00, that's your bogey, that's your sunset time. So, you're going to have to be careful with the weather from the west. It's going to take a while for this to go away. But the Southeast, it goes away as well. It's just going to take a few hours. Take your time, stay safe -- Alex.",
