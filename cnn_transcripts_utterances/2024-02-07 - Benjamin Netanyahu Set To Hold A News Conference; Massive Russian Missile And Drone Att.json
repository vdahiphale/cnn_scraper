Hamas delivers its three-phase plan for de- escalation. This hour we'll hear from Benjamin Netanyahu -- from him himself and his reaction for the very first time. Also ahead, a failed impeachment, the collapse of a border deal and a presidential candidate who lost to no one. We'll take a look at the chaos in the Republican Party. And later, Taylor takes Tokyo. Japanese Swifties fill the streets ahead of the megastar's performance here from one fan who, get this, has quit her job to devote her life to Taylor. Live from New York, I'm Paula Newton. Glad you could be with us. Zain and Brianna have the day off. And we are watching \"One World\" at this hour from New York. America's top diplomat is holding crucial meetings meantime with Israeli and Palestinian officials as he pushes for humanitarian pause in Israel's war with Hamas and discusses the response from Hamas to a proposal to release the remaining hostages it holds. Antony Blinken is in talks with Palestinian Authority President, meantime, Mahmoud Abbas, that's in Ramallah. Now, after meeting Israel's President a short time ago, we are now getting new details of that Hamas counter proposal. The group is outlining a three-phase plan lasting several months. That would include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Already, one Israeli official, as I was saying, says the Hamas proposal is, in fact, a non-starter. Blinken says much work lies ahead. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The hostages are foremost on our minds and in our hearts. And as you know, we now have a response from Hamas to the proposal that was put on the table the way forward. We're looking at it intensely as is, I know, the Government of Israel and there is a lot of work to be done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We will bring that to you live. In the meantime, the diplomatic push comes amidst intense fighting in Gaza. Israel is pushing to capture Khan Younis, the main city in the south of the enclave. Now, this drone video shows the scale of destruction in Gaza after four months of war. Aid workers are warning of dire consequences if Israel expands its operations further south into Gaza. CNN is tracking the story from every angle. Alex Marquardt is in Washington, D.C. but we begin now with Jeremy Diamond who is on the ground in Tel Aviv. And Jeremy, we were just talking about Antony Blinken and the fact that he says so much more work needs to be done. Can you give us some insight though into any common ground here that we might see, especially when we talk about the first phase of this agreement.",

Alex, to you now, and I know you've been following thisfor several months, trying to figure out exactly what kind of pressure the U.S. can bring to bear. So, given the fact that there might be some common ground, what do you think the odds are that the U.S. can pressure perhaps both Israel and Hamas to come up with some kind of agreement, at least to get us through that first phase of this deal?",

      "sentences": "Well, the first phase, I think, Paula, is key. And I think U.S. officials, certainly theones I've been speaking with, are seeing that as a way to cracking open the door and getting to objectives that they have farther down the line. As Jeremy was just saying, when you look at the elements of the first phase of the deal, there's a lot of overlap between what Israel proposed and what Hamas is proposing, of course, with that major sticking point over the prisoners. But when it comes to releasing civilian hostages, when it comes to releasing lower-level prisoners, getting humanitarian aid into Gaza and agreeing to a pause in the fighting, that is -- those are elements that both sides can agree to and should be relatively easy to get off the ground. So, with the sense that I am getting is that they want to get into that first phase and then start discussing the more complicated parts of phases two, three and beyond. And that's really where the U.S. pressure is going to be brought to bear. Netanyahu certainly is facing an immense amount of domestic pressure to get those hostages home. But they're also -- he's also facing U.S. pressure to wind down this war. And the U.S. has been very careful to stand by Israel, not call for a ceasefire, not call for an end to the war, support Israel at the United Nations. And so, there are a lot of carrots that the U.S. can certainly offer and is offering Netanyahu and his government to get to this humanitarian pause to this truce in the fighting. Of course, the U.S. still sending massive amounts of military aid. So far, there's no -- there are no conditions on that military aid, though some Democrats in Congress are pushing for that. Another major prize for Netanyahu could be normalization with Saudi Arabia. That for now is not off the table. That's something certainly that the U.S. is pushing. But really, the sense here in Washington, Paula, is that the U.S. wants to get to this pause in the fighting, not just so that hostages can be released and humanitarian aid can get in, which would immediately benefit Palestinians, but because it would be a key to ending this war. As Jeremy was just saying, right now Israel does not want to end this war, but if that humanitarian pause can start, many have told me that it would be very difficult for Israel to go back to a state of war after that.

Really, when youlook at the video, you kind of understand why. Jim Sciutto for us in Washington. Thanks so much. Now, a bill. Jim was just talking about this, right? A bill that would provide tens of billions of dollars in new U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Israel is stuck in partisan infighting in Congress. We know that's a familiar story. The foreign aid was attached to a Senate bipartisan deal to beef up U.S. border security, which has been a Republican priority for months, if not years actually, but it now appears dead after Republicans largely rebelled against it amid Donald Trump's opposition. And in the House, a vote to impeach Joe Biden's Homeland Security Secretary surprisingly failed on Tuesday when a handful of Republicans voted against it.

Republicans walked intolast night's vote series confident that they would have the votes to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas and have votes to pass more aid for Israel. Neither of that happened. That's because Republicans' majority is so slim. It all came down to one vote. Republicans thought that Democrats were going to have one absence last night, which was going to give them the margins they needed to pass that legislation. But Democrats wheeled in that lawmaker from the hospital at the last minute to cast the deciding vote and change the margins, ending both votes in a tie, which failed in the House. And just since last night, talking to lawmakers and sources, they are furious at how this has played out. This, they know this is another bad look for them. Even though the Speaker, as we heard, is defending what happened and saying legislation is messy, Republicans know that this raises serious questions about their ability to govern.",

We see that in the way that the Republican base is voting in the process that is unfolding now. And he has almost complete control over the Republican Party and Congress. And I think what is so flabbergasting for those of us that watch this is that, of course, Congress is supposed to be a check on the executive. It is one of the branches of the American system of government. And instead, they are not acting with autonomy. They're not acting in the best interest, some would argue, of their own constituents who do want to see something happen at the border, but they're acting at the behest of the former President. And so, you know, they are caught in, again, a very difficult situation where they're saying one thing that they want, they want border security, they want to give aid to Israel. And yet the President -- the former President, rather, is saying that he wants something else. He wants something to run on. This is purely a political calculation.

Chuck Schumer is saying, all right, we're going to do what the President initially wanted to have happen, which is a Ukraine and Israel funding bill. This was, if you recall many months ago that they were thinking of doing this, and now we've gone through all this process and we're back to the beginning. We'll see if he has the votes and then it goes to the House. We'll see what happens in the House. I think what was interesting is that the majority leader of the House in a press conference just today did not say that he would kill it out of hand. And so again, anything goes in this particular Congress. It's very difficult to know what anyone's going to do, but perhaps we will see money to Ukraine and Israel.

And frankly, the contest that we're seeing is to nominate the standard bearer for the Republicans. This isn't a popularity contest across the United States. We've seen poll after poll show that in a head-to-head matchup with the sitting President Biden, she would probably win. And so, but it's the Republicans that are deciding this. And she is not popular within the Republican Party. Her best case scenario, she has money. And we don't know what's going to happen with the former president's legal woes. We've seen a lot of cases go against him now. And so, perhaps what she's hoping is to play this out. And then if something happens to Donald Trump legally, she could then step in.
