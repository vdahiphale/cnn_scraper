Seventeen-year-old Zach Didier found unresponsive in his room two days after Christmas of 2020. Medics arrived and began resuscitation efforts but it was too late. C. DIDIER:  And is started resuming CPR and they just stood there. And I got mad at them and said guys, help me save my boy. When they didn't, I started trying to talk to Zach and begged him, don't go, come back. Please come back. Do not go. L. DIDIER:  I walked up and Chris just said our baby is gone. CAMPBELL (voice-over):  We sat down with Chris and Laura Didier inside Zach's old high school theater classroom, surrounded by memories of their son. L. DIDIER:  He loved school. He loved sports. He starred in the musical. Zach was such a stellar young man. He always wanted to help other people. CAMPBELL (voice-over):  Zach's sudden death initially a mystery to investigators. But the Placer County coroner, near Sacramento, had two theories on the day of his death -- either an undetected medical issue or fentanyl. C. DIDIER:  And that further spiraled us into -- L. DIDIER:  Into confusion. C. DIDIER:  Yes, debilitating confusion. It's like why would you say that word? We had no red flags of Zach having struggles with any kind of drug use, or addiction, or depression. DR.

And to be able to get the leadership of the Capitol police and Metro police it took a lot of time to convince them of what we were trying to do -- do an apolitical documentary.We're not journalists. We don't do investigations. We just wanted to show the people who were there, the minute-by-minute of that moment where life takes a turn that you don't know where it's going to go.

And it was just this weird sense that had descended on the city where people felt unsafe in a place where typically, you feel pretty safe.And I thought one thing you did here that was so interesting is talking about the human aspect of those people who went through that.

And we wanted to highlight these moments where -- these moments of humanity.And regardless, on September 11, just like on January 6, I think you've seen some of the worst of humanity. But what's important to remember is in parallel to this you always see the best in people rising up. And that's really what we wanted to show -- these moments. Of course, these overt ways of courage -- the first responders and putting their life on the line. But also these little moments of humanity when we see how Rep. Susan Wild, who thinks she's going to have a heart attack because of the stress. They're locked in the balcony of the House chamber and certainly, she feels someone putting a hand on her -- on her shoulder saying we're going to be OK -- and it's Rep. Jason Crow.
