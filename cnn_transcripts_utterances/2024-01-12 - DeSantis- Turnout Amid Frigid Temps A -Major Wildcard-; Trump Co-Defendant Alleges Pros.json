The extreme weather and sub-zero temps upending their plans. Plus, new U.S. strikes, against Iranian-backed militants, in Yemen, tonight, hours after President Biden said that he had delivered a message to Iran, with that barrage of strikes, last night. The question now is, is escalation inevitable. Also, potential complications, for the Trump case, in Georgia. Allegations of an improper relationship, between the Fulton County District Attorney, and her lead prosecutor. And a judge is now looking into the matter. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We are now down to the crucial final three days, before the first vote, in the nation. And right now, the Republican front-runner will be off the trail, and on the phones, instead, just like his GOP rivals. Donald Trump's campaign, forced to cancel three of its four scheduled rallies, this weekend, in Iowa, out of an abundance of caution, amid severe weather advisories. And instead, they're going to hold virtual ones. Trump, who, I should note, spent two days, in court this week, hundreds of miles away from Iowa. He was instead in Washington, and here in New York. Says that he thinks the extreme weather in Iowa could actually be good for him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: You have the worst weather, I guess, in recorded history. But maybe that's good, because our people are more committed than anybody else. So maybe it's actually a good thing for us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But a win is a win. And no one has ever won Iowa by more than 12 points. So that's our goal. Maybe a bit of expectation, lowering, coming from the Trump campaign. I should note, of course, other candidates are also facing the same challenges, as Iowans are now being warned to stay off the roads, because of these blizzard-like conditions that you can see here, that are spreading across the state. This is what a highway looked like, just today. Drivers clearly can barely see out their windshields. The question is, of course getting people motivated, to come out and caucus, when it is going to be a high of minus-four on Monday. Now, Iowans are tough. They know how to deal with a winter storm. And they take their caucuses very seriously. But compare the temperature that is expected to be there, on Monday, to past caucuses. It have mostly been held at what seems like balmy weather now, 30s and 40s degrees. With wind chills, it could feel like minus-40, in some parts of Iowa, on Monday. I should note that despite these dangers, the candidates are still asking the voters, to bundle up, and come out for them, that night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm concerned because I want people to be safe, on caucus day. It's going to be negative-28 wind chill. And so, what we hope is that they will wear layers, that they will bring their photo ID, and that they will come out and caucus. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nobody can forecast what the turnout is going to be. Anyone that tells you they can do that is not -- is not being honest. It's a major wildcard. Obviously, it's going to affect it in some way. You're never going to have an opportunity, to have your vote count more, pack more of a punch, than on Monday night. So, if you care about the future of the country, if you believe in us, come out and do it. And you won't regret it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's kind of coming from different directions.So, if you're Trump, and the Trump campaign, they're trying to make sure that nobody is overly competent -- confident that they are going to win. And so, they're trying to remind everyone that supporting Trump, that they have to come out, that they can't rely on this giant lead that he's had, in most of the state polling, here in Iowa. For Ron DeSantis, they have gone again and again, to talk about -- the Super PAC that's aligned with his campaign. They say they have an unparalleled organization, and ground game that matters a lot, in Iowa, for the reasons you just laid out, about why caucuses are different than just going and checking a ballot. And so, they're hoping that that's going to make the difference, on Monday. But they're certainly concerned about how do you convince people to get out of their warm homes, and go do this.",

And I had a change of tire, at 45 below, and nearly lost my fingers.But here's what the Weather Service just put out. This will be in effect at midnight, through Tuesday. Travel should be restricted to emergencies only. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle. So, that's where the Weather Service is on this. Right now, wind chill in Des Moines is 11 degrees below zero. It is still snowing. There's a blizzard out there. Parts of Interstate 80 are absolutely shut down, at this point. There are so many accidents, out there, right now. People are not getting across these east-west roads. Think about this. Most of the roads in Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, they go north-south, east-west. Interstates can turn a little bit. But those east-west roads are getting blown shut by the wind, and the drifts. So, just because a plower goes by, in 15 minutes, that drifts can drift that road shut again. So, nine degrees below zero, when you're standing in line, to get into the caucus? That's the air temperature. Now, you add in the wind. And all of a sudden, nine below turns into 28 below. Up here, in Sheldon, Okoboji, 38 degrees below zero. There are a lot of people here that have livestock. They have animals. They have to take care of those animals. Do they have four hours, to leave them, go someplace, and then hope that they're still alive, when they get back? To me, that answer is no. We'll have to see how that affects turnout.",

And so, everybody's running scared, at this point, especially in light of this weather situation.Jessica alluded to it. Most of the people go to camp -- caucus sites, which are, they walk in, and they're kind of in a gym or in a school. So, you're not standing in line, like at a polling place that you'd normally see, on Election Day. But nonetheless, you have to go out. If you look at those pictures, on the screen, right now, you're driving in that kind of conditions. And even in the daytime, it's going to be treacherous. So, at nighttime, ice, it may be get people pause on, on, going out. And if you're older, nervous driving, you're maybe worried about it. You may stay home. But I will say this. As Donald Trump alluded to, in that video you showed, his followers will crawl over broken glass, to get to their polling place. And I believe it. I was there in 2020, in the Iowa caucuses, for the former President. And I can tell you that the folks were pretty excited, in 2020. I think they'll be pretty excited this year as well.",

I mean, (inaudible) said about a couple of months ago, you never know what's going to happen. And so, you never know, if you're going to have negative 30 degrees. It's the last thing you actually want. But I will say for campaigns that actually have an organization, like DeSantis, and even like Donald Trump, right now, they build an organization, unlike Nikki Haley, did. She has a strong one, in New Hampshire, but not so much in Iowa. And so, you want to be able to convert that grassroots organization, to be phone-banking, nonstop. If you can't knock on a door, then you need to be burning up the phones, texting everybody, and then deciding like, oh, am I going to be able to get some of those folks maybe to provide rides for folks. But the reality is, is the roads are so dangerous. It's just a question of how committed are you to the candidate that you want to win?

The Houthis are a proxy of Iran. They are attacking these shipping routes, simply because they're trying to turn up the pressure, draw the United States further into a regional conflict. Think of what Iran has accomplished. Somewhere behind a curtain, in Iran, is General Hossein Salami, who is the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that controls the Axis of Resistance groups. They have tweaked up the group, in Iraq, to fire on U.S. bases that are there, trying to dismantle ISIS. The U.S. retaliated, and that caused the President of Iraq, to say, maybe it's time for the U.S. to leave the region. They have struck these shipping routes, which caused the U.S. to retaliate, which is now had several of our allies, tonight, come out, critical of those strikes, not supportive. So, what they are doing is they are destabilizing a region, after supporting Hamas, and supplying them with all of their missiles. So, Iran's plan -- Iran's plan is something we have to watch very carefully. Because A, it's working. And B, we have to modulate our responses to make sure that we don't bite too much into it.",

Roman's attorneys are saying, and I should note, with no direct evidence, that Willis improperly hired Wade, saying in this court filing, that they are romantic partners, that she recruited him, to help prosecute the case, while also alleging that she has benefited -- that Willis has benefited, financially, from his appointment, alleging that Wade used some of his earnings, to go on lavish vacations, together. While Fani Willis has had little to say, beyond saying that she will respond to this, in court filings, it is becoming a major issue, in this case. Joining me tonight, Michael Moore, a former U.S. attorney in Georgia, and a CNN Legal Analyst. And I just wonder what you make of these allegations, as we saw them coming out in this court filing. And then, we saw Fani Willis also served with papers, in that prosecutor's divorce filings. Can you just kind of expand on what's happening, for a moment?",

We haven't seen any of that. But I just want to talk about the prosecutor here, Nathan Wade, and his experience, because that's getting a closer look, following these allegations. And he's someone, who's a former prosecutor turned private practice defense attorney, a municipal court judge. But he was someone, who worked on misdemeanors.

If in fact, that's true? And again, I don't know, Mr. Wade's prosecution record. But if he has not prosecuted a felony case? And one would think that's basically an inexplicable occurrence, to have him sitting in this position. So, that begins to draw questions. But then again, you look also now at information that's coming out, because of this, because of the allegations, because of what's happening. And we're seeing his billing records. And so, it's given people, on the Trump side, something to grab ahold to, when they see in those billing records, things like meeting with the Biden administration, and counsel for the Biden administration. When in the past, the District Attorney has been rather coy about what discussions she may have had, with the Feds, about the case. And so, that, that, to me is a problem.

If you look at the size of the Republican majority, basically, you're looking at a 2 percent margin that'll get you into trouble.
