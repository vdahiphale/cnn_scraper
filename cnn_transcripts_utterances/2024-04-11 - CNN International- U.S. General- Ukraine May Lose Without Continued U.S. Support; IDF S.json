It is Thursday, April the 11th, 9 a.m. here in London.More than 200,000 people are without power right now after a new barrage of Russian strikes on energy infrastructure in northeastern Ukraine. Officials say the Kharkiv region took the brunt of the attacks this morning, with 10 Russian missiles hitting the regional capital alone. But Russia also went after energy facilities across the country, including in Kyiv, as well as southern and western Ukraine. So far, no reports of deaths or injuries. Meanwhile, the top U.S. commander in Europe says Ukraine could lose the war against Russia without continued U.S. support. General Chris Cavoli spoke as $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine is being held up by congressional Republicans. He said Ukraine can still turn things around because Russia is struggling to launch any large, combined operations. But at this point, the general says Ukraine is simply outgunned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. CHRIS CAVOLI, COMMANDER, U.S. EUROPEAN COMMAND: The severity of this moment cannot be overstated. If we do not continue to support Ukraine, Ukraine could lose. They are now being outshot by the Russian side five to one. So Russians fire five times as many artillery shells at the Ukrainians than the Ukrainians are able to fire back. That will immediately go to ten to one in a matter of weeks. We're not talking about months. We're not typing -- talking hypothetically. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There was one on March 22nd, which was seen as unprecedented, really, the biggest attack in over a year.And so this is clearly now a trend, a strategy by Russia, this ongoing attempt to sort of attrit Ukraine, to exhaust the population, to cripple the economy. And, of course, it is another reason for President Zelenskyy to come out and say, look, we really need more military aid, not just for the front lines, but these air defense interceptors. Now, Russia, of course, knows this. They know what their head of U.S.- European command said on Wednesday, that Ukraine will run out in short order if they aren't provided with more. And this is why we see President Zelenskyy saying, look, we need air defense support, and not a blind eye and long discussions in his statement this morning. But look, there's a measure of where we are. We look at what the Air Force statement that came out. They said there were 82 aerial targets. That includes drones and all different kinds of missiles. Fifty-seven were destroyed, but that's less than half the missiles. So we're awaiting more information about what kind of damage exactly has been caused. No reports of casualties as of yet, but Ukraine is struggling with the scale and intensity of these aerial attacks as Russia evolves the types and sophistication of weapons it's using.",

That has been the case for a long, long time. But I think it's interesting that he is now vocalizing this, really trying to raise the alarm in Washington, because we are in an urgent situation, not only, as you see, on the front lines, but in terms of these attacks on Ukraine's biggest cities and this effort to sort of exhaust the population.",

This was widely condemned by countries that are not exactly beacons of human rights or international law or justice.Countries like Russia, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, the list goes on. But this was not condemned with the same strength by the Americans. Israel has been accused of this. They haven't directly taken responsibility for it, but they have defended it. And the Americans have in some ways repeated their assertion or at least cast doubt on whether this building was in fact a diplomatic outpost. What's striking especially is the difference in the American reaction to this compared to their reaction to the Ecuador's raid on the Mexican embassy there, saying that was clearly out of bounds in terms of international law. Now, Joe Biden, yesterday the president said that his commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. This despite the fact that you have the U.S. since the outset of this war, Max, saying that their goal is to turn down the temperature on all of this and prevent the war in Gaza from spreading throughout the region.
