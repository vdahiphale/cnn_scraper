President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva returned to the palace on Monday Where he met with governors.  He blasted what he called the coup acts and criticize police conduct before and during Sunday's attacks.

Simply running riot through Brazil's house of power. And seems, eerily similar to the insurrection in the U.S. Capitol two years ago.One week earlier, the scenes were of democratic triumph, as Bolsonaro's left-wing rival, Lula da Silva, was inaugurated as the new year Brazilian president following a tight election result.  Bolsonaro never explicitly conceded and needed that his most ardent followers. \"This, this is my hero, I am at his home, our home, our home!\"  A Bolsonaro supporter says from inside of the Presidential Palace. Protesters dressed in the colors of the Brazilian flag, now a symbol of Bolsonaro's far-right movement, unfilled banners from the congressional building rooftop, demanding the result of Brazil's most fought election in a generation be overturned. More than a thousand arrests were made after security forces used tear gas and stunning grenades to regain control of the congressional building, the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace.  But, by the time that they did, the damage had already been done.  The president's chief of communication showed destruction inside his own office.

Clearly, he had some direct influence. Now, obviously, to be extradited, there has to be a request by the Brazilian authorities to do so.  But I do think a full investigations has to take place and I think the United States, if that request is made, has to be willing and demonstrate its objectively when it comes to defending democratic norms in the world but especially the western hemisphere, has to be willing to hand over Bolsonaro if indeed, and I think there's a very strong argument here that he indirectly influenced and incited the mob to commit a horrible act of terrorism against the three branches of Brazilian democracy.

It's mob violence.  It's obviously vandalism as well at least of charges of course.  They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The problem here of course is that Brazil is a deeply divided country. Bolsonaro lost by only 1.8% of the vote.  And the two sides are deeply distrustful of each other.  So, in trying to ensure there's accountability for this horrendous attack, Lula is also going to have to be careful not to inflame the other side, not to just continue to stoke this, this animosity. Now, in terms of democracy in the hemisphere, it is in the decline. It's sad if you look at Freedom House's evaluation of democracy every year, it has declined in the hemisphere.  But populism for both sides, from both the left and the right, what we learned from whether it's in Mexico whether it's in Venezuela or in Brazil.  Demagoguery is really stoking the decline in trust in democratic institutions and a decline in support for democratic norms. And so -- once across the ideological spectrum and indeed it's very troubling.  For now, at least Brazil -- in Brazil, democracy is held.

Local officials say that two people died and at least six others were hurt. Over the weekend, the Russians launched a series of missile strikes on Kramatorsk.  They say in retaliation for a devastated New Year's strike on a Russian makeshift barracks that even Russian concedes killed 89 soldiers though Ukraine insists there were many more. Russia claims its retaliatory strikes killed more than 600 Ukrainian troops.  Ukraine called that nonsense and CNN's team in the city found no evidence to suggest there had been any mass casualty event.  Just a massive crater in front of high school and a lot of broken glass. Some of the fiercest fighting is taking place in Bakhmut and nearby Soledar.  A visiting Ukrainian general saw the destruction along the main road and a hive of activity as medics work to treat an injured soldier in an undisclosed location. Near Bakhmut, a Ukrainian drone captured the moment that a bomb was dropped on Russian troops carrying an injured soldier. Both Kiev and some Russian military bloggers believe Moscow is eyeing a fresh round of conscription to bolster the frontlines.  The Kremlin has firmly denied it though it also denied its plans ahead of the first mass mobilization in the fall.

And everybody is accused of essentially jeopardizing their personal and familial relationships in exchange for getting better stories and more favorable press coverage in the United Kingdom.  And King Charles is also according to Prince Harry accused of not being a particularly good ol' present father especially after his mother, Princess Diana, died. I think, Rosemary, one of the most significant new lines that we're hearing as all of these revelations continue to feed out, is in his interview with Good Morning America, Harry when he was asked if he thought the monarchy had value today, he said, yes, he thought it did but not in the form it is now.  Not in the way it is now. That could be after all of these days of speculation, the strongest indication that we have yet about what is truly motivating Harry and how he sees his larger mission.

So, it is a little bit uncomfortable because you have the prime minister in the room and you have the president of the United States and the president of the Mexico in the room, and you have to supply at least some issues where there is -- where Canada has interest and input.",

It's terrible for these millions of people that live in the United States, have been working in the United States, where children are born in the United States, and you have leadership that is uncomfortable meeting with them because they entered illegally, you know, -- quote, unquote -- \"illegally\" into the United States. And from the president's perspective, president of Mexico's perspective, you know, it is a little uncomfortable because Mexico depends on the remittances coming from the United States into Mexico. But he doesn't meet with them directly. So, that is a very good observation. It would have been an easy one to meet with these migrants, but the criticism he would receive in the United States from the Republicans and from the more conservatives is that he is meeting with people who technically are criminals because they entered illegally into the United States.

It comes as Beijing condemns what it calls discriminatory COVID restrictions that South Korea and many other destinations have imposed on travellers from China. They include PCT testing and quarantining upon arrival. South Korea says the measures are based on scientific and objective grounds.Inside China, people are on the move again with the self-isolation of zero-COVID in the rearview mirror. Travel restrictions have fallen and the great migration for the lunar new year is expected to reach some two billion trips. CNN's Selina Wang shows us how families are rushing to reunite with their long-lost loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Anticipation is in the air. Flowers in hand, they anxiously wait. This is the most exciting day in three years at Chinese airports as the country reopens its borders. And the moment finally arrives. These are especially meaningful reunions. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, travellers from abroad can meet families right after getting off the plane instead of getting south to a quarantine facility. We documented this family's reunion. A mother and her son waiting for her husband, his father, at the airport. They haven't seen each other in almost a year. UNKNOWN (through translator):  Yes, I'm really excited. It has been too long. I'm thrilled to see him today. WANG (on camera):  He is a little shy, but he says he misses his dad and the flowers are for his dad. (Voice-over):  They patiently wait hours for his arrival. The family running to greet the father. His son finally getting that warm embrace. UNKNOWN (through translator):  It feels great to go home straight without quarantine. WANG (on camera):  The Beijing Capital International Airport is finally coming back to life. But as China is opening up, other countries are getting nervous. More than a dozen countries have imposed COVID-19 testing rules on travelers coming from China. (Voice-over):  But it's not stopping people from going abroad.

Some experts warning that Beijing's use of force to claim what it sees as its rightful territory is drawing closer. Chairman Xi Jinping has made it a priority for Beijing, which hasn't ruled out the use of force, a decision that could cause thousands of lives for China, Taiwan, and America.A war game from the Center for Strategic and International Studies begins with a Chinese missile barrage against Taiwan's military in 2026, destroying much of its air force and navy, followed by an amphibious invasion across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese forces fight back using advanced U.S. weaponry, Patriot missiles for air defense, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes for sea defense, and its ground forces to defend the beach. MARK CANCIAN, CSIS WAR GAME REPORT CO-AUTHOR:  Whatever the Taiwanese are going to fight the war where they have to have that when the war begins (ph). LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  In every scenario, China (INAUDIBLE) forces on Taiwan. But only in the most pessimistic cases does Beijing avoid defeat. But victory for the U.S. and Taiwan comes at a great cost. The war game assesses that the U.S. loses 10 to 20 combat ships, including two aircraft carriers and 200 to 400 military aircraft. In three weeks of fighting, the U.S. suffers more than 3,000 troops killed in action. That is about half of what the U.S. suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan over two decades. America's global position is damaged for years. China loses 90% of its amphibious fleet in 52 major surface warships and its air force loses more than 160 combat aircraft. Crucial to this outcome is the stockpile of precision-guided munitions. Taiwan would need more U.S.-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles, which maybe in short supply because these missiles have been sent to Ukraine. The U.S. needs its own long-range anti-ship missiles and this supply is one of the big risks.",

Top U.S. generals say the key to avoiding conflict is deterrence. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  As long as we remain number one, then we will deter the war that people worry about, a great power war between China and the United States. LIEBERMANN (on camera):  Crucially, this war game doesn't ask the question of, what would happen to make China decide to use military force to invade Taiwan? That remains an open question. But it is a crucial one to understanding the situation, especially given the west's reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy. Will China run the same risks given its own imports and exports, given its industrial economic power, or would it use those powers to try to control Taiwan without using its military?

It rapidly accelerated to well over 8,000 miles an hour and climbing.And everything looked promising. Really, it had gone through most of the very dangerous maneuvers, the difficult maneuvers. And yet, after the first stage fired and the second stage fired, they went into a coasting (ph) period. At the end of which the second stage was supposed to start up again and push it to the orbit where it would release the satellites, something went wrong there. After a long pause, an official from Virgin Orbit came on the livestream and said, we've had an anomaly, we will not be able to reach orbit. The impact economically was immediately clear. In the after-hours trading, their stocks started plummeting. But there's a bigger impact here as well. What does this mean to the future of this kind of mobile platform out here?
