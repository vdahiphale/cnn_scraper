Many hail reports as well as wind and, yes, tornado reports over the last 24 hours. Same areas getting hit once again. Areas highlighted in red Alexandria, Louisiana, back into Jackson, Mississippi, Montgomery, Alabama. These are areas that are most vulnerable for long lived tornadoes, EF-3 or stronger, with winds gusting over 100 miles per hour in some sense.Large hail to very large hail. We're talking golf ball size hail if not larger. We've already had hail reports of two inches and this will extend through Georgia back up into the Carolinas through the overnight hours. Areas highlighted in yellow meaning it's not going to be as strong but we're still dealing with the same threats, wind and hail going to be our biggest concerns. This rides up into tomorrow. So, areas highlighted in yellow Savannah, Georgia back into Albany up into parts of South Carolina. Large hail, damaging winds, main threats going into your Monday, but a tornado or two cannot be ruled out. Heavy rain also another big concern as this trains over the same areas. Pay attention to the timeframe here. Sunday night into Monday morning, pushing through Alabama into central Georgia up into the Carolinas. Again, it starts to weaken. We lose that tornado threat but holding on to the threat of damaging winds and large hail. Areas from just south of Birmingham and Atlanta, picking up 2 to 4 more inches of rain through Monday. That's these areas highlighted in orange. Isolated higher amounts are definitely possible so, that flash flood threat continues on through the overnight and early tomorrow morning, Macon, Georgia back into Montgomery, areas highlighted in red. Again, where you're most vulnerable, but this extends back into parts of Mississippi up into the Carolinas through Monday morning. So, remember, if you come across the roadway and water, turn around, find a different route. You just don't know how deep that water is. Back to you.",

He is moving ahead with the legislation.

When brought for a second and third reading, that's the final voting process in the Israeli Knesset.

He opened his rally with a song of \"Justice for All,\" which was sung, ironically, by people who are in prison because of the January 6th convictions.And so, he's celebrating lawmakers in doing that. The speech itself and you talked a little bit about it, was a rehash of all grievances and it was all about Donald Trump and what they were doing to him and to his cause. He spewed a lot of venom, but he didn't offer a lot of policies. What are you going to do about inflation? What you going to do about national security? But it was troubling because it was so defiant, so -- it was full of anger, and I talked about this being the final battle. Match that with what he did on social media where he said that if he is charged, it will bring what he said -- these are his words -- death and destruction. Well, as Bob Dylan, the great American poet said, \"You don't have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.\" Donald Trump is telling us which way the wind is blowing, and it's very troubling because of his propensity to talk about violence so casually.",
