      "sentences": "Hey, Jim. Good morning.I mean, look, I think that town hall formats are never necessarily the vice president's strongest settings. One thing about the upside of her accelerated campaign, she certainly avoided a primary contest, but the downside potentially was, during a primary contest, as you well know, you do hundreds of these town hall settings, taking questions from voters. Look, she was not necessarily as fluent as some of her advisers might have liked, but I do think she drew a contrast with the former president. And that's what this stage of the campaign is all about. You could hear her throughout her answers, though, with Anderson Cooper there, as well as talking directly to voters, at every opportunity, she would pivot to draw a distinction with her and the former president, some of her sharpest language we have seen yet. So, look, I think it also was able to shine a light on some of the other questions perhaps about her, about her faith, about her background a little bit more, even talking about grieving the loss of her mother. So I think the value for these is more than just the headlines that we're looking at. It's what some voters are taking away. And, look, she wanted to debate Donald Trump. He, of course, did not agree to that, so this is what she did.",

The diversity of Clarkston is something that it was going to be obvious to people attending the rally obviously from there. But it's also something that she is trying to, to speak to show that Georgia has more opportunity for her. I was in the Atlanta suburb just a couple weeks ago talking to just the rising influx of Asian American voters. Some support her, some do not. ACOSTA:  Right.",

We have known all week that the vice president is going to Texas for a campaign rally and appearance talking about abortion rights. And there's been some speculation that Beyonce would be there. We are now confirming that she will be there on stage with Willie Nelson as well. Beyonce, of course, allowed the Harris campaign to use \"Freedom\" as the campaign anthem the moment she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket just a few months ago. So it was widely believed that there would be a joint appearance. Now that is confirmed. That is happening. Jim, you remember all the speculation in Chicago at the Democratic Convention.",

Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. He's the national co-chair of the Harris/Walz campaign. And, Congressman, you have been out on the campaign trail going to places where there's a high Latino voter potential for Vice President Harris. Last night, what did you think about the town hall? Did she accomplish what she needed to accomplish? Were there some moments that you think she would like to have back? What was your assessment? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  Great to be with you. Look, first, let me just clarify one thing, the analysis that just happened right now.

And I think that her being able to start out and laying out the case as to why Donald Trump is a fascist, is a danger to democracy, the comparisons to wanting to have his generals be more like Hitler's generals and Hitler, I think, is crazy. And anyone, especially those independents, especially those folks that are deciding here in the last essentially week-and-a-half, two weeks, those are the issues that they're going to make them think about the kind of president that they want leading our country. And so that contrast is really important.

I'm on the ground in Las Vegas, across the state.I think one of the things that's really important right now is that we are looking at a very well-organized state. I mean, the Harris campaign has 14 offices open across the state. There are thousands and thousands of organizers and volunteers on the ground. There's a strong staff. And that machine, that turnout machine is going to make a difference on Election Day. As it relates to voters there, I talked to a lot of union voters, a lot of Latino men actually that are working in construction. And the vice president's plans on ensuring that construction workers are supported, that there's reimbursement for the tools they purchase, that there's access to buying a first home and doubling that for Latino men in -- during her presidency is really important. And that's, I think, motivating folks to get out and make those decisions. The Latino vote, as we know, is critical in places like Nevada and Arizona, but it's now become even more important in places like Pennsylvania and Georgia. It's a population that is growing. And so being out there, talking to folks in the language that they understand, talking to them about the community and reminding them that Donald Trump essentially calls us criminals, disregards our communities and our families, and says we're poisoning the blood of this country, those are messages that work and are going to turn voters out for Kamala Harris in the next few days.",

Governor, great to see you, as always. And it's reminding me that the late Alice Stewart was there in that same program. We just miss her terribly, and I know you were friends with Alice. But, Governor, good to be with you. Have you voted yet? I know early voting is under way across much of the country. Have you voted? And can you tell us where you're weighing in on this race? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, I haven't voted yet. I will be voting absentee. I have already applied for it. I always vote. And whenever you look at the debate last night -- not debate -- it was a cobble of Harris' appearance on CNN. And there's so many undecided voters that are looking at that and saying, I want a reason to vote for you. They have really already made up their mind that Donald Trump is not acceptable. He's flawed. And they want to have an acceptable alternative. And what worries me is that her answers were not clear enough, specific enough to give people confidence. And that's what she's got to do in the coming weeks. As for me, I'm not voting for Donald Trump. I'm voting for a Republican. I will write a candidate in. But the issue is, those genuinely undecided voters that we saw last night in Pennsylvania, other states, and what they convinced me of, there really are some undecided voters out there.

And he genuinely believes that he has a responsibility to tell the country that a second Trump presidency would be problematic. And he's the -- it has a ring of truth and believability. I think the question is, does it make a difference? And the word fascist, I think everybody says that's bad, but I don't think that means much more than that. And it just sounds like name- calling.

She comes across, even though she's changed positions, she last night I think did a good job of connecting.

The challenge with the MAGA movement is, you take the frustrating element, the angry element that's out there, and you don't put any constraint on it. Donald Trump embraces it and magnifies it.
