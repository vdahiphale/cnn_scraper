What we're told is he was stabbed 10 times. According to this union president, two times in the neck, two times in the back, and six times in the chest.Now, according to this union president, it was because of the corrections officers life-saving skills that were able to help Larry Nassar and then he was transported to a hospital, where we're told he is currently in stable condition. We're also told by the Bureau of Prisons that no other staff or other inmates were injured in this incident that happened yesterday at that prison at about 2:30 in the afternoon. As you said there, Kate, Larry Nassar is that disgraced doctor who, in 2018, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting more than 250 women, including famous Olympians like Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. If you also remember, during his sentencing hearing, it lasted for a week where about 150 or more came forward with victims' impact statements, extremely powerful testimony against this doctor. But currently there is now an investigation under way inside that federal prison after we're learning he was stabbed ten time behind those bars. We'll continue to update you on this, Kate. BOLDUAN:  Yes. Now -- I mean, it's pretty amazing when you see how and where he was stabbed, that he's in stable condition. We'll get a late -- we'll check in with you in a little bit. Thank you so much, Brynn. Sara. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. It was another weekend of deadly gun violence here in America. At least, nine people were injured in a mass shooting in Cleveland, Ohio early Sunday morning. According to local police there, they believe a single suspect fired on a group of people before fleeing. And New York Police have finally identified a 28-year -- a 25-year-old accused in the shooting. Thomas Abreu allegedly went on a deadly and seemingly random shooting spree, Saturday, in Queens and Brooklyn that left one person dead and three other people injured. CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller is here with us. What more are you learning about what happened in New York? People were -- man, that was a really scary situation where you have somebody on a scooter, correct?",

This is after a Federal Appeals Court lifted an injunction against the ban. The law, which was passed in March, was originally set to take effect on July 1st and will now take effect immediately. It means health care authorities in the state are prohibited from performing gender-affirming surgeries and giving hormones or puberty-blockers to transgender minors. More legal challenges against the state ban are expected.
