Good evening.We begin the hour with the historic court appearance coming up on Tuesday for Donald Trump, the first ex-president to be indicted on federal charges. Just over two months ago in Manhattan Trump became the first ex-president to face criminal charges in the so-called hush money probe involving payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This time around Trump will walk into a federal courtroom in Miami to face accusations of possessing and trying to hide highly sensitive classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following the latest developments for us in Miami. Katelyn, Trump arrives in Miami tomorrow, will hunker down at his golf resort there, but he's going to be back in another courtroom. What happens after that?",

They have to know exactly what they're going to be doing. The very next day for an initial appearance and so we believe he will be huddling with his lawyers talking about who will represent him potentially since he had a few departures on the legal team.And then he will come to this federal courthouse behind me on Tuesday afternoon. He and his body man, Walt Nauta, the man that is also charged alongside the former president in this historic indictment for obstruction and the mishandling of records. And what they will do in court, we will not get to see at all very likely, Jim. This is a federal court building and so it's the type of building that doesn't allow any cameras whatsoever to what happens inside and there is a lot of expectation that there is going to be quite a bit of security around the complex to make sure that the former president is quite protected. And so he will go in there, he will have this proceeding. Walt Nauta will be alongside him and also will be arraigned at that time. We believe both of them will be entering pleas of not guilty as is typical at this stage even if a guilty plea discussion could be down the line, and then things will be kicked off to go to trial. But of course Donald Trump will make a political moment of this as much as he can as he seems to very much like to do, and has already announced a speech after this on Tuesday night.",

What worries me is that one of the lessons of the months and weeks before 9/11, you know, before January 6th, for members of the Republican Party is that being ostriches hurts the country. There are people in the Senate who know full well that revealing our military secrets, revealing how we might, if we ever had to go to war with Iran, how we would do it, that that actually hurt this country. They have said nothing to the American people about the gravity of the indictment. Not to say that President Trump is guilty. He is innocent like anyone who is indicted until proven guilty. But I think it's time that the leaders of the Republican Party said to the American people, you know what, this matters. These documents matter. This is a major and serious issue. And if indeed the president, former president did this, this is a threat to our security. They are not saying enough to make clear to Americans that, hey, whatever you might have thought of the other allegations against the former president, this particular federal indictment matters. It matters that he is the first former commander-in-chief in our history who has been now actually -- he's now been charged with violating the Espionage Act. Can you imagine Dwight Eisenhower or Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan or George Herbert Walker Bush, every imagining that one of their successors would violate the Espionage Act?

The governor and the city, they still say that the answer to those questions are under investigation.But I want to tell you what we do know. Basically this all starts just before 6:30 this morning when a tanker truck was sitting underneath I- 95 behind me. And basically that truck caught fire, again we still don't know exactly how. But that truck caught fire and that fire was hot enough that it caused I-95 northbound to collapse. And the governor said in this press conference that the southbound lanes, they are also structurally unsafe at this time. Now currently, Jim, the truck is still underneath that wreckage over there. We've been hearing jackhammering and the sound of heavy machinery trying to dig through that rubble all throughout the afternoon. And while there have been no reports of injuries at this time, the governor said they actually don't know yet if there's anyone who was in the truck at the time of this collapse. Now, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, though, noted that 500 tons of concrete mess is sitting on the ground back there so that's what officials are going to have to sift through in order to answer some of those questions. I want you to take a listen to some of what Governor Shapiro said when he first laid eyes on the scene behind me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO, PENNSYLVANIA: Remarkable devastation. And I found myself, you know, thanking the lord that no motorists who were on I-95 were injured or died. It's just a remarkably devastating sight. One that our first responders, law enforcement and others contained very, very quickly. They got people out of harm's way. And now under leadership of Secretary Carroll and others, the hard work of clearing the site and rebuilding it will be underway and we're going to move as quickly as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The driver who captured the stunning video showing the dark plume of smoke over the interstate -- look at the video -- says he was driving on the southbound lanes when he noticed a dip in the road before the interstate collapsed.

I mean, you must have had a kind of close call there? MARK FUSETTI, TOOK VIDEO OF I-95 COLLAPSE (via phone): Yes, it was crazy. At first I just thought it was a brush fire because as I drove by, you can't see it on the footage, but to the right, the grass was on fire. So at first, I thought, OK, this is just a brush fire and I hit that bump which was startling. But it's also in a section where they were doing reconstruction. So it all just kind of thought at the moment, like, OK, this is just, you know, a normal bump, a normal little brush fire. Then once I realized what happened when I looked in my rearview mirror, I've seen 95, all the cars stopping, and then I learned, you know, shortly after that the road had just collapsed and what was really going on.",

But because we've experienced this in January 6th we should have a learning curve as a country and it simply increases the stakes for Republicans to stand up and condemn this kind of rhetoric because it is inciting. It is asking for an escalation of the kind we've already seen in this country and the echoes are not a mistake. 100 percent. ACOSTA: All right. Yes, he's using January 6th like rhetoric even as the special counsel is still investigating what led up to and took place on January 6th. It just boggles the mind.

General Hertling, great to see you as always. This may not be the most strategic land to hold I suppose, but this certainly does matter for moral, doesn't it? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Jim, every single piece of land that Ukrainian forces can pull back for their sovereign territory is going to be part of a march toward operational success. These are small territories. These are small villages that they're retaking. So yes, it is certainly high -- good for their high moral. But secondly, it really reinforces the fact that they are moving forward. They are conducting operations in various zones within the offensive corridor. They're meeting the Russians in several different locations. And all indicators are that they are slowly gaining success in each one of those.",

We've been talking about it for a very long time because Russia thought it was important and so did Prigozhin. The Ukrainians continue to keep their forces there so Russian forces can't move to other places in the defense.We have seen various activities this week that shows that Russia is attempting to move their forces around to meet the Ukrainian assault. They are in most cases not doing very well at that. But, truthfully, we're still really early on in this, Jim. It's hard to tell exactly who is having critical success and who is failing. But indicators are that on several of the attack axis, and you know, I don't know how many there are in the Ukrainian forces, it could be anywhere from four to about eight that Ukraine has pushed through the first two obstacle belts in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Province, and that's critically important because one of their main objectives in my view is to cut the lines of communication of Russia from within Russia, Rostov-on-Don, which is a small city -- a large city in Russia all the way to the frontlines near Mariupol, Melitopol, and on into Kherson. So if Ukraine can cut those lines of communication, what we could call supply lines, it's going to be very important because Russia won't be able to react in creating a defense that stands against continued assaults by Ukraine.",

Just like they're trying to cut the supply lines, you know, I've said so many times with you, Jim, that amateur study tactics, professional study logistics. That's an old saying in the army. So if you can blunt the tactics of your enemy and take them on and the defense that Russia has basically constructed over the last several months and at the same time knock out their supply lines, their fuel, their ammunitions, their mobilized soldiers that are heading to the front, you just have the capability of defeating that force.That's what Russia -- or excuse me, that's what Ukraine has been doing. It's called a deep strike capability. They're hitting the supply dumps, the headquarters, the mobilization centers, so new replacements, new ammunition and fuel can't get to frontline. It's a very good way of conducting warfare and Ukraine has shown themselves to be very good at targeting those centers so they can destroy them and affect the Russian capability to defend.
