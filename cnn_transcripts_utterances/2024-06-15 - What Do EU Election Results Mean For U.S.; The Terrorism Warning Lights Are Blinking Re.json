      "sentences": "Are they dueling canaries in a coal mine? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. This week came two different events that might forecast the outcome of the 2024 American election. First the elections in Europe that leaned right and second the arrest of eight foreign nationals believed to be affiliated with ISIS, who entered via the Mexican border.I have amazing expertise on hand to discuss each Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and Richard Clarke, former adviser to three U.S. presidents first to the EU elections last weekend, which saw right wing populist parties score big wins driven in part by border politics and inflation. Far right parties won 134 of the European Parliament's 720 seats, forming a substantial bloc against mainstream parties assembling coalition's that are needed to pass laws. The right gained significantly in the union's three biggest countries, France, Germany and Italy. In France Marine Left Pen, RN party won more than 31 percent of the vote, more than doubling President Emmanuel McCrone, its coalition party, which had only 14.6 percent of the vote. That prompted McCrone to dissolve the National Assembly and call for a risky snap election. In Germany, the right quote Alternative for Germany party had its best ever showing. And in Italy, the anti-immigrant and right wing incumbent Giorgio Maloney's Brothers of Italy also won. Many are now wondering that this is reminiscent of June in 2016, when the U.K. voted in favor of Brexit, which ended up foreshadowing Donald Trump's victory that fall. Joining me now is Kurt Volker, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO. He also served as the Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations. What do you think, Ambassador? Is this a canary in a coal mine? How predictive do you believe the EU elections are of the United States? KURT VOLKER, FMR. UNITED STATES SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR UKRAINE NEGOTIATIONS: Well, you know, as always with things, there are similarities and their differences. There are frustrations in Europe with immigration, just like there are in the United States, frustrations about the economy, just like there are in the United States. But the patterns here are a little bit different. In the U.K., they're going to have a general election July 4, and it looks very likely that -- and in Germany and France, two of the countries you just mentioned, the losses for the incumbent seem to be more frustration with the incumbents than about an ideological direction.",

That's a 260 year old tradition honoring the sovereigns birthday in this case, that of her father in law, King Charles. This followed the princess releasing an update about her cancer and chemotherapy treatments in which she said she was having good days and bad days. She also said the treatments will continue for a few more months and that she's not out of the woods yet.Joining me now from Buckingham Palace is CNNs Anna Stewart. Anna, tell us more.

And I think for the public, it was just fantastic to see her after so many months while she's been recovering and undergoing treatment for cancer. Of course, she is not out of the woods yet. We're not expecting to see her regularly at events like this and big official events. It's going to be a case by case basis. And we believe the Princess of Wales will sort of liaise with her medical team each time to see or not whether it works and whether she's actually just feeling good on the day. Today was one of those good days.And it was rather fitting because this was, of course, the King's birthday parade. It's also called Trooping the Color, which was a big military event that there's a way to market. And the regimen that was part of this today is actually the regiment the Princess of Wales is curdle off. So it's particularly fitting that she was able to be there. And I have to say, each year this is the event that really royal fans love the most because it's the one that brings the whole royal family together. Because at the end, you see them gathering on that balcony at Buckingham Palace just there behind me and you see them gathering to waive to the crowds and see a fly pass. And really that's a snapshot in history because each year, the same day each year, you see who's on that balcony and it changes over the years. Under Queen Elizabeth II, that was quite a large group normally on the balcony 40 or more people extended family. It's become a really slimmed down monarchy at this stage with Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, of course departing for the U.S., that's only made it slimmer. And so in recent months with both the King and the Princess of Wales, undergoing treatment for cancers, that's been an even more sundown monarchy. So really for the public, this was a really crucial moment to see them all together up there.",

And that will just be a list of general events that the Royals would be a part of. There's nothing as big as Trooping the Color coming up in the diary. But it will be week to week whether or not there's maybe a foundation event or a charitable event that the Princess wants to be a part of, that -- and she feels that she can be a part of. So I think there won't be anything significant in the diary. And as you say, to be honest, the Royals do take a lot of the summer offs and vacation so I think it will be a quite a few weeks ahead.

And our whole lives are stored in these little devices, everything from our personal photos to our finances. You're walking down the street, you're sitting in a cafe suddenly you're the victim of a mobile phone mugging, sometimes by a pedestrian walking by, sometimes by someone riding on an e-bike. When I was in London last week, the tabloids were filled with stories of such incidents. One thief finally apprehended had stolen two dozen phones in one day. And it's not just the $1,000 phone they are after, it's all the data on them, including banking and credit card information.According to the trade group Payments Industry Intelligence, in the year ending this past January, there was a 33 percent increase in reported mobile phone theft in the United Kingdom, with losses from mobile banking fraud, increasing 17 percent to nearly $24 million, with an average loss per victim of nearly $3,000. I happen to have witnessed an attempted theft on my trip to London last week. Last Saturday afternoon at a time when I would normally be here delivering this program, my wife and I having a beer with our frequent CNN guest, NYU Business School Professor Scott Galloway in Marylebone, sitting in an outdoor cafe, all of a sudden, there's this explosion of activity. People shouting, gathering round right where we were, and one man had another by the throat, screaming to a woman who was at the next table he tried to steal your phone. Apparently, this guy had walked up with papers in his hand, laid them down as if to ask her a question when his real intent was to scoop up her phone. They called the police, the police didn't arrive, the guy was ultimately let go and fled the scene. But it raised the question like what can you do to prevent this type of an outcome and what do you do if it does happen? My next guest has the expertise and the firsthand experience. David Burch is an advisor and global commenter on digital identity and digital money. Wired Magazine named him a top source for business information. His books include identity is the new money and he wrote this piece for Forbes, my iPhone was stolen, I survived, so did my bank accounts. Welcome to the program. Tell me what happened to you. DAVID BIRCH, WROTE FORBES ARTICLE, \"MY iPhone WAS STOLEN/SURVIVED\": Hey, Michael, well what happened to me was exactly what you just described. I was sitting in a cafe actually having a business meeting talking with a colleague of mine. And a woman came up waving some papers around, she puts the paper on the table. You know, you waive her away and she goes, a few seconds later, you glanced down, and my phone was gone. And I knew she'd taken it. So I -- I ran out the door after her. But there was a car waiting for her, she jumped into a car drove off, and my phone was gone. So I panicked for a couple of seconds but then I did what I think most people should do in these circumstances, which is I went straight to -- I went straight online, use my friend's laptop. And I logged into iCloud and change my password, reported the phone as stolen, wiped all the data from the phone, and made sure all that was taken care of. That's number one most important thing is to stop them from getting into your cloud so did that but then I used the --",

No, I mean, if you're going to have your phone out in public, there's not much you can do to stop it is the honest truth because you're walking down the street with $1,000 in your hand. And for the -- for the thieves, that's very tempting. But I -- I think what you said is correct, it isn't just that they're stealing the phone, because obviously, the phone is -- is worth some money. And they'll either send it on or they'll send it abroad to be broken up for parts or something like that. But I wasn't worried about the value of the phone, I had insurance, you know, my insurance covered the phone.What I was worried about was the data and stopping people from getting access to that data is -- is the number one job. I did what everybody should do, because I turned off previewing the messages when the phone is locked down because the criminals use that. There are lots of banks credit card companies, they'll send one time passwords to the phones, and you can see that pop up on the screen before it disappears. You need to turn that off to stop them from doing that. You need to change the password right away so they don't get into it. And then you need to call the phone company to block the phone which is also good idea. And then I call the police. Don't call the police first. Make sure the phone is safe and make sure your data is safe then call the police kind of just say that -- that kind worked pretty well for me.",

No, that's not true. These gangs, so the kids are stealing the phones, they're handing them on to gangs. And the gangs are then conducting the frauds, which is what they really want because remember, you know, if I steal your phone, I'm stealing $1,000. If I can get into your bank account, I can steal $100,000.So that's what they really want. And in fact, after my phone was stolen, because I had locked it up, and there's nothing they could do with it. For a few weeks, I would get messages. Hello, this is Apple, we found your phone, please log in here to prove it's yours. Hello, this is your phone company. Please log in here to prove this phone is yours, et cetera, et cetera, because the criminals desperately need to get into the phone. What they want is the data, not the phone.
