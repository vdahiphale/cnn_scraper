We're also asking if they're not, we're looking for, okay, how and what and where do they need to be placed?

So I can say with a surety that's the case. But an expert will be able to do so and we'll respond accordingly.

He also had compounds that were mysterious and that were foreign to collection in the U.S. What strikes you about what the ATF says they have in terms of evidence found at the home that he rented there in New Orleans that he presumably tried to destroy in that fire, and also evidence consistent with what they located in his Texas address?",

He had set the fire before he walked out the door. And because of where he put it, which was in the linen closet, it ran out of oxygen and smothered itself over the next period of hours. So because, you know, the fire department isn't called for another couple of hours after this attack actually unfolded in New Orleans around 3:00 a.m. after 3:00 a.m. So it's remarkable that the investigators got a few lucky breaks at public, got a couple of lucky breaks, including the fact that he didn't build the bomb just the way that it would have -- that it would have carried out even more destruction, perhaps killed many more people. And also just the fact that he wasn't able to destroy the evidence so that those two things are going to be very, very helpful to sort of solving a lot more of the questions that we have, Fredricka, at this hour.",
