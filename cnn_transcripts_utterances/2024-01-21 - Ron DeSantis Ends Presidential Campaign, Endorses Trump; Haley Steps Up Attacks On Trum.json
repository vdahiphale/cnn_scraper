We're told the decision came after conversations with his donors, that his money to continue just was not there. Here's a little bit of his announcement video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  And now serving as governor of Florida. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it.

He brings a lot to the table. He understands the border. He understands Mexico. Energy, we're the largest oil producer the world in Texas. The economy, we're the eighth largest in the world from an economic standpoint. And his donors base is huge and he brings a lot of donors to the table. I think ultimately he could -- he could potentially stave off a No Labels candidate because there's a number of billionaire donors in Texas that were looking at a No Labels candidate. I think they would potentially not do that if Governor Abbott were in the race with Trump. I think he'd be a great vice president for him.
