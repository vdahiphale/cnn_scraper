I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is on the trail riding hogs.It's campaign season, and Republican White House hopefuls hit the trail Saturday in Iowa for Senator Joni Ernst's annual Road and Ride, in some cases wearing leather motorcycle vests, as they try to position themselves ahead of a highly anticipated August debate. This week, three more Republican candidates, including the former vice president, are officially poised to join the race. The president is sharpening his own pitch for reelection, highlighting the bipartisan deals he struck with Congress, including the last-minute debt limit deal he signed yesterday with just two days to spare. And, in a speech to the nation Friday, he also warned of the consequences of electing a Republican president. His predecessor was notably absent in Iowa yesterday, though Donald Trump remains firmly at the top of the campaign pack, even as we learn more details about his growing legal peril. Here with me now to talk about that and much more is the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, Democrat Jamie Raskin. How are you? Thank you for coming in.

Attorney General Barr, Trump's own attorney general, was so skeptical that he created a panel to look at all of this information, saying, you have got to take the Ukraine stuff with a grain of salt.
