      "sentences": "Well, John, they're saying that these men either have ties or are suspected of having ties to Hamas. There were questions when these images arose yesterday about who exactly was in the group. We've been given some indications from relatives and employers that there are at least several men who have been pictured in these images and videos, who are -- have no ties to militant organizations.But an IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus told our colleague Jake Tapper, that the dozens of Palestinian men who you see in these images who have been stripped, who are on their knees, or sitting in the road, blindfolded and carried in a truck at one point, that they are either Hamas militants or suspected of being Hamas militants, and that they have been stripped down in order to make sure that they weren't carrying any explosives. We also heard from another IDF spokesman yesterday who wasn't speaking specifically to these images, but essentially said that when they clear areas, they ask that that men come out, they take the men into custody, and they've admitted to arresting hundreds of people to essentially figure out who is Hamas and who is not or who has militant ties and who doesn't. But, John, we heard from an employee -- the editor-in-chief of a news organization called the New Arab who said that he identified the head of their Gaza office in one of the images. CNN has also spoken with someone in the U.S., a relative of two of the people in the images, a brother and a cousin, this person -- the person we spoke with saying that they are a shopkeeper and someone who works in construction who have no ties to anything violent. So, this is clearly you know, the Israelis detaining rounding people up in their efforts to figure out who is Hamas and to dismantle a new sort --the militant organization, excuse me. But there are criticisms not just from human rights groups who have -- who have criticized this practice. But we also heard from a member of Hamas in Beirut today, who said that these were displaced Palestinians. And call this a reprehensible crime, John.",

Certainly, a shocking and strange scene for a bunch of witnesses who saw this woman just up on the porch of this historical home, the birthplace of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, where he spent the first 12 years of his life. This woman just pacing on this porch and pouring gasoline continuously upon that in the front door as well.Now, we do have new information this morning from the National Park Service because this is a federal site, from a historical architect saying that there's good news here that there is no permanent damage to the home. The priority right now is to let that strong stench of the gasoline -- to let that air out and also keep away anything that could spark a flame here. We are also told by the Atlanta Police Department via an e-mail this morning that the woman -- this 26-year- old woman was originally taken to a local hospital for a mental health crisis evaluation. And then she was transported over to the Fulton County Jail. Now, we do have a video from one of the witnesses where you can see one good Samaritan pinning her down to the ground waiting for police who arrive. We're told by A.P.D. that it's a bunch of strangers. People not from Atlanta who put a stop to this woman. Two tourists from Utah originally saw her dousing the house with the gasoline and interrupted her. And then two off-duty NYPD officers, they're the ones who chased her and pinned her there and waited for officers to arrive. The fire chief here in Atlanta saying that this was a mighty close call.

A New York man who filed to run for the seat once held by ousted Representative George Santos was just found guilty of several charges stemming from the January 6 Capitol riot. Philip Sean Grillo allegedly entered the building through a broken window. He was also seen in a group of people physically confronting law enforcement officers.The Justice Department noted during the trial that the 49-year-old testified he had \"no idea that Congress met inside the Capitol building.\" Then he went on to run for the MTC. The special election for the seat will be held on February 13. A new jobs report just this morning shows strong jobs growth and a low unemployment rate. 199,000 new jobs were added in November. That beat expectations. And the unemployment rate itself fell to 3.7 percent, which historically speaking is very low. And then breaking just a few minutes ago, six members of Congress from Pennsylvania are now calling for the resignation of the President of the University of Pennsylvania. Elizabeth Magill has faced scathing criticism since her congressional testimony where she failed to explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the school's code of conduct on bullying, or harassment.
