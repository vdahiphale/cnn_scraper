The Israeli defense minister said the hostages were killed just before troops could reach them.

Now, a group representing the families of Israeli hostages is calling for Prime Minister Netanyahu to address the nation and, quote, take responsibility for abandoning the hostages.Netanyahu released a taped statement this morning blaming Hamas for the murders of the hostages. It accused them of not wanting a ceasefire deal. CNN's Nic Robertson joining us now live from Jerusalem with more. Nic, you're also learning some information about these hostages that some of them were actually slated for release before their bodies were found. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yes, Hersh Golberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, and Carmel Gat were all slated to be released in the first phase under sort of humanitarian grounds. The first phase of release. Hersh had become a sort of a symbol, an international symbol, if you will, for the hostages, not just because of the brutal pictures that everyone saw when he was captured, he had lost his left arm, and the narrative that we learned after his capture that had happened as he was trying to sort of defend and fend off hand grenades and gunshots from Hamas. But then, Hamas cynically and brutally used him in a propaganda hostage video in April this year where you could clearly see he had lost his left arm. Everyone in this country and I think around the world could really see what was happening to the hostages and how they were being used. But these three were expected to be in the first phase of relief -- release. There are huge political recriminations, not just from the family of the hostages, not just even from opposition politicians here, but also even the defense minister calling on the prime minister to revisit the cabinet vote last week that many people believe shut down the possibility of getting a hostage deal through. The prime minister has given a statement and he's defended his position and is blaming Hamas for what's happening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  In recent days, as Israel has been holding intensive negotiations with the mediator in a supreme effort to reach a deal, Hamas is continuing to steadfastly refuse all proposals. Even worse, at the exact same time, it murdered six of our hostages. Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal. For our part, we will not relent. The government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving towards a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence.

Jasmine, I first want to get your reaction to what we've been learning through Nic Robertson's reporting that three of the six hostages who -- whose bodies have been found in these tunnels under Rafah, that they were slated to be released in this first phase of a potential deal. And that IDF saying that they were brutally murdered by Hamas just a short while before they were reached by the IDFJASMINE EL-GAMAL, FORMER PENTAGON MIDDLE EAST ADVISER AND MIDDLE EAST ANALYST:  That's right. Good morning, Amara, and thanks for having me. And I'd like to start first by just expressing my heartfelt condolences to the families of these hostages whose bodies have been recovered. It's just the latest in a series of really heartbreaking news that's come out of Gaza and Israel over the last 10 months. It's absolutely brutal. To your question now, it is true that reportedly some of the hostages have been slated for release. It's been reported that Hersh Goldberg- Polin was one of those names that had been approved by Hamas for release and that the deal had continued to be held up because Prime Minister Netanyahu had refused to concede on that point of having Israeli troops controlling the Gaza side of the Egypt-Gaza border, also known as the Philadelphi Corridor. Now, it's important to remember that, ultimately, Hamas bears responsibility for taking these hostages in the first place, right? Hamas started the latest round of this conflict, this war between Israel and the group, and they are the ones who took the hostages. There's no getting around that. But the fact also is that one person has been responsible and has held the keys, if you will, to the release of the hostages, and that is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And as Nic was saying earlier, and as you've been saying for the last few minutes, there has been unprecedented animosity and tension between the defense minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, and the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, where Gallant has basically accused Netanyahu of choosing that Philadelphi Corridor over the hostages who could have been released and all of this could have been avoided.",

And, you know, we did get that reporting about this bitter disagreement that kind of spelled out during that security cabinet meeting on Thursday night between the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Netanyahu over the Philadelphi Corridor. Can you talk to us about why this is such a huge sticking point for Netanyahu and how much support he has about not giving up this corridor, at least in the first phase of any kind of ceasefire hostage release deal?EL-GAMAL:  That's right. So, one of the main things that Netanyahu is reportedly and has said that he's trying to prevent is Hamas rearming and reconstituting as a fighting force if there is to be a ceasefire, whether it's temporary or permanent. And so, Netanyahu has been trying to maintain as much control as he has over borders for -- of Gaza. You know, these borders have traditionally been used to smuggle goods and weapons and money, and he wants to prevent that from happening. So, there is a reasoning behind him wanting to maintain control over the Philadelphia Corridor. But the reasoning has been addressed by the Egyptians in the negotiations with Hamas. They have proposed that there be a Palestinian security force on that side of the border with remote Israeli oversight. So, having the Israelis involved but not physically present on that side of the border, which is a sticking point in the negotiations on the Egyptian -- from the Egyptian perspective.",

Those that say Prime Minister Netanyahu could have by now cut a deal that would have seen them released and those who say that he should just keep going with these hard tactics of going after Hamas.And it gets to that issue in so many ways and then it's a divisive issue. And that's why now we're seeing so many senior leading opposition figures join the hostage families in calling for protest, calling for boycotts, essentially calling to bring the country to a standstill. It's why you're seeing the prime minister's defense minister criticize his decisions about how is handling the negotiations. Call for the cabinet to revisit the issue. How does it affect the negotiations? Well, at the moment it appears that this is a very clear signal from Hamas, and I say appears. because we don't have the details of how these six died precisely or precisely when, but this clearly seems to indicate that Hamas is playing hard ball, even harder ball than it was previously. It has said that Israel has been intransigent. It has said that it supports the peace proposal that the United States put forward, not the recent one. And -- and if this -- if these killings were a response or reaction to the stall out of that process, then this cause huge out over -- over progress that the peace talks can make at the moment, because it's unlikely this current prime minister will change his mind. And that's why there's so much protest, because they want to get that people 62 percent of the country want to get the hostages back and they see the only path to that at the moment is to change the Prime Minister and that is not immediately it appears on the card. So right now, the short answer to your question is it appears that they're stalling out.",

ROBERTSON (on-camera): They're saying that the issue that the country is so divided on, that is just make a deal with Hamas to get the hostages out and if you need to go back to war again, then go back to war after. But the hostages should be the primary concern of the Prime Minister. And they are saying that this has not been the case, that the Prime Minister is in essence putting his own political career and political survival ahead of the families of the hostages. And it's not just ahead of the lives of the hostages. And it's not just the hostages' families that are saying that. The Prime Minister's own defense minister accused him of that in the cabinet session just a couple of days ago. So, the families are really doubling down and calling for people to come out and protest. Remember that there are perhaps more than 60 hostages potentially still alive, all with families. Only a tiny group of those back the Prime Minister, the vast majority, are making very clear in their statements, they want the people of Israel to come out and support them so that they will have a chance to get their loved ones back alive.",

I mean, how widespread is this anger? How much pressure is he facing from the country? Would you say a majority of the country does not support the Prime Minister, or is that hard to tell? ROBERTSON (on-camera): The latest polling says about two-thirds of the country doesn't support the Prime Minister. They do not support the Prime Minister. The calls, I mean, look at the level of division that it comes right down to the some of the key players in this, between the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister, and to a strong degree his heads of intelligence, the Shin Bet and the Mossad, who have been doing the negotiations. You have that division there. But Yair Golan, an opposition leading figure, telling people that this is the moment to come out on the streets with the unions and protest to help bring the country to a standstill. Yair Lapid, another leading politician in the opposition, telling people to come out and protest on the streets, gather in Tel Aviv tonight for a big protest. You have Benny Gantz, who was in Netanyahu's war cabinet, who left that war cabinet because he didn't agree with the way the Prime Minister is handling negotiations, who has gone back to being a leading opposition figure, who said -- released a statement earlier today accusing the Prime Minister saying, you called these other hostages who were freed, now call the families of these six and listen to what they have to say.
