Four wildfiresfueled by powerful winds are raging across Los Angeles, threatening everything inside. Two people are dead, more than a thousand homes and businesses have burned, and officials warn the worst is yet to come. We have the very latest for you. Then America's allies respond after Donald Trump suggests he could seize Greenland and the Panama Canal by force. And then later, I speak to Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado, she's currently in hiding, but that may be about to change very soon. But first, high winds are fueling a really deadly inferno across southern California right now. At least, four wildfires are raging in L.A. County, and at least two people are dead. The L.A. Fire chief says they were never prepared to handle this many major fires really all at once. And the situation as you've been seeing here on our air, is dire. One resident shot this drone video you can see there, showing an ominous sky as the Palisades Fire moves closer. Winds of up to 100 miles per hour or about 160 kilometers per hour have been reported. The mayor of Los Angeles is set to arrive in the city shortly, and this comes as tens of thousands of people are being urged to evacuate as the out-of-control fires you can see there on your screen, how the four of them, how they're really out-of-control and how they're destroying homes. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Last week, we began receivingreports from the National Weather Service about a significant wind event that was going to hit southern California. This is not something that's a surprise to us in southern California, and it was something that we were well prepared for based on those predictive conditions of wind-gusts up to 100 miles an hour east, pushing offshore. We began increasing our staffing, a local, state and federal agencies. Hundreds of firefighters began moving on Sunday afternoon from northern California into southern California. My local partners began up-staffing their own fire stations, helicopters, fire engines, hand crews to be prepared for an incident like this that occurred. Those resources were pre-positioned in counties throughout southern California for an event just like this. And on Tuesday morning, the Palisades fire began.

With that, I'm going to be focusing on the Palisades Fire. That fire broke out yesterday morning around 10:30. We did pre-deploy a number of resources. We knew this was -- there was a potential for a significant threat to our constituents due to the weather event. High winds, I've never seen the winds in my 25-year career, so, we leaned forward as much as possible and pre-deployed. With that, we had a significant amount of fire that occurred. We had an aggressive fire attack. The fire has grown from originally 10 acres to 10,802 acres. As we speak, it's an active fire-fight with our firefighters, and they're doing their very best to protect our people within this area. Interesting enough, because of the winds and the low humidity, we had a second fire also break out, and that was the Hurst Fire, which is just north of that area. Again, this was close to 11,000 acres. This is close to 500 acres that also broke out. The information that I want to share with you is also the significance of multiple fires in the area within the city, but also the county. That's the second fire that actually came out, and we are actively engaged in that fire-fight. The third fire then broke out this morning at 4 O'clock in the morning, in which we have an active fire-fight there as well. We're working with our local jurisdictions, our state, regional as well as federal. So, we're doing everything we can to protect life first and property next. We'll go ahead and then pass this off to police chief McDonald(ph). Thank you.",

Because we already have a defense agreement with the United States. They have an air force base in Tulu, which is important for protecting the U.S. against nukes from Russia. And previously, they have more military bases in Greenland, and we have no problem. If they want to have more of a military presence in Greenland because they think that's important to protect themselves, no problem. They can have that. And if they want to get access to the minerals, that's why you have trade. You know, in no country in the world has everything within its own borders, what you don't have that you need from other countries, you can buy that. And I also have to say that it's a bit exaggerated when I hear dreamers who have this unrealistic expectation that they can just take over another country talking about how it's going to save the U.S. economy. It's not. I mean, Greenland has a lot of deposits, but it's not going to save the U.S. economy. The local authorities have estimated that there's values of about a half a trillion U.S. dollars, and that's the value of the minerals. But you have to get them out of the ground first. And there's no roads, there's no harbors, there's no airports. So, it will be very costly. And half a trillion U.S. dollars, the federal debt in the U.S. is about $36 trillion. So, it's not like Greenland would save the U.S. if they got it. So, I mean, threatening like that and putting that much pressure on us is unnecessary and there's really no need for that.",

We've lost a number of homes along the beach area and in the mountain area above it. And it's actually too early for us to even get in there to do a damage assessment, too risky.

You need to move out of the way and let the first responders get in there when they think they can get in. And if you stay behind, you're risking the firefighters that have to come in and rescue you and 1st responders. It's just a terrible idea. So, people do need to evacuate when we tell them to evacuate. And roughly, about half the city is -- a third to half the city is in an evacuation mode. The western side is not, but the eastern side, and we're 21 miles along the PCH, the Pacific Ocean and we've got about half the city -- third evacuated.",

But the incumbent leader, Nicolas Maduro may get in his way. Despite the opposition releasing tens of thousands of voting tallies that prove Gonzalez won by landslide, Maduro has refused to accept defeat. Well, come tomorrow, he is likely to face pressure from inside the country. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is calling on Venezuelans to take to the streets in protest. She says Maduro will not give up power on his own and that Venezuelans, quote, \"must make him leave.\" And Maria Corina Machado joins me now and plans to come out of hiding take part in this process -- in these protests, and we are not disclosing her location to protect her safety. Maria Corina Machado. Welcome back to the show. Good to see you. Can I start, Maria, with what I'm hearing and what we've been seeing the last, what, 24 hours?

And this proves the desperation the regime is feeling right now. Maduro has lost everything. He lost popular support, he lost legitimacy, because the whole world knows he lost by landslide that we gave him in our victory. He has lost all support internationally because of the crimes he has committed and had been denounced by the Inter American Commission of Human Rights, just yesterday published a report saying that Maduro are practicing terrorism of state.
