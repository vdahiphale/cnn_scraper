So, Trump's team filing that in state court, saying we are not going to try to move to federal court. This may be because it's so far been an uphill battle for Trump's codefendants to try to get removal. It was just a few weeks ago that a federal judge rejected Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows' attempt to move his case out of county court, state court, to the federal level. So perhaps, you know, we know that Donald Trump's lawyers are closely watching that proceeding. And, you know, by all accounts, Mark Meadows would've had a good case. He was chief of staff working directly for the president of the United States. And he said that most of what he did was within his official duties. But the federal judge rejected that argument. So perhaps Trump's lawyers thinking that it would be an uphill climb if they tried to remove the case to federal court. So Trump's case will, in fact, now officially go forward in state court in Fulton County, Georgia. And that case proceeds as this other cases are moving. And we're seeing a lot of pretrial notions in the cases of the Mar-a-Lago classified documents, as well as the submerging case in January six here in Washington, D.C.
