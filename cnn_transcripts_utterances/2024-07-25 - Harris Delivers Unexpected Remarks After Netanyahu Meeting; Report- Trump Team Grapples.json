The vice president choosing to speak from the White House, seizing on her momentum, getting a boost today from some new poll numbers. Is this a honeymoon or is this the real deal? Also breaking, a wake-up call. New reporting from inside Trump's team about how they were caught flat-footed by Biden dropping out, and now, scrambling to get back on track. Plus, the backlash building over J.D. Vance's \"childless cat ladies\" comment, as Trump maintains Vance will help him in the Rust Belt. But will he? So, Harry Enten has a deep dive on those numbers. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, the Vice President Kamala Harris, just speaking at the White House after meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, these remarks were not originally on her schedule, and they were actually more extensive remarks than President Biden made after his meeting with Netanyahu, Harris revealing details about what she called a frank conversation with the Israeli prime minister. And she made it clear that she wants an end to the war in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's bring the hostages home, and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian people.We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Today's meeting comes as her campaign is getting a boost from a new poll by \"The New York Times\". And what this showed was Harris narrowing the gap against Trump. But Trump got a post-convention bounce, but when you look at it all in aggregate, Harris is now four points ahead of where Biden was polling in the same poll before he dropped out, which puts the race in a statistical dead heat 48 to 47. Now, you know, we'll see. Does this -- do you just continue to surge up or not? Obviously, you haven't had the convention bounce from the Democrats yet. The poll does show Harris making strides with groups that Biden had been struggling with, which includes perhaps most notably young voters, 56 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29 back Harris, with just 16 percentage points more than Biden. That's a pretty stunning number. Independents, 45, Biden had 37 there. So doing significantly better there as well and with Latinos, 57 percent back her. It was 41 percent for Biden. So that is obviously dramatic and electoral politics in the United States, it doesn't get more dramatic than that. In fact, it's unprecedented for anything to move like that. So that's the reality of the situation. The question is, is it for now or forever? But you do see that energy in the Harris campaign events that we've seen so far, too, what they've been getting in terms of the boost from the polls. Today, Harris speaking to an energized group of voters from the American Federation of Teachers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the last two hours gave us a really clear window into how the vice president is very quickly trying to shift gears and adjust to this new role that was thrust upon her just four days ago, CNN was TV pool for this meeting between the vice president and the prime minister. And typically, as you know, what happens is a small group of reporters goes into the room, we get a shot of the two leaders meeting and then were quickly brought out. And that's it.But instead, the small group of reporters in that room, but we were taken to a holding room and we were told by the vice president's team that she is actually surely going to deliver remarks as soon as that bilateral meeting wrapped up, which as you point out, is not typical. Clearly, this was a vice president wanting to seize this moment that she was in, and the fact that the prime minister was in town and had met with her to put her own marker down on one of the most difficult foreign policy its the issues that she is set to inherit from the president if she were to go on to win the presidency. One senior official, I was talking to right after the remarks that there was no question that this was a part of the vice president in the recent days trying to really prove herself in a different way. They described it as the vice president putting a punctuation mark at the end of a really eventful, an important day and just keep in mind, Erin, up until Sunday, Israel was one of the biggest issues where whenever it came up, the White House would say there is no daylight between the vice president and the president. And I do think this is going to be a really important space to watch, to see if in the coming days and in the coming weeks, we do start for to see a little bit more daylight creeping between the two.",

Harris gets the benefits of incumbency as she's in the office, right now because I think were going to see the White House intentionally leaned on her in these big moments to be able to show her someone who's grown over the past several years.I remember that was reporting on her last or they will make a point to say that she was more respected globally that even she was appreciated domestically by Democrats. That's been a place where she's seen a lot of emphasis. I think they're going to try to roll that out and I do think that even if the policy differences between her and Biden and Gaza are small, the rhetorical differences in the kind of empathy for Palestinians that she's made a point to show over the last several months might be the kind of tonal difference so you see between her and that the top. But to the point about, does this last, part of that is the question of whether she can capitalize the upside that she clearly has in differences from Biden. The groups that are most marginal Democratic voters, younger people, Black and Latinos, folks were outside the process. They're clearly more favorably see her than Joe Biden. The question will be, does that turn into preference that actually moves votes consistently? And I think that's going to have a policy question behind it that we haven't really gotten to yet.",

Netanyahu came to give this address yesterday, thinking it was Trump versus -- versus Donald -- Joe Biden. And now, you've got Kamala Harris as the person running. I think it was incredibly savvy of her to give these remarks.And I would say this, they were nuanced. There was a little something for everything. She condemns sexual violence by Hamas. She said it committed unwavering support, but then also leaning into saying she recognizes the plight of the Palestinians. This is, I think were most of the country is and something that Joe Biden has struggled to articulate during this crisis. It'll be interesting to see how tomorrow goes. There's a lot of bad will, I would say, between Trump and Netanyahu, Trump never got over the fact that he congratulated Joe Biden when he won the election.

And the Democrats need to win national elections. And that includes enthusiasm and participation and support from younger voters, from the African American community, from Hispanic voters.She's doing better than Joe Biden. Was those voters were drifting away from him, which accounted for a lot of his problems. So that is a good sign. And the fact that she's close this gap so handsomely in just a few days is a good sign. But if the election were today, shed still lose and shed probably lose by a significant margin in the Electoral College because Democrats have to be ahead in the national poll to win because of the way population is distributed around the country. But this is certainly good news for her in the question is can she expand beyond. And one other point, she does open up new fronts in the electoral map. You know, one of the reasons why she has suffered in the Sun Belt states is loss among African American voters, loss among Hispanic American voters in places like Nevada and Arizona, even New Mexico. And the fact that she's doing better among those voters is a good sign that she might be able to fight her way back into those states and that would give her more options on the path to 270 electoral votes.",

Specifically, she's gone to Gwinnett County where there's a lot of diversity in Gwinnett County, and I believe right now in Georgia, 34 percent of the electorate is African-American.

I think the other one that she is comfortable with her prosecutor record this time. This is a difference from four years ago. When I was covering her presidential run, she was frankly tied in knots between the moderate and progressive wings and not owning her criminal justice history. That is not going to be the case this time. You're going to hear her talk about that and kind of own that most specifically. And I really think the third thing is the Dobbs decision gives their chance to be most offensive on the best issue for Democrats.

His father, along with the other hostage families, sharply questioning Netanyahu in a meeting today, asking him point- blank why he was slow-walking negotiations on a deal. This is according to long time Israeli reporter Barak Ravid of \"Axios\".And Jonathan Dekel-Chen joins me now. As you have so many times, Jonathan, over these past -- these past 293 days, and today, you were there. Now, obviously, being able to meet with the prime minister is not something you get to do, usually, right? And he's here in the United States. He meets with President Biden. He's in that room. You were there asking and families I know with incredible frustration -- why has Netanyahu slow-walked negotiations on a deal for hostages? What did he say to you? JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: Well, thank you, Erin. Indeed, we -- six of the seven families of the U.S. hostages were represented at that meeting today. We asked some very difficult questions to the prime minister, mostly trying to impress upon him the urgency of the moment. Hostages are dying in captivity. We do not understand why more progress has not been made in a quicker fashion, which would, of course, get our loved ones home. But also end the suffering of over him a million civilians in Gaza. What we did get without going into the details of the conversation is a promise, both from the prime minister and from President Biden that they completely understand the urgency of this moment. And they also understand that it is incumbent upon all sides to work as quickly as possible to get this done.",

She came out and spoke after her meeting with the prime minister. He is going to be meeting with Donald Trump, the former president, tomorrow in Mar-a-Lago. They obviously had a close relationship. President Biden is the one who moved the embassy, the U.S. embassy in Israel, that was very significant. They do have a tight relationship. Him and Prime Minister Netanyahu.And yesterday at the speech to Congress, Netanyahu praised Trump and Trump also called for a ceasefire. Here he is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

DEKEL-CHEN: Well, it's hard for me to make that qualitative judgment, Erin, what I can say is that it is now clear given former President Trump's statement yesterday, and I believe immediately after the RNC, that anyone who has the illusion that a change of administration, the United States is going to give more freedom of action to Israel to somehow negotiate some bigger or better deal, it's just -- it's an illusion. And therefore, there's nothing to wait for. The Israeli -- the Israeli military and intelligence leadership has been absolutely clear that the time is ripe, right now to complete this deal, we need Hamas, obviously, to agree to this and prefer the safety and the well-being of its own citizens over continued warfare. But assuming -- assuming they're willing to do that, then it's incumbent upon Israel to do everything it must to, to end, to end the conflict now.",

They said these were hostages, at least in some of the cases, who had been actually killed on October 7, that they now were finding out, but they were killed.How -- what is the latest that you've heard from the Israeli government? Have they told you whether they believe where Sagui is, whether what they believe his condition is. DEKEL-CHEN: Well, we haven't gotten any firm confirmation of life since late November, early December and its anyone's guess on any given day what the fate of the hostages going to be. On our kibbutz alone, kibbutz Nir Oz, there are still 33 hostages being held by Hamas. Of them, seven have already been confirmed dead, but they were alive on October 8. So, clearly there's an a present danger to all of the hostages. Friendly fire, or execution by Hamas.",
