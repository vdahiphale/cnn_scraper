Certainly that's the reaction that we're getting at the moment. Two hundred twenty UNRWA staff since October 7th have been killed. These six obviously added to that list. Seventy percent of UNWRA schools, like this one, that were once schools for children that have become refugees for displaced people have been hit now. These are the UNRWA run ones, the biggest U.N. operation inside of Gaza for Palestinians. And the director of that agency has said, look, these continuing strikes, strikes with impunity, he says, against these UNRWA facilities, if they are continued, then they essentially undermine international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions. He says they must stop. That is what the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, posted on X as well, saying, these continued violations of international law must stop. These are places that have become refuge for very many of the Palestinians stuck in Gaza. One of the people inside the school described a scenario where they were having lunch with colleagues. They left the room after lunch to go to another part of the building. The explosion happened, they came back to the room where they'd had lunch. And the room and the colleagues were gone, destroyed by the force of the blast. Eighteen killed, 44 wounded. Now, the IDF are being very clear about this and provided more information during the day. They have said that it was targeted, that there was a specific information about a Hamas cell command and control operating in the school. And even have said, have named nine people who they say were killed in this strike, who were Hamas operatives inside of the -- inside of the school building. I think the notion that the U.N. can make statements and stop the IDF's tactics is clearly at this stage of the conflict in Gaza. Clearly, that's not going to happen. But for the -- for the U.N., this is six more of their staff lost. And for Palestinians there, 18 dead and 44 killed. The statistics are very brutal.",

This all worked because there was an agreed-upon eight-hour pause in fighting window in a humanitarian area where these children could get immunized.

So all the vaccinators have to have things called congelateur, these vaccine carriers that keep it cold. The vaccinators all have to know what they're doing, even though it's a relatively simple vaccine to give. It's two drops. You have to know how to give it. You have to ensure that you can mark off the children's fingers so that you know that you've reached the children. You have to ensure that the parents know what's going on, know where to come. You have to design the sites often with these mass vaccination campaigns. You'll actually go house to house. But in Gaza, there aren't any houses and tent to tent, it was proving very hard. So we had to -- we aimed to work with fixed sites, but we also did have what we call outreach teams that would be mobile teams going to find the children and the parents that really couldn't make it to the fixed sites or were too frightened.

He's also said recently again that he plans to dismantle the Justice Department and the FBI and politicize it for his own purposes if he does retake the White House. So, again, the attorney general today relay a message to his workforce reassuring them that the norms and the sort of code that they operate by will, you know, maintain the impartiality and the non-political nature of the Justice Department, even if Donald Trump takes the White House and Merrick Garland is no longer the attorney general. But he's also signaling outward to Donald Trump and to other, his allies, and to others who have spread these conspiracy theories about the Justice Department that that will not change anything. That they're going to continue to pursue the same impartial mission that they always have, including missions that will have no impact or have no bearing on an election.

Their hope is they can get voters out. And you see that with the attention that the Harris campaign is putting in North Carolina. She's got two rallies here today in two urban areas, Greensboro and Charlotte. The spouses of the candidates, Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz were here in the Raleigh area just a couple of days ago. They're really, really trying to put a lot of resources into North Carolina.

I think the outreach on some of these issues around fracking, around -- you mentioned gun ownership sort of Second Amendment rights, making her seem a little bit less to the left. I mean, one of the challenges in North Carolina is we've often had a more moderate candidate for governor here on the democratic side. And that person has won while the presidential campaign here for the Democrats has not been successful. So we'll see if her trying to tack towards the middle with a lot of her debate answers.
