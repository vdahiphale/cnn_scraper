Some cities will see about an inch or more of snow today for the first time in almost two years for here in New York. Even some southern states getting hit with arctic air and snow. More than 120 million people are feeling those bitterly cold temperatures across the country this morning. The windchill in some places could be 45 degrees below zero.Meteorologist Allison Chinchar joins us now. It is balmy compared to that here in New York, but a beautiful snowy morning that I woke up to.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I will say, as far as the temperatures are concerned, we will get a brief reprieve, but the emphasis is on brief from those temperatures.Now, we can take a look again. You've still got that arctic air surging across the central portion of the U.S. We've also got that cold front that, yes, is bringing areas of snow to the mid-Atlantic and to the northeast. But as far as the temperatures are concerned, we start to see it retreat on Wednesday. So, tomorrow, a lot of folks really starting to see those temperatures get a little bit warmer, but it's going to be brief because by the time we get back to the weekend, another round of arctic air really begins to spread into pretty much everyone for the eastern half of the country. So, again, enjoy that brief reprieve tomorrow. In the short-term, however, we're still focused on all of the snow that's falling across portions of the mid-Atlantic and the northeast. You still have winter weather alerts stretching from Louisiana all the way up into Maine. And the southern focus there is the concern for some ice. But up north, the main concern here is just snow. You've got it falling across places like New York, Boston, Hartford, even around Providence, Rhode Island. Again, here's a look at the forecast, though. You can see most of that line really begins to push back out once we get later on this evening. So, folks starting to dry out once we get through the last portion of the afternoon commute later on today into northeast. The real question is, how much snow does New York end up with. If we can end up getting at least an inch of that, it will break our streak. We're currently sitting at 701 days without an inch of snow in New York. They are likely to break that streak. Some other cities already have, including Philadelphia. So far they've picked up about an inch and a half. Their streak was 715 days. Washington, D.C., had gone all the way up to 728 days. So far they've picked up about 1.8 so far up to this point.",

Iran also fired missiles at what it's calling terror groups in northern Syria, saying they were involved in the grave-side bombings of military commander Qassem Soleimani.

      "sentences": "Well, it's really significant because, obviously, this doesn't come in a vacuum. As you know, Phil, the U.S. government has been pressuring Israel to transition to a lower intensity phase of fighting out of concern for civilian life in the Gaza Strip and growing international pressure on the Israeli government. And now for about a week or so we've been hearing from some Israeli military officials that there has been this transition underway to a lower intensity phase of operations.But Yoav Gallant, the country's defense minister, is the senior most official so far to actually confirm that that change is actually happening on the ground. And he's also articulating it in the clearest terms possible. He says that Israel has concluded its intensive ground operations in northern Gaza and also significantly saying that he believes that that change, that transition will also soon happen in southern Gaza in the Khan Yunis area, the second largest city in the Gaza Strip. He says that Israeli forces are now focused on crushing what he calls pockets of resistance in northern Gaza. But at the same time, we are also seeing evidence on the ground of this transition in Israeli ground operations. An entire division of troops, thousands of Israeli soldiers, overnight withdrawing from key areas in northern and central Gaza as well. The clearest indication yet that Israel is actually following through on what the United States has been pressuring it to do for weeks now. Now, the question of course is, what will happen after that? Because as Israeli officials have repeatedly told me, even though they can ramp down the intensity of operations, that also means that they can ramp it back up as necessary. And we know that in southern Gaza, they are certainly still trying to go after and capture or kill Hamas leaders who they believe are hidden underground. Phil. Poppy.",

And he suggested before Iowa voted that perhaps things might not be right, something might be amiss. We have not heard a word of that since he won with the commanding lead that he did. But if he were to lose here or, you know, have a much more narrow margin, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that we could hear the former president say that there was voter fraud or that the New Hampshire election was rigged.
