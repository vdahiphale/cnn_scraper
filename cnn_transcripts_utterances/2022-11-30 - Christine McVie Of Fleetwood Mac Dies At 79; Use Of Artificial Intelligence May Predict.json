TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so this is my wheelhouse, my favorite topic, cardiology. Leading cause of death in men and women in this country. And so, as you said, if we can find a way to add to our ability to predict someone's risk in an event, that would be huge. Right now, we use a risk calculator. And this study basically looked at the use of a single chest x-ray. And so, they basically they took 150,000 chest x-rays and plugged them in and generated an A.I. model and then they applied it in the world to 11,000 patients. And they in fact found that over those next ten years, the A.I. model with the chest x-rays was accurately or very closely predict the outcomes of those patients. And so, this is definitely promising. I want to highlight though it is preliminary. This has not been published. This has not been peer reviewed. So, it's really more of a proof of concept but definitely interesting and exciting. The Holy Grail in cardiology is picking out those people who are high risk and getting them started on the road to prevention early.",

That's the purpose of the interim order.The purpose of the complaint is to allow us to negotiate or at least to attempt to negotiate a consent decree which will then be judicially enforceable. And that's the second part of your question. Now as for the -- how it relates to an environmental justice. In May of this year, we issued a comprehensive strategy for environmental justice, part of which -- the first part of which is to prioritize actions in cases of overburdened and underserved communities. And that's what we are doing with respect to Jackson. The department's founding purpose was to protect civil rights of American citizens. Part of the reason that I wanted to be the Attorney General was to work on those problems. This is an example of our using all the resources of the Justice Department and civil rights issues -- not only the civil rights division, but civil rights are an element of the environment division, of every part of this component and of the work that every employee of this department in their ordinary, everyday work employs.",

But instead, the product of an organized conspiracy.And you could see what the Attorney General was really trying to say here is, look, we do more work here at the Justice Department than just these high-profile political investigations into the former president and his associates. And Victor, over the past seven years or so, there has been frustration inside the Justice Department that so much of the attention goes to the high-profile political investigations, either into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, the Mueller probe, now the two investigations into former President Trump. But they do so much more work on a day-to-day basis.

And one of the names, the first one he brought up was Stewart Rhodes -- who was the founder of the Oath Keepers. This is a message to the leaders of groups that are extremist groups -- in this case a far right militia style extremist anti-government group.This is a message to the leadership to say, if you go forward and do some of these things like trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power in the United States, we are coming for you. And a jury is going to see all the evidence. And in this case, a jury convicted two of the five members of this group, one of them was an associate of the group, for seditious conspiracy. The charge is very difficult. It is a very rare charge, a charge we haven't seen levied against an American in about a decade, more than a decade. And so, it's not something that the Justice Department would take lightly or anyone would take lightly. But this I think really sends a message, particularly to the leadership of some of these groups. It was not a slam dunk. We should be clear.

And it's a very powerful tool of the Justice Department has in its civil enforcement authority to seek these kinds of consent decrees. You see it in the civil rights context all the time. It's not uncommon to file a suit like this, use that as a negotiatingtool to get everybody to come to the table, the community, stakeholders, citizens and law enforcement, to come to some consensus that make people's lives better. Backing up Paula's point, we focus on the political investigations and politicians being investigated. This is the very, very important work that the 115,000 people at the Justice Department do every day and they should be celebrating it. And frankly, given all the criticism that the Attorney General took and has taken for being slow to the punch when it comes to the victory laps, this is the kind of work that they ought to be trumpeting much more.",
