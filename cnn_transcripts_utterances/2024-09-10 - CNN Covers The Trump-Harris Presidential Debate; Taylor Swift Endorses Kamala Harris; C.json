And we talked earlier. I mentioned, you know, being unconventional, which he has been all these years. Doesn't mean he's unpredictable. And it turned out she could use mad libs of triggers of everything he has ever talked about or been bothered by and use them in a formula that was to first talk about an attack line he might have said to her, take a topic she was weak on, follow it up with a trigger for him, and then watch him spin himself in circles trying to defend it. And at the start of this conversation, at the start of the night, we talked about who's going to look like an incumbent versus who's going to look like a challenger.

Sitting Republican lawmakers who objectively think she won the debate, but also that the mask is starting to slip with Donald Trump, that this is the man who projects himself as strong, as in command.

You ran for president a couple years before you were president. And Donald Trump said the best he could do about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare are some concept and some ideas.That issue was perilous for the Democrats in the first two years when it was being implemented because the change hadn't been fulfilled yet and change is scary when it comes to something so personal like your healthcare. It's one of the most popular issues in the country right now. It has been a huge boon for Democrats. And again, I'm going back to, if you're a Trump voter, I'm getting incoming for some of the Trump voters I've met in my travels, and they're defending him. But the Republican strategists, they're not surprised because they know Donald Trump. They know he takes the bait. But they're really disappointed that he didn't have answers on substantive policy questions. To your point about immigration, that on what should be his issue, he took the bait and was talking about conspiracy theories and other things. And on policy proposals that matter to the people who will settle the election, he had nothing to say.",

And every time she tripped him up a little bit, she didn't then try and respond to him. She just said, see what I told you. I told you what you were going to get. I'm keeping them honest. She also helped turn the page when she said, you're not running against Joe Biden. That was a subtle reminder for Americans for the last two years, is that they didn't want that rematch. And the last time they watched the debate, it was a rematch. And she was like, guess what, folks? I'm here, here's an alternative, here's a path to the future. And the final thing I'll say is that I'm texting with some folks who are doing dial testing focus groups during this debate, undecided voters in Georgia. First, the gender gap is massive. It's about a 20, 30-point gender cap on her responses. But one of Trump's worst answers was his response to COVID. And that was really when he started to un- spiral and unravel and he couldn't get back on track. I mean, say what you want friends, but she nailed it tonight.",

He also then went down a rabbit hole on Charlottesville.I mean, it's useful to the Harris campaign to have Trump revisit all of the most unpopular parts of his history and his personality and his attitude and his lack of remorse. That is a useful thing more so than her defending her own race and racial identity which, honestly, she barely did. I mean, she did it very briefly, and then she just created a scenario in which Trump just went down a rabbit hole that was -- was set for him. That was, honestly, the whole debate in a nutshell.

I think a lot of Americans say, well, all politicians lie. No major presidential candidate before Donald Trump has ever lied with this kind of frequency. A remarkably large chunk of what he said tonight was just not true. And this wasn't like little exaggeration political spin. A lot of his false claims were untethered to reality. On abortion, saying every Democrat wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, though actually more than 80% of Democrats supported Roe. On crime, saying it's through the roof. Though it's actually sharply down since early 2023, it's now lower than it was since Trump left office. On health care, saying he's the one who saved Obamacare, the law he actually repeatedly tried to overturn. On Kamala Harris herself, saying that a Howard University grad, Black Law Students Association president had claimed that she wasn't Black at one point. Frankly, I don't have enough time here to run through each specific Trump false claim. I urge people to go to our CNN website or our app to read our team's detailed fact checks on this and a whole bunch more.

Vance, the vice-presidential candidate, who himself had promoted these claims, acknowledged this morning that the -- quote -- \"rumors might turn out false,\" although he still encouraged people to spread these cat memes. Now, I'll note that Trump himself added dogs to the equation. They had not even been part of these viral nonsense rumors before. Now, let's look at one false claim that Vice President Harris did make about the economic situation that the Biden-Harris administration was left by Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us.

So, it was already improving at the time the Biden-Harris administration took office. And that 6.4% level was the highest since the Great Recession.

He thinks it's absurd to even talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that has no chance of being brought. I think it's a totally reasonable point.But again, the main substantive issue is Donald Trump believes that abortion should be a state policy and Kamala Harris fundamentally thinks that abortion should be funded by taxpayers right up to the moment of birth. It was interesting that the ABC fact checkers or the moderators who, frankly, were just helping Kamala Harris in the debate, that they said that no state supports abortion up to the moment of birth.

So, we wanted to ask voters who have not made a firm decision yet who they want to vote for what they actually saw in this debate. Now, these are voters that have in the past supported Republicans and Democrats. They have in the past shown support for former President Trump or for Joe Biden. But coming into this night, they told us that they had not made up their minds yet in this election. So, just to step back a little bit, show our focus group, two people, Erie residents. Again, most important state, most important county in that state. We asked for a show of hands before the debate who hadn't made up their mind yet but thought this debate may determine where they would go with their vote. To start, with this debate, who do you think won, by a show of hands, former President Trump? Two. I'll give it four. But tentative. Two over there. What about Vice President Harris? More hands.
