President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, though, face another heavy lift after hammering out a deal in principle to raise the nation's debt ceiling.They now have to get their parties to support it. Based on early reaction, it may not be entirely easy. The House vote is expected on Wednesday, and hard-liners from both sides are signaling they at least will not support the agreement. So here's part of what's in it. It suspends the debt ceiling through all of next year. That allows lawmakers to avoid a similar game of chicken during the 2024 election cycle. The deal also caps 2024 spending, broadens work requirements for food stamp recipients, and claws back tens of billions of dollars in unspent COVID relief funds. What it does not do is touch top-line items such as Social Security and defense spending or the tax code. CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's at the White House. Jeremy, President Biden once again achieved a compromise here with Republicans, to the chagrin of some members of his own party.

But there are some glimmers of hope for the White House in getting this passed, as you see some centrist Democrats, including the New Democrat Coalition, who have suggested that they are interested in voting for this bill, so still some more work to do here for the White House, but they do believe that they can get this passed, ultimately -- Jim.",

That's supposed to happen every year. Sometimes, it happens in a more orderly process than otherwise. But with divided government, there was going to be some sort of compromise, probably something along the lines of what we ultimately got, so basically flat spending, flat domestic spending, a little bump to defense spending, and some tweaks around the edges to a bunch of domestic programs. I think that's probably where we would have been absent this brinksmanship. With the brinksmanship, of course, we ended up in the same place, but caused a lot of damage along the way to our global reputation. There was a fair amount of economic turmoil. Clearly, it could have been worse if we had actually defaulted. But Biden had to cut short his trip to Asia to deal with this temper tantrum.

They're -- the estimates vary, but it's like, for every dollar that the IRS spends, for example, on enforcement, they bring several dollars back in, in return because they're going out and they're collecting bills that are owed to Uncle Sam, essentially. So, if you look at how the Congressional Budget Office scores these things, how lots of other independent institutions score these kinds of funding measures, funding for the IRS, they always show that it more than pays for itself. So, here, by taking some of that money away from the Internal Revenue Service, that will actually cost the United States more in the long run that will ultimately have to be made up for either in higher tax rates or spending cuts of some kind, right? If we're not collecting the taxes that are already legally owed, you have to make up for that shortfall somewhere else. So, this is not the -- this is -- you know, defunding the IRS, defunding the tax police is not where you would start if you were really interested in controlling the United States' long-term fiscal challenges.",

That is the highest number we have seen since the depths of the pandemic, day after day, actually bigger than the same day back in 2019, before the pandemic.

They're saying they will shoot this thing down if it enters into Japanese airspace. And it wouldn't be unprecedented for a North Korean projectile to enter into Japan's airspace.

I went to North Korea and actually met with the scientists that are charged with developing this technology. And they insisted to me that this is for peaceful purposes.
