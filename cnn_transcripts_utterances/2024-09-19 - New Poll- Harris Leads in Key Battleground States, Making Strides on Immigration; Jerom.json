A new Quinnipiac poll finding that Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump by five points among likely voters in both Michigan and Pennsylvania. There is no clear leader shown in their poll in Wisconsin, where Harris is ahead by just one point. That poll comes on the same day that the influential Teamsters union announced they won't endorse a candidate in this election. Internal polling that was shared by the Teamsters ahead of that announcement showed Trump with almost double Harris's support among the union's rank and file. In a statement, the union president saying this: quote, \"Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business,\" end quote.

I think there's been this perception of the chaos at the border, of the numbers of people crossing the border. This being such a potent issue and such a vulnerability for Democrats. But now they're seeing, you know, Harris a little more on the campaign trail. People might not necessarily know exactly what's happening on the Hill. But she's really bringing home this point that there was this bipartisan bill that she wanted to see get through Congress and that Trump helped kill that. And then you have, on the other side, you have Trump talking about cat eating, the Haitian immigrants in Ohio. So, that is sort of making people question a little bit, like, is this too extreme? But I will say something, too, here, is the reality is that Trump has shifted the politics of immigration to the right. I mean, we're not hearing Harris on the campaign trail talking about a fair and humane immigration system and undoing the policies of Donald Trump. She's talking about endorsing a bill that has been endorsed by the Border Patrol union; that has been widely criticized by immigration and human rights groups.

And we can argue whether or not that's a term that we should be used. It was used in 2021 on this network. She was in charge of the border for a long period of time.
