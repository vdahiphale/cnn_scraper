      "sentences": "In just moments, Louisville officials will give us an update on their investigation into the arrest of the world's number one golfer Scottie Scheffler. It's been nearly a week since he was arrested just outside the PGA Championship. Police say he was on his way to the golf course when he tried to drive around traffic at the scene of a deadly crash. Schaeffler now faces multiple criminal charges, including one felony for second-degree assault of a police officer. He is continuing to play on the PGA Tour and is expected to tee off later this afternoon in Texas.CNN Law Enforcement Contributor Steve Moore is joining us right now. Steve, thanks very much for joining us. What do you expect we'll hear at this upcoming press conference?",

And what's going on here is he was charged with second- degree assault, which -- it means that he would have had to have either seriously injured the officer by wanton behavior, or that he intentionally injured the officer using a deadly weapon. Well, a car is considered a deadly weapon. Either way, they're going to have a lot of trouble proving that Scheffler who has a sterling reputation intentionally injured a police officer because he didn't want to be kept from going into the golf club. BLITZEROther important news we're following this morning on Capitol Hill, House Republicans are pushing forward with a vote on so-called election integrity legislation. The dual bills look to curb non- citizen voting here in the United States. But Democrats call it a solution in search of a problem because it's already illegal for non- citizens to vote in federal elections. Earlier this month, House Speaker Mike Johnson seemed to admit the legislation is largely based on theories, not hard evidence. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): We all know intuitively that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it's not been something that is easily provable. We don't have that number. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But you know, we have heard from anonymous sources and some sources that have been named that there is concern that there's an overcharge in this matter. The fact that they're alleging that the number one golfer in the world intentionally used his car to injure an officer, I would think they would have wanted to address that further if they had any doubt about the charges. So, I thought that we would get more. And I was kind of surprised that we didn't have the district attorney there to discuss the charges themselves. They may have felt that opened up another can of worms. But it isn't the -- it isn't the complete openness and honesty that they said that they were showing us.",
