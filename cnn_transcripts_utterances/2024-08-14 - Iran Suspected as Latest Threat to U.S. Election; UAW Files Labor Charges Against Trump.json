We've seen this playbook before in the 2016 presidential election. Investigators say Russia, of course, infiltrated both campaigns to try to help Donald Trump in 2020. Russian, Chinese, and Iranian hackers targeted both campaigns.And just weeks ago, the feds warned that Russia, China, and Iran are again seeking to influence this upcoming election. I mean, you would think by now we would be ready for this sort of thing, but it just goes to show you these foreign actors are going to continue to try to do this and find vulnerabilities.",

      "sentences": "Well, I have to agree with Beth that the phishing attacks are a relatively simple tactic, but we know from past history, as you note, Jim, that they can have extraordinary effects. I mean, the Russian interference in U.S. elections in 2016 began with phishing attacks that resulted in information that was then hacked and leaked. And here we are, eight years later, we are still dealing with the fallout, the political fallout of that interference.So, I think it's too early to say what the repercussions will be from this Iran intervention. But I think we can be confident in knowing that this is not the end of it. And I think the bigger data point here is that interference in U.S. elections has really become a sport that a lot more countries are starting to play in. I mean, in 2016, we saw our biggest foreign adversary -- one of our biggest foreign adversaries, Russia, interfering in our elections. But more and more countries are getting into the fold. This is something that we had been warning about for a number of years, and I would not suspect that this election it stops with Iran. Now, behind the scenes, Jim, the conversation in the White House Situation Room is what to do next. And we had these conversations in the last administration about what to do when you get this information. Do you investigate it? Do you keep the details quiet? Do you declassify some of the information? And you can expect the Biden administration right now, given the sensitivity, is in a deep debate and discussion about the appropriate next steps.",

I mean, I think that we know Russia has decided that Trump would be better for them, and Iran has decided that Harris would be better for them. So, you know, we have that. But the disruptive effect of this is what I think is the most concerning and what voters need to pay attention to.I'm less worried about them being influenced in some way by this kind of media and disinformation than I am a message that comes out that looks very authentic, that's targeted and tell someone their polling station has been moved or closed, or that creates real doubt about whether the votes were counted correctly. And we should expect that A.I. generated images, fake newscasters, these kinds of things can make someone look like they're cheating in terms of counting. And so, that is what I am most worried about is, you know, right around the election and right after the election, can these actors disrupt and make Americans believe that the votes weren't correct?",

TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:   Vice President Harris and I have both had the privilege of joining workers on the picket line. Donald Trump and J. D. Vance, they see the world very differently than we do. They've waged war on workers.

Lance, let me start with you first. I mean, if you were writing out Trump's talking points, would you have had him praise Elon Musk for firing workers who go on strike? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR GOVERNOR BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  Well, look, Donald Trump says a lot of things when he's on TV, when he's in these things. Look, the union filing a complaint, no one has done better with union workers and blue-collar workers than Donald Trump has. He's rewritten the book over the course of the last eight years. And I think if you talk to a lot of workers out there, they know that he's been with them and that he is -- they're really focused on the economy. They're really focused on the cost of living and they'll tell you that they -- what the leadership does doesn't always reflect what they do. And that's where Donald Trump has rewritten the book. I think if you talk to a lot of those union workers out there, they're really focused on the cost of living, which is up over 20 percent since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris came into office. So, I think at the end of the day, when the dust settles, that's what union workers are going to be focused on.",

And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, Joe Biden too, by the way, brings the Democrats right back to that middle class economic sweet spot.And look, who better to run against than a billionaire who's in it for himself, you know? And so, I think this is exactly the economic contrast that Democrats want. And Lance speaks good point, Trump did make inroads with those union workers in the last election. Can he sustain it now when he's openly attacking unions and calling for firing people who try to organize? That -- as we say in Texas, again, that dog don't hunt.",

But if -- also in the Elon Musk interview, there was a substantive portion to that. We can debate all the things they talked about, but in terms of the campaign as well, its issue focused.But I read in Axios this morning that Kamala Harris is looking to redefine herself. Jim, her spokesperson couldn't even say whether she would do a press conference to you by the end of the month. So, I think really where voters are looking for are to get answers from Kamala Harris and where she stands on the issues. As far as the campaign itself, Donald Trump, they're laser focused on the issues. It's the Harris campaign that wants to do a bunch of rallies, as you heard her spokesperson say, and not take real questions from reporters and define herself because what we know is the record that we have to go on is one of the most far dangerously left records we've seen in this country, and that's who's running. So, if she's going to redefine herself, which, by the way, I look at as rewriting history, she needs to come out and tell us where she sees the future of this country going.",

She's been trying to vet and pick her vice-presidential candidate, which has been greatly successful. And she's been out in the swing states speaking to voters.So, it's not like she's been running for nine months. It's not like she's been running for a year or four years like Donald Trump has.
