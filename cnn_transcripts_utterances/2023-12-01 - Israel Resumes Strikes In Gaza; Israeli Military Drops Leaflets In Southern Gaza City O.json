Plus, a finality for the fabulous George Santos, kicked out of the house. And that is not a lie. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with Israel-Hamas in the first day of fighting after a seven-day truce in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes resuming today in northwest Gaza, and according to Hamas's interior ministry, also targeting sites in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. The IDF dropped leaflets into the area today calling Khan Younis, quote, \"a fighting zone.\" Hamas, for its part, resumed rocket attacks into Israel. As for the hostages, sources are telling us that both Israeli and American officials believe Hamas continues to hold a number of women taken from the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, an IDF spokesman tonight, putting the number of women and children still captive at 17 out of 136 hostages in all. Talks to freedom continue in Qatar -- all this against the backdrop of last night's detailed and damning report that Israeli leaders dismissed warnings of Hamas's attack plans for more than a year leading up to the 7th. In a moment, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's take on that and renewed fighting. Also, what CNN's John Miller is learning from his sources in the intelligence community. First, the latest from CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is what Israel vowed would happen if Hamas stopped releasing its hostages. After a seven-day pause and more than 100 freed, Gaza is being pounded again. Israeli officials say military pressure will force Hamas to release more.",
