How do you -- how do you counter some of those types of attacks? BILL DE BLASIO (D), FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, you got to point out that Tim Walz is a person who got Minnesota and Minneapolis out of that horrible situation. I mean, that was an unprecedented moment in American history of pandemic plus civil unrest. And we've got to give Tim Walz credit for getting a handle this situation and turning it around. We had a lot of the same conditions in New York City. So I can speak from experience. It's incredibly challenging. But he got the job done. On top of that, you've got a guy who's done real things, that he gave school lunches to all of the children of Minnesota. He's done tangible things that, honestly, everyday Americans can relate to it, especially the people who will decide this election. And those are suburban, moderate women. They're going to look at Tim Walz's actual record of accomplishment. He's a family man. They're going to look at his personality. They can look at the way he's lived his life. Being a high school teacher, that's something that's going to appeal to a lot of people. So I think it's profile. I think it's personality and achievements that are kitchen table and accessible. He's the perfect candidate to appeal to women in those blue wall states, especially. That's where the Democrats win.",

If you could kind of address that.But if you could also speak to what the mayor also just said about those kitchen-table issues. A lot of them were quite progressive, a Medicaid expansion, paid family leave. But for instance, I mean, we can all go back to the beginning of the Trump administration where that was a project that Ivanka Trump was going to be working on because it was so popular. Those progressive things that he championed, are they really that easy to demonize for Republicans?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a good question. So let me touch on the first issue, which I was kind of going to respond to the former mayor about.The governor, actually, I think, ultimately, apologized by -- about delaying how long it took for him to send in the National Guard to deal with some of the rioting and protests and the violence we saw. Obviously, we understood why, but clearly there is a way, I guess, one could argue in terms of showcasing your frustration, your disappointment, your sadness, and maybe even your anger. So the governor has acknowledged it, that he didn't handle that situation as well as he could have. Republicans are going to attack that because they're going to make it about crime. Is Tim Walz capable of handling some of the crime and communities and in other places where Americans feel that that's a top priority? Granted, it is down nationally. But there are some areas where we're seeing pockets of that could still become problematic. In terms of some of the more progressive issues, I think it resonates with some Americans, Brianna, but I think the fundamental question for the average American will be, can I see a continuance of wage increases and a continuance of inflation and inflation reduction? So that, if I'm making more money, I can afford things comfortably, I can save more, I can afford a last-minute emergency. And that's not the case for a significant percentage of Americans. I think Republicans will attempt to draw that contrast, not only from the vice president, but also for Governor Walz.",

But is it desirable? No. And certainly not at a cost question of high interest rates with inflation being now what we've got now.Of course, inflation coming down, which means people have got more money in their pockets to spend on things like groceries and gas. And if the Fed does lower interest rates, giving it a boost, then car loans, housing, their mortgages are slightly lower. for the long term. But many of those short-term interest rates, overdrafts, credit cards, they will become cheaper, the debt on that. More money in your pocket debt, debt levels go lower. Yes. One of the big problems in the U.S. economy is the high level of consumer debt. That needs to unwind. That's what will do it.",

These sources believe those strikes could happen here in the coming days.Iran warning of blood vengeance after blaming Israel for the assassination of a Hamas political leader in Tehran last week. The U.S. now says that an Iran-aligned militia group was behind launching a rocket attack at the Al-Assad Airbase in Iraq on Monday. That's a strike that injured seven American servicemembers, with two who we're evacuated for further care. Officials say that this is a dangerous escalation.

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna, so we're told from multiple sources that it does appear like some preparations have been gone to be made by Iran and by Hezbollah for potential retaliation against Israel.But what exactly those preparations look like still remains unclear, as does the timing of a potential attack. Now, just going back to April, when Iran launched that attack on Israel, you could see missiles moving around. U.S. officials, they saw, very clear signs that the Iranians we're preparing something potentially very significant. They're not seeing those kinds of signs at this point, we're told. It does not appear, at this point, like, you know, the very visible and very active preparations are being made. But they are seeing some signs that there are things moving around. Potentially, some kind of attack could be coming in the coming days. It remains unclear what that is actually going to look like or whether going to even be coordinated between Hezbollah and Tehran or whether Hezbollah is going to kind of go at it alone. That is now a more acute concern by U.S. officials that perhaps a larger attack could come, right -- right on Israel's border there from southern Lebanon, from Hezbollah. So they're watching this very closely. And of course, at the same time, you have these U.S. servicemembers who were attacked, according to U.S. officials at Al-Assad Airbase in Iraq just yesterday. Five U.S. servicemembers, as well as two contractors, we're injured in that attack, with two of them needing to be evacuated for further care. So the U.S. right now is basically ramping up all of its preparations for the possibility that something happens here, putting additional defensive assets in the region, including an aircraft carrier, as well as additional U.S. destroyers. But at the same time, really working kinetically behind the scenes on this diplomatic push to try to de-escalate tensions. You saw President Biden today speak to the leaders of Egypt and Qatar. And Secretary Blinken, of course, also working the phones, all in an effort to try to say, look, let's move on from this. Let's try to cool off a bit and de-escalate. We'll see, of course, whether that works. But for now, U.S. officials really preparing for the worst here and hoping for the best -- Brianna?",

We should mention, as he's landed, he now gets turned over to U.S. Secret Service protection, where he'll begin an onboarding process, which is standard.From here, he'll head to his first campaign event as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. That event set to begin at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time. We will continue to watch the governor's movements on this big day. But we're also watching tropical storm movements, specifically Tropical Storm Debby. It's slowly wreaking havoc across the southeastern United States, southeastern U.S., I should say. Historic and unprecedented rainfall is creating dangerous flash flooding in parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Multiple tornadoes have already whipped through several towns as well. CNN's Allison Chinchar is in the CNN Weather Center with more on Debby's track. So, Allison, how much rain can we expect here?",
