At this moment, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione is behind bars in Pennsylvania, charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. And this morning, we're standing by to learn when he will be extradited here to New York.Police say he was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days and roughly 300 miles away from the site of the killing. Police are now piecing together an assassination plot as new clues into a possible motive surface. According to court records, the suspected killer had 3D printed ghost gun on him, several fake I.D.s, $8,000 in cash and a three page handwritten manifesto, if you will. He had that all on him when he was caught. In his writings were the words, these parasites had it coming. We've got new details on his past, a wealthy Maryland family, a private school valedictorian, the graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, last known address in Hawaii. We have an extensive online profile being gone through right now. Apparently, it includes a photo posted to X of what appears to be an X-ray image of a spine with hardware from some kind of surgery he might have had. His former roommate told CNN of his apparent back troubles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) R.J. MARTIN, SUSPECT'S FORMER ROOMMATE:  Before he moved in, I remember he said he had a back issue and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii. When he first came, he went on a surf lesson with other members and unfortunately, just a basic surf lesson, he was in bed for about a week. We had to get a different bed for him that was more firm. And I know it was really traumatic and difficult. You know, when you're in the early 20s and you can't, you know, do some basic things, it can be really, really difficult. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Does the suspect waive arraignment and says, take me back to New York, or does he fight -- I'm sorry, waive extradition, or does he fight extradition, which will probably not change the process, but slow it down.",

Students right now being told to shelter in place.The fire tripled in size in barely an hour, and it's now burned 18,000 acres in Malibu. It's 0 percent contained, triggering some mandatory evacuations and red flag warnings are in effect for over 12 million people across Southern California. Pepperdine University, though, just sent out a message on social media moments ago in part of it, saying that university believes the worst of the fire has passed. The shelter in place will remain in place until at least daylight. So, a lot happening as we speak. Let's get over CNN's Derek Van Dam who's tracking the very latest. What do you see, Derek?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, this is still a very fluid situation, Kate, considering that we do believe that the most intense Sta. Ana winds will actually occur right around daybreak. So, that's something we're monitoring very closely.But I want to take you to this Cal Fire website. I'm going to have my producer, Monica, actually drive this in the background. What you're looking at here are the latest warnings. We're in Southern California. Here's Malibu. This is Malibu Canyon Road. And this is the area we watched the fire rapidly grow in size overnight. So, roughly around 350 acres at about 2:00 A.M. Eastern Time this morning, and then it blew up to over 1,800 acres. So, this is the current perimeter of the actual fire. There are mandatory evacuation orders for parts of Malibu. But as we zoom in closer to Pepperdine University, here it is, there was actually, according to university officials, helicopters taking water from some of the nearby lakes in what's known as Alumni Park. You can see them right there. They took water from those lakes and helped extinguish some of the flames in and around the Pepperdine region near the Franklin fire. There are still spot fires that according to university officials are not threatening life or structures. But because there is no power across much of Malibu, they're going to maintain that shelter in place at least through daylight this morning. So, let's go a little bit further east. Here's Pacific Coast Highway. Here's Malibu Road. And then this is an iconic figure of Malibu. This is the Malibu Pier, which according to the city of Malibu, has also taken on flames from the Franklin fire as it crossed over the Pacific Coast Highway within the past 40 minutes or so. There are structures that there are currently burning, and they say that the pier has been impacted as well. Remember, this is a landmark park of that area. So, here's some of the footage coming out of Pepperdine University. When you look at the reflection in the window of the flames near the library, where the students were asked to shelter in place, that is terrifying. That is something you don't want to see. Particularly dangerous situation still in place across Southern California, L.A and into Ventura counties. Remember these are rarely issued by the National Weather Service. Last time was in November of this year for the mountain fire that caused so much destruction in portions of Ventura County. These are rare, but they're becoming more common as our climate continues to warm. Check out these wind gusts from the fire, 93 miles per hour. And some of those higher peaks, again expecting to even top out this morning as we hit daybreak. Kate?",

      "sentences": "So, John, we are actually here in one of several garages belonging to Bashar al- Assad. We are on the compound of the presidential palace. And you can see this is a man who had expensive tastes. We've seen Aston Martins, we've got Lamborghinis, we've got Ferraris.I want to add as well, that we've been walking through this compound. There are many garages. We were just in a lot where there were dozens and dozens of armored cars, if you can believe that. I don't know how anyone would need so many armored cars. And I'm bringing you over here because you can see this collection of classic cars over here. And the reason this is all significant, John, the reason that we're talking about this, that we're showing you this, is because, really, this is indicative of the deep, deep corruption of the Assad regime, which is a big part of why this whole uprising started in the first place. Back in 2011, Bashar al-Assad had been ruling for some years, his father, for many decades before, and the levels of corruption and greed, the opulence and the lavish lifestyle when so many Syrians were struggling to put food on the table. You imagine, John, the last 14 years, Syrians have been under bombardment. They've been tortured, maimed, kidnapped, killed. And meanwhile, Bashar al-Assad was living literally like a king, with garages full of cars, with palaces, with incredible mosaics and marble. And we actually watched in the presidential palace some ordinary people who managed to sneak in, walking around with their jaws dropped. They could not believe how he was living at a time when Syria was suffering so acutely. And so this really is a metaphor for the root of the rot, for where it all started, and what it really means, the spirit of this Syrian uprising. Obviously, we're not going to sugarcoat it. There is a lot of anxiety in this moment. There is a lot of anxiety about the makeup of rebel forces, about whether there will be chaos, whether there will be strict Islamic law. And so, it's not that everybody is out in the streets celebrating, but most Syrians are united in finding these displays of wealth and opulence truly sickening and indicative of the sickness of the Assad regime, John.",

She is someone who has never been afraid to buck her party, to buck Republican leadership, and so she's going to be a key meeting for him, as well also Senator Susan Collins, who we're told he's expected to meet with tomorrow.Now, also today, Hegseth is expected to meet with Senators John Cornyn, Steve Daines and Cindy Hyde-Smith, so, again, really making his rounds and trying to meet with these different senators behind closed doors. One of the key things I'm told from my conversations with Trump advisers and those working on the transition is that this whole process is about figuring out what his vulnerabilities are now so that later on, when this plays out in the public setting, which they hope he will actually get to, that it will be a much smoother process. Now, one key person, of course, that has been central to all of this, and you mentioned her, is Senator Joni Ernst. She's a former Iraq War veteran. She's someone who has also been very hard on sexual abuse in the military, working to clean some of that up. She met with Hegseth again yesterday. She described the meeting as going pretty well, and one thing as well in all of this, you mentioned Hegseth's comments about women in combat. He tried to clean that up yesterday as well. He said that, when he was trying to clarify these comments that he actually believes women are some of the country's greatest warriors, that he wants them to remain in the military. That's something Ernst commented on as well. I want you to take a listen, though, to what Senator Joni Ernst told our own Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And part of that is because they, as of now, believe that there are no hard nos on Hegseth, unlike what happened with Matt Gaetz a couple weeks ago when he ultimately withdrew. However, that could, of course, change very quickly. One big thing that everyone is waiting for is to see what happens with that FBI background check that Hegseth said he was submitting himself to. So, that's going to be one thing to keep looking out for. And, again, a clear thing I'm hearing as well in my conversations is that a lot of people at Mar-a-Lago and on the transition team believe that Trump cannot cave into senators on Hegseth. They believe doing that again would give them more power. And so he's really trying to keep propping him up throughout this entire process. Kate?",
