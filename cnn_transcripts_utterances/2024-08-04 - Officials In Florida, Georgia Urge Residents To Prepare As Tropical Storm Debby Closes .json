      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone.Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Our breaking news coverage of Tropical Storm Debby continues as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and state officials are expected to give an update later on this hour, we will bring that to you live when it happens. Debby is expected to rapidly intensify into a Category One hurricane as early as tonight before making landfall tomorrow morning near the Big Bend region in of the state. There are lots of preparations underway. Let's get right to meteorologist, Derek Van Dam, who is tracking the latest. So what can we expect?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fredricka, so we've got some new video into CNN that shows just how vulnerable that coastline on the western parts of Florida Peninsula actually is.This is coming out of Captiva Island. Remember this is near Fort Myers Beach that was hit so hard back in September 2022 with Hurricane Ian now starting to see some coastal storm surge that's impacting businesses and homes within this area. Not a trend that we like to see. High tide was about 1:08 PM within this area, so the tide is starting to go down, but nonetheless, this just shows you the extent of this large storm that's starting to gain strength and also starting to become more organized. Here is Fort Myers. Look at all the way to Tampa Bay. We could see three to five feet of storm surge with the greatest storm surge inundation right near that catcher's mitt, the Big Bend of Florida, six to ten feet above normally high ground. So here's the details. Still a tropical storm, 65 mile per hour winds. It is starting to get more organized, meaning it is strengthening. In fact, our National Hurricane Center using the words rapidly strengthening here before landfall, and it will likely be a strong Category One hurricane as it makes landfall early Monday morning, right near this location, the Big Bend of Florida. There is the radar, that shading of red is a tornado watch that is valid through 8:00 PM. It extends all the way into Southern Georgia. So spin up tornadoes, certainly a possibility as the system tries to get its act together. Now, another concerning trend that we are noticing with this along with the tropical storm warnings that are in place and hurricane warnings, there is also tropical storm watches along the coastal Carolinas and Georgia as well. But that's not the only threat, it is going to be a heavy rain maker for this that could rival some record levels as it gets into the early parts of next week, it stalls, it loses its steering currents, nothing to push it on. So when you get tropical storm feeding off of the Atlantic Ocean, and that is going to produce a lot of rainfall when it doesn't move very quickly over a long period of time, so 15 to 20 inches of rain, that's what some of our computer models are depicting. That means trouble for the low-lying areas of the Carolinas -- Fredricka.",

I think of it like getting a cell phone call from a number you don't know versus one that you have stored in your phone. You know, Josh Shapiro is in the phone of the people in this state. They know him, they trust him. They clearly like him. He is focused on issues that are very local and particular to us, so he offers a little bit of security to people that Pennsylvania's economy, both the health care side of it and the natural gas side of it and everything in between is going to be looked out for in her administration.

So certainly, they are at a heightened state of awareness and the Israeli military itself is at a heightened state of alert as the Israeli military's top spokesman, Daniel Hagari, says that the Israeli military is already reviewing potential retaliatory actions should Iran and its proxies strike. But right now, we are also very much in a war of words as the Israeli prime minister himself, his defense minister also try and project strength, trying to make Iran recalculate, rethink what it is preparing to do against Israel.  The Israeli prime minister warning that Israel is not only determined to stand against Iran on every front and in every arena, but he also says that anyone who harms the state of Israel will \"pay a very heavy price.\" He says the Israeli military is prepared for any scenario. As we are monitoring these regional threats, we are also watching as the carnage in Gaza is continuing. Another very deadly airstrike today on a pair of schools in the Western Gaza city neighborhood of Al-Nasr killing 30 people injuring at least 50 others according to the Palestinian Civil Defense. And you can just see in these images, not only the heavy toll on civilians in this instance since, but women and children in particular appear to have been impacted by this strike. That is despite the fact that the Israeli military says that they were targeting \"terrorists operating inside Hamas command and control centers,\" and the fact that they claim that they took \"numerous steps\" to minimize civilian casualties, but you can see you in that video that civilians appear to have paid a very, very high toll in this latest airstrike, which we should note is just the latest of several airstrikes on schools, housing displaced Palestinians in recent days -- Fred.",

All right, let's get more analysis now on these developments with CNN global affairs analyst, Kimberly Dozier. Good to see you, Kimberly. So these cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, I mean, as Ben was underscoring, I mean, it is a way of life right now, but it has been increasing over the last few months. So why are we seeing it continue at this kind of pace right now and not necessarily breaking out into all-out war, but that certainly is the concern and fear.",

      "sentences": "Well, it almost feels like a holding action by Hezbollah. Right now in Qatar, you have Hamas going through a leadership decision-making process to decide who is going to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was presumed killed by Israel in Tehran, so Hezbollah et cetera will be waiting for word from Iran as to when to attack and how big and how much.The worries inside Israel are that it will be some sort of coordinated attack where Hezbollah does more than just hit those border areas, but uses some of its tens of thousands of very long range missiles and projectiles to hit populated areas deep inside Israel. They have never made a major strike on Haifa, for instance, which is near Lebanon, much less on Tel Aviv or places like that, and the worry is that this would be combined with some sort of repeat attack by Iran. Iran last time sent 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles according to Israeli official count at the country, but Israel was able to use a gauntlet of its own defenses layered in with the US, Jordan, other European countries that knocked most of those projectiles out of the sky before they reached Israel proper. The worry is that you have a Hezbollah attack and Iran attack together at the same time and that would overwhelm those combined defenses.",

I mean President Zelenskyy says F-16 fighter jets have arrived in the country and he is calling it a new chapter. Can you help us understand what you think is happening there?  DOZIER: Well, one of the major things that Ukraine is facing, the major threats that we here day after day are multiple Russian projectiles overwhelming Ukraine's air defenses and hitting things like electricity plants, major parts of the infrastructure that are hard to replace because the Ukrainian power system is Soviet era and there aren't too many places that even make that equipment anymore. So the idea is to beef up Ukraine's air defenses such that they preserve some of the structure for the coming winter. What F-16s do is they add into that layered air defense. They help push back some of Russia's missiles, some of the airframes that they are using to fire this equipment. But it is going to be a slow launch, and it is going to be a slow rollout, because you've got pilots, who yes, have been training some of them for a year on how to use the F-16 airframe, but now they've got to work it into their existing military structure and that is going to take some time to work some kinks out.",

They were throwing all sorts of projectiles out them, including an armchair. They then managed to break some of the windows of this hotel and break into it. And there were, the last time I checked, there were still standoffs in Rotherham between police officers and those -- that mob, those people engaging in that disorder. At least 10 police officers have been injured.
