A make or break case for both of these campaigns is Pennsylvania where Vice President Harris and Gov. Walz just went on an extended bus tour. Donald Trump and J.D. Vance both plan to be in Pennsylvania this week with stops in Erie and Johnstown. Polling shows, of course, an incredibly tight race. A recent New York Times/Siena poll has Harris with a 50-46 edge in a head-to-head matchup with Donald Trump among likely voters. It's a reverse from where Biden found himself in July. Pennsylvania's governor and almost Harris running mate Josh Shapiro says voters are curious about the new Democratic ticket. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO, (D) PENNSYLVANIA:  When I'm out in rural communities in those areas around Pennsylvania where maybe a voter voted for Obama and then Trump, and moved to Biden -- voters who shift around -- they're really curious about Kamala Harris. They'll say to me hey, what do you think of her? What do you think she's going to do on this, that, or the other thing? I think that curiosity is important. It means they're open to casting a vote for Kamala Harris. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Fetterman is from western Pennsylvania. These are places where, as he says, they're going to need to blunt the margins. These are places where you had a lot of Obama to Trump voters, right?What are you picking up on the ground about the job that they're doing around that, and how much hope the Trump campaign potentially has of actually winning the state? STEPHEN CARUSO, CAPITOL REPORTER, SPOTLIGHT PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Well, I think that Democrats are always -- are really energized right now after having Kamala Harris be put on the ticket. I know that there were some concerns about Biden kind of near the end. But, you know, I think that politics is always a game of margins. If you are going to win a big state like Pennsylvania, every county is a little battleground. And the difference between Republicans winning 40 percent of the vote and -- or 40 percent lead in the vote in Elk County on western Pennsylvania and winning 30 percent could be the difference in this election. So, you know, I think that's why places that Sen. Fetterman is from matter. I'd also point to central Pennsylvania where I spend a lot of time. Lancaster County -- you know, Amish country but also the city of Lancaster, a thriving metropolis of its own. You know, that's a place where, in 2022, Gov. Josh Shapiro brought that county within about five points. And that's a place where Republicans normally get about 20 points. So it's not even just about east-west or anything like that. It's -- you know, the rural counties I think Republicans have to really get margins out of are places they traditionally took for granted, like central Pennsylvania. And Democrats are making inroads as they get more and more suburban. So I think from all across the state we're going to see this, like, margin fight in a lot of key places from Allegheny County to Lancaster County to even Philadelphia.",

I mean, we're talking about the area around Harrisburg, Lancaster, Carlisle.Cumberland County outside of the capital of Harrisburg is one -- is the fastest growing county in Pennsylvania. It started flipping blue in recent elections. Shapiro won in 2022. A State Supreme Court candidate, a Democrat, won it in 2023. If that keeps happening, Republicans' chances of winning Pennsylvania get lower and lower and lower. So I'm expecting to see a lot of interest in that part of the state. Western Pennsylvania obviously matters. You know, that's where my alma mater is. But the population has been shrinking there. It's going to -- it has a lot of I think traditional value, prestige value. But Trump's first visit I think since Harris was announced was to Harrisburg, I believe. Remember, he had a visit there. The NRA has a big convention there. So I'm looking to see how much energy do people put into that constellation of small cities and growing suburbs around Harrisburg.",

Carried it by very slim margins. And then, in 2020, Biden obviously won Bucks County.But what we're seeing on the ground here is that for the first time in 15 years Bucks County is actually red. It's typically a purple county but for the first time in 15 years we have more registered Republicans than Democrats. So that's kind of an interesting thing on our end and it's something that we're really keeping tabs on.
