Stand by for more details on that. We'll also get reaction from the top election official who disqualified Trump from that ballot in Maine. She'll join us live this hour.Also tonight, the horrific aftermath of Russia's biggest air attack on Ukraine since the start of that war nearly two years ago, with dozens dead and injured in multiple cities tonight. Will the deadly assault convince a very divided U.S. Congress to send more aid to Ukraine. Also here in the U.S., powerful storms are sending 20-foot-plus waves crashing into the California Coast, causing flooding, danger and panic, as you can see here, with people racing to escape from walls of water and it's not over yet. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Kaitlan Collins and you're in The Situation Room. And we do start with breaking news this hour. CNN has now learned that Donald Trump and his legal team are expected to file appeals this Tuesday, challenging his removal not just from the ballot in Colorado, but also in Maine. CNN's Paula Reid has more reporting on the next steps in these disputes over who is going to be on the ballot, with so much at stake for the 2024 election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court facing increasing pressure to weigh in on whether states can remove former President Trump from the 2024 ballot after Maine became the second state to kick him off based on the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding public office. SHENNA BELLOWS (D-ME), SECRETARY OF STATE: No secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, but no presidential candidate has ever engaged in insurrection and been disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.",

They must bring that challenge to the secretary of state. And I, under the law, was required to hold a hearing within five days of the challenge and required to hold and issue a decision.

I mean, that's not even something Jack Smith has charged him with. BELLOWS: It's important to understand that an administrative hearing under Maine's Administrative Procedure Act and in terms of implementing election law is different than a criminal proceeding in a criminal court. Sure, the standard is preponderance of the evidence. And furthermore, part of the hearing record, and my decision was based exclusively on the record before me, is not only live testimony that is subject to cross examination, but also exhibits that are produced and submitted by the parties. And, in fact, in this situation, there were thousands of pages of exhibits which I reviewed, including the bipartisan January 6th report, a bipartisan Senate report, a GAO report, a defense Department report. So, there was substantial evidence that complied with the Maine Administrative Procedure Act submitted in this proceeding that was subject to my review. And my decision was based solely on the facts before me at the hearing and on the Constitution and the rule of law.

My panel is here.Elie, I want to start with you because you have been pretty critical of this decision in Maine talking about how this went down.

And also, it is shameful and disgraceful that she's being subjected to threats. I think we have to condemn that in the harshest terms and support her.Now, as to the first question, due process, the secretary was correct when she noted that this does not have to be at the level of a criminal trial. However, there still does have to be some minimum of due process, and I think there's going to be a real question there. As you noted, there was really only one not even fact witness. It was a law professor, who I guess was an expert witness, technically. Now, the secretary said to you just now, well, Donald Trump could have called witnesses if he wanted. The problem is that's not his burden legally. And the secretary acknowledges that in her opinion. It's the burden of the complainants. One witness is really hard to justify. The documents that were submitted, there were some very important reports, the January 6th report, which is, in my view, quite credible. The problem is these documents, many of them contain hearsay, double hearsay, triple hearsay, would absolutely not have been admitted in a civil court, in a criminal court. And so while it's not at the level of a criminal trial, there is some due process, and this is going to be scrutinized very carefully. On the recusal issue, I'm completely unconvinced. The secretary said publicly in a tweet, well before this hearing, that there was an insurrection and Donald Trump was guilty of it. She had pre-decided this issue before the hearing happened. She had this sort of technical thing about the timing, but she also said, I didn't need to recuse anyway. That's just wrong. Any judge who did this would immediately recuse himself or herself. So, I respectfully disagree on that point.",

No matter how imperfect, this is the process in the state of Maine.And now the larger question that the Supreme Court will likely have to decide is, is this process, right, a political official in the state, is that who they thought should analyze the Constitution and decide whether or not someone is an insurrectionist and whether they should be on the ballot, is that what was intended, that is a very serious question that should now be decided by the Supreme Court.

But what is on the table right now, because there are Senate Republicans who do want to get aid to Ukraine passed, but they say that Democrats are going to have to swallow some agreements when it comes to -- on immigration, on the southern border. And, obviously, those are ones that a lot of Democrats don't like. But do you believe that your Democratic colleagues in the Senate should work with Republicans, should kind of bite the bullet here on this to get another aid bill to Ukraine passed.",

Imagine, imagine saying that unless we get what we want on the border, Ukraine gets it in the head. Imagine had FDR said that, well, we'll fight the Japanese empire which just destroyed Pearl Harbor, but here are a whole bunch of domestic priorities that are important to me. So, at some level, it's just another reason why the Republicans have drifted away from their commitment to defending freedom and democracy around the world.But to answer your question very specifically, look, they are in the majority in the House. We should do better on the border. No question about it. We could do an awful lot with respect to immigration reform and border security and stopping the inflow, the uncontrolled inflow of people. So, yes, let's engage. Let's have that conversation. I know it's going to be hard, but recognize that immigration is one of the hardest things that the Congress does. It's why we haven't passed an immigration bill in decades. And so contemplate the possibility that it may not work. And if it does not work, you don't get a border deal and Ukraine gets swallowed by Vladimir Putin. Is that really the structure you want to do? But to answer your question, yes, let's negotiate a border deal. Let's see if we can get that done. And if we can get it done, terrific. But either way, we need to support the Ukrainians in this existential fight. COLLINS: We'll see if they do. Congressman Jim Himes, thanks for your time.",

She got too close to Donald Trump and when the lights were brightest, she folded. I think that's the larger takeaway from this. And Chris Christie is right. I mean, those of us who know Nikki Haley, who have campaigned against her, who worked with her, who sat besides her, who legislated with her, we know this to be true, she is someone who will try to apiece everybody and every audience and she got caught on the issue that's very, very simple. This is not something that's a very difficult issue for most Americans who are genuine and intellectually honest. But when you try to cater to many bases, you get caught like this. She'd much rather be talking about Clemson's -- and I hate talking about Clemson or anything, but Clemson's victory today over Kentucky, and talking about this issue of slavery, but here we are.",

She benefitted from being probably the most polished politician in the Republican field so far. She hasn't really had a gaffe for a media cycle that's been super negative.And so, I think people were looking to see, hey, how is she going to react when it's her time in the barrel. I am not certain the cleanup day was all that impressive. I don't think, you know, most sort of hardcore Republican voters aren't all that worried about media outrages. But I will say, these independents both in New Hampshire -- and, by the way, anybody can caucus in Iowa. They might have been looking at her as an alternative for the party to move on from Trump and this may have given them some pause. It's hard to measure, I don't know how you poll it at this point.

I mean, these presidential campaigns, they show who you are. They show your true character. And Nikki Haley is Eddie Effors (ph). I mean, she's a fence sitter and she doesn't really stand for much. And that is what happens when you run for president of the United States. Donald Trump showed us one thing and I can't wait for Twitter to blow up about this because it's true. But if you are going to be ignorant, stand in it. Like Donald Trump owns his ignorance. He owns his bravado, he owns his -isms, his racisms, his xenophobia. He owns those things.
