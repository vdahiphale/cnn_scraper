And anyone who lives in the city understands the fact that there's been major work done over the years to try to get all these water mains fixed. But at the same time, that hasn't happened fast enough for all the expansion that's going on in this big city here. So, between Google, between the Marriott Hotel and all the high-rises that are going on around here, they've definitely dealt with some water pressure issues.I talked to one guy today who was saying he was going to have to drive to a friend's house to get a shower because all weekend long they've been experiencing issues with trying to take a shower or having to boil water. Now, this only had a - not only had an impact down here, but there were concerts that got canceled. Meghan the Stallion was supposed to have a performance on Saturday and Friday. That didn't happen because of this. Residents have been walking out and asking the folks here, when was this all going to be done? So, you see the work is being done behind me, but up the street here they're also cutting the street. And we've had residents walking down to ask us that same question. The mayor himself has plans to be down here around 10:30 to try to figure out exactly where the progress is. We believe today that this will be sort of taken care of. But think about the hospitals as well. That was impacted. We're told the flow there at Grady Memorial Hospital has been taken care of. They're back fully operational. They brought tankers in to actually put water into some of these places to make sure they stay functional. This has been a big unconvinced for the folks in midtown. Hopefully this will be all over a little later today. But when you talk about infrastructure and the need for improvement, this really sums it up when you think about the impact to residents when it comes to driving and in terms of water pressure. And all the small businesses that were shut down this week around this area, because you can't really cook and clean the right way if you don't have that water pressure. Guys.",

They say that that is a lie.Here they were just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RAUL RUIZ, MD (D-CA): There is absolutely no evidence that the viruses studied under the NIAID grant funding to EcoHealth Alliance sparked the Covid-19 pandemic.

We can also expect that Dr. Fauci is going to defend his time at NIH. This is the first time that the committee is going to hear publicly from Dr. Fauci since he retired from NIH a few years ago. They did sit down with him for 14 hours behind closed doors back in January.
