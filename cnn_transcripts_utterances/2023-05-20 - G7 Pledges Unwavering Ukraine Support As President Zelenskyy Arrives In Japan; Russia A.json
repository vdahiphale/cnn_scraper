      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made a dramatic appearance in Japan where he's holding crucial meetings with world leaders at the G7 summit. Zelenskyy is pleading his case for continued support in the war with Russia. Ukraine depends heavily on support and weapons from the G7 leaders who released a statement saying this. \"We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes,\" end quote. President Biden is expected to have a face-to-face with Zelenskyy tomorrow, and in a significant win for Ukraine, the U.S. has signaled it will now allow allies to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine and support training its pilots. That's a major about-face for the Biden administration. Russia and Ukraine are not the only thing on the agenda at the summit. Western leaders are also tackling ways to confront China's increasing military power and how to approach the growing impact of artificial intelligence. CNN international correspondent Marc Stewart is in Hiroshima, Japan. So what has come out of today's meetings thus far?",

Some significant headlines to pass along.First of all, President Zelenskyy's arrival here in Hiroshima. Even though he's been on the ground for a very short time, he has already met with the heads of state from Italy, from India, as well as the United Kingdom. We'll be watching his calendar because more meetings are expected to take place in the hours ahead. And then the other big headline of the day, that position paper, as you mentioned, released by the G7. Diplomats use the fancy term \"communique\". Among the takeaways, commitment by the G7 to stand by Ukraine for the long haul. \"As long as it takes\" is one of the phrases that we've heard. That means expect G7 nations to continue to support Ukraine by providing financial aid, humanitarian assistance as well as military support. In addition, that note also mentioned China, urging China to tell Russia to remove its troops, to pressure Russia to remove its troops from Ukraine. In addition, it raised concerns about some of its economic practices saying in effect to China you need to play by the international rules, Fredricka.",

We know the Ukrainian forces are fighting intensely around that city. Officials are saying the city has not fallen to Russian hands. This is happening while Zelenskyy is away. But I've been talking to commanders here about the good news for them, they say that these F- 16s can get into the hands of their pilots. The pilots can get trained and they can bring them to bear on Russian forces near the frontlines. They say that will be a game change to give them some air superiority, allow them to target more deeply behind Russian lines, hit their supplies, hit their fuel lines, hit their ammunition lines and turn the tide of the battle. So they want that equipment, but of course, it's going to be a while before the F-16s actually arrive here and are battle ready in hands that are battle competent to take them to the enemy.",

And then eventually Germany moved forward in supplying Leopards and the United States we came through now with our M1-A1s there on the way to being delivered. So there is an unfurling flow.

You see the Roosevelt Hotel. Behind that white van, you'll see two city buses. And those buses have arrived here from Port Authority Bus Terminal. They were there to meet with another bus that was bringing in migrants from the southern border earlier today. We've seen about three or four buses arrive this morning with about 20 to 25 migrants in them. They are arriving here to the Roosevelt, which is meant to operate as a first stop, a sort of intake center where people can come in. Get food, water, medical care, have a place to go to the bathroom and to shower and to rest. And then the idea is that they will be connected to the resources that they need, whether it's housing, shelter, schooling for their children or any other sort of resources that they might be in need of. This behind me here is not supposed to be a permanent solution. That is a much bigger question here in New York City as the numbers continue to increase. The mayor has said that the city is in dire need of federal funding. Now, the much larger question here is what to do in terms of shelter.

And so the court said we don't have to reach the meaning of 230. We can say that the defendants here, Twitter, did not aid and abet the terrorist acts that the plaintiffs were suing over. So they really kind of punted on the scope of Section 230, which does allow all sorts of other cases to go forward that require an analysis of that statute.

It's interesting, these cases are not touching on right-wing extremism. They are ISIS-related cases about foreign terrorist organizations using U.S. platforms to try to not only recruit but raise money and then of course, organize.

And they do that through a variety of mechanisms of searches, word searches, bodily searches, age searches, and the algorithm -- all of those combined. So if you actually look at the history of social media companies and criminal -- and crime on it, there actually is a history. The question now is can they do that for a limited group of terrorist organizations who are planning and organizing violence on the platform? I well recognize this is going to hit First Amendment rights, what is terrorism, who is a terrorist in the U.S. versus abroad. Those are the slippery slopes we worried about.
