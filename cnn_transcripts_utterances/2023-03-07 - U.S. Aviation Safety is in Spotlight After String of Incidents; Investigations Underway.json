They were all required to have one. The cars and the makeup of the train was not long enough to take into effect some high regulation.

Because of the derailment, we know they happen, they happen a lot, thousand a year, we have to make the cars safer so they can withstand the derailment without explosion, fire, injury, loss of life, damage to property.

So, these mechanized inspection systems were thought to be better. Why there is not more oversight or really more concern when we have thousand derailments a year? Well, some people say it is lobbying by the industry. But I also think that it is just the lack of attention to rail transit in this country. If human beings were more on the trains -- for example, can you imagine if airlines had that kind of a crash rate? It would be incredible. (INAUDIBLE) as there should be.

PRIGOZHIN (through translation):  If Wagner Group retreats from Bakhmut now the whole front will collapse. Today, Wagner Group is the cement that holds it together. We're pulling in the whole Ukrainian army, grinding them up and destroying them, not letting them focus on other parts of the front lines. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And while Prigozhin was busy this weekend trolling Ukrainian women by sending them champagne from a defunct winery near Bakhmut, he also made clear Wagner is here to stay whether the Russian defense ministry likes it or not.
