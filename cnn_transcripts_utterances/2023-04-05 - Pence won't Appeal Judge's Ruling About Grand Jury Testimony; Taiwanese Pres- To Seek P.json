You can actually hear the call to prayer going on right now. But it's also known as Temple Mount to Jews and it's the holiest site in Judaism.Now there is a status quo that governs these holy sites. And the Israeli police entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is this building right here with a black roof behind me, that is considered a violation of the status quo and then not only them entering, but then them entering in the way they did, firing stun grenades and rubber bullets, well, that brought it to a whole other level. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (voice over): Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have denounced Israel for what happened. The Jordanian foreign minister saying the world must clearly condemned the attack. Shortly after the raid, rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, the militant group Hamas saying Israel's actions in Jerusalem wouldn't go unanswered. Israeli military said it had struck Hamas weapons sites in Gaza in response. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (on camera): And the U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs says that violence has no place in a holy site and during a holy season calling for restraint and de-escalation. Guys, there's a lot of concern this will spiral even further. In just the last few minutes, the IDF says two more rockets were actually attempted fire from Gaza into Israel. They didn't cross the border. But as we speak, we can say that it is calm at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound where Islamic authorities say 20,000 worshippers are praying at this very moment, guys.",

      "sentences": "Well, this announcement today comes from an spokesman for former Vice President Mike Pence and he is saying that Trump or - I'm sorry - that Pence will comply with a subpoena that he received from January 6th investigators based out of Washington calling him to the grand jury operating out of the federal court here.They are wanting to ask him about conversations he had with Donald Trump from the election on, the whole way, leading up to January 6, at that time that Donald Trump was putting pressure on Mike Pence to try and block the election, a crucial piece of what the Special Counsel's office is looking into as they're investigating January 6. Now, the way we got here is that there had been an unprecedented subpoena of the former vice president to testify about the President that he served under and initially there had been two core challenges over this Donald Trump had tried to challenge and Mike Pence had also tried to challenge in court this subpoena. We know that the judge ruled - essentially that they - that he needed to show up and testify that Donald Trump couldn't claim any secrecy around the presidency over their conversations and also that Mike Pence would not be able to not give testimony, he would need to go into that grand jury. Now, Pence did win a little bit here and he, in his statement today, is underlining how the principle prevailed that he had argued in court that the vice president can be covered by constitutional protections for members of Congress because he was acting as the presiding officer over the Senate on January 6th. But even so, at the end of the day, the announcement is that Pence is not going to appeal the judge's decision saying he must go testify. And thus he is agreeing to do that as required by law he says. Now, Trump could also try and appeal some things, but he keeps losing in court every time he has tried to block testimony in this criminal investigation. We don't exactly know when Pence is going to go into the grand jury, but the Special Counsel's office has been very aggressive in getting witnesses in and right now, Mike Pence is going to be a key witness.",

Obviously, that didn't happen when President Macron attempted that same diplomacy with Vladimir Putin in the months leading up to the war.I want to get to Phil Mattingly on that point, because Phil, we heard President Tsai earlier in the first leg of her trip mentioned in a speech in New York. Again, this trip they're calling a transit stop in the United States on their way to Central America say that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a wakeup call to the country. They increase their military budget. It's - at about $20 billion, still a fraction of what China's budget is. But where does the United States stand specifically, Phil, with regards to this meeting. I know the language out of the White House has been not to overreact for China, it was notable that there were no questions asked during this presser between the two, but how's the White House viewing this meeting?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think the most public messaging has certainly been directed towards Beijing, making very clear that this should not be viewed as out of the norm, this shouldn't be viewed as something that should drive any kind of escalation, and that they want to maintain open lines of communication, something that's also been communicated behind the scenes at the highest levels as well.But there's a reality here and that is one that this has happened before and there's always a balancing act between whatever the current U.S. administration is attempting to convey publicly as it relates to the bilateral relationship with China and the reality of where bipartisan lawmakers and a large swath of them at that stand on this issue and have stood on this issue. And I think the momentum behind Taiwan or behind assistance towards Taiwan, both on the economic and defense side of things for self defense purposes has only grown in recent years. And I think in large part, it's interesting what Will and what you guys are talking about in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there's not a person inside this administration you talk to that doesn't view what's happening in Ukraine through the lens of what that may mean for China and Taiwan, how that may shift or maybe drive any calculations in the future made by Xi Jinping and China. Military leaders are certainly discussing that and publicly - in public more so in private, administration officials are as well. And I think all of that kind of can - converges into this very unsettled moment, unsettled, just on a simple bilateral basis between the U.S. and China for any number of reasons that have escalated tension over the course of the last several years. But certainly on this issue, specifically when military leaders go to Capitol Hill, they say in public forums, that conflict is - seems to be coming to some degree that certainly they are planning for that. Certainly they are aware of that reality. And I think what's been most interesting when you talk to White House officials is publicly they made clear this shouldn't be viewed as escalatory. No administration officials are meeting with the Taiwanese president or anybody in her delegation while they're here. But they also acknowledge the reality of lawmakers get to do what they want to do in this issue. They certainly consult with administration officials and it's not just Speaker Kevin McCarthy, this is a bipartisan delegation that President Tsai is meeting with in California. She met with the House Democratic Leader, Hakeem Jeffries in New York, she met with bipartisan groups of senators as well. And so that balancing act of that dynamic at a very, very tenuous moment from a geopolitical perspective is something the administration has attempted to balance and certainly is aware of could lead to some type of escalation in the days ahead. Their biggest question right now is, A, what would that be and, B, they hope it's kind of contained to some degree and not reflective of what they saw in the wake of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit last year.",

It's important to note that the third body that was found in that car submerged in that body of water, we're told, a belong to Silvernail. The Sheriff's office just earlier this afternoon told us they gave us an update on this investigation. Again, they don't believe that there are any more victims out there. And a large part of why they decided to provide some of this information is because there have been some concern in Marion County that the sheriff's office there might be dealing with a serial killer. The town that we're talking about in Marion County is relatively small. It's only about a thousand to 1,500 people and it's about a 90- minute drive north of Orlando.
