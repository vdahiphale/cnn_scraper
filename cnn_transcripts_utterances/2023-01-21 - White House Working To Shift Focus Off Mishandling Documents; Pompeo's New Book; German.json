What the president wanted to talk about is his success on his agenda items, legislative success in the first two years, which really laid the groundwork for the year ahead. That is what they want to focus on. Also the political and legislative opportunities they see in that year ahead, even as House Republicans hold the majority for the first time since Biden has been in office. To some degree, this is a critical part of their strategy as it pertains to the investigation. Once again, not answering any questions about that investigation that is now underway; instead, focusing on the president's agenda, focusing on what they have accomplished and want to accomplish. It's already laid the groundwork for a State of the Union address that's less than a moth away. Obviously the investigation is critical to White House officials, at least the team that is working on it. They know it exists and that it poses risks but they also know they don't have any control over where the special counsel ends up taking things. But senior White House officials believe, when all is said and done, it will show that they did the right things in terms of those documents, found in two different locations. And they believe what people care most about, particularly the people who may be voting for the current president in 2024, is far more about the economy and policy issues they have pursued than any kind of investigation. It is a calculation; to some degree, a bet but one White House officials and the president as well believe that it is very much the case -- Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Instead he is pointing to his mercenary group as being successful, as being behind some of the gains we've seen in recent days and weeks. This momentum that has been regained by Russian forces. The United States says there are some 50,000 members of Wagner on the ground in Ukraine. But about 40,000 of them, according to U.S. officials, are convicts. So concerns about Wagner using the prison system within Russia as the manpower on the ground. Then, of course, finally, you mentioned this, the connections to other groups, other organizations in other countries, as the transnational part of this designation. It's important to remember Wagner does not just operate in Ukraine; it operates in the Middle East in places like Syria and across Africa, as well. So in addition to the U.S. making this announcement, it also declassified these images that I know you have, that show or the U.S. says it shows these images of Russian rail cars going to North Korea to pick up arms and weapons, that are then used by Wagner on the ground in Ukraine.

BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  All the pros and cons have to be weighed very carefully. We cannot all say today when a decision will be made nor will that decision on the Leopard tanks will be. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, concerned about a Russian spring offensive, told the meeting, allies need to speed up or more Ukrainians will die.",

And so our goal -- and I think we've been fairly successful at doing this and bringing together capability -- is to provide the capability that Ukraine needs to be successful in the near term.ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Ukraine says it needs 300 of the Leopard 2 tanks; about 2,000 are currently in use with its allies. But those allies need German permission to reexport them. Ministers of some of those nations met on the margins at Ramstein, one of them Poland. MARIUSZ BLASZCZAK, POLISH DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  I'm convinced that building this coalition will be successful, just as the issue of transferring Patriot systems to Ukraine was successful. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  But despite disagreement over tanks, the threat of a Russian spring offensive has triggered a surge in military hardware pledged to Ukraine recently. The U.S. alone committing 90 Stryker combat vehicles, 59 Bradley fighting vehicles and 350 up- armored Humvees Thursday. Sweden, Denmark, the U.K., Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Portugal, France and Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and others together sending multiple battalions worth of offensive capability. The talks Friday trying to sync it all up. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS:  For all these different nations that are here today, to assemble all of the equipment, get it all synchronized, get the Ukrainian troops trained, et cetera, that will be a very, very heavy lift.",

Officials say the virus is what they call a relatively low level and the number of COVID patients in hospitals is declining.

After three years of restrictions due to their government's war on COVID, Chinese can finally travel again, just in time for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. In pre-pandemic times, this was described as the world's largest annual human migration. \"I haven't been home in three years,\" says this man at the main Beijing train station.

WATSON (voice-over):  Last month, Beijing abruptly scrapped its strict zero COVID policy. The ensuing surge of sick people putting a strain on hospitals and health workers. Several social media videos showed nurses sick with COVID collapsing on the job. \"I felt unwell,\" says this nurse in Shandong. \"It had been a week that I had COVID-19 until that day when I finally collapsed.\" Over the weekend, health officials who once prided themselves on keeping COVID out of China, abruptly raised the COVID death toll since early December, from several dozen COVID deaths to nearly 60,000 people killed by COVID. But the official U-turn on COVID has had other unintended consequences. At a factory in Chongqing, workers pelted police with what appeared to be boxes of COVID tests. Some biotech companies withholding salaries or laying off workers after the government suddenly stopped demanding the population take millions of COVID tests a day.",

We just heard the reporter there, is the explanation as simple as that? Tech companies grew too quickly during the good times? MARGARET O'MARA, TECH HISTORIAN, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON:  Yes. I mean, it's been a time of really extraordinary growth, particularly the last years, three years of the pandemic, when everyone was moving to working at home. Or many people were moving to work at home and to learn at home and ordering things in from places like Amazon and other tech companies. And that stimulated incredible demand that caused the growth of these companies, for them to hire like crazy. And they kind of followed suit. As one company would hire a lot of people, so would others. And now the reverse is happening.",

O'MARA:  Yes. Well, this is different than the dotcom crash. Look, there's some similarities. Then in 2000-2001 you had rising interest rates, you had macroeconomic conditions that were affecting the flow of capital into the tech market, both startups and big companies. There was a lot of froth and hype around certain things. We could say a good parallel to the dotcom hype was crypto, which, even before the layoffs of recent months, was already entering its winter. But I think what's really different is the scale of tech. In 1999 and 2000, the industry was much smaller. It was important and growing and exciting but it was not the thing on which everything else ran. The companies were not as large. So the scale is quite different and the variety of things that these companies do and provide and the backbone that they provide for other companies is much greater.",

But as a sector it only makes up about, what, 2 percent of jobs in the American economy.But even though it's small relative to the rest of the American work force, obviously the big worry for the rest of us is a ripple effect. So is what we're seeing now the canary in the coal mine? Or could it actually eventually lead to broader downturn, do you think? O'MARA:  Yes. It -- it's hard to see. You know, I'm a history professor, so I don't like predicting the future. I know it can be a dangerous game. But you know, there is going to be a ripple effect. Look, if tech is a highly geographically concentrated industry, concentrated in my city in Seattle and the Bay Area but also other cities around the world. Significant tech sectors, they're going to feel that pain more sharply. It's not just the layoffs in companies, it's the retailers that depend on these tech workers to come and buy their lunch there or -- and significantly, commercial real estate, which already was getting upended by the pandemic and so much white-collar work going in. You know, tech companies were leasing a lot of square footage over the last three years. Now they're pulling back. So that's going to have a big effect.",
