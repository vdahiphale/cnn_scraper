I want to show you this over here just because, right now, we can see this group of people.I believe they were just pushed out of the -- they were pushed out from inside the encampment. Law enforcement now making this line here that you can see. And these are law enforcement officers from different agencies locally. CHP, I see some Beverly Hills Police. I see LAPD. So, they are all here and they've been making this line. They are holding this line now. And as I can see now, they are also starting to build up this barricade here. What we saw overnight was very different. I can tell you that we did here some chanting not too long ago within the last hour, but that chanting seems to have stopped now. It does seem that the energy has changed here, compared to what it looked like overnight when it as just devolving. And it just seemed like there was just different sides going at each other. And again, we are not clear on what caused everything to degrade in the way that it did overnight. I was out here all day yesterday and you saw some people yelling at each other, but it was nothing of anything to the scale that we've seen at other campuses. What happened from then to overnight, not clear, what led to the agitation that we saw overnight here, the breaking down of the barriers. And one thing I also want to explain to you is just how they've done it here. Where we are standing, if you are familiar with UCLA's campus, would be closer to the eastern side of the city. This side, it would be the pro-Israeli demonstrators. Once you go beyond that, there is a barricade and then there is a walkway that they have barricaded. You see security in there, and then another wall of barricade, and on that other side is where you would see that encampment of the pro-Palestinian supporters. So, they tried to keep people apart from both sides. And every now and then, you would see a flare up. You would see people yelling at each other over those barriers yesterday. But what we saw in the last few hours is a much more aggressive posture. But I can tell you now, on campus, police officers, law enforcement officers are all around here and it does seem that there is a forced move to keep people away from the center of this encampment and keep pushing people further, further out here.

There has been sort of consistent counter protester presence at our campus since the encampment began. Around 10:30 or so last night, all of a sudden, many more counter-protesters supporting Israel came to campus and shortly before 11, I don't know what triggered it, but they decided to storm the barricade. Security officials hired by the university did not -- they all retreated back into a hall (ph) on campus, which left counter protesters and protesters in direct conflict. I was not there for too long, as I was gassed and I had to leave. But I understand that my colleague saw people being hit in the head, people were being hit with pipes. There was a (inaudible) allegedly around. I believe scooters were thrown, electric scooters, a variety of things have occurred. I know that the barricades were -- the metal barricades surrounding the encampment, a lot of them were moved back and out, and various time points. And that counter protesters were attempting to push down the wooden boards that surround the encampment on to the protesters inside. So, what happened last night? Of course, it is still a bit hard for us to fully determine as, again, it has just been a few hours, but that's from my understanding.

      "sentences": "Well, that is the words that came out of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's mouth. But I think you have to view them through the kind of political lens through which they were delivered. And that is to say that Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under considerable pressure right now from his right-wing, ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, both members of the right wing of his governing coalition, are basically threatening to collapse the government if the war ends, if there is a ceasefire deal, a long-term ceasefire deal that does not involve going into Rafah with this major military offensive.And so publicly, the Israeli prime minister is very much trying to say that Rafah will happen, the war will not end before Hamas battalions in Rafah are eliminated. But the reality of these negotiations and what I am hearing behind the scenes from Israeli officials is that if indeed there is a hostage deal, a ceasefire proposal that obviously means that at a minimum, a military offensive in Rafah will be delayed and it could perhaps be inevitably delayed if this Egyptian framework actually becomes a reality. And that is because the framework on the table would not only call for several weeks of ceasefire to see the release of 20 to 33 hostages, but it would also bring about a longer- term, at least a one-year ceasefire as part of the current deal that is on the table. Now, as this proposal is being considered and debated in Israeli politics, it is also still being reviewed by Hamas' leadership and we haven't yet actually heard an official response from Hamas. But Secretary of State Tony Blinken, as he was in Israel today, meeting not only with Netanyahu, but also Israeli President Isaac Herzog and the families of some of these hostages, he has been saying the ball is in Hamas' court. He says that he believes it is a good deal, a good offer for Hamas and saying that if there is not a deal, if these negotiations this week breakdown and fail altogether, he is saying that it will be Hamas' fault. So as he is here, pushing the Israeli government to agree to this deal, to stand firm on its support for this latest framework, he is also ramping up the public pressure on Hamas, framing the potential failure of these negotiations as something that would fall squarely in Hamas' lap.",

Also, disgraced Movie Producer Harvey Weinstein is expected back in a New York courtroom after his sex crimes conviction was overturned. What a new trial might look like, just ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:21:00] WALKER: At the stroke of midnight, the State of Florida's new restrictions on abortion took effect under a law that will make it very difficult to get an abortion anywhere in the southern United States. Florida had allowed abortion up to 15 weeks of pregnancy prior to this law. And for that reason, it was a destination for many women from parts of the southern U.S. with more restrictive laws. But, the new Florida legislation now outlaws almost all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women even know that they are pregnant.

That is about one and 12 nationwide and one and three that happened in the south. We spoke with a woman here yesterday, who was getting a medication abortion. She was in the process of doing so, she was only comfortable having her first name shared, Candace, and not having her face on camera.

It is devastating.(END VIDEO CLIP) So, this law affects not just people living here, but the many people who over the previous years, especially since Roe v. Wade was overturned, have traveled across state lines into Florida from other states with stricter bans, approaching 8,000 last year. Now, the closest states with access beyond six weeks are North Carolina, which has a 12-week limit, but also a 72-hour waiting period, so that makes it difficult to travel to that state from other places, or Virginia for access after that.

Then there's a walkway, which -- there were some security in there. I was out here all day yesterday. And then on the other side, there's another barricade and then the encampment for the Palestine supporters.And what we saw and what you've seen in some of the video, it looks like people from one side are ripping apart the barricades and ripping at the plywood that was up in the encampments overnight. So we saw these clashes happening overnight, we saw that some of those security people in the middle were trying to pull the barricades and put them back into place. The police did not get here it looks like until after 1 o'clock in the morning local time. So, there were a lot of questions about that. We saw that Mayor Karen Bass put out a statement saying that what she was seeing on the campus was abhorrent. We saw the chancellor put out a statement saying that this had now become unlawful and that students were now being stopped from some parts of the campus to get to their classes, to move around as they needed to. I can tell you as I walked around on campus yesterday, the vast majority of campus was peaceful and chill. You wouldn't even know that this was going on. I saw people sitting on the grass reading books, studying. It looked very normal. This is the crux of the issue here. And I did see some police presence yesterday, but they seem to be staying in their cruisers, watching to see as people may have had little skirmishes, and then they were moving on. But what we saw when we got out here, when we got out here, this barricade that's right next to me, right here, wasn't even here. We watched as the police started to put this barricade in place. They had a wall of law enforcement officers that were from different organizations that were here blocking this line. And then they effectively pushed some people out along this side over here, pushed them out. They kind of stayed around for a bit. But now, now as were getting to -- the sun slowly coming up, everyone from out here has pretty much moved away. But by the time we got on campus overnight, Amara, it is definitely still a bit dicey here. We know now that listening to the Daily Bruin reporters, that's the school paper that is run by the students. They said some of their student journalists were out and were gassed and also assaulted while they were out here during the protests, according to those reporters there from the school newspaper.

It is a complicated factor where the college, the universities in general prefer not to have police on campus. They prefer to do those interventions themselves. But last night, they had to take back a building that had been seized by students in the early morning hours a day before, where they found refrigerators, vending machines, all pushed up against the doors to blockade the entrance to the building.Apparently, students had put some people inside overnight, who then let other students in. Two guards called and said they were being held hostage. The university says they were able to negotiate their release. And then the building was essentially under student control. Now, Columbia University had been negotiating with students for a week and they wanted to clear them off the west lawn where they intend to hold commencement exercises. But I think the red line here was the taking of the building, the destruction of the security cameras, the barricading, and destruction of other property where they called the NYPD. And what you saw was NYPD with hundreds of officers and every kind of specialized unit to deal with any kind of obstacles they encountered.",

So they got the legal warning which is, this is an illegal assembly. We've been asked to move you out by the college. Those who are going to stay will be arrested. Those who want to walk off can walk off now. So what you saw was, one group that was pushed off the campus through the gates.And then you saw those who remained, who were arrested peacefully and largely without resistance. When they made entry into the building, that's a whole other story. They used flash bangs or distraction devices because they didn't know what was waiting for them on the other side of that barricades. But at the end of the day, they found between 40 and 50 students, and possibly non-students inside the building the ground floor. They searched the other floors, which all were barricaded, all the doors were locked and chained with bicycle locks and other things, chairs propped up against them. But they didn't find additional people there. So, it really -- because of the massive number of officers that were brought there, and that's such a stark contrast to what we are seeing at UCLA. The whole operation was over in about two hours. You had about -- over 200, maybe 240, 250 arrests from Columbia, taken down through a mass arrest processing system where they go through an assembly line. And now, that's going to be in the hands of the district attorney.",

When the students took over the quad, they negotiated with them for a couple of days and then they called the NYPD and then cleared it. And then campus life was supposed to go back to normal and then another group came with more intents (ph) and took over the west lawn again. And they negotiated with them for a week and then on Sunday told them, look, you're all going to be suspended and you're going to be moved out of here. And that's when they took the building.So the question is, if you keep taking the same ground, it is almost a military analogy which is unfortunate in a college environment. If you keep taking the same ground and you don't then hold the ground, you're just going to be going through Groundhog Day, so to speak, with this being repeated. So, they've asked the NYPD to maintain a presence and they're really figuring out today, well, what will that presence look like? Is it going to be barriers with a few cops around it to keep that lawn available for the commencement exercise? Or is it going to be a small force, a large force, something in between, with a holding force standing by just off campus, but nearby? Those are the details they are literally putting together right now while were speaking.",

If you look next to me, you can see this group of NYPD officers who have been stationed here outside one of the main gates. Behind me, you get a sense of the restricted access to the campus that were seeing right now, students, faculty lined up trying to get in. We've seen several of them get turned away. There seems to be a lot of confusion about who is allowed on campus right now.We are standing outside Hamilton Hall. That's this building right here where we watched this dramatics seen play out last night where NYPD officers were making their way into this building from the second floor through that second floor window, Amara. It was a dramatic scene inside the building and on the campus, where there were a lot of officers. One of the issues though is it is a closed campus. Media was not allowed onto the campus last night as this was playing out. Even the student press, which had been allowed on campus, if you were watching our CNN coverage last night, you would have seen that those members of the student press were asked to leave by NYPD officers, as they were entering the campus, getting ready to clear the protesters. They did arrest more than 200 of them, many led out in plastic ties. It'll be interesting to see how many of those are students from Columbia or from other schools around the area. We heard Mayor Eric Adams just yesterday talk about professional outside agitators, concerns that more than half of the protesters, according to city officials, they believe were not Columbia students, not affiliated with the school. We are likely to find out more about that, who these people are in the next few days as they're arraigned in court and potentially charged after being arrested here. A lot of questions, Amara, but again, as we give you another look at the police presence here, there are expected to be officers, NYPD officers here at Columbia until May 17 after graduation. And students who I've spoken with here seem divided, even torn for some of them about what happened here last night. I spoke to a freshman just a few minutes ago, who was heading out he said to get his first bite of food in 12 hours because the campus was on lockdown as this was playing out. I asked him what students were talking about, what they were feeling on this campus as it was playing out. He said he was in his dorm and that the area the students around him were really divided on the issue. Some did not want police on the campus. They feared for the safety of those students and protesters who were here. Others wanted to see that cleared, wanted to see those protesters cleared out, many of them who had concerns about how Jewish students were feeling, fears of safety here in recent weeks. So again, it is a divided campus, a divided -- lot of divisive issue, Amara, and it is going to be interesting to see what happens in the hours ahead. If there are any protesters who return, any actions here on the campus, but as you can see, a lot of officers, a restricted campus at the moment and we are going to see how it plays out.",
