There are -- I'm going to write in small letters -- there are 35, 35 races that remain uncalled. Of these Republicans would need to win nine and Democrats would need to win 27 if they wanted to take control. And the question you're getting a lot from the press this morning is, is there a chance? Is there a chance that Democrats could do this? Well, look at the uncalled races. Democrats actually lead in 24 of them, Republicans lead in 11. So Republicans have what they need. But if you're a Democrat, you're saying we're close, it's close.Let's take a closer look at some of these races to see if in some of the races, and these are the uncalled races where Republicans are leading, if Democrats have a chance. In California, California counts slowly. A lot of mail vote there. And a lot of the races there are very close. You can see in California's 13th district, just 203 votes separate them, it's only 40 percent reporting. So this could go either way. You go a little south to the 22nd district. David Valadao is a Republican who voted for impeachment. He's an incumbent who has done well. This is a D plus 12 seat, but still only 30 percent reporting. Could there be room to grow there? You go all the way down here in California, it's sort of the same story. This one's a little bigger of a margin, Young Kim, 55 percent in there. And here you can see only 52 percent. And so Democrats maybe, maybe could make up some ground there. So it isn't over in the House, even though Republicans have a clearer shot, but there's still a lot of counting to do.",

What we don't know yet is Nevada and Arizona, and the situation in these two states has changed some overnight. Quickly, in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, the Republican, leads the incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto by 15,000 votes. But this margin changed overnight. When some people went to sleep, Adam Laxalt was ahead by 23,000. They counted some of the mail vote in Clark County and also in Washoe County up here, and that tightened. There's 110,000 mail ballots left to count. And if the margins that Catherine Cortez won those two ballot batches last night, if she maintains that marge, 60 percent, she could overtake Adam Laxalt in the next few days.

Mark Kelly leads by 95,000 votes. They have at least 560,000 votes left to count in that state. We got some new count overnight. His lead grew from the 80,000 region to about 95,000. That came from mail ballots they counted that were received before Tuesday in Maricopa County and Pima County. Again, Blake Masters has the runway to overtake this margin, but he has to do well.

But here's the issue. It's adjudication, OK. If for some we have ballots that were dropped off, that there is some reason, let's say maybe on one of those races the voter marked both candidates, let's say, in the Senate, and maybe they circled one of them and said, no, I mean this. That goes into adjudication. We have boards of one Republican, one Democrat, they look at those to try to determine what the voter's intent was.So that's a little thing that might impact which votes are being counted on what date.

Number two, in Washington, we have a bunch of things on our plate, including getting the defense bill done with Ukraine right before us and the strides that Vlad -- that Zelenskyy is making against Vladimir Putin on our plate is the end of the year budget bill to make sure we get that right as you know the Electoral Count Act, an effort that I'm leading with Susan Collins and Joe Manchin and others.

But what I'm hearing from New York democrats is that Kathy Hochul really invested her money in getting out to vote in the cities and didn't pay as much attention to the suburbs, basically ceding those to Zeldin and the republicans. And that's where all these winds are coming in. Things that are goingto cause a real hangover. That as well as an ineffective response to concerns about rising crime, something hammered that, something clearly felt acutely in the suburbs that democrats didn't seem to have a strong response for and helped create in part by bail reform laws in New York that Hochul tried to amend but didn't really address head on and that hurt Democrats big time.",
