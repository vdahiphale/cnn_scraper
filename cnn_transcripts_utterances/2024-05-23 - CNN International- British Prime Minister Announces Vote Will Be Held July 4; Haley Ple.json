The late president will be buried later today in his hometown of Mashhad. Raisi and eight others were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Rescue crews are searching for people trapped under debris after a stage collapse in heavy winds at a presidential campaign rally near Monterrey, Mexico late on Wednesday. At least nine people were killed. Dozens more are injured. The candidate, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is OK but is now suspending his campaign events. China has started two days of military drills around Taiwan. It comes just days after Taiwan swore in a new president. China says the drills are punishment for separatist acts. China considers Taiwan part of its territory. In response, Taiwan's defense ministry criticized the drills as irrational provocations. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed Kenya's president to the White House as part of William Ruto's historic state visit. It is the first time an American president has hosted an African leader for a state visit since 2008. The White House will roll out the red carpet tonight for a glitzy black-tie dinner celebrating 60 years of U.S. relations with Kenya. Mr. Biden praised the strength of that partnership on Wednesday. He and Mr. Ruto met with Kenyan and U.S. business leaders to discuss innovation and cooperation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Birzhan is, of course, in the South Khorasan province, which is really the homeland of Ebrahim Raisi. But if you look at here, you look at Mashhad, you look at the shrine of Imam Reza, that, I would say, is the spiritual homeland of Ebrahim Raisi. And, of course, where he has a lot of his political support as well. And, in fact, in 2021, right after Ebrahim Raisi became the president of Iran, one of the first campaigns -- one of the first stops he made after becoming president was right here. We were actually also here as well, as he gave his speech inside the Imam Reza Shrine. He has big ties here, family ties. His father-in-law is the prayer leader at the Imam Reza Shrine. So, definitely, what you see here is a lot of people who are supporters of Ebrahim Raisi, and, of course, who right now are in mourning after his death. There have already been some people saying prayers here. As you can see, a lot of folks are already coming down as we're waiting for that funeral procession to happen here through the town of Mashhad. The procession itself is about five kilometers long. But, as you can see around me, there's already a lot of people who have showed up here, a lot of people who are coming out who want to pay their final respects. As later on, after the casket arrives inside the Imam Reza Shrine, there will again be funeral prayers, and then he will be laid to rest inside that shrine, which, of course, is so important here for the Islamic Republic of Iran -- Max.

But at the same time, the Supreme Leader has also said that the country will move on politically very quickly. Of course, they have already set a date for the next presidential election. That's set to be on June 28th. And, of course, right now, what you're going to be seeing after all the mourning is done, after those who died in the crash will be laid to rest, is that there will be a process set in motion to designate the candidates that are going to be allowed to run in that presidential election. And it's going to be very interesting to see which candidates are allowed to run, which candidates are not allowed to run, whether or not you're going to see the country move in a more conservative or in a more moderate direction. So right now, of course, very important political times here also in this country. But, of course, this week will be the week of mourning.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): You dogs we'll step on you. BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Horrific new video released of Israeli female soldiers captured at their base at Nahal Oz along the Gaza border on the morning of October 7th, revealing the violent nature of their abduction and the brutality that they experienced at the hands of Hamas. The video obtained by CNN was previously released by Hamas, then edited by IDF, and later released to the families of the hostages. In it, you can see several female IDF soldiers, all border observers, their faces bloodied and bruised, their hands bound as they're forced against the wall. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): Our brothers died because of you -- we will shoot you all.

Five of the seven women seen in the video are currently still believed to be held captive by Hamas 229 days after being taken.

She met with -- when she was on a delegation to California, she met with different youth from Israel, Palestine, Jewish Americans. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): This previously released video of Naama being pulled out of a Jeep, her pants bloodied, raised concern about Hamas using sexual violence as a weapon of war. A United Nations representative issued a report following a visit to Israel and the West Bank earlier this year. PRAMILA PATTEN, U.N. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL: We also have reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may still be ongoing against those still held in captivity. GOLODRYGA (voice-over): The families of these soldiers agree to release this video now out of frustration over what they view as inaction from officials, including Israeli officials, to prioritize a hostage deal.
