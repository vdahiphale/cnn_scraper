Now, Pence, could be a really key witness for investigators as they continue to look into the former president's actions in and around the insurrection and his attempts to undermine the results of the election. Now, in his memoir, Pence describes Trump's tweet attacking him that day as, quote, \"reckless.\" And he goes into great detail and great criticism of the former president and his handling of January 6th. And it was expected, once he said all of these things publicly, we expected that federal prosecutors were going to have some follow-up questions for him. Now, it's notable that this outreach did come before the new special counsel, Jack Smith, was appointed to overtake the Trump investigations.

Now, one thing that could potentially get in the way is that the former president tries to invoke privilege. He has done that with several other witnesses. He's been largely unsuccessful, but it is something that could delay this process.

This is what Musk is referencing in his tweets. The DOJ did not find grounds to charge the officer. But in a separate report, released the same day, it did find evidence of systematic racial discrimination in Ferguson at the hands of city's -- the city's police department and municipal court. Now, the DOJ in a scathing report, pointed to the statistics for proof. Black people in Ferguson are twice as likely to be searched in vehicle stops than whites, though whites were found to have contraband at a higher rate than black people. At least 85 percent of those pulled over, ticketed, or arrested for traffic violations were black. And the Justice Department said it was money, not public safety, that the department and the city focused on. And black citizens paid the highest price. So remember, \"hands up don't shoot\" after Ferguson became a nationwide protest symbol for police mistreatment of minorities. It was about more than the shooting of Michael Brown. It was about the pattern of police shootings and brutality in this country.
