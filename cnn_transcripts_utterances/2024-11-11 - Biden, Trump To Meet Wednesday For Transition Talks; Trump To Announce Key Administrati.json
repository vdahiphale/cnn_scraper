The get together has long been a post election tradition in Washington, part of the peaceful transfer of power, one, of course, that Trump cast aside when he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, but never conceded that defeat, and still hasn't, four years later. Now working from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, President-elect Trump is seeing a stream of visits from people who either want spots in his new administration or want to bend his ear about who they believe should get roles. A source tells CNN Trump has offered New York Congresswoman and campaign surrogate and ally Elise Stefanik the job as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump announced on Truth Social a short time ago that he will bring back Tom Holman who served as acting director of ICE in the first administration. Holman would be joining the administration in charge of, quote, our nation's borders and, the president-elect says, oversee all deportation of illegal aliens back to their country of origin. Elon Musk is one person who does not seem to have any desire for a formal role in the new administration but is nonetheless playing a key part in the transition. Alayna Treene has more.",

But the one person who has really been looming over all of it has been Elon Musk.Now, of course, Elon Musk was on stage with Donald Trump, his top campaign advisers, and his team, on Tuesday night, when he declared victory during the election but he's also been at Mar-a-Lago and around Donald Trump in the days since. I'm told many days this week he dined with Donald Trump. Just the day after the election, he brought his children to Trump's Florida home where Donald Trump gave them a tour of his resort. But he's also been sitting in many times when he's been with Donald Trump on some of the calls from foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, I'm also told that Elon Musk has been weighing in on some of Donald Trump's potential picks, making it clear to the president-elect who he believes should have that role. And he's also been calling up allies of Donald Trump himself, including lawmakers, and starting to exert his influence in that way as well. Now, one thing that we saw happen on Sunday is that he came out and waded into the Senate Republican leadership fight. He quickly endorsed Florida Senator Rick Scott after Scott had supported an idea from Donald Trump to allow for recess appointments, essentially trying to make sure that he can swiftly confirm some of his nominees and, in many times, bypass the Senate confirmation process. Three of the men are vying for that spot. But Elon Musk said that he supports Rick Scott. And all to say, Musk has been very influential. He is very close with Donald Trump specifically. So, in these final weeks before Election Day, where he has been out there campaigning for the former president, and now he is spending a lot of time with Donald Trump and making it clear that he's going to be a top person who Donald Trump relies on as we look ahead. Now, sources familiar with the conversations say that Musk is not expected to take on some formal role in Donald Trump's second administration. Donald Trump has mused before that he would love for him to be a cabinet secretary. However, Musk and others believe that he could have just as much power on the outside.

So, I think it's very, very troubling the kind of influence that this billionaire outsider who actually also, let's be clear, owns one of the, you know, key social media news influencing with X that we have in our society.

So, tell me, do you think in the Republican Party, given that Republicans will control the Senate as well, likely the House, are there Republicans who you believe maintain an interest in guardrails and a willingness to back them up? You know Republicans who've attempted to stand up to Trump have been, well, they've been voted off the island, as it were, but do you believe that there are Republicans in the Senate, the House who are willing to rescue some guardrails? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Well, clearly Donald Trump goes in with a serious mandate different than the first term. He won the popular vote. He surprised everybody with the strength of his showing with the Electoral College. Clearly, that resonates with Republican House and Senate members. And so they're very attuned to that in their states and districts as the level of support of Donald Trump. So, he's going to have deference. He's going to have a lot of swag as he goes into his agenda and is broadly supported, whether it's border security, whether it is reforming the Justice Department or whether it is in the international arena. So, he has broad support going in there. He's going to have a season of grace, but it's going to be tested. It's going to be tested. And we'll see whether the Republicans will stand up and whether it's a recess appointments that they push back on or whether it's some other way that the administration tries to bypass Congress, it will be tested and it's unknown as to the outcome of that right now.",

In Lebanon, there seems to be the potential for diplomatic deal underway that the Israelis are fully in support of. And when it comes to Iran, President Trump has pursued in his first term what was called maximum pressure, but maximum pressure wasn't really aimed at anything other than bringing the Iranians to the table so that the president could negotiate a better deal than the one that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had negotiated with the Iranians over Iran's nuclear program. The idea that the president-elect was when he was first in office somehow stronger than any of his predecessors when it came to any of these issues is really just has to go back to his bellicose rhetoric, but it doesn't have really anything to do with his policies.",

Its forces shot down all 34 drones. It blames shrapnel for the damage you see there. Earlier, I spoke with Kurt Volker. He's former U.S. ambassador to NATO, as well as a former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. We spoke about where Donald Trump stands on Ukraine, especially given his attacks on the Ukrainian president and blaming Ukraine and NATO for Russia's invasion in 2022. I asked Volker whether Donald Trump believes it or if it's just campaign talk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: What you said about the views of some people on the far right is exactly right. They have said those things, they believe those things, they think Zelenskyy is corrupt or not a serious leader, taking American money, blah, blah, blah. Trump has never said those things. And so we need to appreciate the fact that he is maintaining a distance between all of those points of view. He has also not criticized Vladimir Putin. He's not said that this is a Russian aggression that needs to stop. But my view is that the reason why he is not criticizing Putin is because he knows he ultimately has to reach a deal with Putin. And so he's not demonizing him, but that doesn't mean that he misunderstands the situation on the ground. I think we have to see how this plays out. And I would just remind viewers that it was actually President Trump who reversed the Obama administration's arms embargo on Ukraine. For years, we had a ban on lethal assistance to Ukraine, which Trump reversed and not because he was all of a sudden, you know, challenging Vladimir Putin, quite the opposite. He was even having this conference in Helsinki in 2018, but it was very warm towards Vladimir Putin, but he was setting the stage for future negotiations.",

So, it's been an uneven record at best as regards Ukraine.And we should note, you know, it's not just folks floating out in the right wing, you know, Twittersphere, who have made such claims. J.D. Vance, I mean, he, in the last days of the campaign, you know, said something along the lines of who are the good guys and bad guys in a war that, as you well know, was started when Russia invaded. So, I just wonder when you put that together and you also add into it the president-elect's frequent criticism of NATO and his public statements along the lines of, well, if you don't pay enough money, then Russia do whatever the hell you want to the east, I mean, it raises at a minimum reasonable questions about his commitment to Ukraine.

And then casting the biggest call of all is the election in the United States. Donald Trump reelected as the most notorious climate denier in recent global history threatening to claw back and undo as much of the Biden climate agenda as he possibly can. Some of it has momentum, especially in red Republican states. Ground is broken on big projects. And it'll be tough to claw those back, but we'll see if he tries to end new rules on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules, incentives for families to electrify with cleaner stoves or furnaces. All of those are questionable, especially with the House of Representatives up for grabs. So, that reality is will cast a pall on all the climate diplomacy in Baku this week. President Biden was never really planning to attend this. There are diplomats from the U.S., but what kind of promises can they make with so much uncertainty for what comes next? And at the same time, all of this is playing out. Copernicus, the European space and weather agency, basically says is the data shows 2024 will be the first to shatter that 1.5 degrees Celsius ceiling that everyone agreed to back in 2016 in the Paris Accords. This was the first full year above that that limit. That's almost about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than we were before the industrial revolution right now. The warmer it gets, the more fossil fuel pollution blankets the sky, the wilder and crazier the weather is going to get. The more this wildfire phenomenon takes off in confounding ways. Out in Los Angeles the winds were so strong they had to ground firefighting airplanes and had to worry more about evacuations than actually putting out house fires. Adaptation is everything these days and it seems to be happening, the calamity faster than that people can adapt while the politics around this issue are going in the opposite direction.

And it's very rare for an incumbent to be able to come back after a big inflation hike during their tenure. And if you think about the Biden-Harris administration as one, that's the case.Now, how did Trump's policies look going forward? Yes, they are inflationary. What's interesting is that it's possible that you could see now this good economy that we have start to overheat because of some of the things that Trump wants to put into place. Let's assume he were to put his tariff proposals into place. That's immediately inflationary. It hits consumers right in their pocketbook. It makes goods more expensive. Unlike the Biden administration, the Trump administration doesn't really have an industrial strategy to bolster American exports, which would be the whole point of having a tariff to try and make American goods more competitive. But there really isn't that kind of growth plan. On the other hand, there is a plan to, to use debt and deficit spending to bolster kind of what I would call a saccharin sort of a growth, a bit of a sugar high. The markets like that, they like the idea of tax cuts, but, again, that just kind of creates a stock bubble. It creates an asset bubble. And to be honest, that's one of the things I think that really is in play with working people in this country being so angry. If you make your money from the stock market, you're doing great. If you make it from a paycheck, you're not. And so this terrible irony for me is that swing state voters that thought Trump was going to make inflation better, their lot may really end up being worse in the next year or two. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Will President elect Trump's promise of steep across the board tariffs on imports to the U.S., with a significant tax on goods coming from China, is already changing the way some companies are doing business there? Could Trump's past relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping influence this decision? Is there room for negotiation?CNN's Marc Stewart joins us now live from Beijing. Marc, I'm curious from the view where you are in Beijing, how does the Chinese government, how do the Chinese people view the relationship between Trump and Xi?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Jim, good to see you. Look, as you know from spending time in China yourself, the relationship between the U.S. and Beijing is always a fragile one, and this moment is no exception. Beijing really is trying to play it safe, and it's very evident in the diplomatic speak that we are getting from the government. Just for an example, President Xi Jinping did congratulate President-elect Trump.And looking at the readout from the government about what was said, I mean, among the phrases that are used, win-win cooperation, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, getting along will benefit both countries and the world. So, that's the official stance that Beijing is taking as it enters this very murky tide. But the relationship between these two world leaders is one that is complicated. I'm thinking back to early on in the first Trump administration when Xi Jinping and President Trump were having chocolate cake together at Mar-a-Lago. It signaled a very strong point or a strong potential for relations between the two nations. But then things turned frosty. I mean, among the issues that made things cloudy was China's response to COVID. That certainly irked President Trump. And then this thorny issue of trade and tariffs, which are somehow -- well, not somehow. They are once again making its way to center stage. Not necessarily a surprise. So, will things begin where they left off? I mean, that's what Beijing would certainly like at least on those high memories from early on in the Trump administration, Jim.",
