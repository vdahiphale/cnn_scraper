Meanwhile, at noon today, the House is set to hold a third vote to elect a speaker after Republican Jim Jordan again failed to win the gavel Wednesday. The hard-right Ohio congressman actually lost ground in the second vote with a number of Republicans voting against him, climbing from 20 to 22. At this hour, Jordan has been vowing to stay in the race, but his critics in the House are running out of patience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY):  This, right now, is an embarrassment and this is not what we should be dealing with. We were sent here to work and we should be working. REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI):  Do you think in a big tent party, like the Republican Party, it's healthy to have disagreements? But there's a point at which, like, the disagreement becomes dysfunction and paralysis and we're going to reach that point if we continue this much longer. REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL):  And to those who started all of this -- the eight who started all of this -- what was your plan? Clearly, you didn't have one. Now we're in total chaos. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because there is increasing frustration with the fact that they cannot do anything. They want to get an aid package to Israel out the door. Most people -- there's opposition among hardline Republicans but most members want to get aid to Ukraine out the door as well. They want to keep the government open. That might involve empowering the speaker -- the temporary speaker, Patrick McHenry.

So those are discussions that are underway.Some of Jim Jordan's supporters -- they don't want to see this. They think it's a distraction. Another big question is whether Patrick McHenry will even want to do this. He has been reluctant to even want to be speaker. And a lot of folks are wondering what exactly he's going to do on this. But this is a really credible question and moving forward, as you mentioned, so many things are happening. They need to happen. November 17 is a critical spending deadline.

And so, it's pretty clear what Biden can do to highlight or at least burnish his approval numbers on foreign policy.At the same time, though, Kasie, I want to stress that I am usually pretty skeptical about how often a foreign policy event or conflict can play in any sort of domestic policy election in the United States.

That seems to have been the trigger for the increase on Wednesday. Hezbollah said that it attacked six Israeli border posts along that northern border. It claimed also to have attacked an Israeli tank. We're hearing about more cross-border attacks going into this morning. And, of course, this is -- you know, this doesn't seem to be yet an attempt by Hezbollah to get involved in the conflict. They have not signaled that they're going in essentially to bat for Hamas but, of course, they do politically support Hamas. They are also backed by Iran. This may just be a signal of their capabilities, which are significant. And it is dangerous. The chief of the general staff of the Israeli Defense Forces as in the region this week and made it very, very clear that Israel would respond forcefully if provoked by Hezbollah.
