      "sentences": "All right, good evening, everyone. I'm John Berman. The breaking news national concern tonight over a 24-year-old man, a human being who was playing at a football game. I'm talking about Bills' safety Damar Hamlin, and at this moment what we know or what we're being told is he's in critical condition. He collapsed after he tackles someone.Again, it was a hard hit that he placed on a wide receiver during the first quarter of tonight's game between the Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals. Hamlin fell on his back just moments after getting up from this open field tackle. The Bengals wide receiver was Tee Higgins. Buffalo Bills team trainers got to Hamlin within 10 seconds after he collapsed, he stood up, appeared to take a step and then collapsed. An ambulance was brought onto the field and he was administered CPR. That was what everyone saw in the stadium. That is what everyone saw who was watching the game on T.V. Beyond that it's been piecing together what we've been reading on social media and hearing from official statements. We know that Damar Hamlin was taken to the University of Cincinnati Hospital. We again are told he is in critical condition. We've also been told by the hospital they will not be having a news conference tonight. So, we're waiting and hoping for more information on his wellbeing. You can see the pictures there from before the football field. This game was suspended, postponed. They waited around for an hour, the players did for word but it seemed pretty clear that none of the players on either team felt well enough to get back on the field and play football again, not with their teammate, not with the opposing player, not with their really brother in arms Damar Hamlin without any information about how he was doing. So, the game has been postponed that is according to the NFL. We have no word on how or if or when the game will be made up. And frankly, at this point, that doesn't matter to just about anyone, everyone concerned more about Damar Hamlin, a second year player for the Buffalo Bills safety, went to the University of Pittsburgh, was a sixth round draft pick. Started the last 14 games after an injury. Really the chance of his life to play now in critical condition. Let's find out what we can. I want to bring in Joe Danneman he is a reporter with WXIX in Cincinnati and you've been really watching every step of this, Joe. Why don't you tell us what you can?",

They're only people, people with feelings, people with hearts, people reaching out to each other.So, whether you play for the Bengals or the Bills tonight, the concern is with this player for the Bills and we've heard tales of Stefon Diggs, the star wide receiver from the Bills going to the hospital to try to get word on his teammates. I know the Bengals players are just as concerned. I'm interested as to what you said though, as of now, you're hearing that the Bills do plan to return home to Buffalo tomorrow.",

That would be their normal flight pattern to leave after a game after they shower up, clean up and get back. You have to wonder why the team would stay here in Cincinnati because there's not much the team can do.Now, obviously, some of the front office members, some of the important people in the organization will be here to support the family and to be with them going forward. But for the rest of the team, the only thing you could think to do right now would be go home and be with your loved ones at this point because I can tell you, John, on the field after this happened, usually you see players gather around a player and that happened tonight. But when they saw them start doing chest compressions and they saw the medical staff start to use the AED to try to shock Damar Hamlin back, you saw the reaction of those players walking away and being distraught, being very emotional, the kind of thing we don't see on a football field. I am told that when he left the field here at the stadium, he had a pulse, was not breathing on his own at that time. But the reaction from the players on the field a lot of times we see in the NFL, and we all understand it's a violent sport, head injuries, that happens, spinal injuries, that happens. We see some kind of positivity from the player as they walk off the field. A lot of times it's a thumbs up. We didn't see anything like that tonight, we saw -- we saw players crying. We saw players on the knee in prayer. We saw players just being around each other. And you mentioned it before you came to me that there was no way that we're going to play this game tonight, not after what these players had witnessed. That's why the NFL postponed the game -- tonight's game.",

And I'm told there won't be any media availability here tonight.Now, at the hospital, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, it was said previously earlier in the 11:00 hour that they were going to update us on tomorrow's status, they had listed him as critical condition. And that they were going to make that announcement at 11:30 with any kind of announcement or status update, and they canceled that, they're not doing that. So, at this point, we're just kind of in a holding pattern trying to get more information. And we're just trying to observe and watch what's happening here at the stadium with the Bills still being here. And we see Bengals players, I have eyesight right now to the Bengals locker room, and you can see players leaving the stadium because there's no reason to stay here anymore. Just go home and be with loved ones at this point. So, right now, it's more of just a wait and see holding pattern here at the stadium and just observing what's happening because no one John has ever been in a situation like this before, especially on an NFL football field.",

It doesn't appear that this is the case tonight, Joe, it appears -- and again, we don't know but it appears because defibrillators were used and CPR was administered.

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting. You mentioned the head injuries because in a primetime game here in Cincinnati earlier this season was when Tua Tagovailoa had his incident. That was a big national talking point. So, that happened here in Cincinnati just a couple of months ago.And now you fast forward to this moment that happening right here and right now here in Cincinnati, it's kind of ironic that it both happened inside the same stadium. But you mentioned that the head injuries again, those are things that we see on a football field, it's a violent sport, the guys know what they sign up for. We see sometimes broken bones, knee injuries, spinal injuries, those are serious things, they happen. We don't see things like this happen. I can tell you, John, I've never seen medical staffs react with the kind of urgency that I saw tonight when they ran out of the field. I don't know if you showed the video of when Damar stood up and then collapse back to the ground, you can see the players immediately motioning to both of their benches to get as many medical staff members out to the field as soon as possible. And they rushed out there. And they were opening up the equipment with the kind of urgency I've never seen before for somebody on a football field. And within 30 seconds, the stretcher was on the way out and also a back support in case that was the issue. And then within a couple minutes, the ambulance was out there. So, all of that is very unique, things we haven't seen before. And I think it does lead to this being a very unique and different kind of injury that we haven't seen before. At least I've never seen on a football field, especially in the NFL.",

And also to show people this wasn't some cheap shot.Again, Damar Hamlin was the person doing the tackle, and appeared to hit the wide receiver Tee Higgins, you know, somewhat awkwardly so that Higgins, the helmet and the shoulder of the offensive player seem to go into Damar Hamlin's chest, that's what it looked like from watching the replay several times, people might imagine that hit him somewhere in the area around the heart. Maybe that contributed to it. You said you've never seen the medical staff get on to the field with the urgency that they did, a training staff, these people are qualified and trained at many different levels. Normally, they're looking at knees or shoulders or arms. You know, this is a different type of situation. Did they appear to have the equipment and have the situation to have a sense of what was going on the minute they ran out?",

      "sentences": "All right, the breaking news tonight is Damar Hamlin, a 24- year-old safety second year player for the Buffalo Bills is in critical condition tonight in the hospital in Cincinnati after collapsing on the field in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Cincinnati in critical condition.We're waiting for an update on his specific condition. As we sit here right now, the NFL is holding a conference call, its press office on the phone holding a conference call with reporters. Our Coy Wire is listening to that. As soon as that is done, he will report back to us what he has heard on the condition, on the procedures, on anything that has happened tonight the NFL briefing right now. So, standby for much more on that. There has been reaction from around the sports world, well, around the world in general. We put up a full screen a moment ago of some of the tweets and various messages of concern for the -- for Damar Hamlin, again, you can see just a sense of it right there as we are waiting for more information on his condition. I want to bring in CNN Contributor Bob Costas right now on the phone. Bob, none of us have ever seen anything like this as many football games as we've all watched. We were talking to Joe Danneman and a local reporter there who said the minute it happened, you could tell that this was different, that something was truly wrong. Your reaction tonight? BOB COSTAS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Yes, you could exactly what it was, absent medical expertise. And doctors Griner (PH) and Gupta have briefed us with regard to that. But you could tell it was different than the usual circumstance, happens too often in terms of concussions, where people wobble to their feet or they have to be taken off and we know all about that crisis. And it is a crisis within the NFL, they have made it somewhat safer, they have taken steps. The very nature of the game is that a certain percentage, and it's somewhat sizable of those who play will eventually suffer some sort of cognitive or neurological difficulty, because of having played football with the repetitive hits, some of which results in concussions. But even as we now know, the sub concussive hits which are not diagnosed as concussions cumulatively cause great damage. But throughout the conversation tonight, I think there's been a generalization made. And as you know, John, I'm the last person that act as an apologist for football, but a generalization made that sort of goes like this, at least that's what I've heard as I've been on CNN for the last few hours. This shows you just how dangerous football is. I think this particular circumstance, John does not fall into that category. Any contact sport, of course, brings with it the possibility of injury or some sort of tragic event. But as Dr. Gupta said in the last hour, it could also be a line drive back to the mound that hits a pitcher, a hard line drive that hits a pitcher at just the wrong millisecond. And just the wrong spot, close to the heart, and you get some sort of arrhythmia, and this was what could happen. But to say that this is unique to football, or that this sort of thing is typical within football just isn't factual is a tragic. Is it concerning? Yes. Did they make the right decision by not going back out to play? Yes. But does this fall into the category of another piece of evidence about how dangerous and uniquely dangerous football is among team sports? I don't think so.",

      "sentences": "OK, Bob, standby. Stick with us, if you will. So let's bring in Dr. Leana Wen to talk more about what may have happened.And Doctor went on here, Bob Costas is listening in all, so all we know is what we saw at this point, which is we saw the hit, we saw Damar Hamlin as he was tackling Tee Higgins the wide receiver. We don't need to see it much more than this at this point. I think we've seen it plenty. But we saw him get hit in the chest with a helmet and the shoulder pad. And we also know that it appears there was a defibrillator and CPR used after he was down on the field. What does that tell us? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Whenever someone suddenly collapses, the first thing that you think about is could this be a cardiac event, something to do with the heart. The fact that there was this direct impact right before this occurred, makes it most likely. Again, we don't know for certain, we have not heard from the medical team yet. But it certainly makes it most likely that there is a very rare but very serious condition called Commotio Cordis, which is when there is direct trauma to the chest that unfortunately happens at a specific part of the cardiac cycle, and ends up disrupting the normal heart rhythm. And as a result, the heart instead of beating normally ends up going into this irregular heart rhythm where the heart is unable to pump blood. Now, the time to resuscitation is the most critical in determining the outcome. And so, the quicker that CPR can be started, the quicker that a defibrillator is made available, the better the outcome. And in this case, it sounds like that type of immediate medical care was given very, very quickly within a matter of seconds. And so, at this point, we are praying and hoping for the best. I will say that the fact that the medical care was delivered so quickly gives me hope. And I think we'll find out a lot more. Now, Bob had also mentioned, I think this was such an important point that this is not something that is unique to football at all. And in fact, the other types of Commotio Cordis injuries reported often involve a ball or a puck that this happens in baseball, lacrosse and hockey and cricket and other games that involve direct impact by a ball to the chest. And so, this is not unique to football and actually, in terms of who normally gets this, it tends to affect adolescence. Boys between the ages of 14 and 15 are the most affected by this condition. If this is in fact what happened to Mr. Hamlin.",

      "sentences": "Look, this is why again, I'll go back to Little League, this is why often they don't want young players using metal bats because they come the ball, comes off the bat that much more quickly.That's why again, if you've known any 10 or 11, 12-year-old boy who has been forced to wear a chest protector, some leagues require it when they pitch they hate it but this is why. Doctor Wen, just talk to us for a second more about you mentioned the defibrillator, the CPR, the treatment and you know, God willing, the recovery from something like this.",

      "sentences": "Right, so, if this is what we are speculating, this Commotio Cordis, this disturbance at the heart rhythm following blunt trauma. And then what normally happens is you want to restore the regular heart rhythm as quickly as possible. And that's the root of the defibrillator.In the meantime, CPR is really essential because you want to keep blood pumping to all your other organs. Or else there could be injury to those organs including to the brain. And so again, this case it looks like CPR was delivered very quickly. What happens after that is the individual would be transported to the hospital where further tests are going to be done to find out exactly what precipitated the incident. Also, what is the extent of the injuries that may have occurred while CPR was happening. CPR is something that is very traumatic, sometimes ribs are being broken in this process. And so, you also want to see what else -- what other injuries may have been accompanied by the level of resuscitation. And then of course, you also want to assess any damage that could have been to other organs along the way. And so there would be a, I would imagine a fairly long process of recovery that's ahead.",

Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin at this moment is hospitalized in critical condition.He collapsed on the field following a collision in the first quarter of tonight's game between the Buffalo Bills and the Cincinnati Bengals. Hamlin, who actually was the defensive player, the safety, was tackling wide receiver Tee Higgins, who's a pretty big wide receiver. So Hamlin fell down but then popped up immediately after, and then collapsed. Taken to the University of Cincinnati Hospital in critical condition at this point. Luckily, the team trainers got to Hamlin within ten seconds after he collapsed. Taken off the field in an ambulance. The game was postponed fully about an hour after the incident took place. And we are now told that the Buffalo Bills will be returning to Buffalo now today, in what is Tuesday. We'll get more on that a little bit later.
