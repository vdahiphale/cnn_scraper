This is a longtime figure in the Republican Party that is refusing to endorse the Republican standard there for the nomination, especially at a time when it seems like almost everyone else in the Republican Party was coalescing behind Donald Trump, including someone like Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who hasn't even talked entitled Trump since January 6, 2021. But I do think that, you know, like, Mike Pence isn't necessarily someone in the Republican party who's going to pull a lot of votes right now. I mean, he did you could said, as you as you would, Kristen pointed out, he did drop out long before the votes started. People voters started to actually vote in the Republican primary contest, but he does give a voice to the stubborn percentage of Republican voters. That is a huge problem for Donald Trump right now.These are the Republican voters who do not who will not who do not want to support Trump under any circumstances. We've seen from post elections, data in the early nominating contests that there is this, you know, persistent percentage of voters who do not want to support Trump at all Republican voters.

But one out of four South Carolina voters, as well, and Donald Trump really hasn't made overtures yet, to those types of voters saying you are welcome in my coalition, you are welcome in the Republican Party.Just a few weeks ago, he said we don't want sort of the quote unquote, \"Romneys of the world\" when it comes to the Republican Party. And that's going to be a big question where are those voters actually go? You know, are they really -- would they vote for a third-party candidate? Would they leave the presidential ballot blank? Would they vote for Joe Biden? Joe Biden's campaign is really trying to court those moderate Republicans, sort of the anti-Trump Republican voters. Where do they go? That's a really great question.

And the court was pretty clear, the judge is pretty clear. Like, I feel like this kind of has the stench of untruthfulness going on. And that's not how you want to begin your case, if you're a prosecutor, or a lawyer, for that matter in front of any judge.I mean, I tell young lawyers, when I speak to them, you know, if you don't tell the truth to the courtroom, go spend the rest of your career trying to make up your reputation. And so that's always an issue, you know, But here, when it comes to the jury pool as long as she will quit making sort of extra-judicial statements like we saw with the church, I think that will help and maybe we won't get into this gag order issue. But if that kind of thing continues that it keeps this fire burning. And so I think what she ought to do is probably put her head down, pay attention to the case, think only about the case, stop making extrajudicial comments, and get ready to try the case.

You remember, just earlier this week, it seems like a month ago, but just earlier this week, the judge dismissed six counts of the indictment. And he said in a footnote, if you -- if the state wants to appeal my decision, I would likely entertain that and so I'd like to do that I'm taking up. All those things add into a delay so the states can decide, are we satisfied with the case going forward and we want to not have an appeal and just get the case moving in the defense is probably looking at like we're going to take every opportunity, file every motion to try to drag this out past November or at least so close to the election that the judge would say he's just not practical to try it right now.",

So they've come in this year and re-energize the bill, the governor just signed it a week or so ago. And so I think this is one way that they're trying to keep their hand on the scale, if you will, going forward.For Fani Willis, in this case, and when you think about the judge's order, he even says in the order that I'm confined by the law. I'm constrained by the law. But there may be other bodies that look at this, like the state bar, the state Ethics Commission, the Georgia legislature is in there. And so it's sort of a toss of the coin to them, like, Look, if you want to take a look at it, do it.

Let me tell you, for example, Amara and Danny, that according to the government -- Governor, since signing state of emergency in order, last year in January, he has increased the number of guards meant for the Florida National Guard by 48, 133 soldiers for the state guard and also 30 additional officers in addition to equipment, four helicopters. He was saying that he is also making available for those officers. And he said that the Florida is ready, will be ready in case this happened. This is something that he had to say when he made the announcement on Friday. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): What's different today than maybe in the past, well, part of it is we have more resources that the state has been willing to put up. And this is not really our responsibility. This is the federal government's responsibility. Coast Guard does by and large a good job but they're undermanned. They're under resourced. So we're filling those gaps. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now the Opperman Foundation has not responded to CNN's request for comment.The Supreme Court is weighing in on how officials interact with the public online. On Friday, the justices ruled that public officials can block people on social media in certain circumstances. The court set a clear standard for when public officials are state actors online and when they can have more control over their social media presence. The Supreme Court ruled speech by government officials can be attributed to the state making them subject to First Amendment scrutiny only if the person involved has the authority to speak on the state's behalf.
