It's the people who govern the network. It's Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the network. It's Suzanne Scott, the CEO. And so I think  what's important to note here is that this testimony, this defamation testimony gives Dominion's lawsuit a lot of weight. And legal experts like Elie will tell you, you know, it's a pretty compelling case. Typically, with media and defamation cases, the First Amendment covers them pretty broadly.

Then you have Rupert Murdoch, which is sort of the tippy top. Right? Not the sort of. He is the tippy top. Then you have Paul Ryan, who is a board member of FOX Corp, now saying that he will not attend the Republican convention if Donald Trump -- and this is all based on Donald Trump's election lies that FOX, right, spewed, as well. Saying he's not going to attend the convention, the Republican National Convention if Donald Trump is the nominee. Let's play your sound bite. I want to get your response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
