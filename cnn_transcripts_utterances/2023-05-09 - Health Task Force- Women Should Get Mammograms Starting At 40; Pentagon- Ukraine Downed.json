With just three weeks before the country hits its debt limit, as early as June 1st, what happens behind closed doors today could set the country on the path towards a deal to pay its bills or a path towards real financial costs. And with two days left before a pandemic era immigration policy expires, federal authorities are conducting an enforcement operation targeting migrants in El Paso, Texas. A Department of Homeland Security statement says migrants with no legal right to be in the United States will be removed. The crackdown aimed at discouraging a migrant surge when Title 42 policy expires on Thursday. Sources with the U.S. government estimates, in Mexico alone, more than 150,000 people may be standing by to make their move into the United States if they can on Thursday. We'll be watching closely.

The threatened heavy flooding and torrential rain, flash flooding likely in southeastern Texas. With a bull's eye on the Houston metro area. Rainfall there could actually top five inches per day. More than seven million people across southeast Texas are under flood watches. And also, after more than eight days on the lam, the second of two escaped inmates is back in prison. U.S. Marshals captured Bruce Callahan after he approached a student at a college dormitory near the town of Farmville for medical assistance. The student alerted police by pulling the fire alarm. Callahan was arrested without incident. And Vladimir Putin marked the country's World War II defeat over Germany with the annual Victory Day celebration, but the military parade was noticeably sparse compared to years past. Russia seems to have significantly scaled back its typical show of military might. As you can see, there was only one tank leading this year's parade. And that usual flyover you see was canceled without any explanation. In his speech Putin said, quote, \"True war is being waged against Russia.\" And he said he wants a peaceful future. Boris?",

The U.S., meantime is stepping up with more military assistance to Ukraine. A new aid package worth more than a billion dollars. Let's take you to the Pentagon and CNN's Natasha Bertrand there live.

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris. The Pentagon did confirm, for the first time, that Ukraine did, in fact, down a Russian hypersonic ballistic missile called the Kinzhal missile on May 4th.Using a Patriot system, that sophisticated air defense system that both the U.S. and Germany have provided to the Ukrainians in recent months. This is significant for a number of reasons. First, among them being that Ukrainians were able to successfully deploy this very sophisticated system to down a very difficult to intercept Russian missile. This is a hypersonic missile that travels at 10 times the speed of sound. The Russians had boasted in the past that it was a missile that was very difficult to shoot down and intercept. So the fact that the Ukrainians were able to do this speaks, according to the Pentagon, very highly of their ability to use this system effectively. Now all of this comes as the Pentagon is announcing a new $1 billion aid package, or just over a billion dollars, for additional Ukrainian air defense, ammunition, other things that they will need over the course of the longer term. So the medium and longer term, because this is not coming, this assistance, from stocks that U.S. currently has. It is going to be contracted out so that this assistance can be built and ultimately given to Ukraine to support its fight against Russia in the longer term. So we will be seeing, you know, moving forward, a lot of the arguments made by the U.S. kind of consistent with their claim that they are going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes here. And this Ukraine security initiative package they announced today is further evidence of that -- Boris?",

The verdict is expected to be read in the next hour.You'll remember that this case is about civil battery. E. Jean Carroll alleging she was sexually assaulted in the dressing room of a Manhattan store in the 1990s. And then, following that, she was defamed by Donald Trump when he denied those allegations.

I was in the court when the judge went through a detailed description of the task that they have at hand. As you noted, this is not a criminal case. It is a civil case. So there is no jail time on the line. This is all about whether the jury thinks that Trump is liable for battery and defamation. E. Jean Carroll alleges that she was raped by Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman in the spring of 1996. And she also claims that he defamed her by saying that this allegation was a hoax and a lie. But, yes, the verdict came back quickly. They had been deliberating over two hours. And if you look at the questions that they have to answer, this is a lot faster than we expected. Part of their job is to consider all of the evidence that they have heard, including E. Jean Carroll's case, which included 11 witnesses, including E. Jean Carroll herself, who testified for several days. The former President Trump did not put on any defense of his own. He did not call a single witness. Though the jury did hear parts of his deposition, and parts of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape. So it is going to be interesting to hear the decision they came to.

Can you detail some more of those questions? And I should note to people watching right now, the verdict is going to be read in about six minutes' time, so 3:00 P.M.

One other option is forceable touching. They could find him liable for forceable touching, which is touching someone for the purpose of degrading them or abusing them, and that is pinching, squeezing, grabbing or rubbing. And so they have a lot of different things to go over in this jury room. They have gone through it very quickly. And then after they made a decision on whether he was liable for any of these potential batteries, then they need to go on to question of defamation. Now, that is also a series of questions to determine whether or not he defamed her. If they find that he is not guilty of the sexual assaults, they would not have to find anything on defamation. But they could find -- potentially, they could say, yes, he was guilty of one of these, or excuse me, liable for one of the counts of sexual assault and not defamation. So it is a complicated case, Jim. And they have a lot of questions to go through. And they received 90 minutes of instructions but only deliberated for two hours.

I think they will get him on at least one of those and I think probably the highest charge, which would be rape. Again, it is not criminal. It's liable.

Jean Carroll, and not just for the sexual abuse but for the defamation. So if they find him liable for the sexual abuse, then they will find him liable for the defamation.
