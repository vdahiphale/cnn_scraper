You're going to see what voters think about the new Harris-Trump matchup.Plus, Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to Capitol Hill to address a divided Congress. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are boycotting the Israeli prime minister's speech. I'll talk to two people who will be there. American parents whose son has been held captive in Gaza for 291 days. And tonight, Americans will hear something they haven't heard since 1968. A sitting president explaining why he won't seek reelection. We have the latest on the Oval Office address that Joe Biden never wanted to give. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Well, this is a wildly different presidential race. Then just a few days ago, we've heard a lot from politicians about Vice President Harris taking over for Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. But the crucial question is, what do voters think? And today we're going to get the first snapshot of how they view Kamala Harris, who used her first rally as the presumptive presidential nominee to go after Donald Trump head on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He and his extreme project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. Like we know we got to take this seriously. And can you believe they put that thing in writing. When you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. America has tried these failed economic policies before, but we are not going back.

A three-point margin, that's within the margin of error, Dana. Donald Trump at 49 percent support, Kamala Harris at 46 percent support. That's about half the margin that we saw in the Biden versus Trump matchup. The last couple of months that we pulled, that was a six-point race. This one now is a three-point race.And if you look here, broken out by party. You see near total consolidation among Democrats for Harris, similar, more than nine and 10 Republicans for Trump. Take a look here at the independents. Trump has 46 percent. Harris has 43 percent. Biden was losing independents to Trump in the last couple of months, according to our polling by roughly 10 points. Now he's -- now Harris is just losing them by three, though remember, Biden won them by 13 points in 2020, when he won that election.",

Do you want the next Democratic nominee. Her name is Kamala Harris. We know.To continue Biden's policies or take the United States in a new direction. 53 percent, 53 percent say continue Biden's policies, 47 percent say take in a new direction, and near even split among Democrats. Looking for a new direction here, I think that is very interesting to watch forward how Kamala Harris campaigns on that. And then we've talked a lot about this all cycle long. Are you voting for a candidate or against the candidate? Take a look at what a difference a couple days make. For Harris now, it splits evenly. 50 percent of Harris supporters said, they are casting their vote for her. 50 percent say they're doing it against Trump. Look at what that was when Biden was the nominee. Two thirds of his votes were against Trump, only about a third, 37 percent were for him. Harris changes that equation. Donald Trump, by the way, gets more affirmative support after the assassination attempt, after his convention. He's now up to 74 percent of his voters who say they are voting to cast their ballot for him, only a quarter say they're casting their ballot to be opposed to Kamala Harris, Dana?",

PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: That last data point is the one I'm most fascinated by nerding out on some level, probably going a few layers deeper than maybe most people will be at this point in time. But I think what that shows is what -- I think a lot of us have picked up over the course of the last 36 hours, 48 hours, which is, if you want to know what a collective exhale of an entire political party looks like, look into these numbers. Both, in the affirmative support of the vice president 50 percent, where I think Joe Biden was 37 percent as David was just showing through. They are excited about a candidate when they weren't prior to now. Because of that you're seeing many of the groups that form up their coalition, as David was running through, start to come back home, which was always the pitch from the Biden team. They'll come back home eventually. They'll have to come back home eventually. They weren't coming back home. They may have, but they weren't up until the last couple of days.

Let's look at another way to approach our new numbers that were just getting out. The question, the choice for president, face the question. Right now, Trump is still up three. Again, there is -- this isn't a margin of error situation. But back just a couple of months ago, if you look from April through June, up six.

Because the key pieces in the constituency, the younger voters, the voters of color, they're the ones that are more inclined to say, I want to see a new direction from Biden policy, is not a repeat. The older voters, the white voters, which again, that she -- that are part of her coalition that she needs to hold on to. They're the ones that say, I want you to continue Biden's policies.

If you listen to the vice president talk about what they have done in their first three and a half years, she does it in a very forceful way.
