President Biden at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan is grappling with both. On Ukraine, a milestone with President Zelenskyy due to travel from Ukraine to Japan this weekend. President Biden gave his okay for a joint allied effort to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters and other advanced aircraft. And on the debt ceiling, it looks like talks which the president was being updated on remotely are back on again. They resumed tonight just hours after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republican negotiators called a halt to them earlier today. As only CNN can, we have correspondents spanning the globe tonight, Phil Mattingly traveling with the president in Japan and Sam Kiley in Ukraine. I want to start with Phil. So what's the latest that you're hearing from White House officials about debt ceiling negotiations?",

It had been days of hours on end of meetings between the President's top negotiators and Speaker Kevin McCarthy's negotiating team.However, they are now back on, just about 10 minutes go, Anderson, the 90-minute rejuvenation, I guess, of the talks that were underway in the Capitol came to a close. One source familiar with the matter who was in the room texted me it was a \"candid conversation.\" There is still a very long way to go, but they are talking again. I think when you talk to officials who have been around this process, Anderson and briefed on this process, they acknowledge that breakdowns in high stakes negotiations like this aren't a rarity and aren't necessarily a bad thing so long as they come together and lay the groundwork for real progress. The major issue right now, beyond the policy, beyond the vote counting and the ability to actually get this across the finish line is the calendar. They don't have time to kind of go through a traditional rhythm of a negotiating process. We're talking about ten, eleven days before a potential default here and things need to start moving quickly. At this point in time, though, nothing is unlocked, just candid discussions -- Anderson.",

And the reason is not just for pure symbolism or not just to kind of rally allies, really the g7 leaders have been the cornerstone of the Western alliances that have been so steadfast in the support, both on lethal assistance and on economic aid over the course of the last 15 months. But it's also to make clear that this war, this Russian invasion, going on a year-and-a-half is at a clear inflection point. We're on the precipice of Ukrainian military launching a counteroffensive. Zelenskyy and his top advisers are very cognizant of the fact that the durability of the coalition that has continued to support them is always a little bit in flux, given the domestic issues, particularly on the economy that they face.Showing up in a place like the G7 in the wake of a week-long tour of European capitals, showing up at the Arab League Summit in Saudi Arabia earlier today, it is critical to make the point make the case and also make the ask because Ukrainian officials just as their US counterparts, acknowledged now, this isn't ending anytime soon and the significance of more funding, more defense capabilities, more economic aid is critical for what comes next -- Anderson.",

It's also very analogous to what you've seen the administration do throughout the course of the last 15 months when it comes to weapons capability.They are reticent, they are weary. They don't believe it will have the effect and then eventually often driven by Ukrainian pleas, allies who want to make that move, they end up moving forward, whether it is Patriot missile systems, whether it's HIMARS, whether it's M-1 Abrams tanks, they have progressively been willing to evolve. And I think it underscores what I hear from national security officials inside the administration quite often is kind of the president's theory of the case in terms of the coalition. If the coalition is moving towards a specific direction, even if the US military advisors say they don't believe it's the best battlefield weapons system or they're concerned about escalatory effects, the president is likely to eventually move in that direction as well. That appears to be what has happened here. There is still skepticism about the actual battlefield effect and it is very clear that the US does not have any plans to send F-16s from its stocks. But that's really been the animating feature of President Biden's efforts over the course of the last 15 months.",

My husband was lucky enough to be able to work on the speech that LBJ gave to the joint session of Congress after the Selma demonstrations, when he talked about the We Shall Overcome banner that had been the civil rights movement. And then he and the power of the presidency joined together. That's when change takes place, when these outside movements that they're now afraid, some of these bans are on movement discussions took place. In fact, I was just thinking after President Biden went to Howard University this last week, that President Johnson gave a talk at Howard University way, way back in 1965 and he acknowledged the importance of racism in a certain sense, because he took this incredible metaphor.You can't take a person to the beginning of a race hobbled by chains for all these years, and then just say, you're free to compete. It was really in some ways, the birthplace of affirmative action. That kind of discussion of the acknowledgement of racism would probably be denied according to some of these ambiguous laws. So we learned from it, we learned at that moment that they were going to try and confront social and economic justice and third part of the civil rights movement -- desegregation, voting rights, and then social and economic justice. Sadly, the war intervened, and we never were able to get that full, but that's what the Great Society was all about.
