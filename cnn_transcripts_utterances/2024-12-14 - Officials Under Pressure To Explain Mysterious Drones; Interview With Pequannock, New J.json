I suggest that we make a coalition of every single mayor in the state of New Jersey, every single elected leader, regardless of whether you're Republican or Democrat. This is not about politics. We have drones that are flying over critical infrastructure. They're flying over our residents' houses. They're flying over our houses, our families. They deserve to have peace of mind. We need to find out what's going on. And I'm calling on the federal government to step up and help us, give us the tools we need to track these. Because let me tell you what we're not going to do. We need to find out who they are, what they are, who is flying these, whatever is going on. We're not going to shoot one down. We're not going to try to catch one, and we're not going to send up a hobby drone to try to take pictures. You know, the unintended consequences of that is way too big. God forbid one of these drones the size of a car crashes into your neighbor's house and kills everyone. I don't ever want that to happen. But what we are going to do, let's focus on getting clean pictures, as good as possible. Video, audio. If you have a flare camera just so we could see what kind of engine this is using. Is the heat signature coming down or back? We need Americas help to solve this problem because the government is not. DEAN: Wow. All right, Mayor Ryan Herd, thank you so much.

So yes, I do think it's worth it. Will he make it? I don't know. It's really on his shoulders, ultimately, to convince these senators that he's the right person for the job.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN COMMENTATOR: I think that became a very -- he became a very popular figure, specifically on the right. People felt that it was unfair that he had been put through a trial. And ultimately they see him as a cause celeb. And so it's a populist move to bring him there, to show that, you know, the narrative that they have is that he was doing his, you know, duty, trying to save people from a man who was clearly unwell and caused a threat. And so they feel that it's good messaging for them in terms of law and order. In regards to Pete Hegseth, all I can say about that is that it does seem like senators are perhaps looking at some of the other questionable picks that Donald Trump has made instead of Pete Hegseth But let's be clear here, the problems with Pete Hegseth do not have to do with him being untraditional. They have to do with very serious allegations, whether he might have committed sexual assault, whether he has problems with alcohol abuse and whether he has really not been able to manage even small charities that he was tasked with running.",

I think if he goes to the table during his confirmation hearing and says, everything I do at HHS is going to be data driven. Any decisions we make about any kind of health care or this vaccine, that vaccine, any kind of new innovations that come along, we want to make sure we have proper data, proper scientific process. That's the correct answer. So I'm really hopeful that that's his posture. There may be people around him or that have been around him in the past that say things, but they're not the ones going under confirmation here. He is. What he says will matter. And absolutely, if he shows up and takes a more strident anti-vaccine view or says something crazy like, I want to revoke the polio vaccine, that would be a problem.

I mean, it is unimaginable to think that one of the biggest advances of science would somehow see their permissions revoked. And so, you know, it raises huge questions. These aren't just sort of ideological issues. These are issues that really impact people's safety, their health.

The reason we knew that it worked is that 36 children were paralyzed in that trial, 34 were paralyzed by polio in the placebo group, 16 children died of polio in that study, all in the placebo group.So, but for the flip of a coin, those children could have lived long, healthy lives. And thus is the nature of placebo-controlled trials. So asking to do another placebo-controlled trial now, knowing that there was a case of polio in New York in 2022, and that case represented the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Because only one of 200 people who were paralyzed by polio are infected or are infected by the virus. In other words, 200 people are infected. For one to be paralyzed. It's just nonsensical.",

We know that too many vaccines given too soon doesn't cause autism. We know that the thimerosal, this ethyl mercury containing preservative in vaccines, doesn't cause autism. Autism occurs in one of 36 children in this country. Look at the Covid vaccines. I mean, we found that the Covid vaccines were associated -- with the mRNA vaccines were associated with myocarditis in one in 50,000 people, or that the Johnson and Johnson vectored virus vaccine was associated with clotting in one in 250,000 people.

What we don't know is how far you're going to see this collection of rebel groups take those principles, whether they'll be fighting internally. There's already been a little bit of signs of that, but better than we thought a week out. You know, our experience with revolutions of this kind has not always been great. In Iraq, you remember the celebrations when Saddam was gone, and then what that turned into later on. And in Libya, the celebrations when Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and ultimately killed.

Now in Syria, they've actually done something pretty smart right now, which is grant an amnesty to anybody in the military who was a conscript. So people involved in war crimes and that kind of thing that don't -- aren't part of the amnesty. But I think that's a smart move. It seems that they're keeping also the bureaucracy in place. And so, so far, they are making the right moves. But as David says, you know, the there was a huge wild card, which is the Kurds who control a good chunk of Syria.

I think the bigger question is the one that you just raised, Jessica, about what involvement he will have in dealing with helping to shape a new government. He sent out a Truth Social message last weekend saying we should stay out of this. But of course, the United States has huge interests in the Syria that emerges. Do the Russians get pushed out of their naval base and their air base? They look today like they we're already packing up their -- their air base, but getting them out and keeping them out would be a significant American interest. Is Syria, at the at the end of the day, no longer a funnel for Iranian arms to make it through to Hezbollah and Hamas? And so sealing that up is going to be a huge American interest.
