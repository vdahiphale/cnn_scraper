This morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is out of money, out of hope, and out of the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donated their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am, today, suspending my campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT:  Now Nikki Haley remains the only person standing between Donald Trump and the Republican nomination. And right now, it is unclear how well she will stand up. A new CNN poll taken after the Iowa caucuses shows Trump now has a majority among New Hampshire Republicans. Look at that -- up at 54 percent with DeSantis supporters reallocated to their second choice. Haley trails there by 13 points. Let's bring in former Trump administration official and GOP congressional candidate here in New Hampshire, Matt Mowers. Matt, you are up in Gilford, I believe. Thanks so much for being here.

      "sentences": "Well, it's a number of factors. I mean, here in New Hampshire, he never really took off outside initial polling that actually showed him winning. If you go back to polling a year ago he was beating Donald Trump here in the Granite State.The challenge to Ron DeSantis, though, was a few different things. One, he staked it all on Iowa, right? And that's not just about time and money but it's also about, like, ideological positioning. If you go back, he started trying to move to the right of Donald Trump on abortion, on issues of transgender issues. On a whole host of different things. And what that did was for every Iowa caucusgoer, which is a low turnout affair and only has the hardest of hardcore supporters that show up to that, it lost some Independent voters here in New Hampshire. And so, that really limited his appeal once he tried to go beyond Iowa. So that was number one. Number two, let's don't forget -- I mean -- and you can talk a lot about Ron DeSantis -- whether it was a failure to launch. Whether it was impossible for him to connect with voters. Whether his super PAC was misrun by folks like Jeff Roe or what have you. But the key thing to remember -- $47 million -- actually, probably a little bit more by now -- was spent against Ron DeSantis trying to ensure that he did not become the Republican nominee. And look, I don't care who you are, that's a lot of money. That is more money than was -- than was spent against Donald Trump and that was spent against Joe Biden -- certainly, against Nikki Haley. And so, all that money that was spent against him limited both his appeal to Republican primary voters. B But if you go back to the ads that were run by Donald Trump's super PAC -- MAGA, Inc. -- they actually hit him from the left. And what that told me and so many others, as well as those who were talking to the super PAC about what they were doing, was they were trying to actually kill his appeal with general election voters. Because if you think about it, Ron DeSantis -- and this will be my final point -- was trying to say he is Trump without the baggage. He was Trump who could win, except poll after poll after poll showed that he had less appeal with general election voters than Donald Trump did and it just didn't serve him well. Not to mention the fact that Joe Biden has shown that he's so weak politically that if you look at polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, and Arizona -- these key swing states -- he's actually losing to Donald Trump. So it's a very difficult message to sell people.",
