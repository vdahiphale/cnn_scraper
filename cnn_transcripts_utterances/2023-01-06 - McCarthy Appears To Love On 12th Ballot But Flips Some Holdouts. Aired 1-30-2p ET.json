He will be one of the most famous members because he will be the chairman of the House Oversight Committee and be the tip of the spear an all these investigations. I don't know what he's going to say. Here's what's true. As long as this is going on, that committee doesn't exist and the oversight doesn't exist and the subpoenas don't exist. But because Comer is getting up to make a speech here I just think it bears pointing out. If you voted for a Republican for the House and are a conservative there's probably 100 percent chance you want Biden to be investigated and the Matt Gaetz seven are stopping you.

One of the reasons is no Congressional oversight. There's no sense of urgency or the White House or the bureaucrats that populate this town to move. I want to talk about that. Oversight of our tax dollars, that's our responsibility. We've all heard reports of hundreds of millions of dollars of potential waste and fraud in the unemployment insurance programs in all 50 states. We've all heard reports of misuse of hundreds of millions of dollars of the stimulus money, of PPP loan funds. But yet, there has not been a single hearing in the House Oversight Committee about this. The border crisis, we've made several trips on this side of the aisle to the border. We've listened to the Border Patrol agents. Their message is loud and clear. Under President Biden, the Border Patrol has become the welcoming committee. They're begging for help to do their job. Law enforcement officers in all 50 states are begging Congress to force this administration to secure the border, to do something about the fentanyl crisis that plagues every community in every state in our great nation.
