He says the craters and other damage are not consistent with an Israeli airstrike. The spokesman says Israel also intercepted communications among Gaza militants that pinned the blame on Islamic Jihad. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESMAN:  The explosion of the Al-Ahli Mahadani (ph) hospital in Gaza was caused by an Islamic Jihad rocket that was misfired. According to our intelligence, Hamas checked the reports, understood it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that had misfired and decided to launch a global media campaign to hide what really happened.

I'm sure we'll be back with you throughout the hour as we watch President Biden on the ground in Israel. Just ahead here, what caused the deadly blast at that Gaza hospital? We're going to talk with decorated Air Force intelligence officer. Plus, another fail in America's House. There is still no speaker. Another vote expected today. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

So, let's -- let's also discuss a little bit about what the actual capabilities are and sort of the fact that there is an element of magnitude that would be associated with an Israeli bomb. Essentially, the Israelis are looking at this and saying, there is no crater in the ground. If we dropped a bomb, there would be massive crater here. The rockets that Hamas obviously are much less powerful.When you look at these images, who do you believe?",

And this is a very difficult problem, especially when you are dealing with intelligence sources and methods, because once you start reviewing the information you have, let's say it's the signals intelligence intercept, which is what the Israelis are talking about of the chatter from the Islamic jihad in Gaza, that then reveals, of course, the intercepting that particular -- that particular line of communication.But in this particular case, it's sometimes better -- certainly better to review that information and say this is what they said at this particular point in time. You know, in a world of deepfakes, and things like that, it becomes a really problematic situation nowadays because it's very hard for people to believe the truth even if they are confronted with the truth. So that's the first thing. It's something that there's no guarantee of success. But it is the first thing a military and political person should do in a case like this, especially if what they are saying is correct.",

We just heard from President Biden who's on the ground in Israel ahead of his bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He said that this appears to be, quote, done by the other team, end quote. This is what he says to Netanyahu. So he's accepting the Israeli explanation for what happened here, but we already have an incredibly complicated an explosive geopolitical situation in reaction to the initial reports that this was an Israeli strike that according to the Palestinian health authority, killed hundreds of Gazans.",

And I think a lot of Palestinian sympathizes around the world have made their minds of very clearly, that Israel is lying, and the Palestinian delegation to the U.N. said as much yesterday.So their view for many of those protesters is that Israel carried out a strike and they're lying. Of course, we have been carrying all of the Israeli spokesperson on the network, they're saying absolutely this was not us carrying out this strike. So, we are trying to balance things, a very difficult thing for us, of course, is that reporters in large numbers aren't being allowed and see actually what's happening on the ground. So we are trying to juggle this. We're looking at all the protest bubbling up. We're seeing them in Lebanon. We're seeing them Iran. We're seeing them in Jordan. Just consider that in Jordan, more than half the population are Palestinians. Millions of people, seeing protests apprise there, then you are seeing destabilization in the region, and this is the thing we are really concerned about in terms of moving ahead in terms of any sort of peace. And we've seen the Jordanian king call off a meeting with President Biden today. So, how this is perceived that is going to have the impact on the situation in the region, and any chances of peace and I think that's as frank reality. There's so much distrust across the region.",

We've already seen pretty stark warning signs coming from Iran. That's a red line for them.And obviously, at the back of everyone's mind is the tension between Iran and Israel, and that escalates at the northern border, many people viewing Hezbollah as a Iranian proxy, of course. We really need to keep an eye on that northern border as well, seeing how things escalate there in terms of wider conflict if it indeed that happens.
