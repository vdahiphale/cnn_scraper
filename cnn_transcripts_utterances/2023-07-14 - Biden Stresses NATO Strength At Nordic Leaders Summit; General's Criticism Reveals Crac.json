And there was a real palpable anger in Kyiv over the outcome of the summit, because they felt like they came in with very reasonable expectations. They understood they weren't going to get into NATO now. But they wanted a very clear path, clear benchmarks that would allow them to finally join the alliance.We didn't see that come out of this, only vague promises that if Ukraine met conditions, at a certain point, they would be allowed into the alliance. And this is adding to a lot of historical heartburn for the Ukrainians. Because if you look back two decades, when Ukraine gave up their nuclear program, they were promised security guarantees by the United States that didn't materialize. In 2008 of course, Ukraine was promised a path into the alliance that didn't materialize either. And then Russia, of course, invaded Crimea and, of course, before that, Georgia. So Ukraine is feeling sort of a lot of palpable anger at this point. It's not clear yet how the relationship will be repaired. Of course, the West put forward some certain conditions, continuance of security aid. So one of the tangible steps is that it seems like the political cohesion in the west over Ukraine is still settled. But Ukraine really felt like it had the wind at its back when it came to the weapons that were coming through. They've gotten artillery. They've gotten cluster munitions. They've now gotten long range weapons from France and the United Kingdom. Now, NATO is really at the top of their list.",

There was a statement that came out of the G7 after the summit, indicating that support will continue and will perhaps be magnified, though it didn't come with specific pledges. Ukraine wanted much more specific and brass tacks conditions.What I think that we're seeing, though, in spite of the vagueness that came out of the summit, is even if you talk to the most hawkish people in the NATO alliance, Eastern European defense officials I was speaking to this week, they actually indicated that the vagueness could be a political top cover for some of the people who are a little bit more reticent within the alliance to actually give Ukraine potentially a step forward -- toward the Alliance. Then, eventually, as this process unfolds, and the war continues on, and potentially it resolves itself in Ukraine's favor. You could see a scenario where Ukraine is much more ready to join the alliance and you have political top cover for the countries that are a little bit more reticent to let them in, such as the United States and Germany.",

It could give NATO a much more resilient defense industrial base when you look at Saab and the other countries that are in the Swedish Defense industrial base already. So this gives NATO significant ability to defend some of its soft spots. And if Turkey hadn't caved here, and actually allowed the Swedes into the alliance, which it appears they're now willing to do. You would have seen NATO kind of in this middle ground, this real limbo, where they have to defend the northern flank without Sweden without Swedish submarines without Swedish F-35s.

So ultimately, if someone falls for a phishing e-mail, and I'm not suggesting that's necessarily how they got in, in this case, except you know, a well- placed e-mail that looks well formatted, it has an innocuous looking link in it, or in many cases, the sophisticated groups can actually deploy something that doesn't require any kind of clicking.

One is obviously the harvesting of intellectual property intelligence that would otherwise be caught, gets out into the hands of a nation state actor that's elsewhere that has malicious intent. The ability to influence or propagate a rumor or do a disinformation campaign from within is also a huge concern, since they have access to things like personal e-mails and corporate e-mails, or in this case, governmental work e-mails, they can propagate a narrative that maybe is untrue and create a lot of disruption in that regard.

And the government certainly has some very stringent methods and procedures that they demand. However, unfortunately, like I mentioned earlier, when it comes to human error, it's hard to mitigate, you can only train people so much, and you can only kind of beat it into their skull so much that they need to do X, Y or Z. It just takes one time to fail. That's the asymmetry of the problem is that the adversary can try many times and fail. We can only effectively fail once and it's all over.

This is the first time since 1960 that both unions will be on strike together. At a news conference announcing the strike, union president Fran Drescher said studios left the actors no choice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA: I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty. That they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The last plains of Gujarat in Punjab Province are home to some of the most fertile land in all of Pakistan. The mighty Indus River and it's tributaries, the lifeblood.But not everyone here prospers from its richness. 14-year-old Mohammed Abuzar (pH) felt the heavy burden of responsibility. His father, a school van driver earning less than $90 a month, was struggling to provide for the family. Abuzar worried about the future of his younger brothers, especially six-year-old Hassan, who is severely disabled. \"My son pleaded with me to be sent abroad,\" he explains. \"He said look at how we live, we will die of hunger. It's best for me to leave so I can support our family.\" Many older boys from the village had already made the trip to Europe through human smuggling operations, sending hefty remittances back home. Abuzar's uncle had decided to go, and the teenager knew this was his chance. \"The people smuggler said it would cost more than $8,000 U.S. to send my son to Italy. I said, I cannot afford it. He told me, your kid will earn that in a couple of months. At the beginning of May this year, Abuzar, his uncle, and a small group of teenage boys from the village set off. Human smugglers organized for the group to fly from Karachi to Dubai, then to Egypt before transiting to Libya. From Tripoli International Airport they drove to the Libyan port city of Tobruk and waited in a cab filled with other illegal migrants for the next month. The day before the group set sail for Italy, their final destination, he sent a video to his brothers, hoping to make them laugh. He then recorded the group's final prayers. That night, he called his father. \"My son was really happy. He said, don't worry dad, it will be ok. We will have lifejackets, it is a big boat. Once I am there you'll have nothing to worry about.\" On the 9th of June, Abuzar boarded the Adriana, a fishing vessel with a capacity of 100. Instead, 750 illegal migrants were crammed aboard, of which almost half were from Pakistan, according to the Pakistani interior ministry. Within days, the trawler would capsize off the coast of Greece, as a Greek coast guard ship watched on. More than 600 people drowned, in what would become one of the deadliest migrant boat tragedies. Among the survivors, only 12 Pakistanis. Abuzar was not one of them. \"Dying of hunger is better than this. Don't send your children away. For us, life and hell are now the same.\" But this grieving father's warning is falling on deaf ears. According to U.N. migration, last year Pakistanis weren't even among the top ten nationalities arriving in Europe. This year however, they are ranked number five with economic migration fueling the surge. A financial crisis in Pakistan and record high unemployment is driving many families to make these life-altering decisions. ROBERTO FORIN, HEAD OF E.U. OFFICE, MIXED MIGRATION CENTRE: The common narrative is that smugglers are to lure people into this dangerous journey. We look at who are the people that's influencing the decision of migrating and it's mostly family. And so migration is a family investment.",

She died in January from a blockage in her small intestine.It was attributed to a complication from weight loss surgery years before. The toxicology report also found certain medications in her system, but they did not contribute to her death. Lisa Marie was the only daughter of the late Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley. She was just 54 years old. And a founding member of the legendary group Fleetwood Mac is paying tribute to a bandmate who died last year. Drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to honor the late keyboarder Christine McVie on what would've been her 80th birthday. He released an unusual version of her hit \"Songbird\".
