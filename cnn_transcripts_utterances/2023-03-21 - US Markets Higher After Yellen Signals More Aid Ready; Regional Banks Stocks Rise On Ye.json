I`m in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening, and welcome to the show. Tonight, relief on Wall Street as the US Treasury Secretary signals the government could do more to support small banks. All three major US indices closed higher. The NASDAQ was up the best of the day, as you can see rallying one-and-a-half percent rising more than anticipated. First Republic recovered parts of the ground that it lost yesterday. Its shares closed up 30 percent after losing almost half of its value on Monday. It comes after Janet Yellen told the American Bankers Association, the government is ready to provide more support if smaller banks need it. She said the Treasury`s efforts would help the entire banking sector. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, if they do nothing, then it looks like they`re justsort of accepting high inflation even though prices are rising much faster than what they are supposed to be under healthy conditions. But if they raise interest rates, they risk potentially worsening the pressure in the American banking system and really the worldwide financial system. It is a difficult balancing act and you know, this was always one of the risks. We know, history shows that when the Fed moves as aggressively as it has in the past year, it tends to break something. And now with the bank failures, we`ve gotten the sense that they have in fact broken something. And so, some experts have said that the Feds really should pause here. I mean, former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, she told me that she thinks the Fed should sort of take a beat, look around, see how much damage they`ve done. Goldman Sachs predicted just the other day that the Fed will in fact hold steady and keep interest rates where they are at this meeting, but as you mentioned, investor sentiment seems to be coalescing around the idea that the Fed is going to go ahead and raise interest rates despite the situation in the banking sector, more than 80 percent chance priced in by the futures market of a quarter point rate hike tomorrow. And I think the thinking here is that the Fed wants to make clear that it still cares deeply about getting inflation under control, that maybe the situation in the banking industry has stabilized a bit. But Eleni, the last point is that the Fed has got to be worried that if they don`t do anything at all, that`s actually going to freak out investors even more, because a lot of them would immediately jump to the conclusion that the Fed knows something that everyone else doesn`t.",

First, officials guaranteed to make good all deposits at Silicon Valley and Signature Banks after the two collapsed. Then over the weekend, the Swiss government arranged for UBS to take over Credit Suisse, that was meant to put an end to the troubled bank`s problems. Now, US officials are saying they`re ready to give more help to midsize lenders like First Republic. They`re hoping it will be enough to prevent a new crisis, particularly if the Fed continues to raise rates. Gerard Cassidy is head of US Bank Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets. He joins me now from Maine. Great to see you, Gerard. I have to say, you know, we`re all eyes on the Fed. And as Matt just said, regardless of what the Fed does, it could have repercussions. If they don`t hike rates, it might mean that the Fed is worried about the impact higher rates will have; if they do hike rates that could also have an impact.

They saw that those borrowings were driven by the San Francisco Fed and the New York Fed, which is where those two banks are headquartered along with First Republic. So when we look at the numbers carefully, the contagion appears to have been contained already and so that is obviously a relief to the Fed, since they`re really stuck between a rock and a hard place where they are fighting inflation, which is one of their mandates, but their other mandate, which is the reason they were created back in the early 1900s is to provide financial stability. So it`s a tough position they`re in. It wouldn`t surprise us if they go 25. Once again, they will get a real pulse on what`s going on with deposits through tomorrow to get a sense on whether that would really rock the market.

First, the actions taken by the Fed two Sundays ago, to provide a line of credit toany bank that needs to borrow money to pay off depositors that are leaving the bank and they don`t want to sell their bond portfolio because they would incur losses, which is what happened to Silicon Valley. But second, and more important, Silicon Valley and Signature Banks and First Republic to some extent, they have a real outliers. Silicon Valley and Signature had approximately 90 percent of their funding deposits that were in excess of the insurance limit of $250,000.00. Your typical mainstream regional bank or even our big money center banks, that number is much, much lower. And in fact, that deposits under $250,000.00, for many of our regionals, whether it`s Fifth Third or Regions, or KeyCorp, it is close to that 50 percent. So the funding mix is entirely different than what those two banks had, and once you know, the Twittersphere, hit the -- you know, pull your money out of the bank, it really forced that run to accelerate on that Thursday.",

But in no way, in my opinion, we`ll have a new view of this, and I think it`s temporary. In no way will it make banks take on more risk, because you might remember, our biggest banks go through an annual stress test every June or it is going through right now, the results is coming out in June. And the regulators, the Federal Reserve, stressed their balance sheets for a very severe downturn and because of this stress test, it has pushed a lot of risk outside the banking system because the banks want to pass the test. So I don`t see that at all as a reason for banks to take more risk because of what she said. I think she said it just to make sure everybody knows that there is not a panic. There is no real contagion, and they want to ensure that people know that.",

Why because President Xi said his peace plan upholds the central tenets of the UN Charter, but nowhere does he recognize that Russia illegally and without provocation massively invaded Ukraine with over 100,000 troops, no mention of that. So how he thinks, President Xi thinks that comports with the UN Charter is unclear and President Putin echoed it. He said Russia and China are the ones that are being violated. Russia and China are the ones that are sort of trying to set out and uphold the real democratic values and principles around the world. So I think if you are in President Zelenskyy`s when his shoes, when you get the call from President Xi, if it happens, you`re not going to be incredibly disposed to feel that he`s going to tell you something that is going to radically alter the battlefield at the moment. Obviously, you`re going to listen. President Xi has a huge amount of influence over Russia, and is essentially by improving these trade deals as they are helping Russia finance the war in the face of Western sanctions, but it does seem to be a stretch really, to understand how Russia and China think that they`re upholding the UN values when ostensibly Russia has completely upended them.",

We don`t know the details of the financial elements of what`s being talked about in these big business opportunities, but you can be sure that Xi is also looking to make sure that China`s interests that he gets good value deals that will strengthen China`s grasp of needed minerals, of needed energy supplies, will want to advantage China in the long run, help Putin right now, maybe, but this is all about China.",

One of our own CNN reporters has already gotten access to it. Clare Duffy is in New York for us. Clare, great to have you. Is your life more efficient, more productive? Has Bard changed anything?
