I think he was much more in tune to the culture at Disney. But that doesn't necessarily mean that Chapek had been completely failing over the past two years. In fact, Disney had grown at one point to have its subscriber base surpass Netflix's. And while they had a bad quarter, Poppy, the trend lines had not been anything new. Yes, streaming losses had been mounting, and Wall Street was growing frustrated with it. But it's not like this is something that just happened out of the blue.

And Bob Chapek was able to stave that off. But new reporting from \"The Wall Street Journal\" about a different activist investor staking a big stake in Disney could put more pressure on the company at this critical time. And then, of course, Don, what I was just noting before. The tensions between these two executives behind the scenes, sources told me, was palpable.
