Many of them have recently experienced some kind of civil conflict or insurgency, whether that's Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic. These are countries that are battling rebellion and insurgencies internally where the aggressor in the case of Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces, is reaching out to those militia groups and rebel groups in those countries, trying to draw them into this.If they are drawn into this fight, you can imagine that the governments of those countries might follow suit coming in after the rebels in their own country using Sudan as a place to do battle with internal rebellions. So, that's the first set of issues that I think we have to grapple with. And then secondarily, those regions are also facing growing insurgency threats from the Islamic State and al-Qaeda affiliates in that part of the world. So, the late Chad Basin has the Boko Haram militia group as well as ISIS affiliates. So, it's a very dangerous area that borders Sudan very closely and where you see a lot of tribal linkages cutting across all of these countries that you could, you know, see drawn into the fight in Sudan.

We hope it doesn't come to that, but if violence does not stop, we will see many more people forced to flee Sudan seeking safety.And to your point, let's take a look at the map because Sudan is bordered by Egypt to the north, Chad and Libya to the west, the Central African Republic to the southwest, South Sudan and Ethiopia to the south, Eritrea in the east, and just across the Red Sea is Saudi Arabia. So, given what you've just told us about the state of play within the region, where do you expect most of those 800,000 people to go?",

So far, we've seen them headed mostly towards Egypt, although many are now fleeing into Chad, especially those who are in the Darfur area, which is, you know, continues to have a high degree of instability and new violence emerging every day.Let's not forget that in the long civil war that Sudan had with now, South Sudan, there are more than two million people displaced by that conflict. There were two million people displaced by the conflict in Darfur. So this is already an area that is prone to heavy displacement, where there are refugee camps already existing in both South Sudan and in Chad and in the Central African Republic. So, those are going to have a very strong, I think, pull factor for many people fleeing violence. And then, of course, Egypt, I think, is the next place where I think we're going to see a lot of people trying to get to. It's an overland border. Egypt, obviously, more stable than some of these other countries. But once you cross into Egypt, again, it's a very inhospitable environment. It's a remote area. The nearest city, Aswan, is still several hours drive from the border. It's a more expensive country. So refugees are going to have a harder time, you know, getting their feet under them there.

Clashes erupted within the first half hour of demonstrations in Paris. May Day is a traditional day of marches for workers' rights in France, but this year with the raising of the retirement age from 62 to 64, protestors were out in droves in Marseilles, Rennes, Toulouse, and in the capital. SOPHIE BINET, SECRETARY GENERAL, CGT UNION (through translator): You just have to look at the processions behind, you can see that today is a historic May Day and we can see that this day of mobilization is a stinging denial of all the bets made by the government. BELL (voice over): From September, the French will start working longer than they had after the government pushed through the reform without a vote in Parliament. But the unions have vowed to fight on nonetheless. This May the first was always expected to be an important barometer of the popular anger that is out there, but it is likely also an important measure of just how difficult the next four years of governing are likely to be for the French president. All the more so because despite the many months of strikes and sporadic violence, more than 62 percent of the French are sympathetic to the movement, according to polling from April. THIERRY CAMUSSO, UNION REPRESENTATIVE, CGT VITROLLES (through translator): We are going to show Mr. Macron, that the country, we are not happy with this reform, and it will not do. BELL (voice over): The government says the current pension system is simply not affordable, its deficit at risk of spiraling out of control.

Some islanders feel like sitting ducks, at the mercy of China's People's Liberation Army. The PLA launched massive military drills near Taiwan twice in the last nine months. China calls the drills a response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-Wen's high-profile meetings with two U.S. House speakers, Nancy Pelosi in Taipei last year, Kevin McCarthy in California last month. Just off the coast of Kinmen, we see Chinese sand dredgers China is reclaiming land to build a new airport, the mainland coast getting closer every day. \"We all hope war doesn't break out here,\" says the chairman of the visitors association. \"We think it's basically impossible for our military to defend Kinmen.\" But they did defend the islands more than 70 years ago. Tens of thousands of nationalist troops from Taiwan repelled the mainland's communist forces. Thins are very different today. Only a few thousand Taiwanese soldiers remain. China now has the world's largest navy. Taiwan's outlying islands are no longer strategically valuable, and almost defenseless, if the PLA decides to make a move. Many here are calling for Taiwan's military to pull out completely. \"We don't want Kinmen to become a battlefield again,\" Wu (ph) says. \"If there are no soldiers or military installations, we can become a demilitarized zone, and attract more tourists.\" He says the handful of remaining military sites are shockingly vulnerable. Last year, civilian drones from China hover over several island outposts. This video shows startled soldiers throwing rocks, raising questions about the military's readiness. Taiwan says it shot down at least one unidentified civilian drone.",
