      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, history on the Hill. For the first time in nearly 150 years that cabinet member will be tried in the Senate for high crimes and misdemeanors. We're minutes away from the start of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment trial, which could be over soon after it starts since the real GOP target is the president's border policies.Plus, the salesman, a teacher and a nurse walk into a courtroom. We have new details on the seven people pick so far to be jurors in the matter of the people of the state of New York versus Donald J. Trump. And quote, Israel makes its own decisions. That's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's message to the world and his own political coalition, as we wait for his war cabinet to decide how to respond to Iran massive aerial assault. We are live in Tel Aviv this hour. I'm Dana BASH. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. You're looking at live pictures of the Senate floor where senators will soon be sworn in as jurors to hear the impeachment case against President Biden's Homeland Security Secretary. Now after that, we don't quite know how this is going to play out. Democrats may call for a quick vote to dismiss the charges, even as Republicans demand a full trial. Conviction and removal requires 67 votes. So, there is pretty much no question here about the eventual outcome. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Manu, you've been talking to senators. What's your sense of how this is going to play out?",

      "sentences": "You know, it could end quickly as you mentioned. There has been negotiations that have been happening for several days among the Republican and Democratic leadership to try to have some structure on the Senate floor. Remember, the Senate operates on a principle known as unanimous consent. That means all 100 senators have to agree to how a debate could happen. That includes during an impeachment trial, but there is no agreement yet and how this could play out.Republicans -- Democrats had proposed and Republicans that came back with potentially having a couple of those to try to call for a full- blown trial, those votes would have gone down along party lines. We'll see if that eventually happens. And then ultimately, there'll be a move to dismiss the charges altogether. But there hasn't been an agreement on that. Even though the eventual outcome is certain that Alejandro Mayorkas will be essentially acquitted here in the United States Senate. And there'll be just -- these charges will be dismissed by this Democratic led majority. But since there's no agreement, Dana, it could be that they open up the floor and they could quickly move to end the proceedings almost immediately. We'll see if that happens is a little uncertain at this moment. Now, the question too, how will this play out on the campaign trail? There are a number of vulnerable Democratic senators who will vote, most likely to vote to dismiss these charges altogether. And Republicans say, they're going to make them pay for this at the polls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): There may be a rare moment of accountability. And that's -- I think, maybe an opportunity here. I don't think they'll be able to run and hide from their complicity in aiding and abetting machine, the Biden border crisis. SEN. BOB CASEY, (D-PA): It's a partisan exercise. And I think it's a waste of people's time, but we have to go through it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But expect most of them -- if not all of them voted to dismiss. Will they pick up any Republicans who will oppose this as well. Another senator to watch on the Republican side, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who has blasted these proceedings, suggested this is there's no reason to charge all 100 Americans with a high crime and misdemeanor over a, essentially a policy dispute. So that's going to be the debate. But Dana, the outcome we know all 100 Americas will be acquitted here in a matter of minutes.",

But, you know, there's a reason that this has only happened once before in our history that a cabinet secretary has been impeached and hasn't been tried since then, you know, it's going to come and go very quickly. And up until the sort of transformation of impeachment into a really partisan tool in the last few years, there was a sense that, you know, both parties -- both parties had an incentive not to an effect criminalize their arguments over policy by putting cabinet secretaries like this in the hot seat. I think it's going to come and go so quickly. It will be seen ultimately as a not very successful kind of political gambit by the House Republican.",

Donald Trump not only believes that immigration helped propel him to the White House in 2016. He also thinks it's going to bring him back to the White House in 2024. And they want to double down on all this. And Republicans are following suit, not just because it's Donald Trump but because they see the poll numbers coming out that immigration is a top issue right now for voters.And the people that you just heard from the senators, that you just heard from those are not necessarily moderate senators who are coming up to the microphone to talk about this. But I do think that overall, this is a way for Republicans and what they're viewing this as a way to highlight the border crisis, a way to put that forward. Maybe people don't actually care about the impeachment of Mayorkas, maybe people aren't really even paying attention to what is going on in the Senate right now. What they are paying attention to is what's happening at the border.",

You'll notice they weren't talking about Mayorkas impeachment in that ad. And I think that, you know, the White House right now is feeling pretty confident. They feel like the American public isn't really paying attention to this impeachment proceeding. And they also look towards that New York special election that Democrats won -- that Tom Suozzi won back that seat, where he used immigration. And talked about immigration saying that Republicans weren't willing to vote for a border deal, killed the bipartisan border deal. And Democrats are willing to sign on to one of the most conservative immigration bills in decades and that Republicans are ultimately the ones that tanked it. So, you may very well see some candidates like Tester and other vulnerable Democrats try to use that argument.",

Not only from Marjorie Taylor Greene, but remember that it takes only one or two Republicans at this point to potentially take down the speaker.The fragility and the narrowness of this House majority, of course, is one thing that's been powering the dysfunction. That's how they took out already one Republican Speaker, Kevin McCarthy. It took weeks for them to settle on this obscure, almost unknown candidate Mike Johnson. You know, I think there's a lot of incentive in both the Republican and the Democratic caucuses right now, not to have another costly internal fight. But I think it's important, Dana, that you started this conversation about Ukraine by talking about the border because Republicans had this kind of extraordinary strategy. They've delayed a vote on this for essentially nearly six months now. In this period of time, Ukrainians have run out of crucial ammunition. They've run out of air defense supplies at a time when Russia is launching incredible barrages against the civilian population and energy infrastructure of Ukraine. And all because Mike Johnson essentially couldn't assemble a governing majority in his own House. So, his bluff is being called right now, remember, Senator Republicans bluff was called. They said, we want a border deal in order to move Ukraine. It didn't happen.",

But we'll see what it looks like. We don't know yet. But as that's happening, our great team on Capitol Hill, they are reporting effectively believe that the sort of sharks are circling and that there are other Republicans. Tom Emmer, for example, who is trying to see if maybe this time, if Mike Johnson is ousted, he can get the gavel. What do you think the chances are that Mike Johnson survives?BARRON-LOPEZ: I think that if this motion to vacate is ultimately raised, and I know that there are a handful of Republicans now saying that they're going to bring it forward, that it would be very difficult for him to survive without the help of Democrats. So -- and then ultimately, does he actually want the help of Democrats? Because, you know, for so long others before him have said that they wouldn't want Democrats to help them effectively feeling as though it would make them a weaker speaker within their party. So, he may ultimately decide that it's better to go down rather than have democratic help. And then again, at that point, who ultimately gets the votes to become speaker.",

Works in sales, has some college education and is married with no children. Juror number two is an oncology nurse and native New Yorker. She lives with her fiance and says she reads the New York Times and watches CNN. Juror number three is a corporate lawyer originally from Oregon. He says he gets his news from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Google. Juror number four is Puerto Rican and runs an IT business for training and consulting.

CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it's a cross section of New Yorkers, a variety of backgrounds, a variety of professional affiliations, family situations.

So, we have this sort of background information about them. I do think one of the challenges that the lawyers on both sides will be facing in selecting the remaining jurors. And in what going into selecting these already seated jurors is that they want to make sure that everybody is being truthful that nobody sort of sneaks into the jury with views that they are not expressing. The entire integrity of the system relies on truthfulness. And so, it just will be so important that the lawyers continue to try to delve into private views the individuals might have.",

Both sides are really worried about the fact that because Donald Trump is so polarizing, that there is potential for people to be dishonest because they want to be either support him in this trial, trying to possibly get a hung jury. That's really the best outcome that the Trump team thinks that they're going to get out of this case. Or on the other side, sneaking in because they don't like it and they want to convict him.
