We're into the fourth week of the conflict. We've seen days and days of people just sitting at the Rafah crossing, hoping for it to open. Now we understand that it will open imminently. We don't have a clear timeline, but we understand that we could see up to 500 foreign nationals cross today. We also could potentially see several injured people, injured Palestinians. Some 80 injured Palestinians potentially could be part of this deal, as well. These would be the first Palestinians allowed to leave the Gaza Strip since the conflict began just after October 7th. We did have images of ambulances. And I think you're playing those now. E.D. ambulances just waiting at that crossing. This is a major breakthrough, one that President Biden had been working on, one that the White House had been working on. One that, again, these families have been desperate to see. but you have to remember, there ARE still 2 million people who are trapped in Gaza who do not have the option that this small group, this 500, potentially; up to 500 nationals do have to come through. But it is a sign of a diplomatic breakthrough. And I'm sure for those mediators, hope that negotiations could move further along with hostages and other issues.",

It's also been a place of hopes and hopes dashed over the course of the last several weeks. Americans being told they might be able to leave and then never actually finding an open border. How does this actually work in terms of getting out of Gaza and into Egypt? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Phil. The big area here is really that right here at the Rafah crossing, what Salma was talking about, this is the area where they have to go through. And as Salma was mentioning, there are multiple checkpoints here. What they're going to be doing is they're going to be looking for to make sure that no Hamas fighters get over this way. Because the key thing here is security for the Egyptians, as well as for the Israelis and, of course, actually for Hamas. So what they're trying to do is they're trying to move the foreign nationals, and they're trying to also move the wounded people, the 80 or so wounded people that will be in those ambulances that we saw earlier. So this is the kind of thing that's going to make a big difference. And Phil, when you look at the way this is going to go, it's going to be a test for the diplomatic efforts that have been going on between the White House, the Egyptians, Hamas and, of course, Qatar. So these are the kinds of things that will make a difference on the ground for a select few people. But the misery in Gaza will continue.",

So there's going to be a lot of questions about what role did they play, what did they know about the preparation of these financial documents. Now, listen, in a former deposition done by Donald Trump Jr., by the attorney general's office, he said, I went to business school, but I didn't actually prepare these documents. I just relied on my legal departments, the accounting departments to prepare these documents. And then I would sign off on them. So we'll see how he expands on that. Certainly, we're going to see the, you know, documents being put into evidence today that they are going to have to answer to.
