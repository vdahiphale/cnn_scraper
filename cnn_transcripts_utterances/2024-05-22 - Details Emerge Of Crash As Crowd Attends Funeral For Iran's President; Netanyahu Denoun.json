Now, Tehran is just the latest stop in the funeral ceremonies that began Tuesday in the Northwest city of Tabriz. They will conclude on Thursday night in the city of Mashhad, where racy is set to be buried. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini is expected to lead those prayers himself.

I'm actually only a couple of streets down from the Tehran University where those prayers were taking place, of course, led by the Supreme Leader himself, they started very early in the morning hours at 7am.And afterwards, the area that you see here, right here, this is called Revolution Square. This is where the bodies are going to be brought through where a lot of the folks that you see here, who are those folks who have come out to mourn are going to pay their last respects. I have to say from being down here on the ground right now, there are huge crowds that are turning out here to pay their final respects. A lot of people here coming with posters that were specially printed for these events, you can maybe see some of them. You can see there's a lot of people, for instance, this is one of the ones that people have been showing this is one showing a very racy getting kissed by the late General Qasem Soleimani, who of course, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2020. That one of the big themes here. Thank you. That one of the big themes here is to portray those who were killed in this air crash as martyrs in the service of the Iranian state. And that is definitely something that you can see here throughout this town. You see this big crowds here around me, Paula, but really throughout Tehran right now there are billboards that have gone out in the last 48 hours a little more since that crash happened. It seems as though millions of posters have been printed. So you can see that on the one hand, the folks who are in power here in Iran, they want to make this mourning very public. They want to make this a state event which certainly it does appear as though it is but at the same time, there is that second part to this as well, where they also want to portray a sense of stability, where they obviously acknowledge that with the president of the Islamic Republic and the foreign minister, by the way, he's a very important figure here as well. It was really important for the foreign policy. They obviously have been killed, but they do say that the government services will continue without any disruptions. Paula.",

THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, I think that there are one of two ways to construe this. It's either incompetence or it's nefarious, and neither is a very good look for Trump. And I think the problem is that Trump has just traffic and so much authoritarian rhetoric, that it's hard to give him the benefit of doubt In any scenario. You know, you can see the pattern, Trump winks at extremists, but then he gives just enough plausible deniability to say that this doesn't represent his views. You know, that's been true over and over and over with his both sides comment at Charlottesville, it's true with his stand back and standby comment with Proud Boys. It's true with his bloodbath comment, back in 2020, you may recall, actually, Facebook took down Trump ads displaying a red triangle symbol used by the Nazis, which the Trump campaign at the time claim was associated with Antifa.

It seems like Biden or Trump essentially has been trying to tack to the center on these issues. You know, he's consistently invoke states rights to sidestep making clear statements, but, you know, in the end that may satisfy no one because there's a really real challenge here for Trump. You know, the religious right will want Trump to come out harder for national abortion ban, they'll want restrictions on something like mifepristone and centrist voters will want the opposite.

There was perfect weather conditions and no concerns. So they took off around 1:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Now we understand from the chief of staff that once they had done that, they then realized that Raisi's helicopter had disappeared. So about 30 seconds after raising the altitude, the helicopter that he was in, then tried to circle back, tried to search for where that helicopter had gone, but was unable to decrease altitude because of this cloud. Now they had tried to make radio contact with Raisi's helicopter and failed. That is when they flew on and then landed in a copper mine. Now, according to the chief of staff, they were able to make contact with the imam on board the same helicopter as Raisi. This was Tabriz's Friday prayers imam. He had answered the mobile of the pilot on board and said that they had crashed and that he was in critical condition. Now, according to this interview, they say that he was then able to stay in contact a number of times with officials over the next three hours, at least before he died as well. Now we understand from this interview that when they reached the location of this helicopter crash, they said that the condition of the bodies of the late President Raisi, of the late foreign minister Abdollahian including the other seven -- six onboard the condition of the body showed that they had died instantly.

I have been wanting to talk to you about what is going on in the cockpit when this happens.I mean given your experience as a pilot, can you explain how and why this can't be avoided and what's going on with the pilots. I mean, they hit clear-air turbulence if that's indeed what this was. What are they doing at that point to try and stabilize the altitude? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, they're initially just going along for the ride, Paula, relying on autopilot initially at least. [01:39:46] O'BRIEN: But unfortunately, clear-air turbulence, if that is in fact what happened here, that seems to be the case, although there were some storm cells nearby which could indicate some other disturbances in the air. Regardless of that, it's pretty difficult to -- I mean quite literally, they come out of the blue. And this is a thing that meteorologists can't predict, air traffic control can't see, and there isn't a sensor on board a flight deck of any airliner that can detect it. And so it can happen suddenly like this. Now, it is interesting that the seatbelt sign apparently was illuminated prior to this happening. So there may have been some concern on the flight deck or some reports by other pilots in the area of turbulence which believe it or not in this day and age, the primary way that we pilots know about turbulence is from hearing from the pilot that went through that airspace right before us. So we can hear about it. We get these pilot reports and we can adjust our activities, maybe changed altitude or put on that seat belt light. In this case, very dramatic turbulence, very suddenly and quite a surprise. And unfortunately we don't have technology to detect it.",

How so? O'BRIEN: Well, if you think about what's happening with climate change, it is heating the planet unevenly, both by latitude and by altitude. And so what that's doing is it is changing the way the jet streams move. These currents of air, which move at high altitude, sometimes hundreds of kilometers per hour. And as they are disturbed and changed by these temperature gradients created by a changing climate these wind shear become more prevalent. And when we talk about wind shear, you can think about these rivers of air, these jet streams as kind of a layer cake. And the winds going one direction at one layer, and it can change at another layer. And if there's a sudden change like that it changes dramatically and quickly, the lift which goes across the wing and that's what we call turbulence. And so the researchers at the University of Reading (ph) tracked this for 50 years and have indicated there is a 55 percent increase in the amount of time airliners endure severe turbulence over the North Atlantic. So there's something going on here. But again, we don't really see or know how to detect wind shear as we're flying and understanding this is really a difficult thing.",

Now, this is a hearty airplane, the Boeing 777. Despite all the problems with Boeing, the Boeing 777 has not been implicated with any problems, has a sterling safety record. But when an aircraft goes through this kind of turbulence, it is required to have a very significant inspection. And in the course of that inspection, they might determine that there was too much metal fatigue as result of this and it could be what we call 100 percent haul loss, you know, total. That is possible in this case, but this aircraft will not fly without an inspection.",

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he hopes that by the end of May or beginning of June, that U.S. airliners would be able to begin traveling more regularly to Haiti, that they would be able to restart their flights because so far there's just a handful of flights scheduled each day. But he warned that while the gangs hold control over much of Haiti, that Haiti risks, increasing risks falling into the category of being a completely failed state. There are representatives of Kenya's government in Haiti right now preparing a force of about a thousand soldiers that is expected to arrive in Haiti in the coming days or weeks. They are expected to rig some security to this problem where the gangs have essentially taken over the streets. But it's unclear if they will have enough firepower to completely wrest back control.
