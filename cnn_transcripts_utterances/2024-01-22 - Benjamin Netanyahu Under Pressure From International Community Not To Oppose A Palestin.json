And then, they were two, Ron DeSantis drops out of the presidential race and endorses Donald Trump, leaving Trump and Nikki Haley to go head-to-head in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. Millions tune in across India to watch the opening of a vast Hindu temple seen as the crowning moment on the prime minister's nationalist agenda with months ago until nationwide elections, but it's laced with controversy. We'll explain why, just ahead. As bombs continue to fall on Gaza, ministers from Europe and the Middle East star in what one E.U. official calls a complex ballet of meetings to look for a way forward. Diplomats from Israel, the Palestinian territories, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt are in Brussels meeting their E.U. counterparts. It comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu double down on opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. After a call to discuss Gaza with U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday last week, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel must have security control over Gaza in the future, drawing criticism from the U.N. and many in the international community. Here's what the E.U.'s top diplomat said a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: Which are the other solution they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill of them? 25,000 already in Gaza, 70 percent of woman and childrens. Certainly, the way you're trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they're doing because they are seething the hate for generations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This isn't in alignment with what the U.S. has been thinking and frankly, many in the international community that have been also speaking out about what this means. Many are questioning whether this is, you know, Netanyahu's major plan, given what we've been seeing playing out in Gaza and importantly, his political career and his ability to survive.",

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden said he will continue to try to convince Benjamin Netanyahu to support this twostate solution even as the Israeli prime minister has shown no signs of budging so far, as was mentioned over the weekend, he posted on social media saying that he would not compromise on full Israeli security control in Gaza. And this episode really highlights the latest flashpoint of disagreements between the two men, as we've seen some of those disagreements that rift spill into public view most recently around what happens in Gaza after this conflict ends. Now, Biden and Netanyahu spent about 40 minutes on the phone together on Friday, just one day after Netanyahu appeared to pour cold water on the idea of a Palestinian state. But a source says that during that phone call, Netanyahu told Biden that his comments were not meant to rule out that outcome entirely. The two men spoke in great length and detail about what possible attributes of Palestinian state would have, that would still need to be negotiated. One thing that Biden administration officials have been talking about is the potential of full demilitarized Palestinian state. That is an idea that is intriguing to President Biden, according to some of his advisers. But after that phone call between Biden and Netanyahu, Biden told reporters that he does still think it's possible, that there will eventually be some form of a Palestinian state. But the big question is, what exactly that would look like and whether they can actually reach that final outcome, especially as you have Netanyahu publicly speaking out against the idea of a two state solution. Now, it all comes as the U.S. has very publicly supported Israel. But there has been some frustration bubbling up behind the scenes about the fact that Netanyahu so publicly pushes back on some of America's proposals, and it comes as Jeremy was outlining, Netanyahu is facing extreme political pressure back at home when it comes to the release of Israeli hostages, and also the way that this -- he is waging his campaign against Hamas in Gaza. So, all of this really speaks to the challenges President Biden faces as he's trying to apply further pressure on Netanyahu, not just when it comes to a two state solution, which the U.S. has backed for quite some time, but also when it comes to how he is waging that campaign against Gaza, which has received a lot of pushback from the international community among the deaths of civilians, thousands of civilians there.",

In the last 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry, 190 people have been killed. And as we've heard time and time again, the majority of those who are being killed are women and children. Now, we've seen continued displacement with at least 90 percent of the population now having been moved. Several -- many of them have been moved several times. In fact, we heard from one woman today, who said she's been moved seven -- she's had to move seven times since the beginning of October. And in fact, she probably thinks that they have been moved more. We're continuing to see for instance the increase in the numbers of hepatitis A cases in Gaza, according to health officials there, the numbers are up 16 times. There's problems with gastroenteritis, jaundice, skin disease. People are crammed into very much the center and the south of the Gaza Strip, there continue to be shortages of food of medicine, of water, of basic sanitation, very little access to clean running water to showers.

I mean, essentially, people are worried about the outbreak of a regional war.But in fact, there's a regional war already going on, low intensity compared to what's going on in Gaza, but low intensity, nonetheless. And what we're seeing, for instance, here in Lebanon since Sunday, Israel has carried out a series of strikes, one of them near an army checkpoint about eight kilometers north of the border, that killed several people, including a woman. We understand that Hezbollah has admitted to three of its fighters being killed. And of course, on Saturday there was that Israeli strike, we assume it's an Israeli strike on Damascus, on the residence of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In that instance, it appears that one of their senior intelligence officials was killed. And as you mentioned, seven strikes on the Houthi since the United States began its campaign there. And so, there is a fear of a real full blown regional war. Now there is a solution, of course, the United States could pressure the Israelis to ceasefire in Gaza. And what we've seen here in Lebanon is that when there was that seven day truce, so to speak, while hostages were released and Palestinian detainees were released by Israel, there was no fire from Lebanon. But as long as the war goes on in Gaza, and the United States sits on the sidelines, sits on its hands and does nothing in terms of bringing about a ceasefire, the danger of a regional full blown regional war comes ever closer, Eleni.",

Instead, it has only bolstered Trump and he continues to just have this stronghold on the Republican Party. And now with Ron DeSantis out, as you mentioned, we look to New Hampshire, of course, it is the first in the nation primary. We had caucuses in Iowa last week. These are actual primaries where people can vote all throughout the day. And we're going to see him face off against Nikki Haley. It's the two person race that Haley has said she wanted. But the fact remains, Eleni, that looking forward if the polling hold and we just -- we CNN just put out a new polling showing Trump again, with this big lead in New Hampshire. The question becomes, what now, if Nikki Haley couldn't beat him in the state where she was supposed to have such a great chance that then turns to her home state of South Carolina. And if he can beat her there, it really is off to the races for the former president. And there doesn't seem to be any more competition in sight.

Fred Pleitgen, thank you so much.Hundreds of thousands of people are turning out in Berlin and cities across Germany protesting for a second straight week against the country's major far-right party. The demonstrations have gained momentum after reports emerged that senior members of the Alternative for Germany party have discussed a \"master plan\" for the mass deportation of migrants and even German citizens who originally came from other countries. Many are comparing the party's alleged stance to the Nazi era. As CNN's Michael Holmes reports (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice over): A huge turnout in Germany to protest against the rise of the far-right, and an ideology reminiscent of the country's darkest days. Waving signs that say, Never Again, and Nazis are disgusting, hundreds of thousands of people rallied in cities across the country over the weekend against the far-right party, The Alternative for Germany and its anti- immigrant policies that many Germans say are similar to the Nazis. JORG LAURENTSCH, PROTESTER (through translator): Germany is undergoing a huge shift to the right, just as it was almost before the war or before the Second World War. And I don't think it's ever been this bad since the war. HOLMES (voice over): The AFD struck a nerve with many Germans after it was revealed that senior party members attended a secret meeting last year of Neo- Nazis and other extremists, and discussed plans for mass deportation of migrants including German citizens. The AFD denies it is a racist or extremist group, and denies such plans are part of their policy, although calls to ban the party are growing. But it has also recorded high polling in some states, and is expected to make gains in regional and perhaps European elections this year. Something protesters say needs to change. KATRIN DELRIEUX, PROTESTER (through translator): I hope that it will make people change their minds. Some may not yet be sure whether they will vote for the AFD or not. But after these demonstrations, they simply can't do that anymore. HOLMES (voice over): German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has encouraged people to join the protests, saying extremism in the country is a threat to democracy, and a throwback to a time of hatred and violence. OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): If there is something in Germany which must never ever find a place again, it is the national race ideology of the Nazis. The repulsive relocation plans by these extremists is just that. HOLMES (voice over): Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, in some senses, this is the fulfilment of a promise that his party has made decades ago, going back even to when the site at which this temple is being built, when it was a mosque in 1992. And it was destroyed at the time, by, you know, a group of Hindu politicians, but also a giant mob. And, you know, all of that, I think, points to this year, why now, a lot of it has to do with the elections that will be coming up in a few months' time, for which by the way, Prime Minister Modi is an overwhelming favorite to win. But much of this is also about him solidifying his image in India as, you know someone who is devout, someone who is seen as someone who delivers on his promises. Remember, this is a very popular move, while it is being criticized by some in the opposition, it is being criticized by people who want to see a -- or India.

First, from centuries of ruled by the Mughal Empire, and then, by the British Empire. And they see themselves as redressing many of these historic injustices. When you look at that backdrop, that framing, that this government has been very good at putting forward, this is immensely popular. And so, in that sense, the country itself has changed where there is not that much protest anymore, about, you know, what is effectively a very majoritarian move that harms India secularism, a lot of this is also linked to weakening of other pillars of democracy in India, whether it's the media.
