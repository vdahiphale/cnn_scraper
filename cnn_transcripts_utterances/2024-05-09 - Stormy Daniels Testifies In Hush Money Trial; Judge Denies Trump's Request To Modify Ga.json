      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper in Manhattan, just outside the New York criminal courthouse where I spend much of the day, inside courtroom number 59 watching witnesses, including Stormy Daniels testifying the Donald J. Trump hush money cover up trial.They have moved on to other there witnesses since Stormy Daniels, including Madeleine Westerhout, whose desk was right outside Trump's Oval Office. Today's testimony is due to end at any moment. Oh, it just has ended for the day, I'm told. Well, this hour, I'm going to walk you through what I saw, what I sketched, what comes next, the highly skilled courtroom sketch artist Christine Cornell, whose work you're going to look at right now, and Jane Rosenberg, they set the scene today as Trump's lawyers cross- examined porn star and director Stormy Daniels. Their clear objective, the defense attorneys, to demolish her credibility by suggesting the encounter never happened and she made it all up for money. Trump reportedly was seething over Daniels testimony from Tuesday, according to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Daniels revealed embarrassing details Tuesday about the alleged sexual encounter in his hotel room at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006. Daniels on Tuesday even suggested that while the sex was consensual, she did not want to do it and she regretted it. So Trump wanted to undermine her today. And remember that the judge has threatened Trump himself with jail time if he violates his gag order again, not by talking about any of the witnesses. So his attorneys rather, were the ones that went after her today. Before the judge leaves the bench today, we are expecting the defense to raise several issues, including a renewed motion for mistrial and challenges to the gag order. CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is here, along with Jeremy Saland, a former -- Saland -- former prosecutor for the Manhattan D.A.'s office. While we watch for the defense motion to play out, let me help you understand a little bit more about what its like to be inside that trial. I was your eyes and ears inside the courtroom. I made this little diagram just so you understand what the courtroom is like. It's about 25, 30-foot high ceilings, pretty high ceilings. This is where the spectators sit. Five spectators from the public are allowed and they'd get up very, very early in the crack of dawn to get one of those five seats, these blue dots are cops and they are throughout. In fact, if you -- if you have bad luck, you might not see anything other than the backside of a police officer for much of the court proceedings. This is the most important stuff though. This is the front of the court. All right. This is where the jury is. Each one and the pink thing is a screen, each one of the jurors has their own screen where they can zoom in on the actual exhibits and evidence. This is where the witness sits. The witness, by the way, sits like the judges stand is like up here, like you considered the witness stand and maybe even barely see the judge. This is where the lawyer who is conducting either the cross or the redirect stands so you can theoretically come in -- when you come in over here if you're a witness, you walk in over here. It is possible to never make eye contact with Donald Trump, who's the T over here. So Stormy Daniels talking to the attorneys, whether defense or prosecution here, here, the district attorney is there. Mr. Trump's sitting here, the judge here, stenographer here. Mr. Trump, as far as I could tell, and this was my seat, I did not have a great seat over here, as far as I could tell, he was just looking this way the entire time. That Stormy Daniels was testifying, which meant that he could be looking at a screen here, a screen there, staring off into space. He did not appear to be looking directly at new witness. Anyway, that is what the diagram is like. You agree with this? You were in --",

It doesn't mean anything, which was an interesting thing to hear a judge say. But she wasn't convicted. But then later on in the trial, when they were trying to degrade her credibility, Stormy Daniels, and they talked about the fact that she had some show that had something to do with the paranormal or a podcast or something.

She knows Trump. She knows the judge. She knows prosecutors in this case. So right now, there are motions going on in court, but the breaking news and the reason we did the breaking news thing at the top of this block is we were just told by Todd Blanche in court, he announced that the prosecution has informed the defense they do not intend to call Karen McDougal as a witness. Karen McDougal, 1998 playmate of the year who has alleged relationship with Mr. Trump around that same time from 2006 to 2007. And also was the recipient allegedly of hush money in the form of payment for a column she was supposed to write for some fitness magazine published by David Pecker's tabloid empire.

And I suspect somebody at the D.A.'s office said, guys, whether you want to or not you just can't put her on. Its going to bring it back in a New York minute as they say.",

This is different here because there was this is Molineux in New York. What we call Molineux material.It shows an alleged pattern or scheme by a defendant. So the reason why the prosecution -- why these people are called in because Karen McDougal was not part of the criminal charges. The underlying criminal charges for the falsifying business records exception, the reason that the catch and kill was brought in through David Pecker, through Keith Davidson, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, was to show that Trump was allegedly involved in this scheme or pattern of hushing this information before the election. So I think that's a very important distinction with the Weinstein appeal ruling and doesn't have place here. And I also think not having Karen McDougal in the case is a good decision because I think Stormy Daniels was damaging and off with all of the tawdry sex allegations and what went on in that hotel room.

I will tell you -- I did change a little bit in terms of some of the cross-examination about Stormy Daniels. I don't think shed comes off as cleanly as some of your folks are suggesting as she came off as a grifter. I've talked to a lot of dead people and they say they've never talked to Stormy. But, look, the bottom line is she was doing some -- some pretty manipulative things and then pretending that the NDA was somehow a protective measure instead of a money grab. I don't think common sense New York jurors are going to buy that. So, I kind of retreat from my original instinct to be very minimalist and succinct with Stormy, which is consistent with the stipulation idea.

I want to bring up, Stacy, more of what happened today, because look at what happened when Trump's attorneys asked about the sexual encounter, the alleged sexual encounter between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels, the defense attorney says, quote, this wasn't the first time in your life someone made a pass at you?

Remember, Donald Trump didn't pick up his own phone to make phone calls or texts at all. He would use peoples own who was around them and that included Madeleine Westerhout, people needed to get in touch with Donald Trump. They'd often reach out to people like Hope Hicks or Madeleine.

Mr. Trump wanted to be able to respond publicly to the testimony from Stormy Daniels now that she's done at least for now, that was flatly rejected.

[6:40:02] The testimony that came out Tuesday was so prejudicial because it suggested that the sex was not consensual. Even though Stormy Daniels said it was consensual, she said other things. Donald Trump was bigger than me. I didn't want to do it. The Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, is saying the fact that it was introduced, that there was no condom worn during this acts in his view, is a quote, dog whistle for rape. How strong a case does he have? JEREMY SALAND, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: I think he's going to find themselves in the same position he was when he first made the application. I think the judge is going to deny it one of the things, if you recall that Judge Merchan addressed was you didn't object, you didn't object early enough, you didn't object often enough, and maybe not those exact words, but it's incumbent upon you as a defense to make those representations or objections, pardon of me. That's number one. And number two, nothing has changed since that time since that initially argument was made.

CNN's Kara Scannell was just in the courtroom. Kara, Trump's request to modify the gag order so that he could respond to Stormy Daniels testimony, at least in part, what was denied. Tell us about how that went down. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jake. So the judge just denied that motion to modify the gag order and Trump's lawyers had said that they wanted at modified because they said that Stormy Daniels story had changed from what she had initially told in 2018, through media interviews to what she testified on the stand, and they said that in part their allegation is that it changed because she made the suggestion that the her encounter with Trump may not have been consensual. Now, Daniels testified that it was consensual, but she also said that she blacked out at one point and that she was surprised and shocked to see Trump on the bed in his boxers and a t-shirt. But what Trumps lawyers are saying is that in news media, on television people, including political pundits, were talking about Daniels testimony and this change. And they were arguing that Trump should have an opportunity to respond to that, so voters could hear what his response is. Prosecutor strongly pushed back about that, saying that they had some witnesses, including some of the witnesses that are brought in to introduce records. So they're called custodial witnesses. They said that some of these witnesses express their own fear and concern about testifying in this trial, and they did not have anything significant at stake with Donald Trump's. So they said that there was still fear. In fact, they said there was fear in the eyes of Daniels because on one of the forms, her personal address was listed there, saying that this is very much a real risk and they said that is a risk because it's Donald Trump's own rhetoric that he continues to make, statements about people. And they pointed to a statement and that they pulled from an expert of Donald Trumps book in which he repeatedly has said in a couple of excerpts in eye for an eye and that you should go after someone who comes after you. So the judge agreeing with prosecutors in saying that he was not going to modify the gag order to let Trump respond to Stormy Daniels, her testimony in the past few days. They're actually currently arguing again, Trump's requests for mistrial. His lawyers are saying again about this testimony that Daniels gave some of the details that she's testified about in this trial that she is not publicly said about her concerns about the bodyguard being at the door. They're saying that all of that is not what was at stake in 2016. It was not the reason why Michael Cohen would have paid for the story and so, they're saying that that actually goes beyond what was supposed to be allowed in this case. So, prosecutors pushing back on that, saying Daniels hasn't changed her story, saying that they were careful not to solicit some explicit the details, including more details about their sexual encounter and said that they were working to keep her testimony in line with what the judge had said. Now, the judge, I don't believe has yet ruled on this. They've been arguing pretty, going back and forth pretty aggressively over this issue. One other issue that Trumps lawyer had initially flag he wanted to bring up. Was that they didn't want Karen McDougal to testify. Now, they said that they'd been informed by the prosecutors that shell would not be taking the stand, so she will not be appearing this case. And as this is winding down, there's really only one have significant witness left and that is Michael Cohen. But prosecutors have not yet said when they will call him, Jake.",

I suppose that's true at least as far as anybody who's familiar with Stormy Daniels book or her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel knows, but still what came out was, I think it's -- I mean, I can understand the argument that it was prejudicial because she certainly seem to be suggesting that she didn't want it to happen even if it was -- even if it was not coerced.",
