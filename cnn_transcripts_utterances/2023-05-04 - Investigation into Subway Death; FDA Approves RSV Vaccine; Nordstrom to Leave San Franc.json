The suspected gunman in a mass shooting at an Atlanta medical center is expected in court today for his first court appearance. Twenty-four-year-old Deion Patterson was arrested last night after a nearly eight-hour manhunt that he led police on. He's been charged with murder and aggravated assault for allegedly killing a CDC employee and injuring four others in the shooting. We're also tracking this, Russia is now accusing the United States of being behind the alleged drone attack on the Kremlin. A Kremlin spokesperson has claimed, without evidence, that the Ukrainian government is implementing decisions made in Washington as it relates to this alleged drone attack. The last -- just the last hour, John Kirby, from the White House, called that a ludicrous claim and a lie. John.",

The incident was caught on video. By the time police arrived, 30-year-old Jordan Neely was already unconscious. His death has been ruled a homicide. Now, no charges or arrests have yet been announced. CNN's Omar Jimenez is at the subway station where the victim was taken off the train. Omar, why don't you walk us through what happened.",

And this happened earlier this week where witnesses say this man, Jordan Neely, walked on to the subway car acting erratically, as it was described, and talking about how he was tired about not having enough food and that he was fed up, hungry, tired of having nothing. And then he took off his coat, threw it on the ground, according to this witness, and some passengers seemed to at least get uncomfortable. But that's when another man, another passenger, came up from behind and just - and started putting this man, Jordan Neely, into a chokehold. Now, that's where some of that video picks up that's been circulating, in the middle of that chokehold. Though I should mention, we don't exactly know what happened leading up to it. We haven't been able to confirm that. But - and we haven't been able to confirm how long this man was in the chokehold itself. But, bottom line, this was something that he did not end up waking up from as the medical examiner said that he died later that afternoon due to compression of the neck. And, of course, that is where the investigation is for now as the district attorney's office says they are looking into this situation.",

Take a listen to some of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: This is what highlights what I've been saying throughout my administration. People who are dealing with mental health illness should get the help they need and not live on a train. And I'm going to continue to push on that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That, of course, the details of what exactly led up to this are still being confirmed, are still bit by bit coming out, but many people feel that no matter what happened he shouldn't have lost his life.

So, yes, it's absolutely about crime. In the beginning of this year, homicides are up 20 percent compared to last year. You mentioned the theft, up 23 percent over the course of the pandemic.But there are other factors. Rising rent is a big factor. You also have people working from home. So, there's not as much foot traffic in the area. And you also have just consumer buying habits changing. A lot of us are buying things online and not in person. But Nordstrom, not alone in this. You have Whole Foods, Office Depot, CB2 (ph), Anthropology, all leaving town. And Nordstrom, for their part, though, says that they're going to try to find jobs for all the employees that are working in those two downtown locations because those two downtown locations make up 300,000 square feet.
