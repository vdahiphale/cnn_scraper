Donald Trump, former president and current candidate for president in 2024, is facing, we are told, more than 30 counts related specifically to business fraud. If convicted, Trump could be sentenced to a maximum of four years in prison, though no legal experts believe that's likely.All of this connected to his alleged role in a hush money payments scheme and cover-up involving the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Overnight, his attorney, Joe Tacopina, says the former president is, quote, ready to fight.

What will happen first is that the indictment will be unsealed. That will be our first chance to see what specific charges he is facing and what kinds of evidence the DA's office has included in that indictment. He will then be -- you know, this is a normal process. Of course, he is not a normal person. So, there is likely to be enhanced security. We'll have the Secret Service involved. They may try to expedite this process. But there's only so much they can expedite. He will have his mug shot taken. He will be fingerprinted. They will read him his rights. And then he will appear before a judge. The judge there will explain to him what the charges are that he's facing and he will ask the former president enter a plea. As you said, his attorneys are saying he's going to fight this. So we expect him to plead not guilty. Big question here will be, will he be handcuffed? One of his attorneys saying this morning on another program that he did not think that he would, but that could be up to the discretion of the district attorney's office. And then because this is a non-violent crime, Trump will be released without bail. It's a standard thing in New York. I mean we are expecting, according to our sources, that there will be more than 30 counts in this indictment. And sources say that they have been exploring looking at and charging the former president with falsifying business records. That can be a misdemeanor. It can also be a felony if these business records were falsified to commit or conceal another crime. All these details will be made public on Tuesday when the indictment will be unsealed. We're told by sources that we do not expect to see these charges before then. Although, of course, with this, everything is fluid. Jess. Jim.",

That was to Karen McDougal. She's was a former Playboy model who alleged that she had an affair with Trump decades earlier. That was one of these catch and kill deals that was executed by \"The National Inquirer.\" And as we know, on Monday, David Pecker, the former publisher, was back in before the grand jury.Now, we're also told, according to sources, that there was another witness that appeared briefly yesterday before the grand jury took up that vote. It's unclear who that witness is.

We understand that sources are telling CNN that they were -- his team was caught off guard by the timing of this. Of course, they had been bracing for this, but we're expecting this to happen later on, like many people were. And so that timing was what caught people off guard.

So far nothing significant in the protest world, but their eyes are going to be on Tuesday, which is the day they consider a catalyst here.Today what they're doing is really working on the mechanics of how the wheels of justice will actually turn here. A meeting this afternoon with the district attorney's investigators, the New York state court officers, those are the people in charge of courthouse security, the NYPD and the U.S. Secret Service literally on expecting Donald Trump to arrive here late Tuesday or early Monday, and how to do that move to the courthouse and then a walkthrough in the courthouse, which is what door will they bring him in? How will he be taken in, you know, hallways to the district attorney's office to be booked in there detective squad and then to an arraignment court? Will that be done in back hallways that are not accessible to the press and the public or through public areas? Who will handle the magnetometers. A lot of logistics there. And -- and that's really kind of them moving at the pace. You know, there's been reporting that they wanted Donald Trump to surrender today based on yesterday's indictment, which I think was more the district attorney's office using a strategy, which is to send the signal that they don't want this stretching out into a couple of weeks.

We're live in Moscow with the latest on his case. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:23:58] DEAN: This morning, former President Donald Trump getting some support from his former vice president and potential 2024 rival. Mike Pence telling us, although he thinks no president is above the law, the charges against Trump are targeted and unjustified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: I think the unprecedented indictment of a former president of the United States on a campaign finance issue is an outrage. When you have an attorney general in New York, and a Manhattan DA, that targeted one particular American in their campaigns, I think that offends the notion of the overwhelming majority of the American people who believe in fairness, who believe in equal treatment before the law.

And, look, I am hardly here to defend Donald Trump and the merits of this case, but when you step back and look at the overall narrative of what Donald Trump has been saying and telling Republicans that the judicial system is unfair, and there is an unequal system of justice for political adversaries, this plays right into what Donald Trump is saying, and what a lot of his supporters believe.And, look, no one would rather Donald Trump get off of the political stage sooner than myself, but this is not the way to do it. Let the voters decide this. And when you have DA Bragg campaigning and vowing that he is going to take down Donald Trump, this right here, what we're seeing here, just plays into what many people are saying is the weaponization of the legal system to attack a political adversary and really to advice a political agenda.
