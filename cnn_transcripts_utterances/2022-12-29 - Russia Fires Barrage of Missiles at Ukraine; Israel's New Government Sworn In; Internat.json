      "sentences": "And a warm welcome to everyone on the show, I am Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, a barrage ofRussian missiles in Kyiv and right across Ukraine, Russia seems to be targeting any energy infrastructure to make this holiday week even more difficult for Ukrainians. Then, Israel has a new government and Benjamin Netanyahu is sworn in yet again. And rescuers in Cambodia searching for survivors after a huge fire engulfed a casino and hotel. Details of the horror just emerging. And we are seeing defiance and of course anger in Ukraine today in the face of one of the largest Russian attacks on the country since the start of the war, and that is definitely saying something. Ukraine's military says Russia fired at least 69 missiles on Thursday, most of which were in fact intercepted, but the rest hit energy infrastructure and civilian targets. Now, I want to have you look at these homes in Zaporizhzhia, that's the kind of damage that was inflicted. At least, three people were killed and seven wounded right across the country, and the missile assault knocked power out in several regions with Lviv, Kyiv and Odessa particularly hard hit. Now, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry tweeted, \"Russia dreams Ukrainians will celebrate the new year in darkness and cold, but they cannot defeat the Ukrainian people.\" Our Ben Wedeman has this report now from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  According to the mayor of Kyiv, 16 missiles were fired in the direction of the capital, all of them successfully intercepted. But the problem is, even when these interceptions take place, debris falls to the ground. Here, at this location, you're seeing massive disruption to clear up crews are already here. Police tell us that a 14-year-old girl was injured at this location, her mother also injured, her mother currently in surgery. Another man nearby was also hurt. Now, this does seem to be one of the largest attacks by the Russians using missiles and drones according to the Ukrainian government. More than 120 missiles and drones were fired today in across the country at various cities. Here in Kyiv, 40 percent of the power is out at the moment. The mayor has called upon people to charge their phones, stock up on water because they don't know when the electricity will be restored in the city of Lviv, in the western part of the country, 90 percent of the electricity has been knocked out. In Kharkiv, in the east, we understand that four missiles did successfully hit energy infrastructure, and it does appear that energy infrastructure was the target of this massive Russian strike. It appears the Russians want to leave this country cold and in the dark just before new year. Now, according to the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, in addition to the drones, 69 of the missiles fired, 54 of them were successfully intercepted. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

First and foremost, our condolences of course, to thefamily, they have been up most in our thoughts and prayers recently, the man himself, as well, Pele, an icon of the sport, at the age of 82. Such a courageous life story as well, from the moment he had that surgery for colon cancer, in and out of hospitals over the last couple of years since then. But just courageous and determined to -- a thought really, a joy of life as well, you think back to what he achieved as a teenager coming from a very humble background, growing up close to the Sao Paulo area, playing when he started as a teen, playing with a football made of socks. Just imagine that. Goalposts with boots. Not even boots to put on their feet at times with the youth team that he was actually in. But what a story, what an icon of the sport, he would go on to win the World Cup, the first World Cup, the first of three, Paula, the only player ever to win three World Cups. The first in 1958, when he was still a teenager, 17 years of age. Just Imagine that, scoring a hat-trick in the semifinal that year at Sweden '58. Then in the final itself, scoring two more goals. His life would change after that moment, as a raw teenager. He would win another one in 1962 as well as Brazil celebrated back-to-back titles. They missed out on England in 1966, but back in Mexico in 1970. He scores again in the final, and Brazil win their third World Cup, quite extraordinary. He embodied the joy of game itself, the joy of life, the beautiful game, as he referred to it, really football's first global superstar when you think about it, Paula. He really set the way. He set the trend moving forward. And he has just had such an impact on the sport. I remember actually meeting him one time, it was back in the buildup to the Germany 2006 World Cup, he was so generous with his time, he was so humble, the humility, just exuded around him, and it was an absolute pleasure to speak with him, even just for a few minutes. I got some time with him then and I treasured that for a long time to come. He is going to be solely missed. Generations of grownups loving him, adoring him, this is desperately sad news, Paula, for the world of football and beyond.",

Patrick, stay with us, but right now, I want to go to senior sports analyst, Darren Lewis, who is with us as well. And I want to say, Darren, that this is of course, sad and it's heartbreaking, but it's also a celebration of a sports icon. And everything that he gave not just to the game, but to his own country, Brazil and to the world. DARREN LEWIS, SPORTS ANALYST (via telephone):  Yes, Paula, I'm really glad you said that, thanks for having me on. Because you are absolutely right, he isn't just a football legend, he is a sporting icon. And I would suggest every sporting outlet over the next 24 hours and coming days will pay tribute to the ultimate showman. The man who brought a smile to faces. A man who signed a football for the U.S. President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1973. Such was his reach! And a man who, when you think about your favorite players right now, the Lionel Messis, the Kylian Mbappes, and even before them, the likes of the legendary Maradona. Everything that they did, everything they thrilled us with, Pele did it before them. But as Patrick was just saying, it wasn't just the fact that he won the World Cup as a boy, a teenager, a 17-year-old. It wasn't just the fact that he lifted it three times. It wasn't just the fact that he scored over -- what was 750 goals that were recorded in over 831 games. It was the fact that he used the power of his platform for good, to speak on behalf of people who didn't have a voice. He realized the power that he had, and he used it so effectively that he touched hearts and minds around the world. And that is a big part of the reason why this will indeed be a celebration of his life. Listen, Paula and all of our viewers know he had been in poor health for some time. His family had been keeping us abreast of developments. But he would want us to smile. He was always about bringing joy to hearts and to nations around the world. And that is why he does have that 100 percent name recognition. Pele is the ultimate footballer, the ultimate showman. The guy who did it before your favorite player did. It's a very sad day, but it's a day to celebrate, as you say a sporting icon.",

There is actuallya goal that he scored, and I think it was March 1961, they call it gol de placa, goal worthy of a plaque. He scored against Fluminense, a Brazilian football club at the Maracana Stadium. He picked up the ball on the edge of his own penalty area. He ran the length of the field. He dodged opposition players and then he beat the goalkeeper. There was a plaque afterwards, commissioned with the dedication to the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracana. And he scored lots of goals like that. Had there been Twitter, YouTube, the social media outlets to be able to really give his genius justice, we would have a better understanding of just how brilliant he was. And it's the reason why his genius transcended generations. Patrick, earlier, was talking about the many players of this current generation who saw fit to pay tribute to Pele during the last World Cup, just gone. They know, they understand. They were brought up on his mysticism. On his genius. On his ability to enchant audiences. Whether you have a passing interest in football or whether you know as you were saying, the intricacies -- the intricacies of the game. Pele was an icon. And I would suggest in the coming hours and days, you won't just get tributes from footballers, you won't just get tributes from people at the very top of football ministration, you'll get it from sports all around the world. You'll get it from celebrities. He was -- and it's important to point this out as well. He was the first black global superstar in sport. He was somebody who transcended so many difficulties as a young man. I remember when watching a documentary about him, and in one of the World Cups he played in, he was kicked so badly because there was no protection from referees for footballers at the time. And older men would really round on him because they were frustrated by their inability to be able to keep tabs with him. And at one point, he said I don't want to play in the World Cup anymore, but he was persuaded, of course, to come back. And my goodness, what an impact he went on to make. And this is the reason why there will be, clearly, a sadness at his passing. But also, a real celebration, and a chance to pay tribute to a guy, the likes of which -- even allowing for the likes of Maradona and Mbappe and Messi. We will not see the likes of Pele ever again.",

And you can see that this region, for this region, this moment will be a historic moment. We, of course, have been very -- looking very closely at the hospital in Sao Paulo, the other time staying in hospital in Sao Paulo where Pele was hospitalized since November 29. And in the weeks coming in and looking for updates, I really held a similar situation to that of when the Pope John Paul II died. I was a young child in Italy back then, and it was just these people, expectations, a national expectation about these historic moment to happen and to celebrate the life of a great icon of the 20th century.

A figure that can only be compared to Muhammad Ali or some of the greatest, really, icons. Just calling him just a sports figure is probably diminutive. And so, yes, there is the debate of who is the greatest of all time, probably some of my friends in Argentina will make a case for Lionel Messi after their greatest triumph so far just a few weeks ago in Qatar.

It is still very early days to say that democracy won. Let's wait and see.

These are going to be very careful days, careful steps, careful symbolism the next few days. How do you think the government-elect of Lula will start to handle that? He is supposed to be sworn in at the first of the year of 2023. This is going to be a huge outpouring right for Pele in the country.",

Also at the same time the incapacity of theextreme right-wing elements to be, at least, recognizing that defeat has happened. So it is a very crucial moment in the history of Brazil. It is a coincidence, obviously. But it's one that will deal with a lot of emotions and a lot of political skills. You have Lula being sworn in on the 1st of January in a situation that, obviously, as you said, the current government either refuses or has hesitated to be, at the moment of the transition of power. It is a country divided; it is a country a lot to deal with in 2023. And now with the situation of this emotional impact of Pele's death. As I said, I hope -- and this is a personal hook of mine -- that Pele's capacity to dialogue, Pele's capacity to establish bridges with so many cultures in the world will help the country to deal with its own current situation.",
