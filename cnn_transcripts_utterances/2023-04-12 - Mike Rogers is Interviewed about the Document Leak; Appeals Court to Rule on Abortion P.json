The documents, some of which U.S. officials say are authentic, expose the extent of the U.S.' eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. The documents also reveal the degree to which the U.S. has penetrated the Russian ministry of defense, and they appear to divulge key weaknesses in Ukraine's defense. Officials are saying that it could take months to complete -- to complete their investigations, but the intel community will do everything in its power to get to the bottom of what happened.So, joining us now is a former House Intelligence chairman. Mike Rogers. Good morning, Chairman. Thank you so much. Listen, there's so much, you know, to talk about here as to how this happened, you know, is there too much access to classified documents. But your key concern here is the damage to our allies. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. But that is your key concern. MIKE ROGERS (R), FORMER CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Yes. Good morning, all. And, good morning, Don. Yes, absolutely. And part of that reason is because this is relatively recent information about an ongoing conflict. It wasn't older information that is embarrassing but you can get over. This is in real time. And it's causing problems for our allies today. You know, there were some really sensitive leaks about, you know, different activities happening in and around Ukraine. That hurts our allies. And it does hurt our credibility a little bit. They - they're going to start asking about what they share and how they share it. And this happened after WikiLeaks, but this is going to happen again. And it's going to take a real effort by the administration to go and try to patch this thing up.",

And so they're always worried about this nother -- another wave of leaks. And, you know, the way it was -- it was leaked -- we saw in years past terrorist organizations use gaming chat rooms to communicate because they were, again, trying to get around U.S. intelligence and allied intelligence, trying to figure out what they were doing. And it was very clever. And so this is really in that same vein. So this is -- some people would look at it and say, that wasn't very sophisticated. I would look at it and say, that's pretty sophisticated. They have -- they're trying to move these documents in a way that would kind of get around intelligence services collecting on them and seeing this information to move it along.So, more information is likely there. I know that's what they're worried about in the Pentagon today when they get up this morning. And trying to tighten this noose as fast as you can without stopping operations because, you know, they're in the middle of supporting a nation that's trying to defend itself against Russia. That's a -- that's a lot of moving parts. And so you've got to keep those parts moving and you've got to try to find out who -- and I'm going to guess they're compromised in some way. I don't think this is ideological given the information that they leaked. This is somebody that was probably compromised by an intelligence service and/or volunteered for an intelligence service -- foreign intelligence service to give this kind of information.",

As you said, the other side has until noon. The Department of Justice has asked that the Fifth Circuit actually decide this by Thursday so that if it denies a temporary stay on this it can go to the Supreme Court and get the Supreme Court to intervene so that women have access to the drug at this point. One way or another, Kaitlan, this case will eventually be before the Supreme Court, and it will be a test of just how far they will go to lift the ability of women to get abortions medication nationwide after their original decision, rolling back the constitutional right to abortion last summer, Kaitlan.",
