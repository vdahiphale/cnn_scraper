We are live near the front lines.Plus, the Gilgo Beach serial killings. The police commissioner in charge of the case is OUTFRONT as we learn more about evidence taken from the suspect's home, including a doll in a glass case. Does the chief believe there may be additional victims? And the Chinese foreign minister vanishes. The official, also close adviser of Xi's, hasn't been seen in weeks. The government says they don't have any information on him. So what happened? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening on this Monday. I'm Erica Hill, in tonight for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Ukraine bracing for retaliation. Vladimir Putin vowing revenge following a major drone strike by Ukraine on a strategically vital supply route for the Russian military. Ukraine using naval drones to successfully target the Kersh Bridge. Now, the map you can see here why this is so important. You can see how that bridge would link mainland Russia with occupied Crimea. It's also the longest bridge in Europe. Putin quick to speak out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Another terrorist attack was perpetrated overnight on the bridge. There will be a definite response from Russia.

A massive explosion severely damaged the Kerch Bridge back in October. In that event, it took four months before it was fully reopened. The 12-mile bridge isn't just a supply route, though. This is really a point of pride for Putin. For Ukrainians, however, it is a hated symbol of Russian occupation.

Will he hit cities like Alex Marquardt is nearby, the city of Odesa, which has had no play so far in this conflict or the city of Lviv or several other cities that are mostly places where Ukrainian civilians are harbored? Probably. You're going to see him continue to strike places where Mr. Putin doesn't believe Ukrainian forces have air defense.

But I would disagree that the platform, the policy document that we released here, the common sense is about what the majority of the American people want. And I think the congressman is right. Right now, Trump represents the base of the Republican Party and President Biden represents the base of the Democratic Party. The question is with those two bases, where are the majority of Americans? And all polling shows that most of Americans don't want to repeat of 2020. That's when No Labels comes in. We haven't decided yet to run a candidate. We are getting ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

I don't think so. I think if there's a reasonable argument on the defendant's side to say we're not ready to go to trial within four or five months from now, early December, we need more time, it's complex, it involves classified materials. And there are many conditions placed on when they can even access the classified materials in a specific facility in Miami that they have to go to, and they can't even discuss the matter of those classified materials outside of the facility.
