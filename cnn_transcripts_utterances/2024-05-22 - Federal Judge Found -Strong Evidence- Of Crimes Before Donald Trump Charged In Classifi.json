And they want her to toss them out of court, to dismiss the case. This is one of those days that it's unclear whether there really needed to be a hearing on this. What the argument is, that Walt Nauta is making is that he's saying he was selectively and vindictively prosecuted, that the Justice Department retaliated against him by charging him because he didn't want to keep talking to them after he talked to them a couple times, and they believe they caught him in a lie. The Justice Department says, that's why we charge people if you lie to us. So, that's what happened this morning. That was the argument. They're going to have some more arguments this afternoon. Judge Aileen Cannon has to work through all of these motions, whether by having hearings or just looking at the court papers, and ruling one way or another if this thing goes on to trial.",

SCHOENpresented before a grand jury in D.C., or a case in Florida in the first place. Secondly, you know, there's an antipathy toward Judge Howell. Judge Howell wouldn't like the way Donald Trump got out of bed in the morning. She's very, very, very strongly against Donald Trump. That's part of it. But I think an overriding issue in this case is whether she's right, and Katelyn Polantz was exactly right. We've been waiting for this opinion because Judge Howell made a remarkable finding, she found that Evan Corcoran's -- all of Evan Corcoran's notes, personal notes, should be turned over to the government. And they were and presented to the grand jury based on her finding that the attorney-client privilege is pierced by the crime fraud exception that she found that these were -- you know, notes were relevant to the commission of a crime. I think she handled it poorly because she had them turned over in wholesale fashion without Evan Corcoran ever having a chance to see any editing that was done and that sort of thing.

I think at a minimum, you have to say that it's relevant to the state of mind of President Trump because the statute -- the relevant statute here 793 A requires a state of mind that he knew and believed he was unauthorized to have the documents and had certain specific purposes in mind for them.

That's where they had to triage patients because the hospital was so damaged. They were actually taking patients out of the hospital and bringing them to the parking lot of a lumberyard here in Greenfield because the hospital parts of it, at least, were inoperable.
