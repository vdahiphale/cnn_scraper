CNN's Kristie Lu Stout following this for us from Hong Kong. And King was facing assault charges in South Korea. He was set to be discharged from the Army.

And because of that silence, concern is growing.We heard from the U.S. Army secretary. She made her first public comments about the case and she said that the U.S. has mobilized efforts to contact North Korea, including going through U.N. communications channels, but North Korea has yet to respond. She also cited the case of Otto Warmbier. He was the American college student who was arrested in North Korea in 2016. He died in 2017 shortly after being released by North Korea. And regarding Travis King, this is what we heard from the U.S. Army secretary. Let's bring up her statement. This is Christine Wormuth who said, quote, \"I worry about how they may treat him. So we want to get him back.\" She also said that King's motive is unclear but he, quote, \"absolutely would have faced consequences for misconduct if he returned to the U.S. as planned.\" Now we also heard from the Pentagon. The Pentagon would not say if it believed Travis King was alive. And a spokesperson said that an investigation will be starting and it will be looking partly at where King was between the time he left the airport and when he went on that tour when he crossed into North Korea. The spokesperson also said that King was not escorted onto his flight because he wasn't in custody when he was at the airport. His escorts weren't allowed to go beyond airport security. Also said that there was no inclination that King planned his crossing with the North Koreans. The Pentagon, as you mentioned, Christine, now describes his official status as AWOL or Absent Without Leave. Back to you.",

Investors reacting to inflation in Japan outpacing U.S. inflation for the first time in eight years. European markets are also mixed at this hour.

Mortgage rates fell slightly. The 30-year fixed now 6.78 percent. That's the biggest one-week drop since March. On inflation watch, gas prices rose a penny overnight to $3.59.
