I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy makes a surprise appearance at a major security conference in Singapore, asking for support at an upcoming peace summit. Israel's prime minister appears to contradict a ceasefire proposal that U.S. President Joe Biden wants leaders to get behind. Why Benjamin Netanyahu says the war with Hamas can't end yet. And voting is set to begin in Mexico's presidential election, where a woman is expected to lead that nation for the very first time. With his country facing a major new Russian offensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is courting international support from new areas. He's attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, a meeting of Asia- Pacific defense ministers in Singapore and we are currently looking at live pictures of President Zelenskyy addressing the media. Zelenskyy is trying to keep the world's attention on the war and Ukraine's need for outside help. Just moments ago, as I say, he held a press conference -- he is holding a press conference right now, and took questions from reporters. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was the architect of ensuring that they got into government that they were a part of this coalition. He relies on them. And, yes, to a degree, they rely on him. But I think if push comes to shove, most people would say that Netanyahu perhaps is more in need of their support than vice versa. They would live to fight another day, whereas Netanyahu, if elections were called, would perhaps lose the opportunity to try to change his legacy if you like, from being one of the prime minister that was at the wheel when the terrorist attacks of October the 7th took place, rather than being the one that can, in his eyes, hopefully, at some point, claim victory, being the prime minister remembered for winning this war against Hamas.

Great to see you. Why has this tourist tax in Venice failed miserably, as some locals are claiming? JAN VAN DER BORG, PROFESSOR OF TOURISM ECONOMICS, K.U. LEUVEN:  Well, I think there's one very important motive for that. And it's that there's so many exemptions on paying the tax, that most of the people that actually should have been paying the tax are not paying it and therefore do not feel any incentive not to come to Venice. And that means that the taxes failure both from the tourism management perspective. So, we still see the influx of especially day trippers as if it was 2019. Plus, because of the complexity of this scheme of exemptions, there're so many people that have to enforce the tax and the costs are so high for that, that the city is losing money on its own fiscal instrument, and that is a paradox. Because what we would have liked to see is that these day trippers would have been contributing to the maintenance of the city, and that is not the case at the moment. COREN:  This $5 or 5 euros entry fee, just over $5, it hasn't, as you say, reduced the number of tourists, and I believe that this weekend they have now restricted the size of tour groups to 25. Is the aim of the tax to reduce and to deter tourism?",

It's like a sort of an extra price of tax, let's say, on cigarettes or whatever to displace people that are staying close to Venice not to come to Venice, just improvising the trip to Venice, but incentivate on the other hand, sort of people sleeping in Venice, spending more money therefore, and also behaving in a sort of good manner with respect to the interests of the local population, the local firms that still are working and doing stuff in Venice.Now, this incentive is not working at all. And that is a very big problem because it's one of the main objectives of the tax in the first place.",

But if they put it in practice, if they leave it and make it a blanket tax, I understand the locals are concerned about the housing situation, that there's more beds for visitors than there are for residents. So, couldn't that money be used to address local concerns?",

I would if you raise enough money, so if you make the balance between the cost, the collective cost of tourism, the collective benefits of tourism, much more balanced than, of course, the money that you're raising with such a sort of a contribution asked by different kind of visitors can be used, for example, to strengthen social housing policies or to subsidize some kind of local activities that are still very important for the place to remain sort of a place with an aninize (ph), we say it in Italian, with a soul. And that soul is about to disappear, which is not only for the Venetians, a sorry thing, but also in the end, I think, for tourism industry at large.",
