The White House says the group will send a united positive signal on Ukraine's path to membership but declined to provide a timetable. An official says Mr. Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday at the summit. While on the eve of the key meeting, a rapid reversal by Turkey on Sweden's bid to join NATO, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced Turkey has now dropped objections to Sweden becoming a member after standing in the way for more than a year. Stockholm in turn appears to be supporting Turkish membership in the European Union, according to Turkey's state-run news agency. While Sweden's defense minister says Turkey's decision to endorse the country will strengthen the security of both Sweden and NATO. A similar sentiment echoed by the head of the military alliance.

He said it's time to change the paradigm. So I think these divisions are something that NATO is going to have to work through over the course of this summit. But this really matters to Ukraine. They are bringing the weight of their suffering essentially over the last 16 months. The summit is essentially a touchstone for that country. And I want to play you a really interesting exchange.

So what you're looking at are conversations over three regional plans within NATO to bolster those defense capabilities. And they cover pretty much everything, naval, air, space, cyber, everything.The idea is that they will bolster, remember here we are on the eastern flank of NATO that has seen a substantial increase in the capabilities of the alliance on its eastern flank. The idea is that across the alliance, if these plans are approved, you will have 300,000 men and women under NATO command at a fairly high level of readiness in order to be able to send the signal that Jens Stoltenberg had made explicit as he kicked off this summit, that NATO stands united, and that Russian aggression will not pay. It is always being framed in reference to Ukraine, but it is, of course, much more widely and profoundly, Leila, about NATO itself, regardless of what countries continue to join and where the accession plans of various aspiring countries are, of how NATO continues to build on that solidity, that unity that was found in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in order to bolster its own defense capabilities, Laila.",

The rain began at the start of the month and it has triggered landslides and caused rivers to overflow.A dangerous situation in the northeastern United States after days of intense rain and flash flood emergencies. Not long ago, the U.S. president approved a state of emergency declaration for Vermont. On more than 50 swift water rescues were carried out there as of Monday night local time. And more than 9 million people are under flood alerts across the region. In New York, state troopers helped rescue stranded drivers trapped by heavy flooding on Sunday. They guided them to safety as the group holding hands after they were plucked from their submerged cars. This was in Orange County, New York, where the governor declared a state of emergency. And a new dangerous, long-lasting heat wave in the United States could set dozens of heat records even in notoriously hot places. The heat is hitting South Texas, South Florida, and the Southwest the hardest now and through the work week. By the weekend, the hottest temperatures will arrive in the Southwest, making brutally hot cities like Phoenix even hotter. And across the Atlantic, nearly 62,000 people died from heat-related causes in Europe last year during its hottest summer on record on this. According to a new study, Italy had the most deaths, around 18,000, followed by Spain and Germany. Researchers also found that the extreme heat harmed women and the elderly more than others. And experts say climate change these kinds of extreme weather events. Here's Michael Mann, a climate scientist from the University of Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL E. MANN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: You know, we have to step back. When we talk about the impact that climate change is having on these events, sure, you know, weather is weather, it's going to happen. Rainfall, flooding events are gonna happen. What climate change is doing, it's supercharging them. So when you get one of those weather systems that's producing large amounts of rainfall, you get more rainfall. Every degree Fahrenheit of warming of the atmosphere puts another several percent of moisture in the atmosphere. So there is the potential for larger amounts of rainfall. That's one of the ingredients that climate change is providing. But there's another one as well. It's a little more subtle, and it's really more at the forefront of current research. But the pattern of warming, where we see the Arctic warming faster than, say, the lower 48, that reduces the temperature difference from the equator to the pole slows down the jet stream and under certain conditions the jet stream basically stalls and those weather patterns remain in place. Those high and low pressure centers remain in place. So you get rained on the same location day after day or the ground gets baked by the sun day after day, heat, drought, wildfires out west, epic rainfall events back east. So climate change is impacting that as well. And we're seeing more of these sort of stuck, wavy jet stream patterns that are associated with these very persistent weather extremes, whether it's the heat drought, the wildfire or the flooding events.

It looks a little bit different. It's a little bit watered down and it's being done in a very slow piecemeal fashion. But the legislation that was brought to its first vote on Monday night would strip this Israeli Supreme Court's ability of being able to declare a government action as being unreasonable. They have rather broad powers right now to say that even if a government action didn't necessarily break any laws, that it is unreasonable and cannot stand. And this legislation would attempt to strip that away. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has watered down other aspects of the judicial overhaul, namely the ability of the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. Those have been taken off the table. But the other elements are still there. And the protesters and the opposition essentially are saying, we don't believe when the government says that this will be a softer version of this judicial overhaul, and they are still taking to the streets. They've actually never gone off the streets even while there were compromise negotiations trying to take place at the Israeli president's residence even while this legislation was technically frozen in place. Israeli protesters were still taking to the street on a regular basis, and on Monday evening They were on the floor of the Israeli Parliament. It's trying to stage some sort of sit-in. They were forcibly removed by Parliament security, and then on Tuesday is this day of disruption from the morning until the evening Israeli protesters saying they're going to essentially try to disrupt daily life in Israel, including at the airport, at Ben Gurion Airport just outside of Tel Aviv, as well as at important embassy buildings throughout the country from different countries and along the really the heart of Tel Aviv, downtown Tel Aviv and the main highway there. We've seen these types of massive protests in the past and the goal of these protesters is to try to once again encourage important figures such as the defense minister, such as other ministers who may be supporting their efforts to come out once again against this judicial overhaul, even this piecemeal legislation, the slow pace that they plan to take it and to come out against it. Because for these protesters, the only way that they will really come off the streets is if this judicial overhaul is completely off the table. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Concert goers throwing things at the artists they've paid to see perform on stage. The biggest stars in the world are not immune to this very bad behavior. Harry Styles got hit in the eye last weekend during a show in Vienna, and in New York you can see someone hurled a phone at Bebe Rexha that hit her in the face and resulted in stitches.

What's behind this and what are some of the possible explanations for fans just misbehaving in this way? JOHN DRURY, PROF. OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX: Well people have been talking about changes in audience behavior since events reopened in 2021 and it's not just live music events. People have been saying the same thing about sports, about theater, about live comedy, and they've been describing fans throwing items on stage but also other apparently new behaviors such as rudeness, aggression, people pushing, trying to get in and so on. When you speak to fans themselves you get a much more mixed picture of this. I mean it's quite clear from people within the industry, so people who work in the music industry say this has been a trend for two years. Fans themselves sometimes describe not noticing any audience changes in audience behavior or they say that it was slightly different when they reopened in 2021 and now it's gone back to normal.

I mean, it's noticeable that the events you talked about and the events that have been in the news involve very famous stars where there might be an element of people trying to raise their own social media profile.

The other thing I'd suggest is, I mean, one factor that everybody seems to agree is relevant is that the industry lost a lot of skilled people when live events closed down in 2020. Those skilled people didn't come back. I'm talking about staff, security people who have the diplomatic skills to defuse situations and deal with people and spot trouble.

MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a very good force. It was one of the strongest partners we had when I was commander in Europe close to a decade ago. Their army is about 24,000. They have a reserve of about 34,000. They have a very good air force of about 120 Gripen aircrafts, over 300 ships in their Navy. They have a great capability of -- of patrolling and monitoring the northern oceans that lead in and out of northern Russia. It's a good force, well-led, very operationally savvy. But truthfully, the fact that they have stayed independent throughout the history of NATO and then suddenly they want to become members and they are now joining or they will be joining, I'm sure, it just shows how Mr. Putin's political objectives of further dividing NATO, have really fallen apart along with his other military and political objectives.
