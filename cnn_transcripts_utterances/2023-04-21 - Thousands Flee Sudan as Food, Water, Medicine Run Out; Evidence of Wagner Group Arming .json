Many have been trapped indoors without electricity since the fighting erupted almost a week ago. No word from the head of Sudan's army if his forces will agree to the temporary truce. Two other ceasefires earlier this week collapsed within hours. The World Health Organization believes 330 -- 330 people have been killed. But with dead bodies left in the streets, the actual number of those who have been killed so far is certain to be much higher.

She could still hear the explosions, even though she was so far away from the actual center of the capital. We'll move on now to a CNN exclusive. Russian mercenaries accused of war crimes in Ukraine now appear to be involved in the conflict in Sudan. Senior international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir reports on the violent group's efforts to help the paramilitary forces. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Sudanese and the Libyan army celebrated a successful joint operation Wednesday, April 19, near the remote desert border between Libya and Sudan. Having captured the Chevrolet Garrison belonging to the rival Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF. But why is this military base so important, given how far it is from the existential fight in Sudan's capital, Khartoum? Because CNN can reveal that the fight in Khartoum is being influenced by what was happening at that garrison, a Russian resupply campaign backed by a key regional players aimed at turning the tide in Sudan's war in favor of the RSF, who have been a key recipient of Russian training and military aid. In collaboration with all eyes on Wagner, a research group focusing on Russian proxy Wagner, CNN investigated the group's current presence in Libya. You can see here on April 16, one day after the fighting began in Khartoum, a Russian Iluyshin-76 transport plane at the Al Jufra base in Libya, previously identified by American intelligence as a Wagner base. Three days later, this same plane is spotted by flight tracker aviation expert Gourgeon (ph) coming back from the Russian airbase in Latakia, Syria before returning to the Libyan air base in Khadim. Images of that same plane began circulating online April 17, heading in the direction of Sudan. Sudanese and regional sources tell CNN that weaponry was air-dropped to the RSF within that time frame, April 15 to April 18, to the Chevrolet Garrison during a period of fierce fighting, boosting the RSF. The Al-Khadim and Al Jufra bases where the Wagner planes departed from in Libya are under the control of field marshal Khalifa Haftar, who commands territory in the East of Libya. Haftar and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a.k.a. Hemetti, having in common strategic alliances, one with Wagner, who Haftar is hosting in his territory in Libya and whom a previous CNN investigation exposed as working with Hemetti to extract Sudanese gold.",

CNN has been unable to independently verify the report, but it comes after state security forces said it was targeting terrorists with a helicopter gunships and fighter jets, raining fire down on the same village just a week ago. CNN's Anna Coren has the story. We want to warn you, though. The report contains details and images which viewers will find extremely disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On this dusty mound near a grove of banana trees, villages don't know where to walk. Everywhere they turn is another dismembered body. Legs, arms, severed heads, human flesh littering the earth. \"We can't recognize who they are,\" says the man filming this video. \"There are so many.\" Hundreds of people had gathered for a community celebration last Tuesday in Pazigyi, part of a self-governed district in Sagaing state, Northern Myanmar. They'd come for breakfast on the eve of Tunjong (ph), a Buddhist new year festival. Families, the elderly, and dozens and dozens of children. \"(EXPLETIVE DELETED),\" cries this man. \"What did these kids do wrong?\" At 7:45 a.m., a military jet dropped a bomb on the building where they'd gathered, according to witnesses. Minutes later, an MI-35 attack helicopter mowed down survivors and continued to circle for the next 15 minutes, firing at anyone who moved. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We heard a boom. I hit the ground, and there was a huge cloud of smoke. I got up and realized my daughter was missing. COREN (voice-over):  As the wounded screamed for help, this man searched among the dead and injured for his 3-year-old daughter and his parents. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It was a killing field. There were people scattered everywhere. A woman with burst intestines died in front of me. I was shaking. Why would they kill their own civilians? COREN (voice-over):  And then, after several hours, he found them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  My father was cut in half from the waist. My mother's body unrecognizable. My daughter was headless. COREN (voice-over):  He says he lost seven family members. Others lost their entire family. For those who miraculously survived, the injured were taken to makeshift medical clinics as staff treated their catastrophic wounds. Others fled to the safety of the forest, coming to terms with the horror they'd just witnessed. \"I cannot comfort myself,\" cries this woman. \"Everyone is suffering.\" With fears of more aerial attacks, villages quickly gathered the bodies and placed the countless remains in piles for cremation. \"Burn, burn, burn! The wood is not enough. Please add the tires,\" pleads this man. \"We are trying to burn the flesh of the dead.\" Sure enough, a military helicopter did return just before sunset, firing more missiles at those who'd come to cremate the dead. The day's final death toll, according to the national unity government, 186 people killed, the deadliest attack since the junta seized power in a coup more than two years ago. The military confirmed the bombings, saying they were targeting rebel forces who have been fighting Myanmar's military government. But CNN has interviewed over half a dozen eyewitnesses of last week's attack who say the target was civilians. This man lost 30 relatives, including young nieces and nephews. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I don't know why they targeted a place full of pregnant women, children, and the elderly. The military are not human. They are more savage than animals.

According to the group, numbers rose from 78 in January to 367 in March of this year. But despite some acts of violence, Kenya is generally viewed as a safer space for members of the LGBTQ community. Same-sex relations and marriages are illegal, but the law isn't regularly enforced. A rare reprieve for a community fighting for justice and equality. Stephanie Busari, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

New details this hour about the political protests in Brazil's capital in January this year, newly-released video appears to show security forces allowing rioters to enter the presidential palace and ransack the building. CNN's Isa Soares has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was the darkest of days in Brazilian democratic history. Supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro taking the capital, Brasilia, by storm, breaking into the presidential palace and other government buildings. Now, new CCTV footage exclusively obtained by CNN affiliate CNN Brasil of what transpired inside the presidential palace appears to bolster the claims of people who have accused the police of failing to act. Chief among them, current President Lula da Silva. LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There were a lot of people colluding, It's important to say there were a lot of conniving people from the military police, and there were a lot of conniving people from the armed forces. SOARES (voice-over):  The hours of CCTV footage showed police forces seemingly retreating as protesters marched on the palace and leaving their post as rioters entered the building. Once inside, the ransacking begins. Priceless antiquities, tables, phones. Almost nothing is left untouched. At the time, former policeman Cassio Thyone told me some of the criticism was unwarranted. CASSIO THYONE, FORMER POLICE OFFICER (through translator):  Some policemen ended up not acting, because they didn't think there was a risk of invasion. I don't think it was incompetence. SOARES (voice-over):  The Institutional security office or GSI, which handles security for the presidential palaces, has also defended its officers, saying they evacuated some areas, concentrated demonstrators on the second floor, and waited for reinforcements to arrest them. Despite those assertions, the bureau acknowledging its offices are being investigated and those proven to have collaborated with rioters will be held responsible. But heads have started rolling. General Goncalves Dias, Lula's government minister in charge of security, has resigned. CCTV footage shows him walking with some of the rioters just feet away from the presidential office. He says he was trying to lead them away so they could be arrested. But critics say his demeanor was complacent and complicit. Back in Brazil after three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro is enjoying some respite, the video leak seen as a momentary win as he continues to dodge blame for the January riots. Yet doubt remains. The new footage raising more questions than the answers it provides. Isa Soares, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, even if you get to the teased article on page eight, you find the headline, \"My Life Has Changed Completely,\" followed by quotes attributed to the Formula One champion, talking about his medical condition and his family life since his brain injury. It's only toward the end of the article that you discover that the interview is fake. Responses were generated by artificial intelligence. The Schumacher family say they are planning to take legal action against Funke Media Group, the German publisher of the magazine, and a spokesperson for that company has declined to comment. This fake interview has caused particular upset, considering both Michael Schumacher's condition following his ski accident, but also his wife's very clear message in a Netflix documentary, which broadcast two years ago, in which he said, \"It is very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us. So now we are protecting Michael.\" Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
