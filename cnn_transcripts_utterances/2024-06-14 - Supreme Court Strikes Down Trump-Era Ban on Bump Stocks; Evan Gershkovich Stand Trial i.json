      "sentences": "Yes, we're taking the time to go through this opinion. And for anyone just tuning in, let me read to the top of Justice Thomas's opinion, the majority here. He writes that Congress has long restricted access to machine guns, a category of firearms defined by the ability to shoot automatically more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. Now, he's a semi-automatic firearm, which requires shooters to re-engage the trigger for every shot are not machine guns. In this case, asked whether bump stock and accessory for a semi-automatic rifle that allows the shooter to rapidly re-engage the trigger and therefore achieve a high rate of fire converts the rifle into a machine gun. They hold that it does not.But in a fiery dissent, his liberal colleagues disputed this, for example, Justice Sotomayor wrote, when I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. A bump stock equipped semi-automatic rifle fires automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger. Because I, like Congress, call that a machine gun. I respectfully dissent. So, a pretty fiery dissent from the liberal justices. Now Jim, we are still waiting for 20 other outstanding opinions from the high court, including that big other gun question that we were talking about earlier. There'll be no more opinions today, but we do expect to get more later next week.",

He is the first American journalist since the Cold War to be arrested on espionage charges. He now faces up to 20 years in prison after Russian prosecutors indicted him and formally accused him of spying for the CIA.CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow for us. Kylie Atwood is here in Washington. Matthew, what can you tell us? The State Department says, of course, these charges are false. What are they saying on the part of the Kremlin?",

That period has now come to an end and the Russian court system, the authorities have moved ahead with the prosecution. They've indicted him. They've moved the case to a to a to a courtroom in Yekaterinburg, which is about 1,000 miles from Moscow that we don't know at this point when the case will actually begin, those details have not been made public yet.But what has been made public is what exactly Evan Gershkovich has been accused of. Up until now, we haven't really had any statements from them beyond he was arrested for working for an American intelligence agency on the basis of espionage. They've been a bit more specific in the indictment saying that Gershkovich was acting on instructions from the CIA. Something, of course, the United States and Gershkovich and \"The Wall Street Journal\" have categorically denied. Collecting information about a tank factory in Yekaterinburg. The tank factory has been named as UralVagonZavod, which is a big, sort of, military facility that both produces and repairs military equipment in the Urals area of Russia. And the indictment said that Evan Gershkovich did this with careful measures of secrecy. Again, no evidence was presented at this indictment at the start of this trial, but we expect that will, you know, obviously come out during the trial. Although, whether it'll come out publicly or not is unclear, Jim.",

And, of course, we should note there's that other American who's been wrongfully detained there for more than five years, Paul Whelan. He's been incredibly frustrated over the last year.

And so, President Biden rolled out an executive order earlier this year that essentially allowed them to go after people who were standing in the way of humanitarian aid getting in or violence in the West Bank and Gaza. And so, that is what enabled the State Department, the Treasury Department to roll out these new sanctions. We're waiting for some more details from the State Department on this. But it's significant because it demonstrates that the Biden administration isn't just going to talk about their concerns, right, about this violence and about these prohibitions that aren't just happening on -- you know, on Israeli official sides, but also on these protesters side, but they're actually going to go after them and target them and try to really drive them down.

And so far, we've believed that this was a guy named Vadim Krasikov, who's an FSB hitman who killed a Chechen in Berlin and is being held in Germany. That may still be the case. But, you know, Putin has said on the timing here that there might be a trade after conviction. And there's no question, unfortunately, that Evan, you know, 99, 100 percent will be convicted. So, maybe at that point you could get a trade. But I don't think at this point you're going to get anything until then. And it will be very difficult time.",

I mean, this is -- you know, he's in a very, very acrimonious time with the United States. This hurts the Biden administration, makes things difficult for the administration.

I mean, I just wonder if it's putting a lot of pressure on her that's just not really fair. BRENNANAnd the bottom line is that she understands this will come in our social media world. People are attaching themselves to her. They're valid questions. Some of them are also just out there and she's getting hit by all of this. Meanwhile, she's playing basketball and had a couple of great assists to lead her team. And of course, steals and, of course, some points. Obviously missed some shots. Led her team to a really big victory last night. So, she's an athlete. And again, I go back, Jim, to Tiger Woods. Tiger, obviously, also kind of a lightning rod, but he didn't have to worry about social media. So, let's look at this and make sure the last thing women's sports and the WNBA wants to do is make Caitlin Clark, well, basically a distractor from doing the most important thing, which is rising and bringing women's sports to a level it has never been before. We've never seen an athlete capture the imagination of the nation like this. And Billie Jean King said this to me last week, Jim, you do not want to ruin it and you do not want to make it so that Caitlin Clark cannot be the person who brings girls and boys and kids from around the world into basketball and following women's sports as never before.",
