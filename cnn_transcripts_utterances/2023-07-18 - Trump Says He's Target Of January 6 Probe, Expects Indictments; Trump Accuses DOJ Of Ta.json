This time, in the January 6th investigation, a sign that charges could be imminent. We heard from him, just moments ago. We'll tell you what he said.Plus, for the very first time, suspects have been charged, in a 2020 fake electors scheme. 16 people accused of multiple felonies, in the State of Michigan. Who are they? And what does this mean, for the other fake electors, in other states? Also, a judge, appointed by Trump, says she'll decide, quote, \"Promptly,\" on a trial date, in the classified documents case. How that could impact the campaign calendar? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It is 9 PM Eastern. And the Trump headlines just keep on coming, tonight, the biggest one being broken by the former President himself. He says that he has been informed, by the Special Counsel, that he's a target, in the federal January 6th investigation. In his own words, that quote, \"Almost always means an arrest and an indictment is coming.\" He does have some experience with this. Trump also got a target letter, shortly before he was indicted, in the documents case. But this is what he's saying tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Now, I'm like becoming an expert. I have no choice. If you say something about an election, they want to put you in jail, for the rest of your life. It's a disgrace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This could just be a case only with Donald Trump. And then, there's another case with other defendants, like Rudy Giuliani, et cetera. We just don't know. And Jack Smith, for example, might want to have a streamlined case, to try to get a case, to trial, before the election.

Aileen Cannon is no friend of Jack Smith, right? She's a Trump appointee, who's already made rulings, in a prior matter, towards Donald Trump.
