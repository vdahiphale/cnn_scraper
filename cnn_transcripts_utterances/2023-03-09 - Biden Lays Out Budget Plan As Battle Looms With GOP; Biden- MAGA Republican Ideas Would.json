Under my plan - and I made this commitment when I ran, and I haven't broken it yet and I never will - no one making less than $400,000 will see a penny in federal taxes go up. Not a single penny. Now, why are they doing $400,000? Because I doubt anybody here makes $400,000. I did it to make the case that I'm not going after anything remotely - any ordinary folks, because they're paying their share. We're also going to save billions of dollars on going after criminals who commit fraud. A lot of people are saying to me that they don't like the idea I'm prepared to forgive up to two - up to $20,000 if you got a Pell Grant or $10,000 for anybody who has a student loan during the recession. Well, guess what? We paid - to the so-called PPP program - we paid significant - I think it's $900 billion - I think it - don't hold me to that number, but it's well over nine on - for anybody who had a tough time with their business during the pandemic so they could pay employees, they could do their - but guess what? You may remember, I was running for office at the time, but you all might remember that the - I had a big fight with the former president and maybe future President - bless me, Father.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Victor, that stood out to me as well. You repeatedly heard President Biden trying to draw a contrast between his proposals and those in - espoused by \"MAGA Republicans.\"Of course, the MAGA Republicans label is a way that he tries to tie the Republicans currently in Congress to former President Donald Trump. And there were also several mentions of the former president in his remarks, including one moment where the President seemed to reference the upcoming re-election battle, saying - referring to President Trump as the former president and maybe future president. The President then did the sign of the cross as he typically does when he's joking and says bless me, father. But this certainly provided the President with a venue and an opportunity to try to draw a contrast between his proposals and those being proposed by Republicans. The President trying to argue that his budget is aimed at protecting and enhancing the security of those who have been forgotten, those who have felt invisible in this country. He talked about the efforts to try to lower prescription drugs, also expanding money for child care, as well as re-enforcing or re- instating the Child Tax Credit. He's also talked about capping insulin for - at $35 a month for all Americans. But, of course, this is all playing out against the backdrop of that upcoming fight over the debt ceiling. And one thing that the President did in this speech is really call out House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, pushing him and urging him to unveil his own budget proposal for Republicans. The President saying that he is willing to meet with McCarthy at any moment once he has that budget outlined. So the President here today really trying to lay out the stakes about the policy and the political battles that will ensue in the coming year.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, you have seen Republicans already coming out swinging against this. Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted in response to the fact that the budget would reduce the deficit, but increased spending on a number of programs and said Washington doesn't have a deficit problem. It has a spending problem. It's not about these revenues. It's about how much they're spending and that is what Republicans want to target in their budget.But as Arlette said, what President Biden did today was essentially dare Republicans to put their ideas onto paper. And that is something that Kevin McCarthy has said he plans to do. He has been having these weekly meetings with the various groups within his party. They're trying to find consensus on a budget. But it has been a really slow moving process. I caught up with the House Budget Chairman, Jodey Arrington, yesterday. And he said they're in no rush to get this out. He initially suggested it might be as late as May when they put something forward. Then a spokesman later walked that back. But the reality is what Republicans are trying to achieve is incredibly difficult. They are trying to enact deep spending cuts without touching Social Security and Medicare and without raising taxes. And so obviously, the budgets are always - it's a political exercise, these are not binding resolutions. But it's a difficult exercise, especially with Kevin McCarthy working with his razor thin majority. And to top it all off, the stakes are incredibly high. You have this looming debt ceiling crisis and so the clock is really on starting today now that Biden has his budget out, all eyes are on Republicans to see what they come up with Victor.",

But this is a good place for us to find where we agree, where we disagree and how we move on from there. But the question now is what is going to happen when it gets back to Congress.This bill or this proposal, as he has put out today. is dead on arrival with Republicans in Washington, not MAGA Republicans, I'm talking about Republicans, simply because of the large emphasis on taxing the job creators in this country. And as Melanie mentioned what McCarthy has said is what we have in Washington, we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. And Republicans are going to focus very carefully on what they can do to cut expenditures, specifically with climate change and global warming policies, but cutting the spending and not working and putting a focus on taxing people. And I've talked with many Republicans. They say there is a plan in place. But first and foremost, they want to look at Biden's proposal, see where they agree on this, but then put a very thoughtful, calculated plan out that would not only balanced the budget in 10 years, but look at cutting wasteful spending without touching Social Security and Medicare.",

We saw the - and Speaker McCarthy said that.There are many Republicans who say that they're not going to be defense cuts, the Pentagon is off the table too. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds that to get to a balanced budget in a decade, all other federal spending would have to be cut by 78 percent. How do you get there?

One, a lot of companies, especially tech, they over hired during COVID, now they're correcting. Companies are dealing with the impact of high interest rates from the Federal Reserve and also I think some CEOs are just worried. So they're being cautious and are cutting some costs.If you look at the numbers, almost 181,000 Jobs had been cut through the first two months of this year. So in context that is five times the same point of last year. It's almost - it's actually the most since 2009. And what is interesting, though, is when you look at the official government statistics, the jobs market looks healthy, although that could be starting to change. New numbers out today show that initial jobless claims that's a proxy for layoffs. That jumped by the most since early October. This is a weekly number. We don't want to overreact, but it is worth keeping an eye on. And, of course, this comes ahead of tomorrow's big government jobs report.",
