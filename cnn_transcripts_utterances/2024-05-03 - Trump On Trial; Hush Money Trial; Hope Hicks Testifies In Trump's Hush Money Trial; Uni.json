Now, Hope Hicks, Trump's press secretary during the 2016 campaign, testified that he told her to deny he had an affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels. She also said Trump didn't want his family to be hurt or embarrassed by anything happening in the campaign. That statement could in fact bolster the defense team's argument that the hush money payment was kept from hearing -- that kept them from hearing lurid allegations not, in fact, to help his election chances. Hicks also said that Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen, who made the payment to Daniels, sometimes went rogue. Our Kara Scannell has more.

That will be added to the well over 2,000 people who have been detained on campuses throughout the country in the last couple of weeks. At New York University, administration officials, they are clearing an encampment that had been present, they say, for nearly a week that took no more than 20 minutes to do so, according to police. 30 chose to leave when asked by police, about a dozen did not and were arrested. And then you look at the pictures from overhead at the New School also in Manhattan, overhead pictures there showing some of the over 40 people who were detained in a similar incident. It is still unclear exactly how many of them had direct ties to the university. But we should add we have learned a little bit more about an incident from earlier this week when New York police officers were asked to make their way onto the Columbia University campus to help clear out an encampment and also detain several individuals in a building that had been occupied by demonstrators. We have learned, according to Columbia, that 13 of the people who were occupying that administration building did not have ties to the school. There has, however, been some positive outcomes here, including at Rutgers, where you could see students seen taking down an encampment after they say that they reached an agreement with the university leadership, leaving the door open to ongoing dialogue in exchange for dismantling this encampment. The university will, among other things, taken at least 10 displaced Palestinian students. And at Brown University, officials there agreeing to a vote on a student divestment proposition that happens in the fall. So, long as there are no future encampments that are built up on campus. So, really as we begin to see commencement season right around the corner with some schools scheduling those ceremonies starting this weekend, it gives you a sense of how universities are responding to that growing wave of demonstrations on campuses throughout the country.

The biggest shortfall really came from a shortfall on state and local hiring, which has been driving job gains really since mid-2023. We know that job openings at the end of March for state and local governments were still among the most elevated of all job openings out there. So, there's still more room to run on that, and I wouldn't take too much out of this one number. That said, the irony is that the more that financial markets rally and bring rates back down again and equity prices up, the more that can stimulate the economy and work against the Fed's efforts to just hold rates higher for longer and slowly cool inflation without causing the economy to go into a deep freeze. They want to avoid a full-blown recession. But, you know, this idea that the financial markets keep running the Fed and getting ahead of them on rate cuts, that's a problem.

But also, we've had a lot of climate damages. And that's one of the reasons insurance costs are going up so much. And they haven't stopped the -- over a billion-dollar climate damage events have actually accelerated quite sharply over the last five years, and that's why you can't even get insurance in some parts of the country on your home. So, these things are much harder for something that's beyond the Fed's control and it makes us (INAUDIBLE) how low can the Fed actually get inflation? I do think they'll keep their 2 percent target. But let's face it, we only got there for a few months, right, prior to the pandemic. And that was on the downside, trying to get it up to 2 percent.

What we saw was the dollar's appreciation and depreciation of other currencies was starting to force many to be worried that the depreciation in their currency meant they're going to have higher import prices, they're going to have higher costs and higher inflation, and that could delay the rate cuts that other central banks had planned. So, as the Fed was talking about delaying rate cuts, that has spillover effects, although it's not as bad as it once was because many emerging markets have sort of -- have foreign reserves and they can defend their currencies when they move really dramatically. They said, we saw this on all currencies. Even the Japanese yen depreciated sharply against the dollar. And those are things complicating the decisions by other central banks to cut rates. And I have to say, I have not had more calls from foreign journalists about the Fed's May meeting in -- and any meeting the Fed has had in a very long time until this meeting.

The difference is stark and notable. There could be a variety of motivations for it, including the Indian government's history of frustration with Canada for not detaining alleged Sikh activists who have alleged ties to terrorism and terrorist activities in India, which the Canadian government, of course, denies. So, there's a history there. It's unfortunate for Canada, which had hoped to use India as a bulwark in the Indo-Pacific against China.

Of course, the U.S.-India partnership in the region is critical to the success of both countries in advancing their interests in the Indo- Pacific. With Canada, I think he felt that he could get away. I don't know if he knew at the time that the United States was also investigating ties between his government and the alleged plot to kill somebody, an activist in New York City. If he had known that information and that the Canadian and U.S. authorities were collaborating and investigating individuals tied to both killings, perhaps he would have taken the Canadian allegations more seriously. Of course, now that we have all the information, we know that both of these killings were connected by an individual who believed he was contacting a contracted killer in the States, but was actually talking to undercover police officers in the U.S.",

I think it's notable that Canada has a very large Sikh population. It is the largest Sikh population outside of India. It's also home to a notable population of Indian migrants. It's actually one in five migrants coming into Canada are -- originate from India. And Canada is pushing to have 1.5 million immigrants by the end of 2026.

And there is, I guess, a concern over the resources on the moon. China has said that they intend to land their next missions at the Lunar South Pole to not only get samples from there, but also to drill into the water ice that has been detected there and try to use it as a demonstration to show that you can turn that water into air, oxygen, maybe even rocket fuel.
