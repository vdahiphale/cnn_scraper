The potential for that is certainly there in Pinellas County, Hillsborough County, Manatee, down to Sarasota.And substantial storm surge risk even farther South down to places like Cape Coral, Fort Myers, and even Naples, because the size of Milton's wind field is going to basically grow, almost double in size between now and just prior to landfall.",

And also, heavy rainfall threats are increasing, because warmer air holds more moisture. And that's something we haven't touched on here yet with Milton.

She -- her camp often said she was the last one to leave the room for the past -- throughout the Biden administration. So, it's a tough needle to thread there. I do think that answer tracks with how the vice president has operated, really, since President Biden came into office. Even at times -- my reporting showed even at times where she did disagree with the West Wing or wanted to push Biden on something. Student loans, for example, she did it privately. She had her team draft up a memo and present it to President Biden and his aides privately.
