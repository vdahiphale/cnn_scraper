Polls are closing in 15 States, with a slew of high-profile races, in key battlegrounds, including Arizona.And we have a CNN projection for you right now in New York. CNN is projecting that the current Senate Majority Leader, Democrat Charles Schumer will be reelected defeating Joe Pinion. In South Dakota, CNN is projecting that a member of Republican leadership, Senator John Thune will be reelected, defeating Brian Bengs. And in Kansas, CNN is projecting that incumbent Republican Senator Jerry Moran will be reelected defeating Democrat Mark Holland. Let's look at the map, right now, and talk about the races that we are not yet going to make a projection. They include the Senate races in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin. As of right now, we do not have a projection in those races. The balance of power, of course, 100 Senate seats. Democrats have 37 of those seats. Republicans have 38 of those seats. There are 25 seats remaining. Republicans only need to pick up one net seat, in order to regain control of the U.S. Senate. There are governor's races going on out there as well. Let's go to Boris Sanchez, for that.",

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Donald Trump press secretary/communications director, following in the footsteps, of her father, Mike Huckabee, becoming the new governor of Arkansas. We should note she becomes the first woman elected governor of that state, defeating Chris Jones.Another projection to bring you now, this one, from Rhode Island. There, incumbent Democrat Dan McKee will win his first full term in the governor's mansion. Remember, he replaced Gina Raimondo, when she left the governor's mansion to join the Biden administration, as the Commerce Secretary. We have some key race alerts, to bring you now, beginning with the State of Texas. Last time we checked in, former congressman Beto O'Rourke had a decent advantage. Right now, Greg Abbott, the incumbent Republican has overtaken him, nearly 170,000 vote lead, for Abbott with 33 percent of the vote in. An update now, from the Peach State, Georgia. Brian Kemp building on the lead that we saw him take earlier, against Stacey Abrams. Right now, he stands 177,000 votes ahead, roughly 8 percent advantage for Kemp. Still above that 50 percent threshold to avoid a runoff with 55 percent of the vote in, in Georgia. Meantime, an unexpectedly close race, in Oklahoma. A key race alert there. Kevin Stitt, the incumbent Republican, taking on Joy Hofmeister, a Democrat, who actually flipped parties, just last year, specifically, for this race. Stitt, right now, 43,000 votes ahead, with 34 percent of the vote in. Jake?",

Herschel Walker, the Republican candidate, now in the lead by 9,000 votes, up to 55 percent. I would say prepare for a little bit of a seesaw ahead.But to the point David Chalian, was making, in our last conversation, as they begin to count more of the today vote, Election Day-cast votes, that's where Republicans have an edge. Boris just noted, Governor Kemp, stretching his lead a bit. It's the very same dynamic. They're counting Election Day votes, now. We're starting to count them, as we move through the hour, and the hours ahead. Remember, Georgia took us a long time in 2020. And those runoffs were close. So now, we come - now we come back here, I'm sorry, come back here to the Senate race. And you just look at this. This is the State of Georgia, today, an incredibly competitive state, a 9,000 vote lead. You're beginning to see the map fill in. If you're in the Walker campaign, number one, you still got 45 percent of the ways to go. But you also see, again, see some of these rural counties. They're small, but we have no votes in at all. Those are going to be red, at the end of the night. So, the challenge is, I just want to go check up here, a little bit. So, you first, you come to Fulton County, Senator Warnock, getting 75 percent of the vote there. Let's just go back and look at 2020, and the presidential race, Joe Biden getting 73 percent. So, we come back here, I just want to check. So, Senator Warnock doing what he has to do, in Fulton County, at least at the moment, as we continue to count. Then you go over to Cobb County, right? It's, you see, it's a more competitive suburb. But Joe Biden won it up by 14 points. Now, let's come back to where we are, and look at the Senate race in Cobb County. And it's a 20-point race. So, around the Atlanta area, at the moment, Warnock there, doing quite well, and what he needs to do. Just want to come over here to DeKalb County, again, only 7 percent of the vote here, though. So, in Atlanta, and the suburbs, Senator Warnock is running strong. The question is where are the Walker votes coming from? So let's see. One of the challenges was, did the Trump voters turnout for not Donald Trump, right?",

But there are dozens of them. And those votes add up. This is a 28-point Donald Trump district. And there you see, Herschel Walker running up big margins. Just to check on the governor's race here.

So, I want to just show you, among male vote, Warnock has this big 36.8 percent lead. Roughly half of it, 49.5 percent is still uncounted. Early in-person voting, Warnock, it's a much closer category between the two candidates. He's got a roughly 5 percentage point lead, and there's only 30 percent left of the early in-person votes to count. But I - you know, John said, it's going to be a seesaw. Look at this. 82.8 percent of the Election Day vote in Georgia is still to be counted. And that is a huge Herschel Walker category of vote. He's currently winning Election Day vote by 37.2 percentage points. And that is the biggest bucket of outstanding vote.

And so, that's one of the lessons we're learning.And this is more complicated now than it was 10 years ago, just because you get people voting, in different ways, early voting, mail- in vote - early in-person voting, mail-in voting, Election Day voting. And different States count them in different orders.

We just want to isolate it to the 82 competitive seats that we've identified. And we'll watch. We could be surprised there could be other seats as well. But you mentioned, to your point, Democrats being very competitive. And again, so where were we earlier? Number one at the moment, Democrats are holding both of the New Hampshire seats, two competitive seats, that the Democrats were a bit nervous about. The Republicans, there's one (ph) there. And so, then you come down here. The last time Jake and I were talking about the competitive House districts, the Republican was leading this district, in Rhode Island. Now you see the Democrat has pulled ahead, in the Second District - Rhode Island's Second District. It's a little bit of Providence, it's Cranston, and it's down to the southern part of the state, the western part of Rhode Island. 50.8 percent to 46.4 percent. So, the Democrat has pulled ahead again, as we count the votes, we get more votes throughout the hour. At the moment, that one was red, just a few minutes ago. Now it is blue, still a long way to go. Then, you come into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This is fascinating, if it holds up. We know this is early vote. We know we have a long way to go to the count, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. But there are four competitive House districts, here, two in the east, seven and eight, Matt Cartwright, and Susan Wild, two out here, in the western part of the country. Summer Lee's district right here is Pittsburgh, and you move forward from here, and you come up here, and you look at this district here. This is the old Conor Lamb district. The lines have been redrawn, at the moment. But again, very low vote count. Democrats are ahead in all four of those. This is a place, where Republicans think they could pick up two or three seats. We'll watch. We have a ways to go, Jake. So remembering that the vote is still early, and where we are an hour, two hours, from now, will tell us a lot more about the House than right now.",

But as we've seen, this has been bouncing back and forth, and I expect that you're going to be hearing a lot of us talking about this, tonight. Let's check in though now, on Ohio, where J.D. Vance has taken the lead, 50.3 percent, over Democrat, Tim Ryan, the congressman who now is at 49.7 percent. Again, Ohio has trended red, in recent years. North Carolina, we've got Ted Budd, the Republican, narrowly ahead, of Democrat Cheri Beasley, 49.4 percent to 48.6 percent. This is a real nail-biter, at this hour, thought we do have 70 percent of the vote in. Now, let's go north to New Hampshire, where Maggie Hassan is holding her lead, in a pretty commanding way, at 57.4 percent, to Don Bolduc's 41.3 percent. He is the Republican. Considering how Chris Sununu has performed, as the Republican, in the governor's race, pretty significant that Maggie Hassan is right there. Now let's take a look at Pennsylvania, where John Fetterman is sitting at 64.5 percent to Mehmet Oz's 33.1 percent. Obviously, we expect this race to end up much closer than what you're seeing, on your screen, right now. We only have about 15 percent of the vote in, in Pennsylvania. And let's check in on Colorado, where Michael Bennet is out to an early lead, 58.2 percent over Joe O'Dea, the Republican, 39.6 percent. This is not a seat that Democrats wanted to have to worry about, but that came online near the end of this midterm season, as the national environment shifted for Republicans. We've got about a third of the vote in, in Colorado. We're going to keep an eye on that through the evening as well. Now we've got some key race alerts on the governor's races, with Boris.",

Keep that in mind. 64 percent of the vote in, he maintains an advantage over that 50 percent threshold. In Pennsylvania, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, 324,000 votes ahead of Doug Mastriano. 15 percent of the vote there, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Let's get an update now, a key race alert, from the State of Michigan. Incumbent Democrat, Gretchen Whitmer currently leading conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, an election denier, as well. A 11 percent of the vote in. We just got an update. It appears Whitmer is 36,000 - 37,000-ish votes ahead, as we get an update from Michigan. Let's take a look at a race that nobody expected would be as close as it was at the end. Incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul running for hers full first term in office. She currently leads considerably, over Congressman from Long Island, an election denier, Lee Zeldin, 265,000 votes, as we just got the update from the Empire State.

We have a long way to go in Michigan.So, as you move out here, you come this way, this is interesting, because this would be, again, it's a very modest number of votes, and they all come from a critical suburb, mind you, Waukesha County. Here's Milwaukee, suburbs here, Democrats can get votes in the closer in suburbs. As you move more out west exurbia, rural, it gets more Republican. But it's very early here. Tony Evers, the Democratic incumbent, again, in a - Tim Michels, near the end of the campaign, said, \"If you elect me, no Republicans will ever lose again, in Wisconsin,\" which brings the democracy question into play, very early. We'll watch this race play out. But again, key presidential battleground, key presidential battleground. When you move out here, in the middle of the country, where you see this one, people don't think of Kansas as a Democratic state. Kansas has a Democratic governor. Kansas, remember, after Dobbs, had the big referendum, where Kansas voters, commonsense conservatives, said no, to opening the State Supreme Court, to allowing more abortion restrictions. So, it'll be interesting to see. This is very early. You say 35 percent of the estimated vote. But if you're looking out here, and all - this is red. This, at the end of the night, will be red, barring some huge surprise. Where are the votes so far? Well, again, it's just, we talked earlier, this is your close to the Kansas - this is Kansas City, Missouri, here, Johnson County, Wyandotte County. These are the Kansas City suburbs, if you will. And then you're moving into the Democratic area, Lawrence, Kansas, it's Douglas County, that's the fifth largest county, Democrat by 40 points, right? So, you think it's - Kansas is a red state, but it has a Democratic governor. This was a 40-point county for Joe Biden. You come over to the Topeka area, it was a Democrat plus three, where the Democratic governor early on is running much bigger than that, obviously. So, we'll see. Can Laura Kelly hold on in the State of Kansas? That's a big test for Democrats, a Democratic governor, in the middle of the country, in this time of year. Then, you move up here to Nebraska, 23 percent of the vote, the Democrat is leading. But slow down, in the sense that look at where the votes coming in. Omaha, Lincoln, the Democratic areas, there's a whole lot of rural red Republican Kansas, to still come in. A race that Republicans had hoped to make more competitive at the moment with about 40 percent of the vote in, the incumbent Democrat, Jared Polis, leading at the moment in Colorado. Interesting to watch if that plays out in tandem with the Senate race. We talked about that dynamic in Georgia, in New Hampshire. Otherwise (ph), what happens to the governor, vis-a-vis, the Senate candidate in Colorado, they are both of the same party. Then we come down, just one more quick one, in New Mexico. The governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, running comfortably ahead, but very early votes coming in so far, Jake, only in Democratic areas. But the governor's race is again, always critical, for state issues, all the more important, because of threats to democracy, and Supreme Court sending abortion rights, back to the States.",

Let's take a look at the State of Michigan. Incumbent Democrat Gretchen Whitmer locked in this tough reelection battle, with conservative commentator, former TV host, Tudor Dixon.

They understand there's a long way to go, and the numbers are going to change, and the percentage is going to change. But they do know what their target was, in every county.

And then, my biggest fascination about this race is when I was out here, couple weeks back, in the Pittsburgh suburbs, the more upscale Pittsburgh suburbs, they were asking, a lot of them voted for Trump the first time, then didn't vote for Trump, the second time, because they didn't like the chaos. They didn't like the tweets. They didn't like the noise. They didn't like to being told to ingest bleach. And so, you're out here in these areas here. There, you're still in Allegheny County, but you're out here. The people, who made George W. Bush, president, and George H.W. Bush, president, and they were asking me, \"What do you know about Dr. Oz?\" And I was saying, \"Not that much, just what I see on TV.\" They were trying to figure out, \"Is he a Trump?\" Because then they were going to - not going to vote for him. Or is he a - is he just taking the Trump endorsement, and when he gets to the Senate, he'd be a more moderate Republican? So, that's one question for Oz. How's he do out here?

Two other projections, in Maryland, Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen will be reelected, CNN projects, defeating Chris Chaffee, Republican. And, in North Dakota, CNN is projecting that former governor and current senator, John Hoeven will be reelected, defeating Democrat Katrina Christiansen.

Meantime, the first openly gay governor in U.S. history will win reelection, in Colorado. Jared Polis defeats Heidi Ganahl, a Republican entrepreneur. We also have some key race alerts, to bring you, right now, beginning with the State of Georgia. We've not stopped talking to you about Georgia all night. We will continue talking about these races. Brian Kemp, right now, 204,000 votes ahead, of Stacey Abrams, roughly a 7 percentage point advantage, with 72 percent of the vote in, in the Peach State. Let's get a look at Texas now. There, incumbent Republican Greg Abbott, with a similarly 282,000 votes ahead, of former congressman, Beto O'Rourke, 56 percent of the vote in, in the State of Texas. An update now, for Michigan. This tough reelection battle, for incumbent Democrat, Gretchen Whitmer. She stands roughly in the same place, where she was, when we last checked in on Michigan, a 40,000 vote advantage against former TV host, and conservative commentator, Tudor Dixon. Only 13 percent of the vote in, in Michigan. Let's take a look at a true toss-up. Joe Biden won the State of Wisconsin in 2020 by an eyelash, only about 20,000 votes. Tony Evers, the incumbent Democrat, right now, holding on to a 76,000 vote advantage, over Tim Michels, with 21 percent of the vote in, in Wisconsin.

Remember, you need - Republicans need to pick up one net Democratic seat, in order to regain control, of the U.S. Senate.

Of those 48, Democrats are in the lead, in 37. Republicans are in the lead in 11. There are 82 competitive seats total.

She faces a strong challenge, by the former State Attorney General, Republican Adam Laxalt. In the Utah Senate race, Republican senator, and Trump loyalist, Mike Lee was facing a heated challenge by an independent candidate, former CIA officer, Evan McMullin.

      "sentences": "Yes. That would be almost everywhere. So what is happening? Number one, Governor Kemp, let me come - let me turn this off, and come back to the governor's race, for a minute.Governor Kemp is over-performing Herschel Walker, where Democrats live, and where votes are overwhelming. You might say he's getting blown out here. Yes, he is. He is getting blown out here. But margins matter, in close races. So look at Brian Kemp, with 28 percent of the vote, in Fulton County, the most populous county, in the state, county Joe Biden won by 46 points, more than 46 points. Brian Kemp's getting 28 percent. Herschel Walker's getting 23 percent, 23 percent. So, that's where the - in terms of where the people live, in a Democratic area, in a large area, that's one way to look at it. But it's also happening out here. I'm just going to pick a random rural county in Georgia. This is Wilcox County. It's tiny. It's less than 1 percent of the vote. But look at Herschel Walker, getting 74 percent of the vote there. And Raphael Warnock getting 25 percent, if you round that up. Then you come over here to the governor's race, Brian Kemp getting a point or two higher, and Stacey Abrams lower. So Herschel - Raphael Warnock is getting a few more votes, in these very White rural counties. He's over performing Stacey Abrams in these areas. It makes a difference, in the close race. You might say it's only 50 votes here, or 100 votes there. When you get in the governor's race, it's not close, so you say \"Oh, it doesn't matter.\" When you get here and Raphael Warnock in the - during this conversation, Senator Warnock has now pulled ahead by 5,491 votes. So, as these votes come in, the margins matter. The fact that Governor Kemp is doing a little better in the strongly Democratic areas matters, big time, in his race. And the fact that Herschel Walker, in these red counties, all across Georgia, is running a little bit behind the Republican incumbent governor, Jake, it matters, the margins matter.",
