Our legal experts are standing by with details on the filing and what it could mean for the truly historic oral arguments next month.Also tonight, Nikki Haley sharpens her attacks on her rivals just five days out from the New Hampshire primary. Haley going after Donald Trump for losing the White House and dragging down Republicans while calling Ron DeSantis invisible in the state. Plus, the U.S. Justice Department releases a scathing report on the law enforcement response to the Uvalde elementary school massacre. The attorney general, Merrick Garland is speaking exclusively with CNN about fatal mistakes made by police. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the breaking news out of the U.S. Supreme Court, Donald Trump warning the justices they would unleash what he is calling chaos and bedlam if they allow Colorado to remove him from the state's ballot.

      "sentences": "Well, the former president's legal team, they're really laying this out broadly. They're saying that the Colorado Supreme Court simply got it wrong when that court ruled to take Donald Trump off the ballot there. And they're asking now the Supreme Court to rule in their favor or else they're warning, as you said, that it will unleash chaos.So, on the first page of this 50-page filing, this is what Trump's legal team is writing. They're saying, the court should put a swift and decisive end to these ballot disqualification efforts which threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and which promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado's lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots. So, what we're seeing today from Trump's team is really the opening step for this case to get in motion at the Supreme Court. Trump has filed his brief today. The voters who actually won this in Colorado, they'll file their brief by the end of the month, and then this case will be heard by the high court February 8th. This is very much fast-tracking, a hugely consequential case. It needs to really be decided quickly because these primaries are playing out around the country. Right now, though, all of the decisions that ruled against Trump, they've been paused. So, Trump's name, in fact, will appear on the primary ballot, even in Colorado, in Maine, those are two of the states that have ruled against him. But the Supreme Court really does need to decide this issue very soon to get things settled, just in case, as is potential that Trump is the Republican nominee and if he needs to appear on that general election ballot in November. So, Wolf, Trump's legal team is putting it all before the Supreme Court in their brief. They're saying a number of arguments. They're saying Trump did not engage in insurrection, that this section of the 14th Amendment wouldn't even apply to him anyway. And they're saying overall that this section of the 14th Amendment can't be used to deny Trump access to the ballot. So, Wolf, the justices, Trump's legal team, they're asking the justices to consider a lot here, a broad array of arguments. We'll see which arguments the nine justices seize onto. But, of course, a lot at stake as we are just months away from the general election with primaries happening as we speak.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are concrete legal issues here. I don't think they're ever going to look at whether Donald Trump engaged in insurrection. There are threshold legal questions that Trump's lawyers have put out here that the justices need to decide. Number one, is the presidency covered by the phrase officer? The Section 3 of the 14th amendment says that an officer who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and then who engages in insurrection should be barred from future office, from holding future office.So, there are a couple of very important legal matters that only the Supreme Court can decide. Is the presidency an officer, an official, covered by this section? Is it -- does it apply only to someone who would hold office, not run for office? That's another argument here. And another one that's front and center in the Trump filing today is whether states have any latitude to change the qualifications. This brief cites a 1995 precedent of the Supreme Court that said that states are not allowed to. Now, this is their filing, it will be countered by the Colorado voters filing, but I would say there are concrete legal issues that the Supreme Court has to decide, and I do not think they will go near the question of whether Donald Trump engaged in insurrection, and they don't need to. There are other threshold issues here that will all play out. And I think this brief is much more -- I thought the petition was focused enough that the justices took the case, and they needed to take the case, but this brief is fairly focused, and when we hear oral arguments on February 8th, it will be joined by members of the Supreme Court Bar who are former law clerks to these justices. So, I think we're going to see a very robust argument from both sides.",

In one of Jake Tapper's earlier reports where he was speaking with Jeff Zeleny up in New Hampshire, you saw a lot of the Haley supporters saying that they're curious, right, or they're intrigued by Nikki Haley. Well, curiosity is not enough right now. She really has to convert a lot of those voters. And so this message that she's pushing right now, in this last phase, in this new phase, as we close in on votes in New Hampshire, is to really like close the deal. That's all directed on electability. Because we saw from a lot of the exit polls, GOP voters right now, they want somebody who can win.

And we can't do that just by providing additional funds that go to aid or assistance to people who come across the border. We have to secure the border.
