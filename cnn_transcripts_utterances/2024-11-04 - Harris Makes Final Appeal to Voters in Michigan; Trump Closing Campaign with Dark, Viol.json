HOLMES: A final push and a final pitch from both campaigns as we close in on the final day before the U.S. presidential election that's being watched closely across the country and, indeed, around the world. Both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have focused on key battleground states ahead of Tuesday's vote. They'll both travel to Pennsylvania in the hours ahead as they try to reach voters amid a tight race whose outcome remains very uncertain. On Sunday, Harris and Trump fanned out, hitting other key states like Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina. The vice president looking to draw a sharp contrast between herself and Trump as he continues to turn to an even darker messaging on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: America is ready for a fresh start. Ready for a new way forward where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left. I mean, honestly, because we did so -- we did so well. (END VIDEO CLIP) M. HOLMES: The latest CNN poll of polls shows exactly why both candidates are laser-focused on the battleground states. From Arizona to Pennsylvania, the averages of recent polling in each state show no clear leader. And with just one day to go until election day in America, more than 75 million people have already cast their vote for president. CNN's Jeff Zeleny now. He was there when Harris made her final appeal to voters in the crucial state of Michigan. He filed this report from East Lansing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Vice President Kamala Harris closing her campaign with a note of optimism, saying it's time to turn the page. ZELENY (voice-over): At a speech on Sunday night on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, the vice president implored her supporters to take the final hours of this campaign to do all they can to make sure she defeats Donald Trump.",

ZELENY (voice-over): These campaigns are closing in remarkably different ways, as former President Donald Trump is already questioning the results of Tuesday's election. Vice President Harris is urging her supporters to stay hopeful and optimistic, even as she tries to fight to win Michigan and these other Blue Wall states. It is no coincidence that she's closing her campaign in Michigan before spending the entire day before the election in Pennsylvania. It is the critical Blue Wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that she believes offer her best path to the White House.",

HOLMES (voice-over): Now, the campaign sought to clean up those remarks, issuing a statement from the spokesperson, Steven Cheung, that said, \"President Trump was stating that the media was in danger and that they were -- and that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield also. There can be no other interpretation of what he said.\" K. HOLMES: So again, our viewers can listen to him say what he said in that clip we just played. This is the Trump kind of clarifying statement about it. K. HOLMES (voice-over): But when I talked to a number of his allies, they were frustrated. They at one point, one of them said how hard is it to get up there on stage and just say, Kamala broke it. I'm going to fix it. They are eager for him to stay on message. They do believe that he can still pull off this race, that he can win the race. But in order to do so, he's got to stop talking. Or at least stay focused on the things that these Republicans believe matter -- K. HOLMES: -- particularly the economy, inflation, immigration, and crime. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Macon, Georgia.

      "sentences": "Here it is, the path to 270. The red states are in Trump's column. The blue states are in Harris's column, for the purpose of this exercise.And we've got seven remaining yellow toss-up battleground states. And as you know, those battleground states are razor-thin. Look at -- these are our poll of polls in the battleground states. No clear leader in any of them, in any of these battleground states. So, this is razor-thin. So, what is the path to victory for each candidate? Well, the Harris campaign will say that their best, most direct path to 270 electoral votes is through the Blue Wall. If she were to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, she'd be at 270 electoral votes and the next president. But what if Donald Trump repeats his 2016 victory in Pennsylvania? Then Harris drops down to 251, and she has to go hunting in the Sun Belt to find some more votes. Certainly, if she were able to flip North Carolina from red to blue this time, that would get her knocking on the door to 270. And then maybe Nevada behaves like it has for Democrats in recent cycles. And that would put Harris over the top in that scenario. What about Donald Trump's path? Well, let's reset the map. Seven yellow battleground states, and Donald Trump's most direct path is to hang onto North Carolina. That is the state he won by the narrowest margin four years ago. In fact, it's the only state he won of the seven battleground states. And let's say he flips Georgia back. You'll recall he famously lost it by just fewer than 12,000 votes. So, let's say that ends up back in his column. And let's say he does get that Pennsylvania victory repeated from 2016. That's it: he'll be at 270 electoral votes. He doesn't need any of the rest of the battleground states. But what if Harris does pull it out in Pennsylvania? Then, where does Donald Trump go for the next 19 electoral votes? Well, even if he were to win Nevada and Arizona out West, that still would not get him to 270. He would need at least one of the other remaining so-called Blue Wall states, such as Michigan. And that would do the trick and get him over the top at 283. (END VIDEOTAPE) M. HOLMES: Joining me now from Los Angeles is Michael Genovese, a political analyst, president of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University, and author of \"The Modern Presidency: Six Debates That Define the Institution.\" Always good to see you, sir.

We are very divided, a division that is wide and getting wider. And it's also getting darker. And the darker is because Donald Trump loves to talk about violence and make hints and drops hints about violence. Completely unnecessary, completely uncalled for, but it works for his base. M. HOLMES: Yes. We talk all the time about the presidential race for obvious reasons, but speak to the importance of down ballot voting.

And so, I think -- you know, we've seen the movie before, what happened in 2020. It didn't end well. It ended in January 6th. And Donald Trump, he will not go quietly into the night.

HOLMES: He's talked a lot about, you know, his little secret with the -- with the House leader, Mike Johnson. A lot of people take that to mean that there are Republican operatives in county, district, state level who are in there simply to stop the certification of various states. You could have a situation where Kamala Harris gets the 270 on paper, and then some of those states just won't certify, which can lead to a situation of the House voting -- voting in the president, which would be insane.
