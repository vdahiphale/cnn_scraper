Coming up, we all saw it coming. But it was still pretty shocking to watch Donald Trump but being booked and fingerprinted. The first U.S. President with a mug shot turns himself in remaining defiant as ever. Russia's President speaks out after the presumed death of the Wagner Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, pledging to conduct an investigation into Prigozhin's plane crash. This is spokesman Dmitry Peskov vehemently denies that the Kremlin had any culpability. Meanwhile, on battlefield in Ukraine, Ukrainian pilots will start cutting their teeth on F-16 fighter jets in the United States this October. And Spain's defiant Football Chief says he will fight until the end after facing a week of fierce criticism over giving an unwanted kiss to a star player following Spain's World Cup victory. Well, it's the first photo of its kind in American history. Let that sink in for a moment, a Former United States President sitting for a mug shot. Donald Trump booked a jail in Atlanta, Georgia for his latest criminal indictment. The Republican front runner in the 2024 Presidential race is charged with 13 counts tied to efforts to overturn results of the 2020 election. The defiant look on Trump's face, apparently intentional, he quickly posted the image on his truth social website and also on X formerly known as Twitter, marking his return to that platform after he was banned from it following the January the 6th insurrection. CNN's Nick Valencia has more on the unprecedented booking of the Former U.S. President. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mug shot an inmate number p 01135809 will forever be associated with a Former President Donald J. Trump was arrested on state charges related to election subversion in Georgia Thursday. He was booked and released on bond at the Fulton County Jail. Former President took to the right wing network Newsmax to discuss his surrender. DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Terrible experience. I came in I was treated very nicely, but it is, what it is I took a mug shot which I never heard the words mug shot that wasn't didn't teach me that at the Wharton School of Finance. And I have to go through a process since its election interference. VALENCIA (voice-over): Ahead of his surrender, Trump agreed to a $200,000 bond and other release conditions including not using social media to intimidate co-defendants and witnesses in the case. This is the fourth criminal case filed against the Former President this year.",

VALENCIA (on camera): Yes, historic for all the wrong reasons, Becky. On Monday there is a federal court case for the Former Chief of Staff for the Former President Mark Meadows. He is trying to get his criminal proceedings removed from a state court and pushed instead to a federal court where he wants to try to get this case dismissed. He's arguing that a federal statute protects him as a federal official who's alleged to have committed a crime while conducting that federal business. He says that his criminal proceedings should be moved to federal court. There's also an October trial date proposed by the Fulton County District Attorney here. We should expect a slew of legal filings before that date hits here. We should also mention a major development just in the last hour Trevian Kutti she's a publicist that is linked to artists like our Kelly and Kanye West. She's represented them in the past. She's alleged to have intimidated a Fulton County Election worker Ruby Freeman driving down from Chicago area home to do so here in the Atlanta area, telling Freeman that she was a loose end that needed to be tidied up. She has just surrendered within the last hour or so now just one codefendant of the 19 remains. Steven Lee is yet to turn himself in.

Donald Trumpreturning to New Jersey after what it was a quick stop off at the jail in Atlanta. What's next for the Former President? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, remember, he is still running for President, we are told that that is not going to stop. And in fact, he's not just running for President. He is currently the front runner in the GOP primary. So he's going to continue that schedule. Now as we get closer and closer to those debates. The next debate, of course, as well as those caucuses and primaries, you're going to hear more arguments from not just the Former President, but from his legal team, that this is, \"election interference\". They want to say that this is going to actually impact his campaigning and that this is going to hurt him in the election. Now, whether or not that works, it's going to be unclear, particularly in a court of law. But much of what Donald Trump does is play things out in the court of public opinion. And that's really also what you saw last night. Wasn't that his bit that he and his team wanted him to get a mug shot? And in fact, I spoke to members of his team earlier in the day, who said that they didn't want that they couldn't control that they didn't know what exactly would look like. But once they knew it was going to happen, they decided to take control of that and play this out again, in the court of public opinion, immediately starting to fundraise off of this image. And as you heard, Nick, they're talking about going back on Twitter or X formerly known as Twitter. This was a big deal. We know that Trump of course, had been banned from the social media platform, it was something that he used routinely or even regularly to communicate with people. He was nonstop tweeting when he was in the White House, really unprecedented as President. So there have been multiple questions about when or if he would ever get back on the platform. Doing so again, gave Trump the opportunity to take control of the narrative but one thing is very clear. This is not something he enjoys doing. Didn't want to be arrested again, he didn't even want to have his mug shot taken. He wants to be focusing on the campaign and polls and I'm told by people around him that he is increasingly agitated when it comes to talking about these legal matters. He's increasingly annoyed and he is particularly angry when it comes to that case in Georgia where we saw him again yesterday being processed in a jail.",

And in a country where he has been something we've never seen before in this country, a minority President at all times. He's never had more than half the country thinking he's good at it or wanting him to be it. I'm not sure that it will come across much of the country the way that they're spinning it to be that he's defiant. I think other people will see it in different ways. The thing is, Becky, as you know, mug shots, and particularly in this country, can really become iconic, and they can hang with you a long time. There have been other political leaders here who have had their mug shots taken who frankly look a lot more cheerful about it than he does here, obviously. But there have been celebrities. There have been civil rights leaders, people whose images really stand out over the years. And in some cases, like those civil rights leaders, they become iconic images of people standing up for rights and making good things happen. For celebrities, sometimes they become iconic of the low spots in their lives. And sometimes for politicians, they become the thing that says, this person is not purely on the straight and narrow, even if they're later acquitted, and all this. So Donald Trump is raising money off of this, he clearly wants to make this his first step back to the presidency. But it's important to remember, in most cases and millions of cases, or at least in millions of cases, it has been the first step toward prison. So we'll see how it plays out for him.",

There is no way they're happy about this, because Donald Trump, more than anything else, it would seem has been somebody who is always obsessed about how he's presented his appearance. I mean, look at his campaign events, look at his normal events, the degree to which he tries to stage directed. And make sure that he's always in the best possible light with the flags behind them and looking as strong and presidential as he possibly can be, no matter what he does with this image.

The point is that that village that you mentioned, Robotyne that has now been claimed by the Ukrainian side does represent a substantial advance beyond the first line of Russian defenses. And that, of course, is important not just in so far as it allows Ukrainian forces potentially, to begin expanding that wedge into the Russian defenses. But it is of course important in terms of morale and momentum, the two things that we're going to be looking at over the course of the coming hours and days as Ukrainian forces trying to consolidate those gains. What we understand is that there is a good deal of fighting further to the east of that village as well where Ukrainian say they are also making advances. And perhaps most importantly, what we're hearing from the Russian bloggers on the other side are tales of dispirited morale, poor defenses, and a lack of manpower. And this is something that we're also hearing from independent voices, Becky. And I think that's important now to be the DC based Institute for the Study of four who is that which is suggesting also a lack of manpower at those defenses on the Russian side.

And ever since then, it's not seen a proposal to dump nuclear waste that it's not endorsed. And that includes nuclear submarines, nuclear reactors that were dumped by the nuclear powers in the 1960s 1970s, and even the 1980s. So the IAEA's job is not to protect the environment, it's not there to protect the human rights of in this case, Fukushima citizens or the wider Asia Pacific region. In fact, the IAEA was an early advocate of the discharge option that the Japanese government has unfortunately opted for and started as of yesterday, as early as 2013. The IEA was saying to the Japanese government, you need to consider discharge of this nuclear waste. So it's not a surprise. But it's clearly not a serious assessment. They made their decision many years ago before even their task force got a chance to report.",

And one of the thingsthat this government task force in Japan and under the Ministry of Economy, was to look at the options because this groundwater was accumulating from day one of the disaster on March 11. And that's particularly to do with the structure of the site. They moved very close to the Pacific Ocean. And so the groundwater that comes from the mountains basically enters the site. Now basically, that's the main reason why there's so much contaminated water. The taskforce identified a number of options injecting underground, evaporating into the atmosphere. They also looked at the storage of the wastewater and the processing of that wastewater, all of those options were ruled out, largely because of cost. They've gone for the cheapest option, which is to pollute the Pacific Ocean.",

What we're talking about are a whole range of different radionuclides such as tritium, carbon 14, but also plutonium, strontium-90. All of these behave differently in the environment and in the marine environment. What we're concerned about is how these radioactive materials concentrate or bio-accumulate in marine life. We know from the science including on tritium, that tritium has a particular characteristic where it concentrates in cells of plants and animals. And that damages the cell structures including the DNA, and therefore increases the potential for cancer is a long term problem.",

If you bind that water into concrete, mixing it with concrete as you normally require a large amount of water,the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi site and this is also one of the bigger contexts of this discharge. The decommissioning of the Fukushima site is going to go on for decades, if not centuries. It's way beyond what the Japanese government is talking about at the moment. They need a lot of concrete; the least environmentally damaging option would be to store that on land. And if you incorporate into concrete, not to spread it around and buildings in Tokyo, but to actually use it on the site that may well be a viable option.",
