You can see how that is a problem.You're also looking out because just beyond those trees you'll find the coast and you will also find a community that is named Wilbur-By- The-Sea, that community, the sheriff is out there right now still evacuating some condos because they have deemed dozens of structures out there to be unsafe, directly correlated with coastal erosion. So not only are we still, what, seven, eight hours after landfall of then-hurricane Nicole dealing with the wind, the rain, the flooding, but also this is a state that is going to now have a bit of a new coastline in some areas because coastal erosion remains a big threat for a lot of those structures that are now deemed unsafe and still being evacuated at this hour, Kate.",

Month over month we saw price declines for apparel, airfare, used cars, fresh fruit. Used cars, in particular, that was a big driver of this better-than- expected inflation report.One economist said that the \"used car bubble is rapidly deflating.\" Now markets are loving this news. The Dow surging 900 points, around 3 percent, even bigger gains for the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ, they're on track for their best day since April of 2020.

We don't know exactly where. We -- there's a lot of debt out there right now amongst corporations. And as rates go up, and you know, you probably will see not maybe as strong of a movement in the future, but certainly still some more rate hikes. It's -- it goes back to the old Warren Buffett quote about how you know that when the tide pulls back, you can see who's been swimming without shorts, and we are seeing that. We saw it in England, we see it in the crypto markets, we've seen it in tech but you also see bright spots in energy, you see bright spots in the industry so I don't think it's going to be an across-the-board market slide.
