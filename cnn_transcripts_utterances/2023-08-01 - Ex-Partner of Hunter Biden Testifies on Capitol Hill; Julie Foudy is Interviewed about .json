They are demanding documents, they're demanding information after a judge rejected a plea deal over Hunter Biden's failure to pay millions of dollars in tax.The probe comes after one of his former business partners testified behind closed doors on Capitol Hill yesterday as part of the Republican inquiry into Biden's family businesses. Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman says Devon Archer told lawmakers then vice -- the then vice president's son would occasionally put his father on the speakerphone during business meetings. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Approximately 20 times, over the course of ten year relationship, Hunter may have put his father on the phone with any number of different people, and they never once spoke about any business dealings.

I mean even the -- even the -- kind of the star witness said that he provided the illusion of access.There's risk here for both. I mean, obviously, none of this looks good for the Biden family. But if you go back to 2022, in an election where a majority of Americans disapproved of Biden's performance and almost 80 percent said the economy was in bad shape, Democrats overperformed precisely because too many voters thought Republicans - that Republican choices were extremists. And going forward with an impeachment on the illusion of access is not, I think, you know, kind of a formula for those 18 Republicans in Biden districts or even the further circle of Republicans in districts that Trump won only narrowly.",

Lobbyists do it all the time with their former bosses. Family members trade off this on a pretty regular basis.But it looks - it looks bad. And it seems to be contrary to what the president said in terms of, he had no conversations with the son about his business whatsoever. My question - my biggest question right now is, does this resonate with anybody outside of the sphere that we kind of all operate in? JESSICA WASHINGTON, SENOR REPORTER, \"THE ROOT\": I think to a certain extent it will resonate with some voters. But I do think this kind of -- we have no direct connection to Biden in anything unethical at this point. And so right now we're talking about Hunter Biden, who isn't in the administration. It's not like the Trump kids where they had these close business ties, where he brought them into the administration.

Joining us now to discuss is TNT soccer analyst, two-time World Cup champion Julie Foudy. Julie, I'm going to be honest, when I started getting really nervous is when they kept showing you on screen and your foot was bobbing up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down. And I thought, OK, this is not good. Is that an accurate assessment of things? JULIE FOUDY, TWO-TIME FIFA WOMEN'S WORLD CUP CHAMPION: (INAUDIBLE). Yes, I was sitting next to Mia Hamm on one shoulder and Joy Fawcett on the other, two '99ers teammates, and we kept like going like, oh God, especially when it hit the post.

They don't look fit. They're playing as individuals. It's OK to be confident, but you never want to cross that line of being arrogant. And this is exactly what can come and bite you.

I think it's more of a situation where you have 14 players on this team of 23 who are in their first World Cup. So, I see a lot of deer in headlights type of play, where typically these creative, fluid players that you see playing professionally and see playing with the national team are bringing more of that creative, fluid style. But you're not seeing any of that. And that happens. And you can see the nerves on this team. And so I think you have that veteran group and you do have, obviously I just said you have 14 newbies. But you have, you know, nine who have - and some who have played in four World Cups, Megan Rapinoe, Kelley O'Hara, Alex Morgan, who are saying to the team, look, it hasn't been the prettiest, but we are through as a nation. That's the first job we had to get done. And now, yes, we have Sweden, which is a very good team, but at least we're alive and we're playing. And that's what they're thinking going into this next game. And you start fresh. And then you spin it that way because otherwise you'd be like pulling your hair out going, what's happening here?
