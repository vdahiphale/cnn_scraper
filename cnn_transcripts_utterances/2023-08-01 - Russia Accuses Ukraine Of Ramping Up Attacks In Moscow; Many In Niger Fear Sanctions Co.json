Kyiv says Moscow has carried out a new deadly strike in the hometown of the Ukrainian president. At least six people were reportedly killed, dozens were wounded when two ballistic missiles hit a school building and a residential tower. Official say a 5-year-old girl was among the dead. Russia's Defense Minister said his country would respond to any kind of Ukrainian attacks by intensifying their strikes on Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SERGEI SHOIGU, RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Given the current situation, we took additional measures to improve defense against attacks from the air and sea. The intensity of strikes against Ukrainian military facilities, including those used to conduct these terrorist acts has been increased many times over.

In Moscow, this Ukrainian drone attack Sunday night bringing Russia's war hundreds of miles away into the heart of its own capital, shocking citizens. LIYA, MOSCOW WITNESS (through translator): My friends and I rented an apartment to come here and unwind. And at some point, we heard an explosion, and it was like, a wave. Everyone jumped. ROBERTSON (voice over): Attacks like this in Moscow becoming increasingly common. Last week, another Ukrainian drone hit a Ministry of Defense building, a psychological blow for a population repeatedly told by Putin's state media they are winning the so-called special military operation.

Medvedev has said that he would use this before, he is the spokesman for Putin in this regard. But I think it's important that we take this very, very seriously. And I can guarantee you that on the U.S. side, and I would hope on the other NATO partners that have nuclear weapons, that they are various -- you know, very serious about how they want to approach what their posture is relative to these threats. You can't discount them, you can't throw these threats away, you need to take them seriously, you need to make sure that you're prepared in case there is some catastrophic mistake that's going to take place. To your second point, I think it is important to realize that what Ukraine is doing in Moscow right now may have an effect on Russian capabilities and command and control capabilities. But also I think, at this point, it's a fool's errand. Ukraine doesn't need to be making strikes into Moscow. The results are, I would suggest, are probably sketchy at this point. And if it is demonstrating that Ukraine has the ability to do this, fine, now is not the time to do it. Look, the only reason to conduct an event like this, strikes like this is to try to further weaken Putin's position, the best way to do that is if you can -- Ukraine can continue to achieve levels of success tactically on the battlefield, and start sending young men home in body bags, that will increase the amount of pressure that Putin feels.",

Because the storm is moving to the west now will likely not continue, either stall, stop or possibly turn a little bit to the right and spend days over the islands here, very close to Okinawa and the like.

[00:30:00] We'll look at the costs of nuclear power in a moment, but you know, yes, nuclear energy is carbon free, but spent fuel from a nuclear reactor remains radioactive for tens of thousands of years and using nuclear energy to lower carbon emissions, in the past, it's been said it's a bit like, you know, smoking to lose weight. Yes, it works, but it comes with a whole lot of other problems. Well, I do think this is a historic day to have this new nuclear reactor connected, but as you say, there are many issues that nuclear energy has to address in order to grow at the immense scale that any energy source has to get to, to really be an important part of mitigating the terrible threat of climate change.

So why not invest the billions of dollars that may go into nuclear into renewable, safe forms of clean energy, get more bang for your buck, and have a hole lot clear -- have true clean energy. Not -- no radioactive waste that can last for hundreds of thousands of years? MATTHEW BUNN, PROFESSOR OF THE PRACTICE OF ENERGY, HARVARD'S BELFER CENTER: Well, to be fair, the great advantage of nuclear energy is that it is not intermittent, unlike wind and solar. You need something when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Now that something doesn't necessarily have to be nuclear. It could be geothermal. It could be fossil fuels with carbon capture. It could be a variety of things. Batteries are extremely helpful for shifting from a sunny afternoon to energy you want to use in the evening, but they're not as good yet for being able to shift from July to January, when there's a lot less sun.

The world remains extremely dependent on coal, oil, natural gas, especially in the transportation sector, but also in electricity and industry.There's really an immense amount of work to do to get to that net-zero carbon that we all want to shoot for to limit the damage of climate change. One of the things that's driving interest in reactors like the one that was connected in Georgia today is the desire to get of dependence on Russian national natural gas with the war in Ukraine. So while there isn't much of a market for this reactor design in the United States, both Ukraine and Poland have expressed interest in building reactors like the one in Georgia. Whether they'll find the money to pay for it, especially Ukraine, is an interesting question.",
