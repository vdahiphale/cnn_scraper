He is hyping the time on his own social media account, saying it is going to happen around 7Jake, one thing, though, that still seems to be not clear to at least Trump's team of what's going to happen once he is here and goes into the Fulton County jail behind me is that idea of whether or not he is going to have a mug shot. Now, the sheriff here has insisted all along every single day that Trump is going to be treated like every other defendant has, like every other defendant is, which, of course, includes processing, fingerprinting, and having that mug shot taken. We have seen it for everyone else who has turned themselves in, including just Mark Meadows a few hours ago. But I was told as of this morning there were still two people who were involved in those discussions and aware of those discussions who said it was not yet clear whether or not there is going to be a Donald Trump mug shot. They had been having these ongoing conversations about that. Now, whether or not that is what happens I mean it seems like if they are sticking with what the sheriff has been saying which is that he's going to be treated like everyone else that that will be the case when he arrives here in just a matter of hours. But that's just one detail that remains to be sorted out, as he preparing to surrender himself here, Jake.",

It seemed to be the district attorney calling that other codefendant's bluff here.But Trump's team has weighed in saying that they oppose that date that is no surprise they think that is way too soon. They believe that this is something that should happen much further in the future if it even happens before the presidential election. Obviously, that's something they've been arguing in other cases. But certainly here given the complexity of this case, not just Trump, it's 18 codefendants, and the RICO charges these racketeering charges that he is facing they are arguing that that should not happen. Of course, what it's ultimately up to is the judge here, Scott McAfee, who is a relatively young judge in this case and what he decides about when that hearing when that trial is actually going to take place.",

He was unhappy with his legal team here in Georgia because he's kind of had this idea as he has with other indictments that they should be able to prevent the indictment from happening at all, Jake. And, obviously, that has not been something they've been able to do at least with the other three situations.But here, the legal team that has been handling this investigation that has been going on for two and a half years, Drew Findling and Jennifer Little and a third attorney. Trump was unhappy that essentially they were able to do that. That's part of what led to the fact that he has been asking around for other attorneys. He's now settled on a top criminal defense attorney from the Atlanta area to go with him. Of course, how they handle this, what this looks like if they're the ones that ultimately take it to trial remains to be seen. But also a notable development. It's something we've seen happen with other indictments where he has decided to shake up the legal team including with his January 6th legal team on that federal indictment. They brought in John Lauro there around that indictment. So that is going to be the case going forward that will be the new attorney appearing with Trump here in Atlanta.",

For the January 6th committee, one of their big conclusions was that every road of this alleged conspiracy went right through Mark Meadows, which is why it was so surprising when he was not charged in the federal case.Now, I will say he has one of probably the best legal teams. He's represented by George Terwilliger. He is a top former Justice Department official. He has a great team of lawyers and they have artfully managed to avoid him being prosecuted as at the federal level. So, I think we there were at the time, clearly when you're the chief of staff everything should run through you. But Mark Meadows, you know, he really tried in many ways to enable everything the former president wanted to do, particularly after the election.

You can get things removed to federal court, but you have to meet some criteria. The biggest thing is to know that what you're claiming is look it was part of my job. It's called the color of office.I was doing that which I was required to do and able to do. And so, this ought to be in federal court. I was chief of staff. However, the elections are the purview of the states and there might be a bit of a hurdle to climb to suggest that as chief of staff, I had some reason or job reason to meddle as it's alleged in this incidence. Another thing, of course, is the why you wanted to go to federal court. Number one, a different and wider jury pool, right, not just Fulton County, but the northern district of Georgia which was much more expansive. I think you got, of course, the federal docket, meaning it can be a little bit quicker in the process of it. The rules for the judges are a little bit more developed. They've published their opinions more often so of course they have a case law precedent to build on. A number of factors are in play. But if your sole motivation is because you do not want a certain jury, that's not going to bode as well as having a substantive basis to suggest I was doing what I'm allowed to do in my job. But he's got to actually to show that, not the highest of burdens to actually meet but it's significant. We were talking about what will that mean in terms of removal? Does that mean it's now a state violation and a state conviction? Is it pardonable? A little bit of uncharted territory.",

Once difference jury selection in the state court pretty much the lawyers get to do it. You get to talk to the jurors you get to know them. You get to let them know you and you sort of start to lay your case out a little bit. Federal court is a much more rigid process. Oftentimes federal judges do a lot of the voir dire.
