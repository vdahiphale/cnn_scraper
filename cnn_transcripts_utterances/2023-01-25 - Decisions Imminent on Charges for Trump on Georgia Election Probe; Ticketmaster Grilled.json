This whole situation has already accomplished two big things. One, it has shined a bright light on what is normally an arcane issue. The idea some companies are just too dominant. Two, Live Nation has done the unthinkable, bridged the partisan divide in Washington. Listen to what Senator Richard Blumenthal said to the Live Nation executive.SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Mr. Berchtold, I want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement. You have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause. Unfortunately, your approach today in this hearing is going to solidify that cooperation. Because as I hear and read what you have to say, it's basically -- it's not us. It's everyone but us. May I suggest respectfully that Ticketmaster ought to look in the mirror and say, I'm the problem. It's me.",

Now Live Nation tried its best to, as Taylor Swift would say, shake it off. The Live Nation president and CFO, he blamed the fiasco on Vox, run by scalpers. And for the first time he pointed the finger at cyber-attacks that flooded the system. The Live Nation executive, he apologized and said the company learned some valuable lessons here. Now of course the question is what can be done? One idea that was floated during this hearing is that maybe the tickets could be made nontransferable to keep a lid on prices. Others say the real problem is competition or, rather, a lack of competition in this industry. It's possible that today's hearing gives the Justice Department political cover to file an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation. Senator Blumenthal even suggested that one solution here is to have the DOJ unwind the controversial 2010 merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster that created this ticketing behemoth in the first place. Basically, undo the deal altogether. Effectively the DOJ would be saying -- and I can't resist one more Taylor Swift pun here -- the DOJ would be saying I knew you were trouble when you walked in -- Max and Bianca. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He promised to go back to basics, focus on the economy, those bread and butter issues addressing what he says is the pandemic of inflation which is hovering around 7 percent. In the end inflation, rising crime and inequality, the issue that New Zealanders are really concerned about, as to why Jacinda's popularity and the Labour Party's popularity has waned. They're trailing the Conservative National Party 32 to 37 percent in the polls. And then of course, that shock resignation last week by Jacinda Ardern citing that she was burnt out. That she had -- excuse me -- nothing left in the tank. But political commentators say that she has -- if she had gone to the polls and had sought re-election for a third term, she would have lost. But before Hipkins was sworn this morning, Jacinda Ardern addressed the public for the last time as Prime Minister, saying that this was the greatest privilege of my life. There is no doubt that this woman put New Zealand on the map. She was the youngest Prime Minister. She had a baby in office. Took her daughters to the U.N. General Assembly. And then of course, her handling of the terror attacks back in 2019 she did with grace, empathy and compassion. You know, she was a global icon. There is no doubt about it. An international star but, sadly, her style waned back home. Chris Hipkins has less than 9 months to turn around his party's fortunes.",
