The marriage between the two banks is the latest attempt to calm panicked investors and nervous markets.UBS will pay nearly three and a quarter billion dollars for the 167- year-old Credit Suisse. That's about 60 percent less than what Credit Suisse was valued at when markets closed on Friday. And UBS will now assume up to $5.4 billion in losses in a deal backed by a massive Swiss guaranteed.

The U.S. and Europe are highly skeptical of that, but Xi Jinping has made it perfectly clear that China is committed to finding a resolution to this year long war in Ukraine.He wrote an article in a Russian newspaper that was published this morning, celebrating the close ties between China and Russia. Now last month, China proposed this 12-point peace plan calling for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia an end to Western sanctions but it does not address Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory. [01:10:011] Now, China's peacemaking credentials were recently bolstered as you may remember, when it facilitated the reestablishing of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Kremlin interestingly claims to be giving the proposal quote, great attention. We know that the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that he is also willing to speak to Xi. There is much talk that virtual talks will happen although that has yet been confirmed. But Laila, the U.S. isn't buying any of this. It believes that Xi is considering Russia's request to supply with lethal weapons including artillery shells and attack drones. And that this, as you said, is a blatant show of solidarity between the two countries and the strengthening of ties. These two leaders have met 39 times since Xi came to power in 2012. And, as we know, Xi just cemented his precedent breaking third term in power. These are two men who position themselves as leaders for life and quite frankly, this partnership is about creating a new global order with China firmly at the helm. The timing is critical for Putin. His invasion of Ukraine has stalled. Military casualties are mounting and just last week, the International Criminal Court, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for war crimes against Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. I mean, he desperately needs a distraction. As you mentioned, Xi is expected to land in Moscow in just over five hours 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time, 1:30 p.m. local time. There will be an informal lunch at the Kremlin ahead of main talks. Laila.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Russian President Vladimir Putin made a surprise visit to the shattered Ukrainian city of Mariupol, fresh from being issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court which has accused him of kidnapping thousands of Ukrainian children and taking them to Russia. The city of Mariupol this time a year ago was encircled by the Russian military and being bombarded from land, sea and air by Russian forces. There were tens of thousands of residents hiding in the basements of their apartment buildings terrified, drinking rainwater that was being collected in gutters. I interviewed some of these people as they were shell shocked fleeing that city and describe to me burying their neighbors who had been hit by shrapnel in the front yards of apartment buildings. On this visit, the Russian President arrived by military helicopter drove himself in a short distance to the outskirts of the city to see some apartment buildings that the Russian government has constructed over the course of the occupation of the last year met with a handful of residents who thanked him for giving them new apartments when they had nothing due to the consequences the devastating consequences of the invasion. A top Kremlin aide described efforts to build new hospitals, kindergartens, and a new drama theater amid the Russian siege of last year, hundreds of residents had hidden in the Mariupol drama theater, which was then subsequently shelled.

So we have more than -- we have billions of funds in excess.The government is saying that within perhaps 10 to 15 years, there will be a 10 billion deficit that he needs to that they say they need to fill in. But when we take a closer look at it, 10 billion euros is less than the profits of sometimes single corporations in France, that single corporation sometimes they generate more than double, sometimes even three times that amount of profits each year. So it's a very, very little amount of money. And the government is saying we will not make a shareholders pay, we will not make the corporation's pay, we will not make the banks pay, we will make the workers' pay for that deficit by working more and more and more, despite the fact that our corporations, banks, insurance, you name it, whatever, generates huge amount of wealth and profits every year.

While this latest violence comes weeks after Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians in Hawara following the shooting of two Israeli brothers. U.S. President Joe Biden has directly weighed in on the controversial judicial reforms being proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They spoke by phone on Sunday and the White House says President Biden underscored the importance of checks and balances in democratic societies and told the Prime Minister any fundamental changes should have broad support.

Elliott Gotkine reports now from Jerusalem (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST (on camera): As surely as night follows day Saturday night these past 11 weeks in Israel has meant mass demonstrations against the government's judicial overhaul. Protesters are concerned it will remove pretty much all checks and balances on the government, allowing it to appoint allies as top judges and removing the Supreme Court's ability to strike down laws except in very narrow circumstances. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who leads the most right wing and religiously conservative government in Israel's history, says his overhaul is required to restore the balance between the government and the judiciary. But the protesters don't buy it. They worry it will erode Israel's claim to be a liberal democracy and that will damage the economy and infringe upon their freedoms of expression worship and the right to demonstrate precedent. Isaac Hertzog attempts to broker a compromise unveiled earlier this week were rejected by the government and though his warnings of civil war seem far-fetched for now, so long as the overhaul continues, its passes through parliament the protests will continue.

In August 2010, the last U.S. combat troops left Iraq, leaving behind a brutal, corrupt, deeply-flawed, democratic regime, riven by sectarian tensions. Which provided fertile ground for the rampage of the Islamic State or ISIS, spilling over from the war in Syria into Iraq. ISIS seized control of the northern city of Mosul and then captured city after city, reaching the outskirts of Baghdad. It took more than three years of bitter combat and foreign military assistance to defeat the group. That enemy vanquished, old discontent resurfaced. In 2019, Baghdad was gripped by massive protests against corruption, sectarianism and poor living conditions. But like protest movements across the region, it too was crushed. As the U.S. invasion and occupation fade into history, neighboring Iran plays an ever greater role in the country's affairs. Old problems, corruption, dysfunctional infrastructure and unemployment remain unresolved. Yet despite it all, today Baghdad is more peaceful than it has been in years. Ben Wedeman, CNN.

It's set to hit California late on Monday bringing even heavier rain and snow. Cities in both California and Arizona have issued level 2 excessive rain risks for the start of the week. Well, officials in Ecuador have lowered the death toll from Saturday's earthquake from 60 to 13 but the number of injured has risen to more than 460. In the province of El Oro homes, schools, medical centers and highways were damaged, leaving people struggling to cope with the aftermath. CNN's Ana Maria Canizares filed this report. Sorrow, concern and multiple buildings and houses damaged is what we found here in El Oro, the most affected province by this Saturday's earthquake. It was a 6.8 shock that caused severe structural damage to homes, schools, medical centers and even highways in three neighboring provinces -- El Oro, Guayas and (INAUDIBLE). We are in Machala, the capital of El Oro. Several brick made houses collapsed here and in some cases, people got trapped. Even one of the city's largest hotels had to be evacuated because it showed evidence of damage. The government reports hundreds of injured so the death toll can easily increase. This two-story house in downtown Machala collapsed. Some survived but three people died.",

Some in Washington have expressed concerns that the app could be used by the Chinese government to spy on users or gain access to their data. It all comes as TikTok's impact on global culture is becoming harder to ignore. The app has more than one billion users around the world. And here in the U.S., it's been the most downloaded app for the last two years. So despite the growing scrutiny on Capitol Hill, some lawmakers have continued to embrace TikTok if cautiously. Among them freshman Congressman Jeff Jackson. His videos documenting his new job have racked up millions of views, like this one explaining some of the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.
