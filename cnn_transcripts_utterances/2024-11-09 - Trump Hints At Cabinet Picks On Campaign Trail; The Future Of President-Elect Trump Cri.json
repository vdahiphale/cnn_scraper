This is what she said. [06:10:00] Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race. Kamala may have.

Now, is there room to talk better and more intelligently and run at certain problems, like economic problems, the migration crisis that this country, again, like every other major industrialized democracy is facing? Yes, you could definitely talk about it better. You can engage people differently.

The two Americans are in custody and have been ordered held pending trial. According to court documents, Iranian government officials tasked Farhad Shakeri, 51 years old, to focus on in recent weeks to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Donald Trump. He couldn't come up with a plot in a short timeframe before the election and the Iranians believed that Trump would lose and that they could target him later. Shakeri is still at large in Iran, the Justice Department says. Now, also on the target list of the Iranians, journalists and activists Masih Alinejad, a prominent critic of the Iranian regime who the FBI says that the Iranians have tried to kill several other times. Prosecutors say Shakeri told the FBI in voluntary interviews about the tasks that he was given by the IRGC. Now this includes plans for a mass shooting targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka. And he also told the FBI that he was tasked with surveilling and assassinating two Jewish businesspeople living in New York City. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran is trying to retaliate for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed IRGC General Qasem Soleimani. They have plotted to kill Trump, who ordered the strike, as well as a number of prominent Trump administration officials.

They are clearly hate speech. But the question is, do they rise to the level of being a hate crime? Are they inciting, directly inciting some sort of criminal action? Which is generally the standard that people look at to determine that. So that's something that I think investigators and particularly prosecutors will have to look at for some time. There are other ways that these men messages might be criminal and that turns to the actions of the people who are behind sending them. So if they are based on and using information that has been, for instance, stolen from people or stolen from data brokers or other repositories of personal information, then that could lead to a criminal prosecution.

I would -- it looks to me like they are probably utilizing the data that is contained and accumulated by data brokers. So there are businesses out there that are pulling together all of our data and trying to build kind of profiles of each of us, and you can access that data if you're willing to pay the price for it. So that's one way that a group or an individual might be able to put their hands on the sort of information that would enable them to craft these messages.

Coming up, details on the complicated evidence that jurors are wading through to reach a verdict in the tragic murder of two teen girls. And a programming note, a look at how new weight loss medications are transforming lives. Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports, is Ozempic right for you? Premieres Sunday, November 17th at 8(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:40:00] WALKER:  Jury deliberations continue this morning in the Delphi Indiana double murder trial. Richard Allen is accused of killing two teenage girls, 14-year-old Liberty German and 13-year-old Abigail Williams more than seven years ago. The girls also known as Libby and Abby never returned home after going for a hike in February 2017. The case gained national attention partly due to a photo and audio of the suspect on Libby's cellphone. Joining me now from Delphi is Susan Hendricks, a veteran broadcast journalist and one of the first reporters to cover this case and speak with the victims' families. Susan is also the author of \"Down the Hill: My Descent Into the Double Murder in Delphi\". Susan, it's great to see you this morning. This was not a slam dunk case for the prosecution, was it? You've been watching this trial. It's day three of deliberations. Based on everything that you have seen and heard in court, are you getting any indications as to which way the jury may be leaning? SUSAN HENDRICKS, JOURNALIST &amp; AUTHOR:  Yes, Amara, good to see you. It's so stressful at this point because you never really know -- I was in court every day looking at the jurors, listening to the testimony. And in Indiana, this is what gave me a little bit of an indication was you're allowed to ask questions and they had a lot of Intelligent questions. But they have a lot to go through. There's I think, 387 pieces of evidence, and you mentioned that call, Amara, what was on that video, Libby German's phone that day? She knew well enough that there was a man on the Monon High Bridge, she didn't recognize him, so, she hit record on the phone. Well, we finally after more than seven years we're able to hear in court what was on that phone. I looked over at Abby and Libby's families that were to the left of me in the seating there and tears all around because you heard their voices sounding so young and scared, saying there's no path down here, I think it's this way. Then you hear the man's voice and you see him on Libby's phone. She was holding it down and kind of not wanting him to see this. That's when he said guys, down the hill which we've been hearing about and finally we were able to see.",

The state is saying we absolutely can because he came forward a few days after the girls were murdered and said, went to the district sheriff's office, they followed up with him in a grocery store parking lot.[06:45:00] And he said, I was out there but I really didn't see anyone.  His name is Richard Allen, it was filed as Richard Whiteman, the street that he lived on, and that's tip went away. And he lived in a small town. So, he put himself there also, what's on Libby's phone and the other students. It was a day out from school, it was a Monday, the girls who were down there at the time, the prosecution is kind of piecing together a timeline. And saying, look, this was Richard Allen, he put himself there, we have surveillance of a car that he drove, that didn't have the plate still, but the defense is saying, look, there's no DNA, nothing links from there, it's circumstantial. So, the jury has a lot to go through, but they did say they wanted extra hours. So, they're coming in this morning at 10:00 a.m., I will be outside of that court house, and I'm wondering like, does that mean they want to pack, that they're going home because they are sequestered, but you really never know.",

But the fire threat still remains across portions of the northeast, especially as we head into the weekend here.So, one of the things we're going to notice is, you've already got a lot of those alerts in place because of the fire. One of those fires in northern New Jersey, the New Jersey Forest Fire Services talking about smoke being visible from Interstate 287 in those locations. And we know that several structures are nearby in that fire. But again, the fire threat is not just for New Jersey. You can see all of these areas here in pink, about 28 million people under that potential for the red flag warnings and the fire risk. All of these areas are extremely dry right now. So, when you get those new fires, it really doesn't take much to spread them very quickly even with lower-than normal winds. Look at some of these. All of these areas are well below normal and not just for this month, but since September 1st. Now, they are going to get some rain as we head into the latter half of the weekend, but it's going to go by very quickly, which means it's not going to be a lot. It's not going to be a drought-buster for these areas that they would really like to see. But at least, at this point, something is expected to help. Now, out into the west, we're not so much talking about rain, but we're talking about the snow and incredibly high amounts of snow. Look at some of these numbers, 40 inches, 36, 32, and this one right here, 31.7 inches in Las Vegas, New Mexico, that is an all-time November record, the most snow they've ever had for the entire month of November. And in some of these places, Denver's only had maybe single-digit numbers, but that number is going to keep rising because they're still expecting more snow as we go to the next several hours before that system finally exits, which is why you have the Winter weather advisories in effect.",
