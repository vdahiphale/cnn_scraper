They've been trying to figure out a lot more about the suspect what he's been doing the last few days, the last few weeks, where he's been, who he's talked to. The type of things that he associated threats that reportedly were associated with him, he apparently, according to some of the intelligence shared by law enforcement officials in the last few hours. He made a threat to a military installation there in Maine near where this shooting occurred. It's very unusual to have a situation where we have not only two shooting scenes, right, where we have multiple people have killed it, you know, for shooter to go from one location, go to another location.

They call those assets very critical to the search. We had as that press conference was going on the Canada Border Services Agency put out an alert saying that there might be someone who is armed and dangerous.

And so the role of the FBI and sort of the Marshal Service and some of the others who've now gone up there is to try to bring some of the resources like they have. For example, you know, one of the things that they're doing is going through electronic records, right? They can look to see what kind of searches he's done on his phone, they can look to see where his phone has been in the period of days before this, that he, for example, leave a vehicle somewhere that he can get away, right, because we know we found. What they found one of his vehicles or the vehicle that was associated with him at that boat launch, but clearly he's not there, because if you see the posture of the law enforcement in that area, they don't believe he's there. So the question is, you know, how far did he get? Could he have gone as far as the border more likely? Maine, as we were just talking about a little bit out there is sparsely populated.

We had some heroic efforts by our team members last night, continuing it today. They provided expert and compassionate care. One of the challenges with identifying patients early on was the speed with which our teams needed to act. We had a first patient arrive at 7.24 p.m. And over the next 45 minutes, we received a total of 14 patients. Eight of those patients were admitted to our hospital. Three of those patients are deceased. Two were discharged home and one was transferred to Maine Medical Center. We also had one patient that was taken to St. Mary's Hospital. For the eight patients who are currently admitted, five of those are in stable condition. Three are in critical condition. We're not going to comment at this time on the gender or the ages of those patients. Nor are we going to comment on the nature of those injuries. I'd like to thank also all the hospitals, health care providers, EMS agencies and air service. From Augusta to Portland, we had incredible support throughout the night and into today. We've had an outpouring support and offers assistance. And again, very much appreciate all those efforts. Once again, I'd want to extend our thoughts and prayers to the families, to their loved ones and to the victims who have been impacted by this tragedy. Thank you very much for your respect for our caregivers and for those families.",

DR. ALEXANDER: You know, in, certainly in the short term, there is an outpouring of assistance that's being offered. And you don't know what resources you need or don't need. So it is helpful, we were able to organize those resources and use them effectively. As an example, we had ambulance services from other counties coming on site. At one point, we had approximately 10 ambulance crews standing by outside of our trauma center to ensure that if we had patients who needed to be transferred, they could be transferred. We received nurses and physicians from some of our area hospitals. We had a helicopter support, not only from our own life flight of Maine, but also from Boston med flight and from Dartmouth.

Our hearts go out to them. REP. CHELLIE PINGREE (D-ME): Yes well. I'm heartbroken like everyone else in Maine. And I think there's a lot of fear in our state right now. This is a very unusual occurrence. We're not used to having a mass shooting in our state, we only had 29 murders in all of last year so to lose this many people in one shooting is terrifying. And as you know, the shooter is still on the loose. So that's a very unusual situation for our state. Not only are people in lockdown in the towns of Lewiston, Lisbon and Auburn, where the shooting occurred and where the shooter was last seen. But schools are closed throughout my district. Even in Portland in South Portland, Maine, businesses are closed. People are feeling very fearful.

We, you know, we frankly, we lose people in the woods who go hunting. And we lose people in the woods who go hiking.

November's the start of hunting season a lot of people go hunting for deer here. A lot of people are, you know, trained to use guns. They collect guns. It's just a long tradition in our state and people have been reluctant to support gun legislation, I think, because they're very concerned about their rights be being interfered with. This is the first time we've dealt with a mass shooting. This is the first time where we've seen up close and personal with an assault style military weapon, not something that's used for hunting, but what kind of damage it can do in a short period of time. So I think there will be a lot of conversations in our state about this. A lot of people talking about, you know, what should we be doing here? As far as my interest in congress, I'm interested in national gun legislation, because I think sometimes it's hard to do it state by state. I think we should have a ban on assault weapons. I think we should have a ban on high capacity magazines that make it easy for someone to shoot over and over and over. And I think Red Flag Law should be a national thing. We have a yellow flag law in our state. And the difference with that is that it has one more layer of protection for the person who may have their gun taken away. So there is a debate about that. And our legislature debated between yellow and red flag laws. I personally, I am in favor of the Red Flag Laws. I'm glad we have a Yellow Flag Law. I don't know if in this case, because this person didn't have previous interaction with law enforcement, if that would have made a difference.
