Twin bombings at a memorial leave nearly more than 100 dead, stoking fears of a regional war. A big reveal or a big nothing burger? Unsealed court documents confirm the big names connected to sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And why weren't the runway warning lights working and what role did that play in a fiery collision at a busy Tokyo airport?Who did it and how will Iran respond? Two key questions right now after nearly 100 people were killed in two deadly explosions at the gravesite of the late Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. Crowds had gathered to mark the third anniversary of his assassination by a US airstrike in Baghdad. So far, no claim of responsibility, but the US has denied involvement and says there's no reason to believe Israel is responsible. Still, Iran's president was quick to blame the Israelis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): These gatherings that you see held in the country, this flood of people that poured towards the grave of Qasem Soleimani these days, you come to scare the people with your criminal act. You're not strong enough to face the resistance. Your power has lost its effectiveness against the forces of resistance. Now you're targeting innocent people? Know you will pay a heavy price for this horrible crime. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Nada Bashir is following the very latest developments, reporting in now from Beirut.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL REPORTER (voice-over): Scenes of chaos in the Iranian city of Kerman. An explosion sending crowds into disarray when a second blast rings out. Thousands had gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of military commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad four years ago. The twin blasts less than a mile from Soleimani's grave, killing more than a hundred and injuring many more. Iranian officials say this was a terror attack. State media reporting that one of the explosions was caused by a bomb inside a suitcase in a car. Soleimani was Iran's revered target, a top military general. This attack on his supporters, seen as a strike against the Iranian regime, which has many enemies both inside and outside the country. In Lebanon the leader of Iran back Hezbollah, commemorated Soleimani's death, but also used his speech on Wednesday to condemn Tuesday's killing of a top Hamas official on his own soil. HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH SECRETARY-GENERAL: Yesterday's crime was large and dangerous. This crime will not be left without, without a response and punishment. Between us and our enemies there is time and the battlefield. BASHIR (voice-over): The strike in southern Beirut targeted Salah al- Arouri and several others in what Hamas has described as a cowardly assassination. And while a U.S. official tells CNN that Israel was behind the strike, Israeli officials have so far been careful not to publicly take responsibility. MARK REGEV, SENIOR ADVISOR TO ISRAELI'S PRIME MINISTER: Israel has not taken responsibility for this attack, but whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. It was not an attack even on Hezbollah. BASHIR (voice-over): Hezbollah, perhaps not the target in Israel's eyes, but the Iran-backed group has long warned that any attack on Lebanese soil would trigger a response of equal severity on Israeli territory. From the outset of the war between Israel and Hamas, fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has been largely contained to Lebanon's southern border region. But the brazen strike in Beirut, in the heart of Hezbollah territory, has raised fears among the United States and its allies that a full-scale war could break out between Israel and the Middle East's most powerful paramilitary force, or even more broadly, across the region.

And I think we have seen that inside of Iran, inside the regime, there is increasing pressure for Iran to respond more directly to the assassination of Iranian generals and others. There's a bit of a belief inside the system that Iran has not responded forcefully enough. And as a result, its deterrence has weakened. On the other side are those within the regime that are arguing that this is a trap. The Israelis want Iran to respond in order for it to be able to enlarge the war and that it is in the strategic benefit of Iran to conduct an indirect war with Israel rather than to do so directly.In all of this, however, one of the measures that would be most effective in really de-escalating the situation would be to have a ceasefire in Gaza. We saw, for instance, that the attacks by Iraqi militias that are close to Iran against U.S. troops completely stopped during the six days that there was a ceasefire in Gaza. The day before the ceasefire, there were six attacks by Iraqi militias against U.S. troops. So, if we truly want to de-escalate this, instead of sending more troops, et cetera, I think we really have to think more closely about the effectiveness of actually having a ceasefire that has proven to be more effective than any other measure that has been done so far.",

Publicly available records show that red warning lights embedded in the tarmac, lights designed to stop pilots from mistakenly taxiing onto active runways, were broken at Haneda Airport for seven days leading up to the accident and on the day of the accident. Five crew members aboard the Coast Guard plane were killed, one injured, and another possible clue to the tragedy. Japanese officials have just released a transcript covering over four minutes of communications between air traffic control and the two planes involved. Just moments before the collision, the control tower says to the Coast Guard plane, referring to its tail number, quote, JA722A Tokyo Tower, good evening, number one, taxi to holding point C5. CNN's analysis indicates that's likely a command to taxi to a point short of the runway, but not on the runway.

They have made it very clear that they are not going to be answering any reporter questions. You know, a big reason why air travel is so safe these days, despite this horrible accident we've seen, but why, broadly speaking, air travel is so safe is because of redundancy. There are so many different procedures, different practices in place to double check safety. And that's where all of these different factors will come into play. We should also point out, John, that the cockpit, the cockpit voice recorders, as well as data recorders, often known as black boxes, they have been retrieved from that Dash 8 turboprop belonging to the Japanese Coast Guard. The cockpit voice recorder and the data recorder from the Airbus have not yet been found. And as we have seen some of these images, I mean, there's very little left of the plane. However, these boxes are meant to withstand even the most severe of conditions. So, that's going to be a priority, especially this afternoon. We should also tell you that Japan Airlines is now expecting a $1 million loss because of this accident. Obviously, that aircraft that was lost, that was in this accident is a total loss, based off of what we have seen. I think that's pretty safe to say. In addition, Japan Airlines does recognize that some passengers may be a bit unsettled right now, and if they are choosing to cancel their reservation, John, the airline is allowing that to occur without any kind of penalty.",
