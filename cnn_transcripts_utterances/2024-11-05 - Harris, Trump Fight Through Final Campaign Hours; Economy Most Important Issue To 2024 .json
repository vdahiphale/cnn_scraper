We have 75 percent, sometimes 70, 75 percent of this country who thinks we're headed on the wrong track, and that's largely because of the immigration issue and the cost of living issues.

And if we look at the polling, I mean, the seven states which are kind of the deciding factors here, I mean, we're within a half a point. And so I don't think it's anything that seems to be factoring into the motivations of voters. If anything, if we look at the polling, the number one issue is cost of living. The number two is immigration and abortion there on after. You really don't see these legal issues coming and rising up. Yes. Is this a -- this is going to be a big deal for him, win or lose.

They would be highly inflationary. It's a picture that we really haven't ever seen, certainly since the 19th century. And so I think people have kind of, you know, gotten that picture and said, hey, this is not what we're looking for. OK? Tariffs, maybe as a targeted tool if we're trying to deal with Chinese dumping in steel or in electric vehicles, but not as an economic strategy.

She's also talked about fighting price gouging. Critics have pointed to that, for instance, and called it price controls, arguing that it's not exactly realistic.How realistic would her plans be for the U.S. economy?

I think that the big line Kamala Harris has had to straddle is how close is she going to stick to the Biden White House and what they did, Bidenomics, if you will, which has become a little bit of a word that Democrats don't love. And how much is she going to go her own way? And I think that she's trying to really straddle that.You can see it in her advisors, frankly, about half of which are, you know, folks that would have worked, say in the Biden White House, Obama, maybe Clinton, years. Others are more her own tight circle. I think that what you're going to see is Harris taking certain parts of the Biden plan. For example, the idea that workers need to make more money. We can't just have an asset based economy. You know, you need to bring down the cost of living for average people. That's what things like her housing plan are about. That's what things like the child tax credits are about. I think you're going to see her kind of taking some of these more populist approaches from the Biden administration and making them her own, focusing on issues that she really cares about. Children, families, racial justice, inequality. These are things that she really, as a prosecutor, as someone throughout her whole career has thought about. And so you're seeing a little bit of a grab bag, I will say, so far in terms of what those policies will be. She's not coming out like Biden did at the very beginning of his tenure and say, hey, I'm about workers. This is about work, not wealth. Kamala Harris is more about straddling line between dynamics and between something new, talking about innovation, talking about freedom, you know, freedom from regulation in some cases. You know, she is really kind of taking a big mix of policies from a lot of different places. And you know, that has been a criticism, I would say during the campaign that, well, what is Kamalanomics, you know, what are we really getting? And we don't have 100 percent clear vision, but we can say that she's going to be focused on family, she's going to be focused on children, and she's certainly going to be focused on the housing market, which is aside from inflation, where a lot of pain still is in the economy.",

The first in the nation placed to have voting on Election Day and the first results that we learned. So there are six residents, they were all invited to be here.

Talk about a close election. We've been talking about it for weeks and weeks that the polls that's so close -- this is literally 50 percent for each. By the way, this is an interesting aside, for governor, the Democrat got one, the Republican got 5. So the Republican won the governor's race. For representative in Congress, the Democrat got 4, the Republican got two; the Democrat on the congressional race. So there's a lot of ticket splitting and a tie. But what happened here in this little (INAUDIBLE) where the voting was, the booths over here, three voting booths with the American flag, the six voters, two shifts of three walked in. I don't know if you can see inside here. They had the ballots in here, pencils, to show (ph) up their ballots, they then dropped their ballots inside this box. This box has been used since 1980 when Ronald Reagan ran against Jimmy Carter and it was locked. The moderator of the town showed the box being empty before the vote started. People put their votes in. When they took them, they saw that it was still empty. A representative from the attorney-general's office of New Hampshire was here to make sure everything was done hunky-dory and it was. And then they counted the votes here and ultimately the votes went on that board. The sign up here, that says \"Dixville Notch, New Hampshire\", that's been used since the 1960s since they began this. In 1960, it was John F. Kennedy against Richard Nixon. John F. Kennedy got zero votes, Richard Nixon got nine votes in that election. Indeed Nixon won New Hampshire but John F. Kennedy won the presidency. So is this vote conclusive today?

And that is why you had people like Kellyanne Conway trying to advise Republicans to be better on this issue. And you had Trump -- you know, Melania Trump came out pretty recently saying that she was pro-choice. That is not an accident.

I think Iowa especially is interesting because there was a strong pool of Nikki Haley supporters around Des Moines, I spoke to quite a lot of them in the primary campaign. Some of them said that they would break back to Trump if she didn't win. But there were significant numbers that said they would never vote for Trump and they wished they could vote for a female candidate.
