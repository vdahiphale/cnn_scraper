In another step toward the return of -- to normalcy, really. Schools across Lebanon are expected to reopen next week, that is according to the country's national news agency. The Lebanese army, meantime, is beefing up its presence in the south as part of the ceasefire agreement. Under the terms of the 60-day truce, Israeli ground forces must withdraw from Lebanese territory, while Hezbollah fighters have to retreat about 40 kilometers, that's roughly 25 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border. And despite the truce, the IDF is ramping up a warning, not allowing anyone to move south of the Litani River. And those living on the other side of the border have also seen their lives turned upside down by the fighting. Our Jeremy Diamond went to one northern Israeli town to talk to residents now that a ceasefire is in place. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The last time I was here, the Israeli military told me I had just three minutes to get in and out, that's because the Lebanese border is right across those concrete barriers on that hillside. Hezbollah sitting right across the border. But now, we are just hours into this ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, which is intended to bring calm and peace to this region. But the residents here in northern Israel, in this town of Shtula, are extremely distrustful of this ceasefire. They don't believe that it is actually, truly making them safer. That's because they fear that this threat of anti-tank missiles which wrought the destruction on this house right here, just several months ago, they fear that, that threat still very much exists, that Hezbollah will be able to come back, re-infiltrate southern Lebanon and ultimately pose a threat to these communities once again. The Israeli government insists that it will act unilaterally against Hezbollah should Hezbollah violate that ceasefire. But we are just hours into it. And for now, this fragile peace has a lot of tests to endure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And, Jennifer, we not justheard from Sullivan there, but also President Biden just in the last 24 hours, pretty much suggesting that this deal gives new hope, right, to ending Israel's other war, and that is with Hamas. Does this administration, you know, in the fact that we've got 60 plus days left off President Biden's term in office, does it believe it can achieve those goals given that President Biden has tried and failed before?",

But I think a big question here is whether that is actually realistic. We have seen these efforts stall out almost entirely over the past several months. There have been moments where there seemed to be a movement forward on these initiatives in the past, only for those to be dashed. And, you know, the rhetoric we are hearing for the administration putting this all Hamas, you and I both know that there have been cases where it has been Hamas that has been the deterrent to this deal. But there have been also cases where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also was putting forward opposition to any sort of plan to bring the war to an end in Gaza. There are reports that his military advisers have pushed him in the past to accept a deal and he has refused to bring an end to the war in Gaza. So, there are questions of whether that motivation has changed, whether the Israeli prime minister is ready to bring an end to the military operations there in the Strip. Now, in terms of this newfound push to get a deal moving forward, we don't have a lot of details of what that will actually look like. President Biden said this would involve a number of countries who have been involved in the past, Qatar and Egypt, for example, but he also said Turkey could play a role here. Now, Isa, we know a number of Hamas officials seem to have relocated to Turkey after Qatar sort of expelled them from the country. So, there is a chance that Istanbul could play -- Ankara, excuse me, could play a role here. But it remains to be seen at what level the negotiations could take place when there will actually be meetings in the past. We've seen Bill Burns lead the negotiations there. We have no sense of when or if he will be traveling to the region. So, there are all a lot of questions that remain about whether this optimism can actually produce any results here, Isa.",
