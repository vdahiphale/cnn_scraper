And finally, theextraordinary Vermeer exhibit stunning the art world. We take you on a private tour with the master of light. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. More than 36,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been injured by the devastating earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria exactly a week ago. But miraculously, people are still being pulled alive from the rubble. There's anger though about the pace of rescue and aid, especially in Syria, already ravaged by the long running war, and by serious President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of limiting humanitarian efforts. Many of the hardest hit areas in Syria were already devastated by Syrian and Russian bombings. Of course, Russia has been focusing that firepower on Ukraine for the past year. Also striking critical infrastructure, like the country's power grid, hospitals, and schools. Meantime, more than 65,000 war crimes have been reported in Ukraine, and the western alliance is committed to investigations and accountability. My first guest tonight, Beth Van Schaack, is the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice. And she's joining me now from her trip to Bangladesh. Ambassador Van Schaack, welcome to the program. BETH VAN SCHAACK, U.S. AMBASSADOR-AL-LARGE FOR GLOBAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE:  Thank you.",

But the problem is really that during the period in the security council, there were three pathways to provide aid to Syria during the conflict. Russia then vetoed those resolutions. So, now there was only one route to provide humanitarian aid. That route has now been damaged by the earthquake. And so, in order to force the provision of humanitarian aid, we would need a new security council resolution to create a new pathway.

The course there are operational, there are war crimes teams, the International Community, including the United States have been funding the provision of experts who have come from the world's War Crime Tribunals to assist the prosecutor general in this incredible challenge. Pathway number two is the International Criminal Court, also currently seized of the situation, because Ukraine has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction. And then finally, you have European courts and legal authorities that are starting investigations, working through a joint investigation team, sharing information, and strategies in order to be able to bring charges when perpetrators come within their jurisdiction. This, however, is the major challenge. As perpetrators remain in Russia, it will be very difficult for many of these justice pathways to operate unless in absentia trials are allowed.

They have -- which one's the defendant is available, identifiable, and whether or not he can work up the chain of command in order to reach more senior figures who may have been the architect of violence. They should also expect the International Community to support the International Criminal Court, which is exercising jurisdiction. The court has essentially global jurisdiction, a number of open investigations in other wartime and atrocity situations. And so, it needs the assistance of the International Community. A number of states have now seconded (ph) personnel, provided additional voluntary contributions, et cetera, to all of these justice efforts. So, this is, as you mentioned, a daunting task. It's an intergenerational challenge. But there are no statutes of limitations for war crimes and other atrocities. And so, we can be bringing cases for the next decade. There are still some cases being brought against living Nazis, one of the last cases that Germany brought was against a very elderly secretary who had been part of the holocaust.

Will you be able to establish a chain of command responsibility and command responsibility? And if he is, either publicly or secretly indicted, will he ever -- is there ever any realistic chance but he might be, you know, brought before a court? I go back to Milosevic, Slobodan Milosevic in Bosnia, who we followed the war crimes court against him at The Hague. And yes, he was taken in but he was arrested inside by his own people and then handed over. What do you think in Russia today?",

There may require a political transformation within Russia, such that he is no longer in power. This may -- it may involve finding jurisdiction over lower-level individuals first. We've seen a fair amount of schism's happening within the defense infrastructure of Russia, various generals being moved around as a strategic blender of this war becomes more and more apparent. And Russia fails to perform on the battlefield, and in fact, it's performing quite poorly, and it has been associated with atrocities, literally, everywhere that Russia's forces have been deployed. And so, some of these individuals may either be tossed out of the country, or they may decide to leave on their own, or risk falling out of a window, for example, as we have seen. So, eventually courts will get jurisdiction over these perpetrators. And your mention of command responsibility is important because prosecutions can be brought against the direct perpetrators. But also, against individuals up the chain of command who knew or should have known that their subordinates were committing abuses and who failed to take the necessary steps to either prevent those abuses or to prosecute those individuals after the fact.",

Indeed, I'm at the largest refugee camp in the world, upwards of a million individuals are here. Fleeing genocide in neighboring Myanmar. I met today with survivors and with their advocates. And every single one of them spoke about the importance of justice. There are, as in Ukraine, multiple different pathways to justice. There is a case that has been opened at the International Criminal Court because Bangladesh is a member of that statute. And so, crimes of deportation that involve the crossing of an international border can be brought before the international criminal court. But also, the Gambia, which is a West African nation has brought suit against Myanmar for state responsibility for genocide under the genocide -- that case is moving forward. And one of the women with whom I spoke had traveled to The Hague in order to support that case. In addition, we've seen Argentina, Germany, and other national courts open or entertain petitions by complainants, by victims, in order to potentially bring the suit before their own national courts under principles of extraterritorial jurisdiction.",

The same reasons that the Russians targeted veterans, the same reason why the far-right targets veterans, and the same reason why Fortune 500 recruiters target veterans. That's because veterans are influential. Americans have a certain respect for veterans that they don't have for other parts of our society. And veterans are, more likely, when they get out of the military there's a lot of negative stereotypes like PTSD. But we're more likely to start our own businesses. When we go to college, we're more likely to graduate with a higher GPA than our peers, and more likely to be community leaders and that doesn't mean just getting elected.

The electrical grid in our modern world is more important than ever. You know, when power gets shut off, people who are in hospitals, people who have medical equipment at home can die as a direct result of that. And the goal of neo-Nazis in these antigovernment extremists isn't only to create a white ethnostate, it's to create chaos necessary to build the fascist movement. They want to convince Americans that their government cannot protect them, so that Americans start to call out for something else. They are going to do everything that they can. And that is their life's purpose to convince Americans that the democracy is not working. And we are there to do just the opposite. We are there to document this kind of criminal activity. To document them sharing information and I'm drawing up plans to do things like attack power grids and to make sure that we can make sure that law enforcement protects -- can intercept them before a terrorist attack happens. Now, to be clear, we haven't done anything like that yet. But I believe that we've got a potential.",

He was known as the master of light, the 17th century Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer, is the subject ofa new exhibition at Amsterdam where 28 of his paintings are shown together for the very first time. The paintings have been subjected to extraordinary scientific study, machines developed by NASA to examine minerals on the moon and mars have revealed an astonishing detail how Vermeer made his masterpieces. Correspondent Nick Glass has had exclusive early access to the exhibition, and it is indeed a wonder. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICK GLASS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  For a glorious 90 minutes, we have the place to ourselves, Vermeer's paintings, their beauty, their size demand intimacy and quiet. And here was an opportunity to spend quality time with his most famous creation. GLASS (on camera):  This is rare. I've been arts correspondent for something like 20 years, and to be alone with a painting like this, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, it's extraordinary. And she's not alone. GLASS (voiceover):  The Rijksmuseum has pulled off an astonishing artistic coup, the greatest Vermeer show of this, or any other lifetime, 28 of the 34, the 37 attributed works. Vermeer himself would never have seen so many of his paintings altogether in one place.",
