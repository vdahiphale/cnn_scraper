Now, this is not the only drug that's in shortage, unfortunately. This number is so, unfortunately, eye-popping. In 2022, last year, 160 drugs were reported as being in shortage. Now, the FDA says they're working with manufacturers to alleviate these shortages, but this is a huge problem. And it's not just albuterol. It's Adderall. It's antibiotics. It's cancer drugs.
