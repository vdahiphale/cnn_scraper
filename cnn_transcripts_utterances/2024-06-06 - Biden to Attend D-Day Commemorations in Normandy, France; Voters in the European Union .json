We heard on Tuesday from Hezbollah's second-in-command Naeem Qasim, who described Lebanon and Hezbollah as being another front to the war in Gaza that they would continue to target northern Israel so long as the war in Gaza continues. And of course we have seen that exchange of rocket fire and drone attacks by both Hezbollah and the Israeli military on either side of that southern border of Lebanon, which has led to the killing of dozens of civilians in Lebanon. The Israeli military says it has killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighterssince October 8th. And of course we have also seen journalists in southern Lebanon targeted as well. There is mounting concern as we continue to see these tensions escalate. We saw on Wednesday, according to the Israeli military, yet more crossfire, yet more drone attacks by Hezbollah targeting parts of northern Israel. As we know, nearly 100,000 civilians on the Lebanese side have been forced to evacuate their homes. Many, around 50,000 Israelis in northern Israel have also been forced to evacuate as a result. So this is having a significant impact, of course, on the civilian population on either side of the border. But we did hear from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was visiting the parts of northern Israel yesterday. He said that Israel will take very intense action if they continue to see provocations by Hezbollah. He went on to say that whoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake. One way or another, we will restore security in the north. Now, of course, there have been calls from the international community for a de-escalation of tensions along the border. The U.S. has called for a de-escalation of tensions. It has said that it does not believe that Israel wants to see a full-scale war between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. And we have heard from Hezbollah as well saying that they are not looking for a war, that they do not want to see a war break out on this particular front, but that they also will not stand idly by if there are further provocations.

That's one of the things that's critical for him. And we know that the United States has given Ukraine permission recently to actually strike inside Russia Russian military targets using U.S. weapons. And I think as President Zelenskyy talks and meets with the other leaders as well, who will be there in Normandy, this is his opportunity to press his case, to be allowed to do that more often and strike more deeply. But air defense will probably be the top of his wish list as he speaks to President Biden.

Knox, now a mother of two, returned to Italy from Seattle to attend a hearing on Wednesday, hoping a court in Florence would clear her of a slander conviction for falsely accusing the manager of the bar where she worked, Patrick Lumumba, of Kercher's murder, sending the innocent man to jail for two weeks. Knox wrote on X on Monday that she hoped she would finally clear her name of the, quote, \"false charges\". But it wasn't to be.

However, the slander conviction for Knox remained. Knox later petitioned the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2019 that Italian investigators violated Knox's rights by garnering the false accusation without the presence of a lawyer or adequate translator. They also ruled that Italy should pay her nearly $21,000. Knox said she felt sure the Italian court would agree with the European ruling. Instead, the court upheld that Knox is guilty of slandering her former boss. She had already served the original slander sentence when she spent four years in a detention following her wrongful imprisonment for murder. Her lawyers said they would consider appealing once again, meaning that this is not the last word on a case that has lingered for nearly two decades. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Florence.

      "sentences": "NASA Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sonny Williams are on their way to the International Space Station after a successful launch of the Boeing Starliner spacecraft which lifted off from the launchpad just behind me about four or five miles away on Wednesday. They're going to be docking with the International Space Station at around noon on Thursday, about a 24-hour trip. They'll spend about eight days up there, and if all goes according to plan, they'll then come back to Earth under some big parachutes and land not in the water, but in the southwest United States. They're going to be landing on land.So that's a little bit different from the other company that is in the business of taking NASA astronauts up to the International Space Station. SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, it splashes down in the water. And so today really represents the fulfillment of NASA's crew program. They have been wanting two options to get its NASA astronauts up to the space station, and they've been wanting that for the better part of a decade. Today, we saw that these two astronauts are well on their way to making that happen. So not just a huge day for NASA, but a really big day for Boeing. They have been dealing with so many delays, so many financial issues over the decade that this spacecraft has been in development. Today, the person that heads the Starliner program for Boeing during a post-flight press conference, he said, to give you an idea of how big a day this was for Boeing, my boss was here, my boss' boss was here, and my boss' boss' boss was here. So the highest of the high up at Boeing were here for this launch today. And if all goes according to plan, it means that NASA will now have two options to get its astronauts up there. So a successful start to this mission, but it will still be several more days, about a week before we know if Boeing Starliner spacecraft is indeed capable of flying NASA astronauts, not just into space, but return them safely back to Earth. At the Kennedy Space Center, Kristin Fisher, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
