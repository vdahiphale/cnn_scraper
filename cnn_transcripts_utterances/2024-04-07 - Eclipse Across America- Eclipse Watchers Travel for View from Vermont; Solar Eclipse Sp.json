      "sentences": "Hello and I'm Bill Weir. Welcome to a special \"Eclipse Across America\" here in Washington, D.C. We are less than 24 hours away from witnessing one of the most spectacular shows to take over our skys. A total solar eclipse. Every day the shadow of the moon bounces on countless corners of the Milky Way and  when it hits earth, odds are generally that it'll pass over uninhabited patches of ice and sea where no one can appreciate it. But tomorrow, tomorrow that shadow will launch a U.S. tour centuries in the making with 32 million people living in the path of totality. Another three million expected to join them from around the nation and the world.The celestial show, of course, opens on the Mexican border with Texas before crossing over Dallas, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, on its way into Eastern Canada. It's so rare for the path to include so many fellow Americans and there won't be another until your newborn is old enough to drink, in the year 2044. It's the kind of rare, awe-inspiring, nonpartisan cosmic event that is uniting people around, wonder and so many are getting in on the fun. There's clever marketing and mass weddings and potentially nervous zoo animals and a run on special safety eclipse glasses, which are vital. Your Ray-Bans will not cut it. So much to talk about in this special hour. Of course, we have reporters fanned out all across the country, keeping track of possible cloudy formations there. As preparations get buttoned up really that is the drama there. Local weather is everything for would-be eclipse goers. It's the difference between celestial awe and disappointment. And we will get to all these folks and see how they're doing coming up. But let's begin with meteorologist Elisa Raffa. Elisa, joining us along the path of totality there, my heart goes out to the families who have been planning this for years and now are just going hour by hour refreshing the forecast. What's it looking like? Who's got the best shot tomorrow?",

      "sentences": "You know what, and it's so opposite for what we would expect in April. It's flipped the switch on the climatology. We've got a severe storm throughout that's pretty much growing over parts of Texas. Looks like the best view could be over parts of the Ohio Valley and in New England. That severe threat in Texas is now an enhanced level, three out of five.We're looking at the threat for damaging winds, large hail and some isolated tornadoes right along there, that path of totality. But the good news is, is it looks like the storms don't fire up until after the eclipse. Couple of showers before, but all of this fires up after 3:00, 4:00. So it's going to be a problem on your way home from any eclipse events there in Texas. It will also come, though, with the clouds. You're looking at mostly cloudy skies in Dallas throughout the event. Your peak at totality is 1:40. Place like Indianapolis looking at more sunshine, clear skies, a better view of things like the corona as we start to get into totality. A couple of showers, though. We've got this stalled front that stalls pretty much right along and near the path. That's what's bringing the clouds and the showers from Texas into Louisiana, Arkansas, then maybe a couple of two over upstate New York. But you've got that patch of clear and this over the Ohio Valley and then another patch of clear skies over New England. So Cleveland, Ohio, another spot that will have a mix of sun and clouds. So you're hoping to just not get that cloud once you have that totality. So you can see things like the corona. You'll still get that darkness, though, no matter what your cloud conditions are. And something that's really cool is once you get that darkness, the shadow is going to basically cover up the energy from the sun and temperatures will briefly drop when you're in totality. So you get a little bit of a cool breeze once the shadow comes across, Bill.",

It was in the lower end of the solar cycle, so the sun goes through an 11-year solar cycle and we are reaching its maximum right now coinciding with this total solar eclipse. So once the moon blocks out the sun, right over the skies here of Lake Champlain, you can expect to see more solar prominences, solar flares, and just more beautiful things around the corona of the sun. That's the sun's atmosphere that is going to be more active because were in that solar maximum right now. It is going to be an incredible event to witness something, that is not going to be the same as what happened in 2017; even more spectacular, perhaps.",

It reminds me so much of the Apollo aid mission and the Apollo 11 mission when the world really came together to witness something in space, and especially the coverage I've been watching today with the first lunar landing, part of watching that event was watching people all around the world share in that experience.

MUIR-HARMONY: I don't know so much about the rocket experience -- experiments, but I saw that you mentioned the airplanes, which is a great way to extend the observation time for solar observation.

It has been described as one of these experiences that could be transformative, really could change our trajectory and some people have talked about going into science because of it. So if you can make it, over half the country lives within 250 miles of totality. So if the weather behaves, there is good potential for that, but also if you are in regions where you're going to have a partial eclipse, it is still an extraordinary event to see really inspiring.
