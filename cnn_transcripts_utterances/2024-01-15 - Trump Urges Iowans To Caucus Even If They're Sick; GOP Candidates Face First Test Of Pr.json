JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST &amp; ANCHOR: What's so striking to me is obviously about turnout but we are talking about such a small percent of the Iowa population having a potentially determinant impact on the election, on the nomination really on the first caucus contest. So the highest total, John Beman told us, 187,000 folks participating in the caucus. And 1.6 million participate in the general election. Evangelicals make up 12 percent of the population of Iowa. They make up 65 percent of the caucus. The reason this matters is we have a representative election. Nikki Haley really struck me in an interview talking about would it not be good to have a Republican who could win the majority of votes.",

It is notable she is making this closing argument. Not just electability but we need someone who can build the build the biggest tent.

That question comes to -- I think what John was speaking to about the evangelicals, does Ron DeSantis emerge or not? If he does not, effectively this is a two-person race. Asa Hutchinson could stay in but who cares. So if it's a new race, then it does go to South Carolina where Nikki Haley could make things interesting. But she could lose her home state. And at that point, we have two ways this race goes. It's effectively over at that point with Donald Trump and then there's the delegate map that Karen talks about where it's the official part of it being over. This could be a very short process. Part of it is because, if we do start with the winner take all, it's not dramatically different from what Republicans have done in the past. This is how the RNC did things in 2020 and certainly in 2016 by and large as well.",

But there have been strong feelings in our party for a long time that we need to have an earlier contest that actually represented the diversity of our party and our country.

The \"Des Moines Register\" poll in 2016 overestimated Trump's vote and underestimated Cruz's vote. Now all pollsters have changed the way they approach polling since 2016.
