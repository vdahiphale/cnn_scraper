Bush, whose presidency was eventually doomed by a recession in the early 90s, a recession that economists say could be the model for what they say we're about to experience.Now we should point out, there are some significant differences. First, unemployment today is low, like really low, and wages are relatively high. And there are the complications that we didn't see in previous downturns such as in China where they've got some insanely strict COVID policies. One case can shut down an entire city and all of its factories. That clogs up the global supply chain, which might explain why my Philadelphia Eagles hoodie has been on backorder since last winter.

Well, a number of reasons. But also because new poll numbers show voters are feeling particularly pessimistic about the state of the economy.A recent New York Times CNN poll found that 44 percent of likely voters said that the economy and inflation are the most important issues facing the country. And look at the other numbers, the next top ranking issue is abortion, immigration, crime guns are all at 5 percent or less. So what might that mean for candidates across the country? Well, Republicans are seeing a boost in polls in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, even New York as Americans continue to struggle with rising prices. When I talked to Senator Bernie Sanders last week, as I mentioned, don't assume that Republicans have the answers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT): And the irony here is, Republicans say -- you know, they talk about the economy, really not one of them is going to vote to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, not one of them is going to vote for legislation that makes it easier for workers to join unions, not one of them is going to vote to do what every other major country on Earth does, and guarantee health care for all people. Nor will they vote to raise taxes on billionaires at a time when the richest people in this country, in some cases, pay nothing in federal income tax.

What a lot of people don't realize, I think governors and, and a few of us who are actually in charge of allocating those dollars and spending of them, only a fraction has actually been spent, right. It's all been allocated. But the actual number of checks that have been cut is very minimal.ARPA funds, all of this, that's all designed infrastructure, all designed to be spent into '24, '25 and '26. And so inflation is going to be very exacerbated for the next few years. And the recession is going to be very real. Never in American history and world history you get inflation like this not followed by a pretty severe recession. And so that's why you're going to need Republicans, fiscal hawks, folks that are managers willing to make tough decisions to make sure that it isn't government that comes first, it's individuals.

It has to be the top issues for folks at home, which is why November is going to be very strong for Republicans, because it's about inflation and cost of fuel and cost of putting food on the table. Those things are very real.So what do you do? First, you keep going with the quantitative tightening. The Treasury has to keep pulling back and buying back those assets. Those -- especially the some of those long term assets. Pull money out of the economy, is the only way to really get inflation under control. Unfortunately, these rates are going to have to stay high for a decent amount of time, which is why I get so upset with Secretary Yellen. She knew what she was doing. She knew that at the end of the day the roosters -- the chickens had to come home to roost, so to say, and that interest rates would ultimately have to almost outpace inflation to get this thing under control. And then understand that, you know, making sure that the dollars that have been allocated are really going to one-time spending, not increasing the size of governments. A lot of states you see bigger government programs and that's the absolute wrong thing to do, because you're increasing your long term liabilities on your local taxpayers. We don't have sales tax here, we don't have income tax, we're getting rid of our interest and dividends tax and all of that. But at the end of the day, you need fiscal hawks that know how to take what they have, spend the dollars efficiently, and make sure that you're just creating opportunity at that localized level. And you can do that in Washington. They're not very good at it, traditionally, but the opportunity is absolutely there. The last thing I want to jump on his workforce, workforce, workforce. That's the key to our economy, that doesn't really get fixed long term for America, until you deal with securing the border and creating a legal immigration system. The right type of system that lets folks come in the right way and really start allowing that process to happen in a safe and secure way. You stop the humanitarian crisis, you stop the drugs at the border, but you let that the immigration flow in a legal way the way it should. That in itself can create a lot of opportunity for workforce for America.",

You got to bring the other side of the aisle into your office.I had a discussion with a bunch of Senators when they were trying to get me to run for Senate a while ago. And they said, you know, well, you know, balancing the budget is really hard because you need 60 votes, and that's not going to happen. And I said, well, if you're sure you need 60 votes, then build the 60 vote plan. That means you're going to have to get some Democrats. Go build the plan that brings Democrats on board, find out what they want, give a little to get a lot. At the end of the day, you'll be rewarded for doing right by the American people. Businesses have to balance the budget, individuals have to balance a budget, why shouldn't the government have to balance a budget. I have to balance a budget here in New Hampshire.

And then when I'm shooting, and the actors are actually acting against something that the right size and not just acting against tennis balls.
