And they've been using artillery to strike things like arms depots, command and control hubs, logistic hubs. And for Ukraine, the idea is to try to isolate Crimea and make it more difficult for Russia to use Crimea to sustain its military operations on the mainland. Now, U.S. military and intelligence officials that we spoke to said that it is -- it's difficult to say at this point. It's just too early to say whether or not these strikes on Crimea are actually having the intended effect, whether they're making it more difficult for Russia to stand up to this Ukrainian counter offensive. But what we can say, Kate, is that there is a growing skepticism behind closed doors within the U.S. government that these Ukrainian attacks on Crimea are really a good idea. There are some military and Biden administration officials who fear that these attacks are, as you said, at best a distraction and at worst, a waste of valuable resources at a moment in which the U.S. government broadly is concerned that Ukraine has stretched itself too thin across multiple axis of attack. And I want to share with you what a senior defense official said to us, which is this person said, it's knocked the Russians off balance a bit, but it's not doing anything decisive. And it would probably be better for everyone for them to just focus on the counteroffensive. Now, Kate, it is important to note that the U.S. government hasn't yet started advising Ukraine not to strike Crimea. But what we can say is that the longer this counteroffensive goes on, the less likely its chances of success.",
