And he is also now seeing this case against Alexander Smirnoff. Now, he was an FBI informant for about 10 years. But last week, the Justice Department charged him with lying to investigators when he said that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden accepted $5 million in bribes. They're now saying that was a false statement.He was subsequently arrested. And while he was in custody, Boris, according to this new filing, he told investigators that some of the information he had about Hunter Biden came from Russian intelligence officials. So that raises the possibility, right, of an effort by the Russians to put disinformation into the U.S. political system, something we've seen before. Now, that would be a bombshell. But I also want a caveat that in this filing, your prosecutor, say they have not independently verified his claims. And this is a guy who clearly has a problem with the truth. All of this came out because the prosecutors were trying to convince the judge to keep him behind bars. They said, look, this is a guy who lies about how much money he has. He says he has a few grand. In fact, he has about $6 million. Lies about the Bidens. This is someone with extensive international foreign contacts. We don't think he should be released. But the judge didn't buy it. The judge said, look, politics here don't matter, and called the Russian connection, quote, speculative to say the least.",

The White House put out a warning in light of this arrest of a dual U.S.- Russian citizen in Russia, asking any Americans in Russia to immediately leave. How significant is the risk for Americans who may still be there?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's highly significant, Boris. I think anyone who is considering going to Russia right now would be a fool to go. And even some of the U.S. citizens who are in Russia right now, the tourists places like St. Petersburg, Moscow, the places where you would consider that tourists would be welcome and relatively safe. But given the kinds of actions they've conducted against members of the press, against average citizens, against anyone who is doing something that Russia doesn't approve of, to be thrown in jail for long prison sentences, it's just a huge warning to stay away. I visited Russia several times during my career. There was always concern about what you were doing, what people were listening to, how you were being perceived.

And they have the artillery and the missiles to do that as Ukrainian arms continue to wear thin. They are in dire situations.

It's continued holding of Ukrainian citizens and children as hostages in Russia. They just released several more a few days ago. But there are literally thousands of hostages that Russia has taken.In the long term, it's emboldening Putin and the Russian leaders. Inaction has given Putin a second wind. It's allowing him to achieve his prewar strategic objectives regarding the division of NATO and the United States, as well as the attempts to subjugate Ukraine. In the long term, it's increasing dangers to other countries in Europe. I've talked to many of my former colleagues in European armies. They are very concerned, especially in several specific countries like Poland, Romania, the Baltics. They're concerned about what Russia might do next.

No one is disputing that this was an accident, but prosecutors believe that those who are responsible should be held accountable. We know that Alec Baldwin has been recharged, but today's trial, today's hearing all about Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.She was the armorer on the set, the person who was responsible for the safe handling and storage of weapons and ammunition. And authorities have charged her with involuntary manslaughter, essentially claiming negligence on her part. There's this separate charge in addition, and that is evidence tampering. Authorities say, as you mentioned at the top, that they believe that she handed off a bag of cocaine to another person after being interviewed by police. The reason why that is important is because so much of the government's case seems to point towards her sobriety on the day of that shooting. Authorities said in a filing that she was likely hung over whenever she inserted a live bullet into a gun that was then used by an actor. Witnesses had also alleged that she had been using marijuana throughout the filming of that film. And, of course, on a movie set, if there's anyone that you would want to be lucid, it would be the person who is responsible for the safe handling of firearms. So, this is what this case is all about. Now, at the start, when these charges first came out, I spoke exclusively with the district attorney. I asked, why now? Why this negligence charge? She explained what their investigation found. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, NEW MEXICO FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set that there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those, or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin.

It is extraordinarily difficult when you're talking about a high- profile case like this. With a very high-profile case individual in the sidelines. Obviously not Gutierrez-Reed, but Alec Baldwin's defense is looking very closely at this case. Well, there isn't going to be a person, unless they live in a cave, who doesn't know about the Rust production, the Rust movie, the Rust killing of Ms. Hutchings. All of Alec Baldwin being involved in the killing of Ms. Hutchings, whether he's found criminally liable or not, that's for a jury to decide. That's going to be the key issue for the defense. In fact, the defense had already made whispers of this and made motions about looking at whether or not Ms. Gutierrez-Reed could even have a fair trial in this proceeding in this venue.
