The idea that we don't have a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the idea that we have all these -- all these promotions that are in abeyance right now, we don't know what's going to happen, the idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre. I don't ever recall that happening, ever. And it's just totally irresponsible, in my view. And I just think that -- I mean, I'm confident that the mainstream Republican Party no longer -- does not support what he's doing, but they got to stand up and be counted. That's how it ends.",

But I'd be surprised if we don't see another Russian attempt to push back Ukraine somewhere and gain an advantage in whatever negotiations ensue at the end of this. So I don't think it's over, despite the fact that we don't believe that -- or the administration has said that Putin has already lost. I'm not sure he accepts that.

What was your reaction when you heard the questions on that and the answers from the president of the United States and the president of Finland?",

And President Trump at the time said that he took President Putin's analysis that there was no interference by Russia in the U.S. elections, he took that over and above what he was hearing from his own -- his own intelligence advisers. So the Finns have seen this firsthand. So yes, there is this concern about what can happen, but I think what we heard from President Biden there in explaining in Congress and in Senate, and there's a lot of support, and we heard that echoed by the Finnish president as well, that would sort of lay some of those concerns to rest. I think the one other takeaway I had there as well, Wolf, was President Biden's analysis here that perhaps Ukraine -- or is -- this is an implicit analysis -- that perhaps Ukraine is not going to take back all of its territory, because he said there will be a war, and then there will be negotiations. If Ukraine was actually able to force Russia entirely off of its territory, then what need for negotiations because the war would be over, Russia would be gone? I thought that was an interesting insight. I'm not sure if the president implied that, but that's what came across.",

He was going to bring Donald Trump's so-called America-first approach to foreign policy to an end and make it America with its allies as the primary approach. And that got stronger this week, obviously, with Finland participating in the first time as a member of NATO, Sweden, going forward in the process with getting the agreement with Turkey, and showing a unified force in this battle that Ukraine is engaged in with Russia. All of that was completely within how Joe Biden has presented his view of America's role in the world to the American people and a direct contrast from his predecessor, Donald Trump, Wolf, who may be his Republican opponent next year round -- next time around, including when Arlette had asked him about potential election interference from Russians. I mean, could you get a stronger contrast? In the very same place where Donald Trump sided with Putin over America's intelligence community, you had Joe Biden say flat out that Russians have interfered in American elections, and so trying to do so again would be nothing new, a complete contrast that Joe Biden and his team were eager to draw throughout this week with his predecessor.",

What was your reaction to when the president said he would be willing to talk with Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama about Tuberville's actions to prevent Senate confirmation of senior military officers, generals and admirals, from moving up in the command because he doesn't like the Pentagon's policy in allowing women who serve in the U.S. military to travel to other states and potentially get abortions at the Pentagon? The military would pay for those travel expenses, wouldn't pay for the abortions, but would pay for the travel expenses. What's your reaction to what Senator Tuberville is doing? Because the president said this undermines U.S. national security in preventing these generals and admirals from moving up?",

Whatever his views are on the use of the military and how the military can engage in taking care of its people and meeting their needs, that's a separate issue. But to block these promotions, to mess with the chain of command to make an issue like this, it's pure political stunting. It may be great for some of his funders back in Alabama,or someone from the extreme right wing. It's harmful to the United States of America. I'm delighted the president is willing to speak to him, but it shouldn't take that. The Republican Party should certainly stop this.

And to tell you a little more about Opill, it is an oral contraceptive. We do know that it contains only progestin. And this is the first time that the U.S. FDA has approved an oral contraceptive pill for over-the-counter use, so you don't need a prescription. Now, I should clarify this is not an emergency contraception. This is, again, a daily birth control pill. The idea here, Sara, is, this will be made more accessible for people. And it's just similar to the other progestin-only oral contraceptives that are available under prescription.
