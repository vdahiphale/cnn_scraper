I'm Anderson Cooper in Tel Aviv.We are seeing live pictures out of Gaza right now, large explosions over the Gaza Strip. The IDF says it is \"operating forcefully,\" those are their words, \"on all fronts and will continue striking Gaza City and keep calling upon civilians to evacuate south.\" This comes as we're learning more about hostage negotiations with Hamas. U.S. officials insisting hostage talks will continue even as the Israeli military ramps up its airstrikes and expanding its operation on the ground. Jeremy Diamond is in Ashkelon for us. Jeremy, what have you been seeing now over the last half an hour or so?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, we have been hearing the steady thud of these intensified bombardments and artillery fire on the Gaza Strip. This has been the loudest and the most intense, perhaps even the most sustained bombardment of the Gaza Strip that we have heard in nearly three weeks of covering this war.And all of this as the IDF says that it is expanding its ground operations inside of Gaza. We have been watching over the last several days a buildup to this moment, a buildup to a potential ground invasion, which as of yet we do not have confirmation that these expanded ground operations are indeed that invasion that has been expected, that has been telegraphed by Israel's political and military leadership. But we have seen over the last several days targeted raids carried out by Israeli infantry troops as well as tanks rolling across the border into Gaza, targeting Hamas' infrastructure and those tunnels, which Israeli military officials say will be key to eliminating those tunnels in order to make it safer for their troops as they go into Gaza. What we have also been watching today is those potential hostage negotiations, which are very much now complicated by this expanded Israeli ground operation inside of Gaza. There were signs yesterday and this morning, Anderson, that those talks were progressing in a very real, a very significant way. But now it appears that they are all but stalled. Officials insisting to me and my colleagues that these talks have not yet collapsed and a senior U.S. official telling me that they will continue despite what we are watching tonight, despite this expanded ground operation, despite this intensified bombardment, and even despite a ground operation invasion potentially beginning, Anderson.",

We are about 10 kilometers from the border with Gaza, so I don't want to make any definitive pronouncements.But what we certainly have been hearing, Anderson, is the outgoing artillery fire and then bombardment of Gaza, which not only can you hear, but you can also feel it kind of shake the buildings, even as far as we are right now from the Gaza Strip. What we also - what I can also tell you is that we have been hearing that bombardment continuously over the last several days, over the last couple of weeks, but it has been nowhere near as intense as what we have been hearing tonight. And certainly as we get in reports from people who are inside of Gaza reporting very much the same, that this is the most intense bombardment that they have felt. And what's also notable is that it appears that telecommunications, Internet and phone service have been cut off in large parts of the Gaza Strip.",

And you can feel the building shake. You can feel the windows shake.It is hard to imagine, Anderson, the power and the destruction that those bombs are wrecking inside the Gaza Strip. We have watched already, as Israel has intensified its bombardment in recent days, as the casualty count has risen to over 7,000, I believe is the latest number, inside the Gaza Strip. Nearly 3,000 of those casualties, Anderson, it needs to be noted, are children, according to the Hamas- controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. And so we know that every time we hear this bombardment intensifying inside of Gaza, we know that there are lives being lost and, in some instances, civilian lives being lost, including, unfortunately, children.",

      "sentences": "It could be a series of things or a choice of things, Anderson. It could be an increase in bombardment to prepare for an assault, which normally happens. It could be a continued bombardment, just for the sake of knowing that they - the Israeli defense forces have achieved targeting data and intelligence that shows where targets are.Jeremy just said tonight there are continued rockets going off. Israel has the capability to see where those rockets are coming from. Every time a point of origin appears on a radar screen or intelligence feed, it's going to be targeted by Israeli aircraft. Or third, it could be sending a message about the slow pace of returning the hostages. It appears Hamas is using human shields, hostages in this case, to delay Israel's operation. And it's been 20 days since they took these hostages. So Israel's probably sending at least a partial message, even though that hostage negotiation continues of saying we're not going to put up with this anymore. Either return the hostages or the operation will be executed. Now, truthfully, I'm your military analyst, Anderson. I'd like to be able to tell you what is exactly happening. But unless I'm in the operations center of the Israeli defense forces, I don't know what they're doing, neither do any of us who are making analysis on this. And guess what? Neither does Hamas. They don't know what's happening either. But I will tell you the continued concussion of these bombs and these artillery shells is not only affecting them physically, but it's affecting them psychologically, because being under constant huge shelling like this really takes its toll on a force.",

Do you - I mean, that's a possibility, I assume. But given their experiences with, say, fighting Hezbollah in 2006, those movements were very slow as they went into Lebanon.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna and Boris, American officials are unwilling to say that, given what we've seen tonight from Israel in terms of its activities in Gaza, that the hostage conversations have collapsed. The American officials have told us, myself and several of my colleagues, that those conversations will continue. One person saying, in particular, there's no scenario until the hostages are free that we would stop pursuing talks.Now, one thing we have heard repeatedly from various Biden administration officials is the need for humanitarian pauses to both allow aid to get into Gaza, but also to allow for more time and ease for these hostages to come out. That is something that we just heard moments ago from the National Security's John Kirby, who was speaking with journalists, saying that they have been having active conversations with Israel about these humanitarian pauses, saying that is something that they absolutely would support. Now, when you look at what we are literally looking at right now in Gaza, that appears to be the last thing on Israel's mind. They seem to be really pushing forward, really expanding their military operations. That's something that I'm told U.S. officials are also seeing, but certainly trying to assess. They're watching this very carefully as well, but they are certainly seeing this as an escalation of what we've seen in terms of incursions by Israel over the course of the past few days. Now, where these talks exactly stand about the hostages, that is hard to say. What everyone seems to agree on is that they are not in as good a place as they were earlier today, when we thought that we were closer to a potential deal that could have seen a much larger group of civilian hostages released. So it appears that those talks have taken a step back. We have heard from the Israeli military spokesperson who was asked about this as he announced the expansion of these military operations, Brianna and Boris, he said that you should not believe the rumors about a potential deal. But we are told reliably that the conversations continue. They just don't seem to be as - in as good a place as they were earlier today and yesterday, guys.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's a really good question. And the details are not absolutely clear, but I think we've got some sort of parameters that at least we understand were being discussed right from the outset. Let's remember right from when we first knew that they had hostages being taken, and I'm talking about nearly three weeks ago.The Israelis had said there will be no ceasefire until, if at all, until hostages are released. They didn't see that as a credible demand from Hamas, who were saying they wanted to see a ceasefire before hostages were released. As things have moved on, it does appear that there were a number of parameters here. There was the Rafah Border Crossing. How much more aid could Hamas demand was sent through that border crossing and to where, of course, incredibly important that more humanitarian aid, fuel, medical supplies gets into Gaza. But massive concern and a red line by the Israelis from the beginning of this saying that - those - that aid, those medical supplies, that fuel could not go to Hamas. We do know that the Rafah Border Crossing, as we understand it, has been in play in these negotiations. And then the other point is: where are these hostages, does Hamas have all of these hostages, could it be that there are some hostages who aren't with Hamas at the moment and then how many - what's the exchange as far as civilians are concerned. It did appear that that was an exchange for food - for aid that was being discussed as opposed to a prisoner swap, which would be military for women and teenagers, Palestinian women and teenagers being held in Israeli jails. So perhaps it can be described as a twin track. I can't stand that up. Certainly, we've heard reports of that.\\ But at present, all we do know is that there are 229 hostages as described. That's the number that was described by the IDF earlier. And at this stage, it's not clear whether any of those, be it a large number or a smaller number, will now be released anytime soon.",
