This is how Bolsonarosupporters in Brazil, stormed Congress and broke into the Presidential Palace. I'm Becky Anderson. Hello and welcome back to \"Connect the World\" broadcast from here in Abu Dhabi. Well, leaders in and out of Brazil are now calling the people who carried out that violence over the weekend fascists, terrorists and criminals. Here they were at the Supreme Court building on Sunday absolutely stunning scenes reminiscent of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol two years ago. Many protesters who'd been camped out in Brasilia are now packing up and heading home on the order of authorities. They are angry over Former President Jair Bolsonaro's reelection loss in October. Well, like the U.S. insurrection it was hard to watch the scenes out of Brazil and hard to look away. But the mayhem didn't happen in a vacuum. CNN's Rafael Romo tells us why the protesters were so frustrated about the situation reached this point? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Brazil boiling over supporters of Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro storm key buildings in the country's capital Sunday, breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country's Congress, Presidential Palace and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country seat of power many dresses in the colors of Brazil's flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro's defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Reese Inacio Lula Da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs those buildings while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seeing sitting at the desk of Brazil's Congress President. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula da Silva, who was inaugurated just a week ago describe the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible.",

Bolsonaro, who is currently in Florida, denounce what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy. But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country's electronic voting system. ROMO (on camera): The intensity of Sunday's protest shows that last year's presidential election is still unfinished business for some Brazilians in a sign of just how divided the country is Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.

I feel that there is one good point what happened yesterday is the fact that the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the present Supreme Court, and the President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, united right now this moment, have a meeting on making very strong measures to punish everyone who was there. And not only to punish them, but also to punish the people who paid the buses saw hundreds of buses, who came from all over the country to make this demonstration.

What happened yesterday, shocked nation? I mean, people Brazil, even those who voted for Bolsonaro and most of them do not agree with what happened yesterday. So Lula has now the chance to have let's say, a normal position, not a violent opposition, not aggressive opposition, as we saw yesterday, but a normal position that people will just disagree with him. So I feel that in certain sense, Lulu has now the opportunity to talk to people who didn't vote for him. But that would agree that let's go on and have new election for years and things go on.

He feels other people have been telling his story, a lot of it informed by leaks from the family and he wants to take control of it. So it's, I think, from what I can tell, it's as simple as that. What happens from here, maybe it gets out of his system, and he moves on to other projects. Maybe there are more books and TV programs to come. I can't imagine, William and Charles are going to give him more material to use, because they're so concerned about all of these private matters getting out in public, that Harry says he does want to reconcile with them. He does want a conversation with them. But he doesn't want to do that without it being leaked. So who's the leaker? You know, where's the trust?",

Scenes like these played out across the country as family members who'vebeen separated by the pandemic were allowed back into China without having to spend days or weeks in quarantine. The move comes even as China is dealing with a massive wave of COVID cases across the country. Nearly 89 percent, that's nearly nine out of 10 people in Henan province, for example are infected with COVID-19 according to report.

And this is the freshly reopen rail crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China. It had been closed since February of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was opened on Sunday. And we've been witnessing a steady stream of travelers coming through. Now Quarantine is no longer a requirement. But a number of pandemic restrictions are in place. For example, the mask mandate remains out in force. In addition to that travelers must show proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test before their journey. And this is going to be a phased reopening, you know, up to 60,000 travelers can travel each day from mainland China to Hong Kong and vice versa, from seven different checkpoints, including this one where I'm standing from and the demand has been absolutely huge. In fact, as of Sunday evening, over 440,000 Hong Kong residents have signed up for a chance to make the journey. And earlier today, we spoke to a couple of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been discussing the human impact of this lockdown and why it is people are, you can see the relief in people's faces and the excitement about getting to see family members, friends, once again. These lock downs and subsequent re-openings have led to huge fluctuations in the market. So let's look at this, then through the prism of business and finance. You've been studying these trends.

What you find is the economy is in a very, very weak spot. I mean, the numbers are just showing absolute bloodbath. Every sector of the economy is struggling, including these consumption sectors. I mean property is in the doldrums the manufacturing sector is doing incredibly poorly. And you're looking at a year-on-year contraction as a result of, of course, the COVID lockdowns that you got in October, November. And then the reopening the hasty reopening, which of course led to a flood of cases an explosion of cases, which again curtailed economic activity.

Now, the problem, I think,presently, is that a lot of the demand projections and economic projections are getting a little ahead of themselves. The fact of the matter is that we are yet to go through a second wave of COVID outbreaks in the rural areas over the Spring Festival, which means that there's still more pain ahead in terms of both COVID and COVID related deaths, as well as the economic impact of all of that, which means that the true impact of the reopening on the bottom lines, that positive effect will probably not be seen before the second quarter of this year. And that is where you start to see demand really pick back up, I think Chinese consumers will be much more activated at that point. This is not probably going to be this month and next month story.",

They also by the way have to be quite important when we think about real estate as a whole. So when we get out of the major cities, which tend to get a disproportionate amount of attention in the economic story of China, when you get out of there, you realize a big chunk, over a billion people still need to be thought about. And they need to be talked about in terms of what that means for demand projections and Chinese consumption. And I think you're going to see probably a slower ramp up in activity out there. I think a lot of the services and retail consumption is going to probably not rebound as quickly in that part of China once you leave the major cities.",

Remember, this is a technologically challenging launch, this plane will flap to about 35,000 feet off the southern coast of Ireland, it will release this rocket that will fall for about four seconds and then accelerate about 8000 miles an hour very, very quickly. It is a difficult challenge to launch this way. And bear in mind virgin orbit has not done these themselves away from their base in the Mojave Desert in the western United States. So this is technologically a challenge for them too. But it's the kind of thing that can open up a lot of places and right now everything is go.
