We've heard a lot about Biden's debate preps, but not so much about Trump's until now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I've been preparing for it for my whole life if you want to know the truth. And I'm not sure you can lock yourself into a room for two weeks or one week or two days and really learn what you have to know. I think we'll do very well. We've done well in the past, and I think we'll do very well.

The Wall Street Journal reporter accused of espionage, a charge that he denies. The U.S. government says he's wrongfully detained. No media, family, the U.S. embassy personnel are being allowed into the court for the closed door proceedings. Clare Sebastian has reported extensively on Russia, joins me now.

That is justified in Russia because of the charges, which are espionage.So, allegedly, you know, state secrets could emerge as part of this trial. But this is not an independent judiciary, so, essentially, they can close the doors whenever they want. That is an important part of the backdrop. As for the charges, the judge approved the indictment about 10 days ago. They said that the FSB has proof that he was acting on instructions from the CIA when he tried to obtain secrets about a major Russian tank factory. And that was in the region where he is currently facing trial. Obviously, the Wall Street Journal has strenuously denied it. I want to read you a portion from the editor-in-chief in an op-ed this week, Emma Tucker. She said: the trial, it will be held in secret. No evidence has been unveiled. And we already know the conclusion. This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job. So, you know, these are very serious charges against him. The maximum sentence is 20 years. Russia is a country where really less than 1 percent of criminal trials end in acquittal. And as I said, closed doors. So we're going to have to read the tea leaves, the length of the trial, the eventual sentence, assuming that he's not acquitted, as to how Russia feels politically about this and how urgent they feel it is to advance beyond this legal process to potential diplomatic negotiations.",

President Putin said in his interview in February with Tucker Carlson, you know, there's no taboo around this. We're looking for a way to solve it.

We'll keep everyone updated on that.We could hear from Julian Assange for the first time since he became a free man earlier today in the Northern Mariana Islands. The WikiLeaks founder is on board a flight to Australia, where a press conference is scheduled in about three hours' time. Assange pleaded guilty to a single espionage-related charge for publishing leaked U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables starting in 2010. The U.S. judge sentenced him to 62 months, equal to the time he's already served in a London prison. Let's bring in journalist Alex Thomas following developments live from Canberra. Hi, Alex.

And he was battling against the extradition process to the United States.It won't exactly be a hero's welcome. We haven't seen crowds of well- wishers gathering here at the airport to welcome him back, although his father certainly will be here to welcome him back, and he can't wait to see his wife and two young children as well. But certainly at the very highest levels of Australian government, there is a feeling that this has gone on long enough. The prime minister himself, Anthony Albanese, has played a central role in securing Assange's release, which came as something of a surprise when it was declared that he'd made a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this week. And this is what Anthony Albanese had to say in Parliament here in Australia a little bit earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we're going to hear what Julian Assange himself has to say and thinks about it all, as you say, in just over three hours' time, when he holds a press conference after landing here, here in Canberra, which is the capital of Australia and the home of all its politics as well.So no surprise, perhaps, that he chose to come here rather than Melbourne, say, where he spent many of his teenage years growing up, although he's from Townsville in Queensland, away from the politics, as I say. He's certainly keen to resume family life. He met his wife while he was still imprisoned, if you like, and had his two sons all the time while not a free man and fighting this legal process -- Max. FOSTER: A lot of his defenders are saying this is a trial for journalism, because if he'd gone to the U.S. and faced all these espionage charges, it would have set a dangerous precedent for journalism. But there is a precedent here, isn't there, because he's pleaded guilty to an espionage related charge. Do we know the nature of that and what impact that would have, actually?",
