The White House says it is actively working to get Americans out of Sudan as a bloody conflict between two rivals turns even deadlier. U.S. officials say it's too risky for a large scale evacuation. So, instead, they are using intelligence and surveillance tools to help international convoys of cars get to the port in Sudan where American military ships are standing by. The U.S. evacuated all its government employees from Sudan over the weekend and suspended operations at its embassy in Khartoum. Blinken called the move the only, quote, feasible option given that hundreds have now been killed and thousands more injured in the fighting.

There was a cease-fire for just a couple of days during the religious holiday that enabled us to get the embassy employees out. The problem is you identified, we have 16,000 Americans left behind who are given the message that you're sort of on your own right now. Now, let me just say, it's a very dangerous situation on the ground. This really reminds me, sort of reminiscence of Mogadishu. Remember the Black Hawk down when you have these rebel forces fighting in the streets of the city of Khartoum that have surface-to-air missiles. So I agree with the secretary. It's very dangerous for any NGO like Samaritan Purse to get in, but also to get Americans out of there in a safe travel way.

But in order to keep it that way, we are always looking at new developments and trying to make sure there is even more safety built into the system.Now, what happened in this case of the flight that no one wants to look out the window and see what these passengers saw. The flight crew, of course, returned that plane safely to the ground and everybody was taken care of there. But what we're interested in, in addition to making sure there are those safety systems that allow an airplane to safely land with one engine operational where necessary is to try to prevent these bird strikes from happening in the first place. FAA believe it or not does a lot of research on birds and on wild life for precisely this reason. It may sound like a pretty quirky area of research until you realize that there is life safety on the line. Let's make sure we have fewer of these incidents. And, you know, everything from bird habitats and bird behavior changing to the evolution of engines that are more efficient and therefore quieter means that we might need to undertake new specifications, new safety measures to try to minimize those bird strikes that are a real concern for airline safety.",
