Your position has been kind of jazzed about that, it seems, on the TV in the last hour or so.Is it fair to say the White House is thinking what a soft landing could look like or not getting that far? JEAN-PIERRE: What we can say -- (CROSSTALK) JEAN-PIERRE: I'll say this. As you said you heard from many of my colleagues in -- who are economists who have been working on this issue, pushing forward the president's economic plan. Look, it just goes back to the president's economic plan. And we see it as it's working, right? The vision that the president has for this country. When you think about when he came in, he passed the American Rescue Plan and all the other historic pieces, the infrastructure legislation, the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. I talked multiple times at the top about the Inflation Reduction Act. Look, it is -- it matters what the vision of a president is and him acting out on it. That's what you saw. When you see inflation down for six months, that matters. Right? That's because of the president's economic plan. When you see annual inflation down 6.5 percent from where it was this summer, just this summer, 9.1 percent. Gas prices down by more than a buck 70 from its peak. All of that matters. And so that's how we're seeing this. We're seeing it as the president's economic plan is indeed working. We are going to continue to put the American families and American people first. And work on this issue that you hear us talk about all the time. His number-one economic issue is bringing down inflation. That's why the Inflation Reduction Act, what I talked about when you think about health care, when you think about Medicare and negotiating those prices. When you think about what the amounts in Georgia, 250,000 will be created. All of that, all of that matters and all of that is in important. And more broadly speaking, it's about the president's economic plan. Look, we believe we continue to be in this transition of stable and steady growth. And I think that's what we believe that's what the numbers continue to show as you talk about the jobs report we saw recently and as we talk about the CPI data.",

      "sentences": "This is the new normal. It's a new normal that's kind of evolving over the course of the last three or four days.And gotten a lot more serious, at least inside the White House, since Attorney General Merrick Garland decided to appoint the special counsel yesterday. There has not been a lot of disclosure or transparency as it pertains to the specific details of the review that had been under way by the U.S. attorney in Chicago or the process that the president's private attorneys were going through in their own search for documents that concluded a day or two ago. In part, at least as it's been explained to me, was because lawyers made clear that as long as the president's private attorneys were continuing their search -- they hadn't completed going through all the locations where documents may have been held. And really ensured they had a full understanding of where things were and what might be out there. But there weren't going to be kind of lengthy or fulsome comments about what was going to happen. Whether or not that was going to change, when that search ended, as it did, really is kind of a nonfactor now that there's a special counsel. So you've seen this posture be maintained. And I don't get the sense that thinks it is going to end any time soon. Everything will be referred to the White House Counsel's Office. They're all lawyers and not exactly fulsome in their responses in all things. And more importantly, I think everything related to the investigation itself over to the Special Counsel's Office, which is still in the process of being set up or the Justice Department. I think the reality is, right now, this is a White House very cognizant of the fact they need to be careful about everything and everything they said. The downside, which is very obvious, and you have seen it in the briefings, is there are just a lot of questions outstanding about timeline, about messaging, about when things were said publicly and why some things weren't said publicly, about processes. All questions remain outstanding. And, at least at this this point in time, the White House sees no incentive in answering them given the fact they're facing a special counsel investigation.",
