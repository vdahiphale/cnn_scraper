That was 76,000 voters. Chris Christie got 1.6%. That was about 9,000 voters. When you look at those numbers, those are moveable margins for Kamala Harris in Wisconsin, which is a very purple state, especially in presidential cycle years. So, while this is a bit more of what we would call in politics a persuasion event, they're trying to deliver the message that they believe Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. What this should be is a get out the vote event for them. They should be now trying to turn the message into the movement, getting voters now to the polls and considering that persuadable block that does exist in Wisconsin from what we saw in the primary.
