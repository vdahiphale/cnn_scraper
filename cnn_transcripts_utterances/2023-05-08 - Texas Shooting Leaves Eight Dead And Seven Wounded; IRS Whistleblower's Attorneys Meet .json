It is a federal problem and any sort of long-term solution is going to have to come from the federal government. But as we know, this has been a very difficult problem for lawmakers to solve. It's not something that the Biden administration can do on their own.

So, this is very clearly a different picture. Still, I, of course, have to point out the other polls, right? This is my job. I like looking at averages. And if we look at some other national polls that have come out over the last month and a half, Biden is ahead of Trump in all of them. In IPSOS, Biden is up by five. \"Wall Street Journal,\" Biden is up by three. Quinnipiac, Biden is up by two. But I think the large message that you should take away from all of this polling data is that the race for president, of course, the election wouldn't be for a while, but at this particular point, it is quite tight, which is very different from the picture we saw at this point in the 2020 cycle.

Despite the fact that we've had other poll numbers suggest that the Trump voters are more enthusiastic, when it actually comes to saying that they're going to vote, the Trump and Biden voters were about at the same level.
