      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING, live from the Mars Cafe in Des Moines, Iowa. Republicans here getting set to brave life-threatening temperatures, subzero windchills to cast their ballots in the closely followed caucuses today. At stake, Iowa's 40 delegates and, probably more crucially, momentum heading into the New Hampshire primary. And, of course, as we know, Iowa is an expectations game.So, where do we start here? Donald Trump, the far and away frontrunner. He's really taken so much suspense out of the caucuses here. Fifty percent -- if he is over 50 percent, that is exactly what his -- the expectations that his team, honestly, they have been trying to lower. But he was -- if he's above 50, nothing about this race changes. If he starts to creep below 50, as he did in the Iowa poll, and it's actually falling further down, I think you're going to see some conversation around that as we hit -- head into New Hampshire. But, really, the person for whom tonight is going to be everything, Ron DeSantis. He absolutely needs to come in second place. I mean, the end. If he comes in, in third, below Nikki Haley, there are going to be significant questions about what is next for him because it's going to be Haley that's going to get another shot at Donald Trump in New Hampshire to the point that DeSantis has announced he's going straight from here on to South Carolina, which is the following contest. Nikki Haley was the governor of South Carolina, and she, at this point, expectations are higher for her than they were, which is a little bit of a risk for any campaign. The final Iowa poll showed her moving into second place over Ron DeSantis for the first time in that particular poll. However, as long as she doesn't collapse, Haley is really going to get another shot in New Hampshire. The real thing that - that Iowa could be for her, if she gets second, is a springboard. That would send her to New Hampshire with momentum that I don't think any of us particularly expected, especially because she honestly hasn't made a big a play for Iowa until here in the final weeks, Poppy.",

She has to do better than people are anticipating because what that does, it gives you the momentum heading into New Hampshire.And what she has the benefit of that I don't think that DeSantis has is she has a ground game outside of Iowa. We've been talking about Iowa for so long. It is the first in the nation caucus, but it is not reflective of the nation. People in Iowa, they're white, more evangelical, they're more faith-based. You go into New Hampshire, it's a different demographic. It's a different focus. Same going into South Carolina, as well as Nevada. Nikki Haley will resonate in these other states, whereas Ron DeSantis doesn't have that benefit. He's skipping New Hampshire, going right to South Carolina. So, she benefits from having a more general election type of message moving forward out of Iowa, which will help her in this all-important delegate race. So, doing well out of Iowa gives her momentum. Donors will pay attention. Voters will pay attention. And they will say, let's give her a chance because she is the non-Trump candidate that we've been looking for.",

So, that will be really important.But the other thing that Alice mentioned that is so critical, now begins the race for delegates.

About 97 percent of the contributions that we got in the fourth quarter were under $200, right? Those are folks like teachers and nurses who are giving $5, $10 at a time by going to joebiden.com. They're doing so because they understand, a, what this president has done to fight on behalf of them, but they also understand what's at stake in this election, and that's whether or not we're going to hold on to what the president referred to as a sacred cause of America, which is our democracy. And so we're excited about the enthusiasm that we've seen thus far in the race. We're excited for the fight ahead. We'll be watching closely to see who emerges here tonight in Iowa.
