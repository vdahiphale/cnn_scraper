This is the man who oversaw the initial phases of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which didn't go very well. And when the Ukrainians say that, perhaps he's been given the chance to fail twice, that certainly looks like it. But there's an important sort of behind the scenes struggle going on here between the Russian army and Yevgeny Prigozhin [ph], who's the head of the Wagner Group, who is really - - had the Wagner Group and its soldiers and convicts turned recruits, are the major participants, it seems in the battles of Bakhmut and Soledar. And he has been very critical of the Russian high command of the military and is essentially presenting himself and the Wagner group as sort of an alternative to the formal structures of the army. So this is an attempt perhaps, by the military to reestablish its predominance, its preeminence in this war.

I mean, we haven't seen any successful operation during this campaign, apart from the original getting into Ukraine from all possible corners, and then failing in most of them.

It doesn't have any civilian control. And as a -- as a -- as a sort of encapsulated organization, it preserves its own elites and it preserves its own leaders.

So whether this is going to be effective, I'm sure that it's a -- we knew about that strategy before. Essentially, Russian Armed Forces were throwing their people right now. Just right now, it's climbing to a completely new levels, because they indeed throwing hundreds without any thinking what's going to happen with them in the next few minutes. So I'm sure we'll find the ways to stop that. I'm sure that will be -- will be okay. Because this is not -- this is -- in 21st century, that cannot be a winning strategy.

We've learned Mr. Biden's legal team ordered searches of various locations following the initial discovery of classified records in November. Now, the president's former think tank office in Washington. Resource tells CNN the first batch contained 10 classified documents, including U.S. intelligence and briefing materials on Ukraine, Iran, and the U.K. CNN senior U.S. justice correspondent, Evan Perez, joining us now. And, Evan, this is threatening to become a major political embarrassment for the Biden administration. And it comes as his predecessor, former president Donald Trump, of course faces a special counsel investigation over his alleged mishandling of classified records. What are we doing about this latest batch found and what the White House is saying at this point? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, at least the discovery or the disclosure of the -- of this new batch of documents creates a perception problem for the White House, which is obviously, for now, we're asking questions about why didn't they disclose it when they said earlier this week, that they had found an initial set of documents -- classified document's own office here in Washington? What we know is that after the discovery of that -- of that set of documents, there were 10 documents that had classified records, various classification levels. They conducted additional searches of other residences, other offices that were used by Joe Biden during the time of the Donald Trump presidency. And this is when they discovered this second set of documents. We don't know very much about it. We don't know what level of classification it is. We know that they've turned them over to the federal government, which has been doing a review. The Justice Department has been doing a review of the -- of these documents. The question for the Justice Department now, Becky, is one of, does this perception create the need to appoint a special counsel to do a full-blown criminal investigation of the sitting U.S. president? As you describe that it's threatening to be a political problem, I think we're already there. It's a bit of a debacle really that you wouldn't come out and just say everything at once, rather than having it come out during dribs and drabs. That's the problem that they've created for themselves. And so we'll see what the -- whether the White House will more -- will acknowledge more about what they're doing to clean this up today.",

And the reason why this is important is we have seen, at least one witness, who has testified to the House Committee that was looking into January 6, that she felt that the attorney who was being paid for by the Trump team really was trying to push her to mislead investigators and that creates an obstruction of justice problem, which is now clearly something that the Special Counsel Jack Smith is now looking into more closely.

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky, you know, it does feel like the Fed has all of the momentum right now and is on track to win this war oninflation. These latest numbers are encouraging, you know, annual inflation, increasing six and a half percent. That's not healthy, but that is much better than that 9% figure from six months earlier. This is actually the lowest in 14 months. Month-over-month, we see prices were actually down. We haven't seen anything like that since this inflation crisis began. So let's look at where prices are cooling off. We saw a decline year-over-year in gasoline prices. That's huge. That is also really important psychologically. Used car prices, those had skyrocketed during much of COVID. There was a shortage of computer chips. They're down almost 9%. And look at that televisions also related to computer chips down 14%. But listen, this war on inflation is not over. It's way too early to declare victory. Look at where inflation remains hot. For example, shelter. Shelter prices up by seven and a half percent. That is significant. That's the biggest year-over-year increase since 1982. Supermarket prices, of course, remain very high. And a lot of people are talking about egg prices. They're up almost 60% year-over-year. We haven't seen anything like that since 1973. So there's some good news here for the Fed. There's still some reasons to be cautious. So, Becky, I think what we can expect from the Fed is they're not going to do another one of those monster 75 basis point increases. The thinking right now is either they do another 50 basis point increase on February 1 or perhaps more likely they downshift and they raise interest rates by just a quarter of a point. And maybe we get some more hints about whether or not the Fed can actually pause the rate hikes altogether in the coming months.",
