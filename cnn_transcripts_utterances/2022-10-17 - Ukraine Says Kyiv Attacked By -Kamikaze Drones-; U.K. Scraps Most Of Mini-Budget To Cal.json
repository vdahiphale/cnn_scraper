Officials say at least four people were killed including a pregnant woman and her husband in a strike on a residential building. And rescuers are still looking for survivors in the rubble. The Kyiv attacks coming in the morning around the time that commuters were getting ready to go to work. And they were part of a wider assault on the country's energy infrastructure, people being urged to conserve power to help keep the grid stable. Monday's attacks now have Ukraine calling for sanctions against Iran saying it's responsible for \"the murder of Ukrainians.\" Well, government officials claimed the Kamikaze drones used to attack Kyiv were Iranian-made. Tehran denies giving Russia weapons to use in Ukraine, but the EU plans to look for concrete evidence of Iran's role in Putin's war. And CNN's Clarissa Ward is live in Kyiv. She'll join us in a moment. First, let's get you to our Fred Pleitgen in Dnipro where that power grid, Fred, came under attack, and the officials there as I understand it says there is a serious destruction to the infrastructure. What more do we know at this point?",

There was a fire apparently for an extended period of time. And that the situation there was really pretty dire after that energy infrastructure installation was hit here, as they say, but also by those Russian kamikaze drones. Now, the current situation they say is still very difficult here in the city of Dnipro and also in the outlying areas. The power plant that was hit, Becky, was about 40 kilometers away here from the city of Dnipro, in a very industrialized area. And so the authorities here are urging people to conserve electricity. And you know it's something that you really can see on the ground here. Last night, also, most of the street lights are off. Most of the lights in general are off as people are trying to conserve energy as that power grid keeps getting hit. And Ukrainian authorities have been saying that they are working very quickly to get all the power infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and of course, also heating back up and running as fast as possible because of course they understand it's something that's badly needed, especially in the region where I am, but also in other regions of Ukraine as well. And so many of them were hit today, we've been focusing a lot on Kyiv. And obviously situation there this morning was definitely one that was devastating for the local population there and also, once again, energy infrastructure hit there. But also, for instance, in the Sumi region in the northern part of the country where you also had an energy infrastructure hit. And the Ukrainians are saying this is part of a larger campaign to sow terror against the Ukrainian population and to also devastate the Ukrainian population, as the winter approaches. Of course, what we're hearing from Ukrainian officials is they believe that this is -- or they say this is something that's definitely not going to work. If anything they say it will strengthen their resolve rather than have the opposite effect, Becky.",

I think today was the first time we saw them use, was such an effect here in the capital in Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities said that they intersected some 15 of them that were headed towards the city of Kyiv, four of them struck with deadly effect, at least four people killed, a residential building hit, we were there at the scene earlier and, you know, just awful. The body of an older woman was brought out. Also among the dead, a young couple, the wife reportedly six months pregnant. And essentially what Ukrainian authorities are saying is that these drones are very difficult for their radar systems to detach. They're asking for more support in terms of more sophisticated and more widespread anti- aircraft weaponry to help try to repel these kinds of attacks. You've seen now these images on social media, just extraordinary of police and rescue workers basically just firing at one of the drones with their -- with their own rifles in a desperate attempt to stop it in its deadly path. But you mentioned also and significantly that the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, coming out today and saying, OK, enough is enough. We need to see sanctions against Iran for supplying these weapons to Russia and for continue doing to increase even the number of these drones that are being supplied with such deadly effect here on the ground in Ukraine, Becky.",

There's obviously the advantage ofthem being difficult to detect with radars, the advantage that they're firing off a lot of anti-aircraft missiles, like very valuable anti- aircraft missiles in an attempt to take these drones down. But then you also have the kind of palpable effect on the public psyche. I mean, Kyiv had been relatively peaceful for the last few months up until a week ago, you had that last Monday, a barrage of missiles slamming into the city, today, for the first time really seeing those drones. And you can hear them, Becky. They have a very loud, kind of whirring sound almost like a lawnmower. And of course, that contributes to a palpable sense of fear that people living here on the ground feel. But the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who we talked to at the site of one of those blasts was saying, listen, this is quite clearly an attempt to attack civilians, to intimidate and cow civilians, and of course, to hit civilian infrastructure. But the effect that it's having is quite the reverse, in fact, that people are feeling angrier than they were before. They're feeling more hardened in their resolve to try to win this war once and for all. And I just want to note that they have really been hitting this one specific area in downtown Kyiv now last Monday and again today, this is an area where there is critical civilian infrastructure. And we don't yet know whether any of today's blasts did successfully cause some kind of damage to that infrastructure.

Well, the markets are higher and alongside other markets around the world. And this is the state of play the FTSE100 which is, of course, the London Stock market up about 1.3 percent. But that just reflects as you can see some rises elsewhere. And NASDAQ doing particularly well today in that market full of tech stocks, of course, that up some 3 percent. Well, CNN's Bianca Nobilo is watching all of this in London. And she joins me now. The government once again conceding today that it went, \"too far, too fast,\" what more can we expect when we hear from the UK finance minister in the next hour or so? BIANCA NOBILO, CNN HOST &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, it was exceptional that we heard from the new finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, earlier today before he addressed the House of Commons because, as you well know, on matters of tax and big government policy, the way things are done is for that minister to tell Parliament first before he speaks to the media. But because of the sensitivity of the markets and the economic crisis that the UK finds itself in, there was a discussion between the finance minister and the speaker and they decided that actually, it was OK if he comes out first thing Monday morning to try and give the markets that reassurance. And we might need a different term other than U-turn because this is a complete dismantling of Liz Truss and her former Chancellor's mini-budget. It completely undermines all of the economic principles and platform by which she was elected, which has led many MPs to question what is the point of Liz Truss, why she's still there if the key principles which got her into number 10 are now completely dispensed with. It appears that the chancellor is now the one in charge. Let's actually take a listen to one of the most powerful elements of that statement earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But it has to be said the Biden administration has been somewhat more cautious in its approach than perhaps the Obama administration was when we saw protest sweeping across the country back in 2009. But, of course, the U.S. government has placed sanctions on both Iranian officials they accused of perpetrating human rights abuses, as well as institutions, including the morality police, which has long been the culprit of violence against women and of course, has come to the fore when we're talking about Mahsa Amini and other women in Iran who have faced the brutal violence of the morality police. But it's not just the U.S. government. The EU, of course, taking a hard- line approach considering further sanctions on Iranian officials. The UK has faced new sanctions on Iranian officials. Also, there has been a concerted response by the international community, condemning the violence that we're seeing as described by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as excessive and lethal force by the Iranian security forces. But the message that we are hearing from human rights organizations, particularly those that are operating in Iran, is that more needs to be done to hold the Iranian regime to account. They have tried very hard to block the spread of information. We've seen internet blackouts in pockets of the country. But these protests are continuing. They are gaining momentum.

She did not hesitate to do so because her focus is on the well- being of every one of our citizens. It was the right thing to do. And whether you agree with this or not, it took courage to do it.

The fact that Penny Mordaunt who also vide recently and almost successfully to become prime minister was replacing Liz Truss and delivered quite a strong performance that seemed to have been liked by the benches behind her will only put Truss's struggles, I think an even sharper relief. And, Becky, we should bear in mind that following Penny Mordaunt shortly will be Jeremy Hunt, another person who recently vide to become prime minister instead of Liz Truss. Now both of those people give stronger performances than the prime minister has been of late. You can only imagine how that's going to deepen her political despair.",

And that very much is reflected in the markets today. The stock market is higher, as is the UK pen significantly higher from the point at which it collapsed to two weeks or so ago.

So everything happened as it was supposed to. But it is unusual. And actually speaks to the level of crisis, the fact that he even needed to do that. In terms of what we might hear from him today, a fleshing out of details. But the key message was absolutely clear, which is that everything basically in Liz Truss, in the former Chancellor's mini-budget that hasn't already been through Parliament, and had the rubber stamp from His Majesty will be thrown out. So it's a completely different economic direction that he's going to take the country in. And as to whether or not that will buy Liz Truss any more time perhaps. You know, if the markets were more destabilized, then I think the Conservative Party would feel like they'd have to act faster to oust her. This time, it might mean that they feel they can be a little bit more strategic but they will continue behind the scenes because they think her position is simply not tenable.",

China is still pursuing the zero-COVID strategy where entire cities are still being locked down over just a handful of COVID cases. And despite the growing frustrations of people, it's this is upending billions of people's lives, Xi Jinping made clear in his speech that zero-COVID is not going away. In fact, he said zero-COVID is a success that has put Chinese people's lives above all else. He also talked about boosting economic growth with innovation. He discussed more self-reliance and technology. Now in foreign policy, he didn't directly name any countries in specific but there were a lot of hints of threats from the United States. For instance, he said that China opposes any unilateralism hegemony or bullying. And on Taiwan, there was the biggest applause, Becky, when he said that China would never renounce the use of force, the biggest applause from the more than 2000 Communist party delegates in the audience.

The NASA spacecraft is on a 12-year mission, covering 6.4 billion kilometers to fly past eight ancient asteroids. Lucy is the first mission to investigate the Trojan asteroid swarms, which are asteroid clusters along Jupiter's orbital path. Armed with cameras, a thermometer, and an infrared imaging spectrometer, Lucy will collect the first high- resolution images of these asteroids. The spacecraft gets her name from the Lucy fossil, an ancient human ancestor whose remains transformed the study of hominid evolution.
