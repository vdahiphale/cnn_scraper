She spent more than 30 years working for Trump, sitting outside his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower she controlled his calendar her testimony comes after more than ten hours of questioning, cross-examination, redirect re-cross of David Pecker a longtime friend of the former president's and former executive behind the national enquirer tabloid.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, as you mentioned, Rhona Graff worked for the Trump organization for almost 30 years. She sat right outside of Donald Trump's office in Trump Tower. She managed his calendar and she just testified to all that again, in court. She said that she's there on pursuant a subpoena, so as she is essentially forced to be there, subpoenaed by prosecutors as their witness.And right now, she's testifying about her role in managing Trump's contacts with the Trump Organization, and she's just told the jury that two of the contacts that she maintained for the Trump Organization were Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Obviously, two potential witnesses in this case, two people that we've heard a lot about, and there are at the center of the prosecutions case here that this hush money payments, these hush money payments that are paid to suppress stories, negative stories about their alleged relationships with Donald Trump, in order to prevent them from getting out and impacting his election there. She is very intimately aware of any contact that was happening between the Trump Organization and these two women. Her testimony is ongoing. Like you said, this comes after David Pecker, the tabloid king, just wrapped up about 10-1/2 hours of testimony, has been on the stand answering questions from both defense attorneys and prosecutors. Defense attorneys for Donald Trump had to poke holes in his credibility, undermine his credibility on the stand by noting some small inconsistencies in his story. But upon redirect, the prosecution did try to re-establish that by honing in on the key points here and the key points according to Pecker's testimony, are that his understanding was based on that 2015 meeting, in August 2015, in Trump Tower, that he was supposed to buy these stories as they came up before anybody else could buy them and publish them to prevent them from getting out and he did so to help a presidential campaign. That's something he re-established on multiple occasions today, really again, reinforcing the core point of what the prosecutions argument is here is that these hush money payments were about helping Donald Trump's presidential campaign by preventing these negative stories from surfacing elsewhere. That includes both the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal stories. But the difference with the Stormy Daniels or and this is where David Pecker's testimony sort of left off offers that were Stormy Daniels, David Pecker says that he did not pay for that story. He did, however, raise, highlight, alert Michael Cohen, that this story was floating out there and he did recommend that Michael Cohen should pay and buy this story, before another media outlet published it. He actually said on the stand today that if this story got out through another media outlet, quote, the boss is going to be very, very, very angry with you. So he also reaffirmed to that this again, was all about helping and Donald Trump presidential campaign. He reinforced Michael Cohen's role in this alleged conspiracy, and he sort of set the scene for these future witnesses, including Rhona Graff, who is testifying and putting them in the context that the jury needs to know as this case moves forward, and as the prosecution continues to paint its narrative. Do we know what the intent or just watching the cross- examination from the defense, where exactly were they trying to poke holes in Peckers testimony? One key theme of the defense attorneys questioning was trying to make the case that these hush money payments were business as usual for Pecker as the tabloid king. That this was something that was highly normal and something that he did regularly in order to further his own business interests. And that's the other thing he said. They're going to highlight the fact that these Trump stories and buying these Trump stories was good for Pecker's business. That they pointed out that there was one incident where this investigation may need it would have helped Pecker to wrap up this investigation in order to sell off the \"National Enquirer\" intimating that he only agreed to testify that non-prosecution agreement in order to further his own business interests. [15:05:05] The prosecution, again, tried to rebuff that in their own line of questioning after the fact, but these inconsistencies were quite small. They're picking on little discrepancies in what Pecker said during his interviews with the FBI, and then in his testimony later on, the prosecution did for the most part, try to clear that up and reinforce the core point here, which was that Pecker's understanding is that he was to buy these stories, prevent them from coming out in order to help Trump's reelection campaign. And when it came to Stormy Daniels under that '15 -- 2015 agreement, he brought that up to Michael Cohen and suggested that he buy it for the same reason.",

She can also testify that there was an ongoing flow of people in and out of his office who had to get checks signed. She can also know what -- if the door was open, what the conversations were. She is like eyes and ears on Donald Trump when he's sitting in Trump Towers.This is very important because it sets the stage for the later witnesses are going to come in and say, I was there, I talked about this.

She knows what was going on with Trump, both with respect to the election in his personal life and she knows the level and degree of involvement that he has with signing invoices, signing checks, having these conversations, meetings with Michael Cohen, Pecker, that meeting is so critical, and She's the one that was maintaining the calendar. So I would say she has a dual purpose. Some of what we just spoke about would be the substantive testimony that we're going to hear the other piece of it will be putting together a timeline. Remember this is eight years ago, so she's going to verify what our business records, entries that she might have on the calendar or emails relating to these meetings in order to submit those into evidence and ultimately we build that timeline because remember, that's important to the prosecution.

Melissa Bell, good to have you there. Thanks so much. Well, here in the U.S., throughout the week, we've been bringing new scenes from those anti-war protests, continued to spread so many different campuses and sometimes seems like this as well. Yesterday at Emory University in Atlanta, two professors, police arrested two professors there. One throwing one to the ground, two officers on a female professor. Her name is Carolyn Fohlin, she tried to help a student who was pinned to the ground by four police officers. Today, authorities charged her with disorderly conduct and simple battery against a police officer. Remarkable to watch that. The University of Southern California has canceled its commencement ceremony after police arrested nearly 100 protesters earlier this week.

And it was clear after you hearing from them that these negotiations that are seven days in, to use their word, have reached a stalemate. So there's going to be big question about what will come next when negotiations come into -- continuing to the weekend. What is almost pretty much guaranteed at least for the rest of today, and perhaps the next few days is this encampment will still remain here.Now there is still that long list of demands that we've heard from students, of course, what they described as the primary objective right now is divestment, and also amnesty for some of the students and the faculty who have faced some consequences, the academic consequences for their involvement in some of this demonstrations. In terms of an objective for the university, theirs is to dismantle the space. You see the whole goal is to prepare this massive space for commencement ceremony that's scheduled for the next couple of weeks. But in order for that to happen, as we heard from the students a short while ago, they need to find common ground at this point, but at least his based on what we just heard from some of the student leaders here, that seems unlikely for now. Now, back to what you and I discussed about yesterday, which there was reported some not only the students, but also university reported some progress that was made in those negotiations, that happened on at least two fronts according to one of the two negotiators that I just heard from a short while ago, that is on finance -- the issue of financial disclosure. Basically, the students want to find out exactly where the university is investing their money especially with companies associated with Israel. And then secondly, on the issue, or at least the an item that's on the negotiation table, which is for potential statement from the president of the university, specifically addressing the events of last week. As you recall, that's when the university of reached out to the NYPD and ask for the agency's assistance for helping clearing out an encampment just like this one, only to have it pop back up. So here we are again, Jim, to seven days into these negotiations. Unclear if they will continue into the weekend, but we do know for sure is at least at this point, that forward momentum, if there was any, at any point which we believe there was based on what we heard, it seems that that has slowed.",
