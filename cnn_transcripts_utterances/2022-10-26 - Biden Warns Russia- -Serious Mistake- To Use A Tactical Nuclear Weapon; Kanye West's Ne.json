Very precisioned, very able to disable these bridges. So, those 20,000 Russian troops are vulnerable or in trouble.

I came from Holocaust survivor parents. And I wound up as the ambassador to the European Union, which is one of the most consequential posts in the U.S. government. The reason I wrote it is I wanted to encourage people to consider a couple of things. First of all, we need to be working very closely with the European Union, which is our largest trading partner and our most powerful ally. Because when we work together we're an unstoppable bloc. I know for a fact the Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, the North Koreans do not like it when they see no daylight between us and the European Union, and we don't take advantage of that often enough. We squabble over all kinds of things that are not important and we don't focus on the big things that are important. And that's one of the reasons I wrote the book.",
