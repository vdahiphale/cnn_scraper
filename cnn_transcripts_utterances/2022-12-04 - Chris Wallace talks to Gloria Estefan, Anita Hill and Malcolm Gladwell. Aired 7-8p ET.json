And you know, it's funny, neither of my parents, the reason they were able to get married in 1958, was that neither of them took their identity that seriously. My father, if you prodded him wouldn't have said he was -- if you asked him to describe the top five words that describe you, he would not have been in the top five. If you asked my mother the same question in those years, she would have said, well, I'm a Christian. I'm interested in psychology. You know, she would have come up with -- the fact that she was Black would have been low on the list. So I come from a family that exists because we didn't foreground those issues. So, it's always a tricky question for me. I sort of feel the same way. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about what my own identity is, because it's so -- it's such a mess.
