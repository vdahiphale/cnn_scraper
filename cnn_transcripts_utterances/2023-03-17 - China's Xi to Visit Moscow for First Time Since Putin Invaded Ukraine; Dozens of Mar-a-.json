They refuse to even call it an invasion.And even though President Xi is trying to portray himself as a neutral diplomat, a peacemaker, he hasn't even been willing to get on the phone with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. And now his first overseas visit after his endorsement as president for a third term, an unprecedented third term in China, it really just show that Xi's priorities are, you know, on his authoritarian best bud, Vladimir Putin, as they continue to entrench against the west and help really Russia kind of minimize the impact for regular people of the sanctions by the west as well as providing potentially microchips and other things that Russia needs for the military.

      "sentences": "I'm going define it in neutral terms, not in critical terms. Being woke refers to becoming alert to invisible societal injustices generally based on genetically inherited characteristics, like race, sex and sexual orientation, and then being called upon to act on those injustices using whatever potential legal means are necessary, including the market to do it. That's a neutral definition that even most proponents of woke-ism in the United States would agree with.Now, my criticism of this is I think that it's inherently divisive to tell us that we're nothing more than the characteristics we inherit on the day we're born. That divides us on the basis of race and sex and sexual orientation. And then when that merges with capitalism, which is what I've actually been the biggest critic of, what it does is we lose the sanctuary, the apolitical sanctuary in our economy that otherwise brings us together whether we're black or white, even whether we're Democrat or Republican.

You know, Ron DeSantis is making this sort of the focal point of his soon to come campaign, which is what does it mean to you? I mean, is it the war with Disney? Is it a war with DEI and ESG or is it more about just like cultural norms and the way that we interact with the people around us.",

It is being aware of issues that have to do with minorities, destruction of the country, issues that have to do with women, issues that have to do with any marginalized community. That's what it is. It's not defining people. It's being aware of the structural injustices in our society and trying to be better, not trying to cancel people. So, I think that he's wrong on that.

Pence did not apologize. He said not only can Buttigieg do not do his job, he can't take a joke. Did it surprise you that Pence went there with that?",
