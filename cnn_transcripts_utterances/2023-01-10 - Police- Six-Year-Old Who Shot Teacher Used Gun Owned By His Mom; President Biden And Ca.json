      "sentences": "Well, Kate, what we were told earlier today by the police chief of Newport News, Steve Drew, is that there is \"certainly a possibility that the mother of this child could face charges in this case.\" We have asked the police chief repeatedly about why the mother has not been charged, the mother did legally purchase that gun, a nine-millimeter Taurus handgun. And the police chief said they can't make that determination yet until they speak more with Child Protective Services, until they speak with investigators further, and until he, the police chief, speaks to the Commonwealth's attorney to make the determination as to whether the mother could be charged. But him telling CNN this morning, that there is certainly a possibility that she could be charged.You know, lots of other kind of burning questions about this case, how did the child obtain the handgun in the home? We know that the child got the handgun in the home somehow. put it in his backpack, took it to work, pulled it out, and fired a single shot at the teacher Abby Zwerner. So, those are the details that we do know. But the key question as to how the child obtained the gun at the house. I specifically asked the chief whether that gun was secured at the house, but he did not really answer that. He was not able to answer that at the time. I think some of this is still being determined in the investigation. The chief is also talking about heroes in this case. And we do have a number of them to talk about. He was really effusive in his praise of that teacher Abby Zwerner for getting all those kids out of the classroom. She was the last one to leave the classroom. And there was one other teacher, Kate, who went in and restrained the child until the police got there. The child became combative and struct the school employee, but they were able to restrain the child until police got there. So, that person is hailed as a hero this morning as well.",

And it's pretty clear was within 24 hours, maybe even sooner than that, the first time I talked to CNN, I knew I wasn't going to charge this kid because it was legally impossible. So, the -- you have to have two things to have a crime. You have to have the Actus Rea, or the Act, which we have here, the shooting. Two, you have to have the Mens Rea, or the mental capacity to form intent.Children that old had been held by courts for centuries, decades, not to be able to form the intent necessary to commit a crime. So, take that off the table. This is a civil case regarding him. The community ought to wrap its arms around this young kid tried to get him out of that horrific situation where his parents obviously think that guns will protect her but don't understand that they don't protect the community, and especially children in hers, could have just as been easily the child being injured. So, you know, this is the mindset in America, that has to change, OK? The mindset has to be less on the rights of somebody less on the parents' fear, and more on the victims, or potential victims, which is you and me and my kids and your kids. I think the country needs to have a constitutional amendment for Victim Rights. The outrageous thing here is that we have many states who have Victim Rights -- crime victim rights in their state constitutions, the United States Constitution doesn't, so, when the Supreme Court comes calling, and I've argued a case in front of the Supreme Court, about a school shooting way back in just a couple of years after this case, they're more interested in the NRA point of view and less interested in the victims. And I wouldn't be happy to argue that any day of the week, whether we should care about dead schoolchildren or wounded schoolchildren versus the right to have these guns. And when we get in the constitution, that debate will change significantly.",

But as you say, there are tremendous things that we can build on here at home.North America is the largest free trading bloc in the world, larger even than the European Union. We have a tremendous amount to contribute to the world in goods and services, but also the technologies and solutions that the world really needs. And our capacity to work together has brought us to places of extraordinary success. But at a time of disruption around the world, a ton of very real challenges, we can and must be doing even more. So, I'm really pleased with all the work that our folks have been doing over the past many months and years on aligning or coordinating so that we're leading the way on the -- on the net zero transition we all have to do while at the same time ensuring that individual, Canadians and Americans and Mexicans and others around the world can see themselves in the future in an optimistic way, and understand that yes, we're at a time the challenges and strife. But you're right. There's a lot of reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us in our countries. But it's going to take a lot of work something that neither you nor I nor mostly our citizens have ever been afraid of, rolling up our sleeves and building a better future and most better communities is absolutely essential. So, as we talk about issues, whether it's Haiti, whether it's some of the challenges in South America, whether we talk about critical minerals and energy and how we're going to continue to move forward to create those efficient and resilient supply and value chains that we need, there's a lot that we're going to be able to do together.
