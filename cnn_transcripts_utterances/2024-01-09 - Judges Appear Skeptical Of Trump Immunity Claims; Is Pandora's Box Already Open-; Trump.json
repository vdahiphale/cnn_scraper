      "sentences": "All right, so what happened in Donald Trump's immunity hearing? It comes down to just one word. I'll tell you what it is tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Okay, so today's word of the day -- take that Merriam Webster -- is concede, meaning to admit that something is true or valid after first denying or even resisting it. Why is that the word of the day? Because a court of appeals heard a major concession -- see what I did there -- from the lawyer, from a former president who has refused to concede that he lost the election, and he did lose that election. Now before today, Trump's lawyers were absolutely -- what's the word? Adamant. Totally convinced, seemingly, that the president has absolute immunity for Trump's conduct while, of course, he was in office. In fact, they wouldn't even budge on this point. Well, at first, they wouldn't budge. But then, right out of the gate, with questioning from one of the judges in the circuit court, they were forced to make a powerful concession that, of course, there is not absolute immunity, meaning you can never charge a former president for action taken while in office. If it was criminal or otherwise, they can see that you can, you can prosecute under certain circumstances. And they only admitted that after the judge gave them a whole string of hypotheticals that could really -- I mean, only have one legitimate, truthful answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FLORENCE PAN, JUDGE OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT (voice-over): Could a president who ordered S.E.A.L Team 6 to assassinate a political rival, who was not impeached, would he be subject to criminal prosecution? JOHN SAUER, TRUMP'S LAWYER (voice-over): If he were impeached and convicted first. PAN (voice-over): So, your answer is no. SAUER (voice-over): My answer is qualified yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A moment for you to answer a question and a yes or no so they know what they're working with. Are you a delusional attorney who can keep a straight face while making any argument whatsoever no matter how absurd the argument may be, or maybe are you reasonable, willing to admit that one and one really does equal two?But instead, a qualified yes, hmm, over the mere thought of a president of the United States. Remember, we call our president the leader of the free world. Whether they could assassinate a political rival, that was the hemming and hawing and the qualification. Was that worth the credibility of the other arguments that you want to raise? This is where common sense has got to come into play. I mean, I know you call on lawyers for a lot of things, but some things just require the common sense of every person who knows what yes and no actually means and, of course, a hypothetical. You have to be willing to actually admit the obvious because if you do not do that, you will lose your credibility forever in front of the court. But Donald Trump, back to my word of the day, he still refuses to concede that, which is obvious to his advisors and obvious, if you hear Jack Smith tell you, that he refuses to concede, he refuses to concede and admit that he lost the election, and the conduct taken, hmm, problematic.

No, the United States Supreme Court has said that a president is immune for their official acts.

The first actual votes in the race for the GOP presidential nomination because the Iowa caucuses are just six days away. Now, our public contenders are all over the state. They are trying to win over caucus goers. Well, everyone except for the person you see on the far right there or in the center of my screen there, Donald Trump.Today, he was in the campaign -- not in the campaign but in a courtroom instead in Washington, D.C. and, of course, choosing to attend this very consequential court hearing on whether he has presidential immunity for some of the federal charges instead, of course, stumping across the campaign trail. Now, the reality, though, is maybe he was on the campaign trail because the courtroom shows a bit of his political currency, does it not? I mean, look at these numbers. Look at these numbers. According to a knowledge panel poll, Trump's mounting legal troubles have not even dented his status as a GOP frontrunner. In fact, the indictments have perhaps strengthened his position. I want to dive in now with former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent and Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for \"The Atlanta Journal- Constitution.\" Can we put those numbers back up for a second? Because I think they tell a very compelling story here. Look at those numbers of before and after. Pre-indictments, 47%. Now, 63%. That is striking for a lot of reasons.

They, too, often would defend him when he's being -- in the New York case when he was indicted over the hush money payments of Stormy Daniels, they defended him. Well, all they're doing is elevating Trump. I mean, it's just acts of political malpractice by his opponents. The only one is Chris Christie, the only one who seems to take him on his conduct.

The other one was August 24th when he was booked into Fulton County jail. These are huge fundraising days. There's the mugshot, he also fundraised off of that.I mean, the idea that people are seeing him perhaps as that victim of the deep state, as Charlie alluded to, or that he is just defiant and he is against this, what people perhaps perceive as a political persecution, the fact that he is fundraising so heavily and it's not derailing at all, significant. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yeah, I think it's interesting because both of those dates you mentioned were also huge spectacles. I happened to be in New York, I was outside the courtroom, it was chaotic and pandemonium and people lined up. Trump knows how to harness the spectacle for campaign and political purposes. And normally, we think about that in terms of rallies or public events. Well, now, these court cases, these hearings, are part of the spectacle. It's why he would leave the campaign trail to go to a court date that he didn't even have to be there in person for. And again, you mentioned the fundraising. I think it's not just the victimhood of himself that he's fundraising on. He also tells his supporters, you're being persecuted, your right to elect me is being taken away by these cases. And so, that's part of his messaging and it seems to be working.

Now, there are more than 200 MAX-9s in service all around the world, but most of them operate right here in the United States. CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien has been following every twist and turn of this story, and he joins me now. Miles, I got to tell you, every time I hear about this case, the statements make me a little bit more nervous each and every time about our mistake and the cause and grounding aircrafts. There's also a source inside the Boeing safety meeting, says that this mistake, they're calling it, happened in the aircraft's manufacturing supply chain. How would quality control checks have missed something like this? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: I'm stunned, Laura. And they keep saying mistake, singular. It's mistakes, plural. That's the problem here. This is not an isolated event. Boeing, not too long ago, was warning operators of loose knots in the tail section of the 737. They had some problems with the pressure bulkhead. And, of course, most notoriously, the two fatal crashes related to some software designed to keep the aircraft flying properly. This is a series of mistakes by once the gold standard manufacturer of airlines in the world. It's just mind-boggling to anybody in aviation that these bolts would not be turned properly to the right torques and little wires put through them to make sure they don't get loose. And as far as we know, there weren't any bolts on the door, which was ejected from that aircraft, and that is just stunning.",
