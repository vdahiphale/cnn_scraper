Two groups of pro-Ukrainian Russian fighters known as the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps, so they liberated a settlement in the Belgorod region, which sits on the border with Ukraine.The attack left eight people injured and a number of buildings damaged from shelling. Ukrainian officials are insisting neither group is directly linked to the government in Kyiv and both were acting independently. A spokesman for the Kremlin says security forces are working to find what he called a sabotage and reconnaissance group, and claims the attack was meant to divert attention from Wagner forces claiming victory in the battle for the Eastern Ukraine city of Bakhmut. Over the weekend, the head of the Russian mercenary group, Wagner claimed his fighters had taken the city and would hand it over to the Russian military this Thursday. To get more details down from CNN Matthew Chance threatened.

We've just been told the place that we were going to is under heavy shelling so we're going to pull back here and go somewhere else. In the battalion bunker, the commander tells us the Russians have ramped up their shelling on his troops since the advance. Tons of ammo, shrapnel, tanks firing, everything. His units drones recorded their recent successes, but now the Russians have regrouped and in a moment of candor, following losses the previous night, admits morale is flagging. \"Let's be honest,\" he says. \"We are fighting heavily for more than a year. My soldiers went through many battles and two rotations near Bakhmut. Troops are exhausted, but we endure.\" Bakhmut which is just over the hill in that direction has become an object lesson in how Russia's wealth and men and ammunition can prevail, and unless Ukraine gets the modern weaponry support from its allies, it's going to struggle to tip the balance. Callsign \"Fox\" and his unit load up for their hard miles at the front an end the war, getting back to their families -- what drives them into the shelling. Nic Robertson, CNN -- eastern Ukraine.

It will be the five year anniversary in just a couple of days time. Perhaps no coincidence that this particular fine as large as it is, has come at this particular moment. It comes even as the United States and Europe try and hammer out some new framework that will allow for the free flow of data between those very two different legislative frameworks. It's something they found before time after time European courts have struck it down because it is so difficult to square that circle. What American legislation allows in terms of American agencies like the NSA being able to get hold of that data and what European law prevents, that is European data finding itself on those American servers. Now, it is, of course, a fine that targets Meta specifically, but it has implications for all of big tech. Their argument, Meta's argument, is that this could be a serious problem for the global economy, for their business models, since they keep trying to find ways -- having to find ways, to go about their business despite those European rules. It's likely also -- to put extra pressure on the U.S. and European administrations as they seek to hammer out a fresh framework that we expect as early as July, but that could take as long as October. Now, the timing, of course, could have significant impact as well on Meta's ability to carry on doing business for the time being. The company has said that it will appeal the ruling.

Our venture funds SignalFire offers advice on navigating regulations, just like we do with helping with recruiting or growth, because this is becoming such a prevalent issue. And you know, just last month, you saw all of the AI giants saying that they want regulation, and one of the big problems there is that the tech giants love regulation in a lot of ways because it closes the door behind them. It makes it hard for start-ups to come up and compete with them, because the giants have the money to be able to afford jumping through these hoops or paying lobbyists, and the start- ups never will.
