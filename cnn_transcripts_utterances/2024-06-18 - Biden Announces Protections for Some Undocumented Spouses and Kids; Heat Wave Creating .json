The President is there saying that to secure our border, we don't have to walk away from being American. He said we can both secure the border and offer a pathway to citizenship for folks who have been in the country for an extended amount of time.As he pointed out, the average amount of time that these undocumented folks have been in the United States without actual paperwork averages out to about 23 years. He also took the opportunity to attack his opponent, Donald Trump, as being out of touch and inhumane on this issue.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Brianna. I spoke with Representative Delia Ramirez of Illinois and her husband, Boris Hernandez. Her husband got DACA status back in 2012 when he was 14 years old. He crossed the border illegally back in the year 2000.Now, they have been married since the fall of 2020, and he's been trying to go through the process to adjust his status in this country, given the fact that he is now married to a U.S. citizen and a sitting member of Congress. But they say that that process has taken so much time, it is so difficult to understand where they are in this process, and they said that while they're continuing to go through that application, this announcement today could have an impact on their own family if that first route does not go as they hoped. So this is having an impact, not just on thousands of American families right now, but on a member of Congress who says she is the only person in Congress who is from a mixed-status family. And she has to remind her colleagues all the time when they ask, is your husband going on a CODEL? No, he can't go on a CODEL because he is not a U.S. citizen. I think that it's such an important reminder that this does affect such a broad group of Americans. Here is what she said earlier about the president's announcement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DELIA RAMIREZ (D-IL): The reality is there's mixed emotion, right? For me, as the only member of Congress in a mixed-status family, it gives us a little bit more relief. But that's not relief for my brother-in-law or my sister-in-law. So I think part of what you hear, too, is we're thankful for what he's doing today, and we have so much more work to do. There are still hundreds of thousands of people still in the shadows who are going to watch the news today and ask themselves, does this finally mean that I finally get out of the shadows? And for many, not yet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That includes the Post Fire, just about an hour north of L.A. It's charred more than 15,000 acres since it erupted on Saturday. So far, it's about 24 percent contained. We want to go now to CNN national correspondent Natasha Chen, who's on the ground in Castaic, California. Natasha, the winds there are supposed to be easing up. Are firefighters getting a better handle now?",

Though, as we speak, I can still feel some of the wind gusts spreading around those particles.It's been very thick, heavy air. You can feel it sort of burn the eyes a little bit. It feels like very heavy allergies. So even if one is not evacuated from the area, people here definitely feeling the effects. We actually followed some folks out of this command center just now in the last hour to a boat launch, where for the first time in L.A. County, they were actually shuttling fire crews to the perimeter via boat over a lake. And so we watched those hotshot crews go to the southern perimeter where there's a lot of steep and rugged terrain. So even in better conditions, they expect that that can still take about a week to fully secure that line right there. This is just one of more than a dozen wildfires in the West, as you mentioned, a lot of them in Northern California as well, quite near the vineyards and wine country. And then you have the New Mexico fires, the two of them, that have descended upon one village town. As an official described it, like a pair of tongs with that town just in the middle. Here's one resident describing fleeing that place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. MARCO RODRIGUEZ, L.A. COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT: What we're seeing down here at the lower part of the fire, southern part of the fire, is a lot of rugged terrain, really difficult to access. We're going to be putting some crews on boats and trying to get them up to this side here and try to attack this part of the fire with direct attack. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thousands have evacuated from that area. So we're keeping a close eye there where there are extreme drought conditions as well -- Boris and Brianna.",

And this is a state that Vladimir Putin used to be able to boss around together with the United States and other U.N. Security Council members.And now he's actually beholden to him. He owes the North Korean leader quite a lot, it appears. He needs him for the war in Ukraine.",

North Korea has been providing millions of ammunition, so bullets basically, for the weaponry that Russia needs and Russia cannot manufacture.North Korea has also provided missiles, ballistic missiles. According to South Korea, they've been used in Ukraine, in the battlefield there. So the Russians are dependent on North Korea right now for weaponry. I do think, yes, there is a diplomatic angle there, as you mentioned. Russia is trying to show that it has friends and allies, you know, while the West is meeting, while the G7, which kicked Russia out in 2014 when it first invaded Ukraine, the West is meeting and showing that it's allied. Russia is showing, well, I have friends and allies too, but his allies are far weaker and they can help him only in limited ways.",

So if they were neutral, you know, when President Biden took office, meaning we decided we were going to try, but we weren't going to break our backs trying, and certainly President Obama, if you recall, prior to President Trump, had given up on any kind of real diplomatic progress with North Korea. I was there in 2008, actually, when we had the last chance for diplomatic progress, and that was under President Bush.President Trump really made a show of trying to deal with the North Korean leader, but that didn't work either. North Korea has decided that they are going to be a nuclear power, and that presents problems for China in particular, because while it has been kind of a patron country, you know, helping North Korea, it really doesn't want a nuclear North Korea, a nuclear-armed state there. And Russia, I think, has decided that maybe it can live with a nuclear North Korea, again, because it finds it convenient to have this kind of ally. And Russia is really trying, as you mentioned, to shore up its relationships around the world, to demonstrate to the United States that it too has friends. The visit to Cuba was, you know, in that same vein. A little bit more escalatory also, because they used warships to visit Cuba for the first time.",
