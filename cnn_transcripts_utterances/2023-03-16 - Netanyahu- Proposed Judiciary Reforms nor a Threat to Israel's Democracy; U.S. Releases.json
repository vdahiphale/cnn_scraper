And while you definitely hear some of the divisiveness on the street, while we were following some student protesters who were you know, chanting slogans such as democracy, not a dictatorship. You did have some people in cars shouting back at them saying things like some of them, were saying Bibi is King, a reference to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, some of them getting rather passionate. Now, I have not yet seen many of these sorts of counter opinions devolve into violence on the street. But I think that's why the President wanted to speak out ahead of these sorts of things happening, that has not yet happened. But he's really President clearly understands and was talking about the divisiveness that is he believes really hurting the Israeli society. He talked about at the Shabbat tables, how families are being torn apart over this. But as you heard me, the Israeli President put out this compromise proposal that he's been working on for weeks. He essentially called on - to take it or leave it, not cherry pick it. But the coalition government essentially said thanks but no thanks, Benjamin Netanyahu and his government saying that the reforms will they perpetuate the problems that they see with the judiciary. They believe that judiciary has essentially become too powerful meddling into the affairs of the state meddling into the will of the people and that they believe that their reforms need to go forward? Now, they are pushing for these reforms at an incredibly rapid pace. They want to push these reforms to be done, signed, sealed, and delivered within the next few weeks. So the question now is now that this compromise has put for essentially sharp back down back to square one, where do we go from here? Will there be some sort of softening perhaps of the legislation? Will they just continue to push forward unilaterally or now that I believe it's even less likely possibility is some sort of compromise with the opposition? I think the most likely situation will be that within the government itself, they will sort of soften some of the reforms within - with kind of their own negotiations internally and put that forward, unilaterally.",

But it's hard to know, because everything we hear from Netanyahu is essentially no things to the compromise. These reforms need to be done. But you're right about the international pressure. We've heard it several times from the Americans from the President, the Secretary of State and most recently, the U.S. Defense Secretary. And actually today standing next to Benjamin Netanyahu, the German Chancellor, also talking about these reforms, clearly worried about what they will do, essentially calling on the Prime Minister to consider President Herzog's proposals. This is again, another international official standing next to an Israeli official, this time the Prime Minister and urging them to essentially saying that they are worried about these reforms and what they could do to Israeli society. Now, Netanyahu responded by saying Israel will remain a democracy and that these overhauls will only strengthen Israeli but you have to think about the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu is not only a student of history, he is a writer of history. So you have to wonder, what is he thinking? He must know that the history books are being written as we speak. And how will he be portrayed as a result of these reforms if they continue the way they are pushing them forward?",

Get inside his mind find out what someone very close to him over the years thinks he might do next. Well, important step Thursday, in Iran's outreach to its Gulf neighbors, Iran's top security official met here with his UAE counterpart in Abu Dhabi. After years of animosity, the two states have been growing closer lately it comes only days after Iran reestablished ties with Saudi Arabia in a deal brokered by China. Well, as China is enhancing its role in the Middle East some U.S. Senators are questioning U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, a bipartisan group of Senators submitted a resolution on Wednesday that would tie U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia to a report on human rights in the Kingdom. Well, I spoke to one of these Senators, last hour here on \"Connect the World\". He told me that Saudi human rights abuses are one reason it is building stronger ties to China, this the thoughts of Chris Murphy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): One of the reasons that Saudi Arabia is drawn closer to China is that China just doesn't give them a very hard time when it comes to their human rights record. And in fact, gives them technology as they do to other countries that facilitate that campaign of repression. So we should just be the eyes wide open when we think about why Saudi Arabia may be drawn closer to China, it's because China doesn't come with any values asks. ANDERSON (on camera): The Kingdom would argue that they do business with the Chinese and they are close to the Chinese because China is their biggest customer should that not be part of the thinking here?",

If you look 10 years down theroad, oil produced in the Middle East is going to matter much more to China than it will to the United States. And it's an interesting situation we have today in which China essentially, is a free ride on U.S. security guarantees in the Gulf. The United States spends most of the money to secure oil deposits, exploration and transport. China gets more of that benefit today than the United States does. So I don't know that it is completely out of bounds for China to be expected to pick up a little bit more of the cost when it comes to securing a product that over the next two decades is going to matter much more to China than it will to the United States.

The stock of Credit Suisse ease as you just showed there wasup some 20 percent after falling at one point more than 30 percent on Wednesday, definitely some relief that the Swiss National Bank rode to the rescue. And that Credit Suisse took advantage of that credit line. Stocks in Europe holding on to their gains after the European Central Bank decision despite the fact that it came off the back of a lot of speculation that they might moderate that interest rate increase that they might go for a quarter points instead of a half point even though because of the situation in the financial markets. But I will say that in the banks in particular, the rally is cooling off a little bit. We still are in this climate of fear around the vulnerabilities potentially in the banking sector that Credit Suisse in the events that we saw in the U.S. might not be the last shoe to drop. So that's one thing. And there are of course, still lingering concerns in the U.S. with regional banks dropping again today, which Europe is most likely taking note of the ECB though sticking to its guns. As I said, with that half point rate rise clearly telegraphing that the problem with inflation at eight and a half percent in the Euro area is still that top priority. Christine Lagarde, saying that their commitment to bringing it back to the 2 percent target has not waned, that they are of course, closely monitoring the situation in the financial markets.

In the first one there is no contact the Russian jet approaches from behind dumps fuel which is that almost spiraling cloud that you see coming out of the back of the jet and then passes by the U.S. MQ-9 reaper drone. That's the first clip. In that clip you also see the propeller spinning essentially well. The propeller itself is functioning. The drone itself is still flying. It is the second clip that is more crucial to this encounters here an encounter that the Pentagon said lasted 30 to 40 minutes. In this clip, you see roughly the same beginning to the encounter. The Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet approaches from behind begins dumping jet fuel again, that's the spiraling cloud coming out from behind the jet. And then as the collision happens the video essentially pixilated and goes to bars for a moment. How do you know there's a collision when it comes back out? When you have a look at the back or the tail of the Reaper drone? The propeller itself is damaged that forced the propeller to stop or the operators to stop the engine of the propeller from spinning and force the operators to glide the drone itself into the Black Sea some 70 or 80 nautical miles Southwest of Crimea. That's the crucial moment here. Why? First it supports the U.S. account of how this all played out over the Black Sea early Tuesday morning? Second, it undercuts the Russian denial of what happens? In the Russian ambassador to the U.S.'s statement after he was summoned to the State Department on Tuesday he said there were no collusion and no firing at the U.S. drone. No firing. OK, great. We don't see the Russians firing at the drone. But we do have a clear account of the collision itself. And that undermines the Russian account of everything of how this all played out essentially, Becky. We've also learned according to two officials familiar with the intelligence that some of the highest levels of the Russian Ministry of Defense ordered their pilots their fighter jets to harass, disrupt disturb the operations of the U.S. surveillance drones in international airspace over the Black Sea. Though Becky it is worth pointing out that the officials say it doesn't seem like that went all the way up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

The UK ban is kind of other piece with a number of other countries or governments that have taken steps to restrict TikTok from government devices. In recent months, we've seen Canada, the European Union, and over half of U.S. states, restrict TikTok from official government devices and, of course, the United States federal government as well. But you know, with this, you know, call by the U.S. government for TikTok to be spun off into a separate company. That comes out of a rather opaque negotiation that's been going on between TikTok. And the U.S. government for more than two years, about a potential deal that could allow TikTok to keep operating in the United States in light of these security concerns. And, you know, like I said, this, this process is typically pretty opaque, you don't hear very much about how this happens, or what is being discussed. But in this case, TikTok has said that the U.S. government has asked it to spin off its operations from its trainee's owners, which could be, you know, a potential turning point for these discussions. Now, it's not clear and talking to experts on this process, whether this marks the end of the discussion or is simply a negotiating tactic. But it does seem to be, you know, a turning point about in these tensions between the United States and TikTok. And some of this that may be driving it is, you know, caused by U.S. lawmakers to ban TikTok nationwide. You know, there have been a number of bills proposed, and one of which the White House has actually endorsed to give the president more latitude to enact a nationwide ban even on personal devices. And so, it seems this process with TikTok this negotiation the United States government has been engaging in on the side reflects perhaps some of the movements that we're seeing in Congress on this issue, Becky.",

They told us four things, Becky, that they need very simple, and we call them paving the way for climate action for COP28. P for Participation, A for Action, V for Voice, and E for Education that's what global youth keep telling us. They want to participate. So, one of our duties and our strategy in this pillar is to really champion reforms to mainstream youth participation at COP. If you look at A for Action, it is to create spaces and opportunities for climate action that is done by youth. The voice our job is to relay the voice of all youth, especially those coming from indigenous communities and focusing on inclusion, gender equality, et cetera to ensure that their voice shapes outcomes in November pre-post and during COP. And the last is education, we've realized from challenges that you face is that they don't have the necessary knowledge to be equal participants to decision makers at COP. And so, we are really championing and advocating for Climate Education.",

We've heard from the most critical of the young climate activists. That criticism will that be supported here. People around the world will want to know, is this a cop that everybody is invited to that everybody's voice will be heard whether or not it is critical to the extent that it might be inconvenient?",

We are really hoping that COP28 is going to include everyone on the full spectrum.So even when we talk about industry, you might say well, fossil fuels, it's a country of oil and gas. That's the whole point to include everyone because the UAE understands the importance of economic development, but also the energy transition. Today Dr. Sultan is transforming ADNOC, re-booting it, and re-thinking how it can be the next leader that is changed. And that's action. And today the UAE wants to model that but it also wants to learn from others how can we move together towards action? The ambition from young people that we hear is two things. What does success look like? Youth inclusion to be continuous, unbroken and mainstreamed in future COP so, I hope that the Youth Climate Champion, yes, it's a turning point for COP28. But we want it to be a turning point and new normal for future cops.",

And what we are here to witness is a group of these users who are sharing their experience in what slavery and modern slavery means for them. Of course, there are many signs of slavery that we need to learn how to recognize. And so, sharing these experiences among them is the key. And you can see on my background, that there is #MyFreedomDay where they are attaching papers where they write their experiences and how they think modern slavery impacted their lives. So one, they were in a situation of difficulty when they were in a situation of abuse. I'm also here with a new friend who is ready to share her testimony with them. Her name is Laura. She's 24 years old. And she did, she was a victim of modern slavery in the past. And she's here to explain how her experience and what she did to overcome that phenomenon. So what I'm going to ask her is why she thinks her testimony is so important for a day like this.",
