So, FEED helps fund the sort of best-in-class amazing non-profit partners who are working around the globe as well as here in the U.S. to provide those school meals.And for me, it was that exposure. We went to a therapeutic feeding center where children were sort of on the verge of starvation. And these kids just literally for lack of something as simple as food were kind of like lifeless and lacked that energy and vitality that you're expecting with kids. And it just -- it just -- like, there's like no way to properly describe that. And it really is what set me on my journey because the next stop after that therapeutic feeding center where we spent the afternoon was a school. And there, kids were vibrant and curious, and running around and kind of rowdy and rambunctious. And they were there primarily because they were getting a school meal. So, same community less than a mile apart. And it was just the aha moment of like oh my gosh, school meals. Like, that's such a simple intervention to help get kids not only that guaranteed meal but then, again, the education.",
