When pundits and economists talk about a good economy, they`re looking at a few key metrics, the unemployment rate, GDP growth, wages, the stock market. So you can compare those numbers to years past. You can compare them to other similar economies around the world. On both those fronts right now, the U.S. is doing well.",

They say inplace for teen users, but a lot of pressure has been mounting on them recently. And so what they`re doing is they`re adding even more protection. So around search terms like self-harm and suicide and eating disorders, they`re going to hide even more kinds of content. Even among people that teens follow on these platforms. They`re not going to show them if somebody posts about those things. They`re also automatically setting teens in the most restrictive content settings. So right now it`s when you sign up, they put you in that setting. Now, they`re going to do it for all teens automatically. And they`re also going to be sending notifications to prompt teens, to update their privacy settings with a single tap. So all of this of course comes amid this backdrop that really started a couple years ago with the Frances Hogan, Facebook papers coming out, which blew the whistle, including on things like young girls self-image. So that was one thing that was really focused on there. Of course, in the middle of last year, the Surgeon General put out an advisory about kids mental health and social media states have now sued Meta alleging harms to children. And then a second whistleblower coming out at the end of last year, saying that Meta executives alleging that they knew about these kinds of harms and weren`t acting on them. And so there`s also federal legislation pending. So these companies are under a lot of pressure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And rightnow we`re going to head to China to a place where more than 30,000 people per day from around the world, flock to check out a frozen Wonderland. Here`s CNN`s Laila Harrak with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAILA HARRAK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It`s a winter wonderland you won`t see anywhere else. The Chinese city of Harbin saw a record number of visitors over the New Year holiday weekend during its annual Ice and Snow Festival. Well, this ice city features intricate sculptures and structures, all glowing from within, all of course made entirely of ice. WANG TIFEI, TOURIST FROM DELIAN (through translator): It`s quite nice, and quite shocking. When I saw it for the first time, I thought they built it very well, and the ice was very transparent. HARRAK (voice-over): Well, this year, officials say an average of about 30,000 people entered the park every day. That`s nearly double pre-pandemic numbers. Well, the festivities have sold out every hotel. JAI XIA, TOURIST FROM WUHAN (through translator): Booking was pretty difficult. For booking hotels, we spent two to three days before we found a suitable hotel. Tickets for Ice and Snow World were sold out online. So, I bought them on the second-hand website Xianyu. HARRAK (voice-over): The state media says this year`s festival covers 810,000 square meters, nearly nine million square feet, and features 250,000 cubic meters of ice. A rather fitting spectacle as temperatures over the New Year holiday dropped nearly minus 25 degrees Celsius or minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit. But, the cold hardly stopped those itching for fun after the last three years of holiday cheer were stifled by varying degrees of pandemic restrictions. LONG PING, COLLEGE STUDENT (through translator): Because this is the first winter holiday since the pandemic was lifted, and everyone can`t hold back. We`ve been sealed for several years. So, we want to go out and relax, to release some of the stressful feelings from the pandemic. HARRAK (voice-over): Harbin`s Ice Festival will shine bright until early March. In the meantime, the aptly nicknamed Ice City shares its ice, art, and animals with the visitors looking for something cool to do. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
