Lebanese authorities say an Israeli air strike near the country's largest public hospital has killed at least four people.The IDF says it hit a Hezbollah terrorist target near the hospital, but not the hospital itself. A CNN analysis shows the area was not covered by evacuation orders from the Israeli military. The U.S. is turning up its diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza and secure the release of the remaining hostages. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to arrive in Tel Aviv in the coming hours.

On Monday, Israel has struck another branch of a financial institution in Lebanon, which the U.S. accuses of managing Hezbollah finances. Israel claims the group is hiding hundreds of millions in cash and gold under a Beirut hospital.

You can't work in isolation like that. So, the biggest thing in that victory plan which I think everyone doesn't have a problem supporting, especially here in Europe, is for the Ukrainians to get permission to strike further into Russia with Western missiles. I mean, Rosemary overnight across Ukraine, we had 60 Russian drones attacked Ukraine. That's more than I ever remember and we had a missile here 24 hours ago in Odess. So, air defense systems alone don't do it. Ukrainians have to have that ability to strike inside Russia where these launches are coming from. And I think the Europeans understand that.

This was India's largest-ever initial public offering of $3.3 billion worth of shares. But demand had been so great, they received $5.5 billion in bids. And CNN's Mike Valerio is following the story for us from Seoul. He joins us now. Great to see you, Mike. So, what more can you tell us about the stock's debut and how it's performing so far?",

So right now, as I look at the chart on the National Stock Exchange in Mumbai, down 2.59 percent trading, that's certainly off its session lows when the stock was approaching down about 5 percent. But this was to be expected from analysts over the past couple days because institutional investors were talking about -- the big investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, the Government of Singapore were all in on this stock. But as you said, Rosemary, retail investors, people like you and me, the small potatoes who were looking at the stock were thinking maybe it's valued a little too high, so we're going to stay on the sidelines.And that seems to be what investors are signaling here. But this is an interesting blockbuster story nonetheless for the themes that we're going to outline right here, how we got here, how Hyundai got here today. India right now is the third largest auto market in the entire world, an astounding story of India's economy, leapfrogging Japan, joining China and the United States in the top-three position. Hyundai, what it's trying to do with this IPO, getting past the rocky road that we see right now, it's trying to make so much cash with this IPO to try to strengthen its position in India, shortening the gap that it has right now between the number-one automaker in the country, which is Suzuki's Indian arm, and itself and trying to make a bastion of its Indian operation to export more EVs and SUVs to the region at large. So, one might be thinking, why not China? Why not make that your play? And it's certainly interesting analysis coming out from here in Seoul, written in the pages of the \"Financial Times\" a few days ago, that Hyundai is likely looking for an alternative to China because you have Beijing giving all of these generous subsidies to domestic Chinese automakers and that has largely pushed out so many international car companies from the Chinese market. So from Hyundai's perspective, makes sense to invest more in India where it's still relatively cheap to manufacture things. You have a burgeoning middle class, an ever increasing urban population. So that is what Hyundai is trying to do. Now, Rosemary, make no mistake, there have been some pretty rocky IPO debuts in the past. You think back to Facebook a few years ago, Uber had a pretty -- I don't want to say disastrous day, but there were a lot of concerns on the first day. So, that is not to say that the first few hours are going to be a presage for how this stock performs in the next of couple days and weeks. So, we're going to see if this is the proverbial pedal to the metal if things start to turn around. But we are off the session lows, make no mistake, when it was approaching down about 5 percent, we're now in the down about 2.5 percent range, Rosemary.",
