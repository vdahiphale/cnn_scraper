Chuck Grassley, the Republican from Iowa -- do show that there was an issue with when those text messages where shared -- or sorry, when the photo of the shooter was shared with U.S. Secret Service. There's one, in particular, because we're learning that they identified the shooter 90 minutes before the shooting took place, which is earlier than we knew in our previous timeline. In the text messages reported on by The New York Times it says, \"Kid learning around building we are in.\" Obviously, maybe a typo there. \"I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI, if you want to notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.\" Obviously, some concern there at 4:25 p.m. That's almost two hours before the rally began. Again, testifying before Capitol Hill, the U.S. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle would not answer those questions. She was later forced to resign just a day after her hearing.

I mean, I think that if they want to -- if the Democrats want to focus on J.D.

You have to give them credit for coalescing behind Kamala Harris.I think I've said it on this show and a -- and a few others that there's no doubt that she should be the nominee instead of Joe Biden if he dropped out. And so, I think they have to keep pushing forward on that message. I think focus on Donald Trump and the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, although I'm on the Donald Trump side of things. But don't focus on J.D. Vance.

The state's strict abortion law is now in effect after a judge had blocked it from being enforced when it was passed last year. It bars most abortions after about six weeks before many women even know they're pregnant and is among the most restrictive in the country. Lyz Lenz is on the board of the Iowa Abortion Access Fund, and she joins me now. Thank you so much for taking time with us this morning. I'm curious what your biggest concern is about this abortion ban that is at about six weeks. LYZ LENZ, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, IOWA ABORTION ACCESS FUND (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. So I have had three pregnancies -- that's two babies and one miscarriage -- and every single time I didn't find out I was pregnant until after -- between, like, eight to 10 weeks. So when we talk about a six-week abortion ban we're really talking about a full and complete abortion ban. This ban also, on paper, has exceptions for rape and incest. But when you look closer at those exceptions you realize that the rape or the incest has to be reported within two weeks of it happening, and it relies on the doctors adjudicating whether it's rape or incest, which is something that even the police have a hard time adjudicating. So we're -- the reality is this is a complete and total abortion ban and -- even though on paper it has exceptions. And so, my fear and concern is that this is going to result in the death of women. And like we saw in Texas how their abortion ban resulted in the increase of infant mortality rates; this is also going to result in the death of infants as well.",

The man accused of starting this blaze is due to appear in court today.CNN's Camila Bernal in Chico, California this morning with the latest. What are you seeing this morning, Camila? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  John, this is just devastation here. Thousands and thousands of acres that look a lot like what you see here behind me. And fire officials have told me that the center of the fire is still very active. It's still in very steep terrain. And what they're saying though is that they were able to make some progress because of two things. One, over the weekend, we had a lot better weather. And you also have a lot more resources. We now have about 4,700 boots on the ground. And so what that means is that they can come to areas like this one and do an assessment. They say about 100 structures have already been destroyed. But the other thing they say is that they were able to have a direct and aggressive attack on those flames. And so, thanks to that attack they were able to move that containment from zero to 12 percent. It may not seem like a lot, but it does make a difference for a lot of these firefighters and for the people that are on the front lines of this fire. Another thing that firefighters told me is that their priority is to get people back into their homes. They are very sensitive to the people of this area. They are very conscious of what they've lived. These are people who are in Butte County who went through the deadliest fire in California history back in 2018. So anecdotally, I can tell you that a lot of the residents here have taken evacuation orders and warnings very seriously. They've been paying attention, trying to keep up because of how devastating these fires could be. They are very aware of the dangers of these fires. And so, overall, the community is just very happy to see that containment number go up.

More than half -- 54 percent -- say it's not too likely or not at all likely that they'll ever be able to. But that really speaks to a lot of pessimism here about the American dream.
