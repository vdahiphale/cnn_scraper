Tonight, an American pediatrician stuck there, sleeping outside, says there is one toilet for 800 people to use. And the breaking news in the United States. The House has a new speaker after a 22-day debacle. He is Mike Johnson from Louisiana, an election denier with fewer years in the House than any speaker since 1883. And the dramatic day in court for former President Trump. He took the stand, he was fined, called a liar by the judge, and he stormed out of court. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett tonight live in Tel Aviv. And we are following several breaking stories around the world here in Israel. New video of a rocket attack just about 10 miles from where we are tonight. Israel says several people were injured as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his forces are now, quote, raining down hellfire on Hamas. And that is indeed what seems to be happening there constant strikes. Netanyahu says they've killed thousands of terrorists and, quote, this is only the beginning. Strikes are now reported up and down the Gaza Strip where, of course, civilians are caught in the fire. Much more of all the developments on the ground, including the latest on hostage negotiations and new reporting OUTFRONT of Hamas military capabilities as well as our exclusive dispatch from inside Gaza where the U.N. relief efforts warn that those efforts could stop as soon as tonight. I should say it is 2:00 a.m. here in Tel Aviv. But first, we do have two major stories in the United States this hour. After 22 days, the House finally has a speaker, and he is a Republican Congressman Mike Johnson of Louisiana. The little known congressman was able to do what no one else in his party could do, which was actually get the gavel. Johnson was first elected in 2016. He does have less experience in the House than any person elected speaker since John Carlisle back in 1883. He's a vocal opponent of abortion and LGBTQ rights and was a key player in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Tonight, Trump is taking credit for Johnson's win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reason is because you can see who's sitting next to the judge. It is the clerk. That is the clerk. That's who's sitting next to the judge. Not Michael Cohen, the clerk sitting there.And Trump, in fact, has attacked that clerk in the past, which is why he was under a gag order in the first place. So the judge saying he found Trump, quote, not credible when he said he was talking about someone else and he fined the former president $10,000. Shortly after that, Trump stormed out of the courtroom. Paula Reid has more on Trump's heated day in court, a dramatic day.

Instead, he was facing questions from the judge about whether he had violated a gag order. The judge has barred Trump from commenting or talking about members of the court staff. And that was imposed after Trump posted about the judge's clerk.And then today, Trump complained about the judge suggesting he was partisan but then also implied that the person sitting alongside him was also partisan. To most people, it was pretty clear he was talking about the clerk, but Trump's lawyers denied that. And then when Trump took the stand under questioning from the judge, he said, yeah, I was talking about you being partisan but I wasn't referring to your clerk, I was talking about the star witness of the day, Michael Cohen. But, Erin, the judge wasn't buying it. So that he found Trump, quote, not credible, said his comments were intentional, and fined him $10,000. But this is going to be a challenge for judges not only in this case in New York but also in at least one of the federal cases. It's one thing to impose a gag order. It's another thing entirely to enforce it, especially against someone who is determined to try to paint all the proceedings against him as partisan pursuits.",

Now, Cheeley, we've learned, he was approached but so far rejected the deal, but negotiations are ongoing. And we've learned that prosecutors are willing to strike a deal with almost anyone, anyone except for former President Trump. There doesn't appear to be a lot of willingness on the prosecution side. But this is pretty common. This is how you handle a RICO case, right? You charge 19 people, you try to whittle it down to a few key people.

I mean, at some point, the judge excuses the options that he has in terms of what he can do to try to deter this kind of behavior. And Trump seems to have run, you know, roughshod over it twice now.

He was of course first elected to the House in 2016, which was the year after you were elected.But, you know, he was able to pull off something no one else was able to do including a lot of very well-known household names, okay? So he was able to succeed. Do you think he's ready for the job? BARBARA COMSTOCK (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, listen, you know, it's been a real split screen this week. You have all of these MAGA lawyers who've been pleading guilty to basically 2020 election denial lies, while you have it basically being a qualification for being speaker that you have to be an election denier. So, it certainly was disappointing to see that basically the disqualifying factor for Tom Emmer was that he had voted for certification for the 2020 election because Tom Emmer certainly is a conservative, it was disappointing to see that Donald Trump put the thumbs down on him so he couldn't be speaker. But, you know, you're going to now see can he manage this unruly group of people, he did vote against keeping the government open, that November deadline coming up, that will be his first big test. He also has not been a supporter of Ukraine. So he'll need to deal with that. So it's a lot of big challenges coming ahead where he'll have to expand what he's normally been doing.",
