And Biden is not going to have to reach far to find pressure points that are going to concern people about what a second Trump presidency would mean. I think his bigger challenge is to convince people that a second Biden term would mean improvements in their lives.I mean, you know, he is looking at an approval rating right now that is in the level of presidents who were defeated for reelection. Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Donald Trump himself. There are a lot of voters who will say they're disappointed in Biden, but they're still going to vote for him because Trump is unacceptable. But there is not an infinite pool of such voters, Wolf. And what Biden I think needs to do, above all, is to begin improving his own standing with the public by convincing them he has the vitality and the agenda to make their lives better if they send him back to the Oval Office.",

Widespread pessimism about the economy, even though the numbers are pretty good out there on the economic indicators. And major concerns about his age.

I expect him to do that tonight on immigration. I agree with Ron. He's got to show fight.I happen to know because I obviously know people in the administration in senior positions that, in fact, is totally intact and completely in charge. Now, he's just simply got to give that impression to the public. And I think tonight is a great opportunity to do that. A lot of this stuff is packed journalism. And we all know that exists. And that's a big problem. But you can turn that around with a big performance tonight. And that's what I'm looking for.",

Now, apparently, without any progress to point to on a temporary ceasefire and a hostage deal. What should his message on this very sensitive issue be when he's facing serious backlash from Arab and Muslim-Americans and progressives for that matter over his handling of this war?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And he's also facing the reality, you know, that backlash is real and it's a challenge for him. But it's obviously not the whole political story because polls show that most Americans are still more sympathetic to Israel, even as concerns about their behavior have increased.I think Biden is going to look for ways to declare more of his independence from Benjamin Netanyahu and the -- and the Israeli government. I -- you know, he has bound himself to a partner who probably doesn't have his best political interests in mind. I think there's no question that Netanyahu would rather have Trump in the White House than Biden and the Israel -- and his government has, I think, consistently frustrated what -- how Biden has tried to steer this conflict, and particularly the post-conflict period. So, I look at that as one of many issues where Biden is going to have to kind of assert more mastery over events. I mean, the concern about age really is a concern about whether he is driving events or events are driving him. And you can see that on a lot of fronts, whether it's immigration or inflation, or Hamas. The overarching goal in this speech has to show again, that he has the vitality and the agenda to kind of bring this very chaotic world under at least a little better sense of cohesion and control.",

That's one for each student his teen son Ethan shot and killed back in 2021.CNN Correspondent Jean Casarez is joining us right now. Jean, you've been covering this for I think from the beginning.

Am I next?And the prosecutor in the opening statement said this is a very rare set of circumstances. I think trying to calm the jury down that conceivably our parents. Also, there are a lot of gun owners on this jury, and they talked about during jury selection, how they stored their guns. And he says this is not about guns. This trial is not about how you store guns. This is -- the trial is about this gun. But the focus was really in the prosecution's opening foreseeability, that James Crumbley was the one who could have prevented this mass shooting because he knew what his son could do.

Also, Mariell Lehman said that James Crumbley, you will learn, had no idea that his son knew where he had hidden the gun. And so, that is going to be a focal point too.And also, the defense said, you're going to hear from witnesses who saw the interactions between James and his son, Ethan. You're going to see what they saw and how they assessed it. And also, people that have training in this are going to testify looking at the Math Worksheet, what those drawings could exemplify. And so, I think we're going to see a different trial, Wolf, than we did before. Obviously, it's a different defendant. There are some similarities, but we're going to see some stark differences.",

Hundreds of National Guard troops will be in the New York City subways. That's after a series of violent incidents that led the Governor, Kathy Hochul, to announce a new five-point safety plan.Let's bring in our CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. John also served as a former Deputy Police Commissioner from -- for the NYPD. How exactly, John, will this work? Are we talking strictly about the presence of the soldiers as a deterrent, or will they actually be authorized to engage in law enforcement? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So, yes and no. Their job is going to be to do bag checks, to inspect bags to make sure that there's no weapons, explosives, and so on, knives, guns going into the subway. But they're also a high visibility deployment. You know, you're going to be seeing soldiers. They're going to have weapons. They're going to be in uniform. But no, they don't have the authority to make arrests. And that's where, after these 750 National Guard members, you'll see about 250 state police officers from the state police and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also.",

Brian McNulty down in Miami -- University of Miami says that some of this heat is statistically impossible as we look at a 1.77 degree above pre-industrial levels for February, the hottest February ever recorded. Now, it's nine months in a row that these records have been beaten again and again.Now, we're about over 1.56 degrees of warming over the last 12 months. So, the last 12 months, the hottest, at least for 120,000 years scientists say. This, of course, some of this is fueled by the natural warming patterns of El Nino in the Pacific. But that is ending now. And we're heading into a hurricane season in which water -- warm water is the engine for these big storms. So, massive concerns about that, about coral reef die-offs, and that's the -- that's the trend line, as you can see on the screen going back to the 1940s there, just hotter and hotter and hotter. And this also is hugely problematic in the North Atlantic Sea surface. These are all average air temperatures. But if you look at sea surface temperatures back of March of a year ago, in 2023, we set a new record then, and then every day since then, has broken that record. So, sea surface temperatures are off the charts in just amazingly gobsmacking ways, Wolf.",

And what's interesting about that, it's the result of hydropower, which is a sustainable renewable resource. Hydropower dams are getting weaker because a hotter planet, there's less water, rivers aren't as strong running through those turbines as well. So, we're losing hydropower as the earth heats up as well.The United States emissions have been coming down steadily with the shift away from coal towards better. But still not great natural gas. China's emissions are still on a rocket ride as they try to, you know, meet the needs of over a billion people. They're also adding record amounts of solar and wind capacity as well. But the energy, you know, appetites of humanity don't seem to be slacking in light of all these warnings from science.",
