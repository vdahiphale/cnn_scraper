Tonight, as president Biden and Democrats are scrambling to contain the fallout from this week's presidential debate, there is another blockbuster event on the horizon. The Supreme Court is set to end its term Monday with what will be one of the most consequential decisions in American history: Can former President Trump assert presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case concerning January 6th? The implications are hard to overstate, both legally and politically. And that's not the only major decision coming down from the court this week. CNN Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic joins us now. Joan, great to see you. I know it is a huge week. So let's start. Help us put this immunity ruling in context. What are the implications?",

      "sentences": "Sure, and it is so good to be with you, Alisyn.You know, we are on the very last day. In 48 hours, the Supreme Court will answer a question that it has never addressed before, whether a former president can be shielded from criminal prosecution, and in this case, it involves charges brought back on August 1st of last year against former President Donald Trump for election subversion -- fraud, deceit, obstruction of an official proceeding -- all sorts of charges that were leveled against him, and that Donald Trump said he should be immune from. Now a trial judge rejected that claim. The DC Circuit Appellate Court rejected that claim, and the Supreme Court earlier, Alisyn said it didn't want to weigh in, but it then did weigh in and hold oral arguments on April 25th. And now, they are going to say, and Alisyn, this is important for two big reasons. One is, first of all, it will affect all presidents in the future, just whether they can be shielded from prosecution for actions they took while in office once they leave office, and it will also dictate not just this very weighty question of presidential powers, but whether Donald Trump is subjected to any kind of federal trial on federal charges, having to do with the 2020 election before he actually is tested with the American public for the 2024 election. So the stakes could not be higher and at this moment, the nine justices themselves know how they have ruled, but we won't know until around 10:00 AM Monday morning Eastern.",

Now, just so you know, Alisyn, the January 6th defendants have been charged under a multitude of federal statutes, but the reason the administration had wanted to use this one is it has some pretty hefty penalties. Anyone who had been convicted under this statute could be subject to up to 20 years in prison. So it is a pretty muscular statute compared to some of the other ones that the defendants had been tried with, for example, there is assault, vandals, and damage those kinds of things. So what Attorney General Merrick Garland said was that, they had started to seen the handwriting on the wall that the Supreme Court had been suspicious of this. In the end, they may have to recharge a handful of people, but Attorney General Garland said that it should not affect the bulk of the cases coming from January 6th.",

It's in his close advisers' hands. And this guy has come through a lot of very tough stuff in four years as the president. He has handled it very, very well. Trump was a disaster and I have full confidence in him making whatever decision he wants to make. And am I worried? Actually, I am not very worried. I just think that the American people need a little time, usually 10 days is the attention span of something like this, unless it repeats itself and I am just not that worried, I really am not. CAMEROTA: \"The New York Times\" Editorial Board sees it differently. They're calling on President Biden to step down. They say: \"Biden struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures, and his chilling plans. More than once he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\" So do you think that President Biden hears the concerns of \"The New York Times\" and others?",

Everybody who wants to make themselves more important can't wait to jump into the fray. I've been in this business a long time. Patience and toughness is what you need to get through and Biden has both of those. Now, if he does this again, it is a major problem. But I don't think he will do it again. I don't know what went wrong with the preparation, but something did. But this is one mistake five months before the election, and you've got a serial liar who I think is, sometimes, occasionally psychotic on the other side. So again, this is not the time to panic. We've got to buckle down, figure out what is going on, give the president time to make the right decision and I think he will make the right decision. I suspect the right decision is to stay in.",

But we did hear from a Hamas spokesman earlier today in Beirut saying that the proposal on the table remains short of its demands, which are for a complete cessation of hostilities and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Israel for its point, for its part says that the ceasefire proposal doesn't preclude -- doesn't prevent it from carrying out two of its main war objectives, which are to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities. But of course with Israel insisting that it needs to do that and Hamas obviously not wanting to have its military and governance capabilities destroyed. It suggested there are still very large gaps between those two sides, and as you know, we have been here so many times over the past few months, and it just seems that these two sides, Israel and Hamas are unable to come to an agreement on a deal, even though the US, pressuring the Egyptians and Qatari mediators as well to put pressure on Hamas is doing its best to do so.

Did this make a difference? And the answer to that is pretty clearly yes.But the difference is going to be small and here's why, only 4 percent of Americans are truly undecided. People will make the claim I haven't made up my mind, but they will have decided against Joe Biden or against Donald Trump. They just don't know if they're going to vote for the opponent. That's not an undecided voter. It's just 4 percent. But where this does matter is those key swing states and in particular Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They matter most. At this point, Donald Trump is beating Joe Biden among the other close states, Georgia, North Carolina, as you showed right there, Arizona, Nevada. But that doesn't take him to 270. He has to win one of those three. And I believe that when the polling is done next week, Trump will be ahead in Pennsylvania, will be ahead in Wisconsin, and will be ahead in Michigan. Not by enough to put the race away, but this debate will have an impact. And one last thing, 50 million people saw the two candidates face-to- face, side-to-side, and that has an indelible impact on how people view it. They were not happy with Donald Trump. They were even less happy with Joe Biden. And frankly, what our group said was, at the end, Joe Biden should step aside, put somebody else in there. The gentleman in your focus group said exactly what I heard. Someone younger with Biden's policies and Biden's record will give Donald Trump a run for his money. Joe Biden will not.",

The New York Times wrote about it. The reporter from The Atlantic wrote about it. That if you want to challenge Donald Trump - and I'm not taking sides, but if you really want to ensure that you defeat Donald Trump, is this the candidate, is it really Joe Biden?

That one has to wonder, I don't know how to put this, but our democracy is at stake. It's not just for an election, it's for a generation. And that was not the worst performance ever.

I'll say one more thing if I can. This is happening all across the country. It's not just in Oklahoma. It's happening from Texas to West Virginia, from Florida to Idaho. There's Ten Commandments for display in every classroom. There are laws that allow public schools to replace certified school counselors with chaplains.
