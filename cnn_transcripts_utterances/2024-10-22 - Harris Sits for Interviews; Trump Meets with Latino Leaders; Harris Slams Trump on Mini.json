The plan aims to lower costs, increase homeownership and expand job opportunities. So, this is similar to Harris' proposal for black men where she intends to increase startup funding by providing one million loans, fully forgivable, up to $20,000 to Latino entrepreneurs and others to start a business. And then she's going to sit today with NBC and the Spanish language network Telemundo. We've got more of the policy proposals there.

You know, normally candidates show their hand a little bit in these closing weeks of the election. Either they are going where they see an opportunity, or where they have to protect their flank. And North Carolina, one of those states that Trump barely won in 2020, one of the closest battlegrounds that he actually won.

Remember, an election that President Biden won.But in North Carolina, North Carolina was the state that Donald Trump did win, but the one he won with the smallest margin, about 1.3 percent. Not very much at all. So, he's making his fourth trip there in two days, which is an awful lot. They're clearly trying to guard his flank. And where he's going, he's going to Greensboro, which is in Guilford County. Now you're going to look at this and say, wait a minute, he's going to a blue county. Why is he campaigning in Democratic territory? Sometimes it's about the margins there. You can see, President Biden won this county, but he won it by about 23 percent. Now, I'm going to keep this number there for a second and pull out to talk about the margins because it's in the same election were Donald Trump won North Carolina, a Republican. The governor's race was won by Democrat Roy Cooper. Roy Cooper won across the state. Let's push back in to Guilford County here, and you can see in Gilford County, Cooper, who won the state, won by 29 percent in Guilford County. So, you can see that Donald Trump was able to keep it much closer in this county that in the governor's race there. And those margins certainly helped him. And sometimes when you talk about where you're going, it's not just the county itself. We can pull up here and look at Randolph County, which is by - right by. North Carolina has some population centers and then just outside the population centers some more rural counties where, if you talk about the presidential race, you know, Donald Trump just crushed Joe Biden here. Look, 77 percent to 21 percent here. And there are thousands of votes there. Randolph County is, of course, where Richard Petty is from. Richard Petty often shows up at campaign events there. And again, when you look at the margins here, Trump at 77 percent. Just, if you look at the governor's race there that year, the Republicans only got 72 percent. So, Donald Trump trying to stretch the margins in these Republican counties, if I can get back to the presidential race, stretch the margins there and to the Democratic counties trying to keep it much closer.

People - they didn't have to raise the minimum wage. The government didn't have to mandate it. Minimum wages - wages went up in those - in that bottom part, right, because people had to pay more because there weren't - the labor pool was shrinking. There weren't - there weren't that many people to work. So, wages increased for that bottom group of that socioeconomic spectrum more so than any other group. And so a booming economy is the best thing you can do for minimum wage.And, plus, the people at McDonald's, I think McDonald's, the average wage of a McDonald's employee is someplace between $15 and $19 an hour. So, they're getting - they're getting - I'm not saying you're - you know, you're living a lavish life, but they're not getting minimum wage and McDonald's has great benefits and, you know, you get promoted, you get college - college, you know, college opportunities and other things.
