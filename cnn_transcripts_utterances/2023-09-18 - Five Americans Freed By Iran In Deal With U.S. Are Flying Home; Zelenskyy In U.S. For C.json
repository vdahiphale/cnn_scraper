We'll discuss the terms of the deal that ended their wrongful imprisonment with the top national security adviser to President Biden, Jonathan Finer.Also tonight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is now in the United States for critical meetings over at the United Nations and here in Washington. We'll preview his plea for more global support as Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia drags on. And another Trump co-defendant attempts to move the Georgia election interference case to federal court, this as the former president is taking credit for efforts to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election, declaring it was his decision. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with the release of five Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Iran and the deal that made it possible. CNN's Becky Anderson is covering it all for us. She's joining us now live from Doha, Qatar. Becky, you were on the scene as the freed Americans landed in Doha before heading to the United States. Give us the latest on their journey to freedom.",

They are on that last leg and homeward bound as we speak.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice over): Smiles, hugs and tears as five Americans detained inside Iran for years are finally freed and on their way home. Among them, Siamak Namazi. He was arrested in 2015 while on a business trip to Iran and charged with having relations with a hostile state. After nearly eight years in prison, Namazi was Iran's longest-held American prisoner. Feeling abandoned by the U.S., earlier this year, he appealed directly to President Biden in an unprecedented interview with CNN from inside the notorious Evin Prison.",

We've done a number of sanctions, designations in response to that situation, including some quite recently around this anniversary. And the question really should go back to the Iranian government. They should not undertake these sorts of activities against their people, against citizens of foreign countries.

He submitted a sworn statement that the judge refused to accept into evidence because, of course, prosecutors can't cross a sworn statement, so that came up. Look, this is interesting to see what happens for Jeff Clark, but it's also interesting because we want to know what's going to happen to Donald Trump in this case. And Trump's attorneys have signaled that it's possible they will try to move his case to federal court as well. They haven't done that yet, but we know that they've been watching this closely. They were in the courtroom again today. At one point, our team that was in the courtroom even overheard one of Trump's attorneys seeming to opine that things were not going well for Jeffrey Clark. So, it's clear they want to learn what they can and then from the Trump co-defendants before they make their own move to try to move to federal court, if they do that.

However, we know that that's not actually a legal defense if you commit violations of criminal law with the best intention, there're still violations of criminal law.

But the job of any DOJ official is to investigate in good faith, find facts and act accordingly.What Jeffrey Clark did is the opposite of that. He drafted a letter that he wanted DOJ to send out to various states saying, we found evidence of substantial fraud. That is a complete fabrication by Jeffrey Clark. So, if indeed he was acting within his scope when he made up those facts and tried to get states to act on it, then that's a very dark day for DOJ, and heaven help us all, and I think Jeffrey Clark is going to lose this motion.",

Only it has no connection to Russia's official cultural agency and was run until recently by Prigozhin's closest associate here. Photographs taken on that visit show a new face, a woman known as Nafisa Kiryanova. After days of asking for permission to visit, we decide to film covertly.

Donald Trump right now is running a general election campaign. The problem is he has to win the primary first. And what got him into office in large part in winning the 2016 campaign was his commitment to being the most pro-life Republican out there. And he's banking on the fact that he got three conservative justices on the Supreme Court, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, as well as Amy Coney Barrett. And he's thinking that's going to continue to win over these pro-life Republicans. I've spoken with the pro-life community in Iowa, Bob Vander Plaats of the Family Leader. They're saying, you can't play let's make a deal on the pro-life issue. And there's a national group, the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, they are fed up.

He was president for four years. If he was going to try to do some kind of deal, okay, why didn't you? There was a bill actually in the Congress during his tenure, the Women's Health Protection Act. He could have said, let's pass that and protect Roe v. Wade. Let's find a compromise. He didn't. He's now trying to have it both ways.
