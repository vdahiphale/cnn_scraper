Put -- put the two of them in the room, establish the scheme, establish an understanding of how catch- and-kill and the business model of AMI and the National Enquirer worked. They needed to do that.Now again, you put the testimony out in the world and then have the defense have their way with him. And they are going to beat him up. We're seeing it now on the screen as well. They're already talking about his profit motive merely saying, oh you weren't a charity? Sort of saying that will look, you know, you were in this to make the money too. But -- but as far as what prosecutors needed to do, of course, they succeeded",

To say actually, there's a whole range of reasons why you operate the way you do and it's not just because you really wanted to help this person who wanted to be president?And I think it's going to be interesting to see sort of how you know This former publisher starts to justify all of that kind of work",

That he was -- he was gaining access through Donald Trump and using Donald Trump also in many ways.But I think the main thing about David Pecker is that he's going to be the key corroborating witness for Michael Cohen whom as we all know has some credibility issues here. And while they may try and use the non-prosecution agreement as a way to challenge Pecker's credibility I think that they went a long way towards establishing that that Pecker was a truth-teller here and had nothing to hide. Since he was under some obligation to tell the truth as a result of the non-prosecution agreement. So when, when, when Michael Cohen comes to testify, you know, they can then say well you were at this meeting with, with David Pecker You had this phone conversation with David Pecker And so they'll be able to tell the same story and I think that's really important",

Number two, some of that, if the prosecutors do their jobs, will rely on financial records.

And that was good access for the newspaper and for Pecker himself. It took him to a certain level of society that he wanted to be a part of. And so I think it was competitive also. He was competing with tabloids. And Donald Trump gave him a leg up many times by feeding him information. So Trump was not only a source, but he gave him access.

But I do think that this is going to captivate the attention of some segment of the electorate. But to the point about he wishes he could be campaigning, there was no court yesterday. There was no place for Donald Trump to be. He wasn't on the campaign trail yesterday.So, you know, if indeed, and now they've announced he's going to be in Michigan and Wisconsin next Wednesday when there's a break. But I think we have to wait and see this -- how this unfolds and how much Donald Trump uses every moment that he's not required to be in court to actually be campaigning. We're starting to see him do it message wise at the courthouse. This morning he made the comments about the economy and GDP and trying to be a bit more on a political message. That's a development that's occurred in just the last couple of days. So I think Donald Trump right before our eyes, Wolf, is still figuring out how to be candidate Trump in this environment. WILLIAMS: The caveat, though, that every morning, literally every camera and television station in America is on him when he's stepping out and on the way into court. He has ample opportunity, if he wishes, outside of the courtroom to politic all he wants, which is sort of interesting, the way in which he's chosen to attack sort of the legal system in the process rather than.",

But then also, as you observed, how the justices came out and really were more sympathetic to former President Donald Trump's lawyer than to Jack Smith's counsel at the lectern there. And many of their -- it was clear from many of their concerns that they see various detours or off-ramps that the former president can take before any kind of trial. They might, you know, say, well, we're not going to give you absolute immunity, but we're going to give you some immunity here and some defenses for whenever a trial occurs, given the kinds of questions they were asking. The other thing, Erin, I would point out is how they really suggested a real vulnerability on the part of a former president. And let's hear first from Justice Samuel Alito on that score.

We are, just like you said, seeing the defense basically say that David Pecker and Trump, they had a relationship for decades, and it was mutually beneficial that Pecker made money for his newspaper when the headlines read Trump, and that, you know, these catch-and-kill stories didn't exactly just happen prior to the election. They happened more than a decade prior.He would give Trump the heads-up about a story, and they would let him know that this, you know, is something that's out there in the public. And so he even pointed out, the defense team, that the term catch-and- kill, Pecker wasn't even aware of that term until a prosecutor actually brought that up to him. One of the things they also talked about is they brought in Arnold Schwarzenegger and the fact that he was the former governor, of course, of California and that there were dozens of people that came to the \"National Enquirer\" with stories about him, and they were trying to explain to jurors that this wasn't an unusual thing. In this exchange, let me read it to you. It says: This relationship you have with President Trump is a mutually beneficial relationship. You had similar relationships with other people, the defense attorney said. I did, Pecker replied, confirming there were other people he would promote in the \"National Enquirer\" and give a heads-up about negative stories. So the defense team really trying to show this was not an unusual relationship, that there was no wrongdoing here, and again, doing it right out of the gate. Now, I do think it's interesting, again, they spent more than six hours of prosecution building the credibility of David Pecker. They had his testimony. They brought jurors inside the room in discussions that he would have with Michael Cohen, with Donald Trump. They would back it up with text messages. They would talk about all the discreet ways that they would have these sort of back-and-forth conversations or agreements or negotiations. And so it'll be interesting to see how the jurors sort of, you know, take in this cross-examination who right out of the gate is going through, sort of chipping away again at this credibility of Pecker.",
