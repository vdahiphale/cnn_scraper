So, M.J., I see you there at the White House, his arrival comes at a key moment in the relationship with the U.S. Why now and what's ahead for the visit?M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, definitely a key moment for the U.S./French relationship, but all of this kicks off today with the French president spending some time with the vice president. They are, as you said, set to spend some time touring the NASA headquarters. This is obviously going to provide a great sort of visual, but it's also heavy on symbolism too, right? They can draw attention to one of the many areas that U.S. and France have worked together on, including space and science, and also, just more generally, areas of cooperation between the two countries that go back for so many decades. But tomorrow really is the big, main diplomatic day. This is going to be the day that the Bidens host the Macrons at the White House here, already just walking around behind me, around the White House grounds. You can see a number of French flags on display, as they prepare to welcome the French president and his wife to the White House. We are going to see a big arrival ceremony in the morning, and then, obviously, there is going to be the big bi-lat meeting between the two leaders, including a press conference afterwards. And then there will be the big state dinner in the evening. Now, senior administration officials say that there are many things on the agenda for the two leaders to talk about, including, of course, the war in Ukraine, and the various energy and economic crises that that war has unleashed, and they're also expected to talk a lot about China. One administration official is saying that the two countries should speak from a common script when it comes to China. They will certainly trade notes on dealing with Xi Jinping, the president of China. And also Iran is supposed to be another major issues that the two leaders are expected to talk about. Now, as you noted, this is President Biden's first state visit that he is hosting at the White House, and official say that, in and of itself, goes to show just how deep and far-reaching that relationship between U.S. and France is.",

Many economic experts, as always, they are going to be searching for clues into whether the central bank will slow its increases in interest rates. This comes as a new GDP report shows the economy grew much faster than expected in the third quarter, up nearly 3 percent. Previous estimates put it around 2.6. We are as well in a historically tight jobs market. New data shows the number of job openings in the dropped in October to 10.3 million. Let's bring in Jeanna Smialek.

There are a lot of reasons to believe that inflation has peaked and that it's going to continue coming down into next year. When you talk to the Fed, they will mostly tell you that it is way too soon to declare victory. Inflation is still 7.7 percent on annual basis here in the United States, which is very fast. By way of context, the Fed aims for about 2 percent.So, we're still nearly four times what the Fed is aiming for. This inflation still feels really bad to anybody who is on the street or trying to shop for eggs or groceries or what have you. And so the job is just not done yet.",

But the study authors themselves say that longer studies need to be done to look at efficacy and safety.So, let's take a look at efficacy first. What they did in the study is they took 1,800 people between the ages of 50 and 90 who had mild sort of early stages of Alzheimer's. And half of them got a placebo and half of them got the drug. The half that got the drug did still see a cognitive decline over the course of 18 months but it was 27 percent slower than the folks in the placebo. Also, the folks who were in the drug group, they lower levels of amyloid. Amyloid are those plaques that we see in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. So, the two big questions are, okay, well, that's good, there's no question that's good, but is that enough to make a difference? Will it really make a difference in their lives? Will they be able to function better? Will their families notice a difference? And then the second question is, what about the side effects? And that's a serious question for this drugs. 17 percent of the people who took the drug on the study, 17 percent had brain bleeding and another 12 percent had brain swelling. Now, to be clear, some of the folks who took a placebo had those two things, too, but not nearly at rates that high. Now, the media has reported on two deaths among participants who got the drug. The company said those deaths are not associated. It will be really interesting to see what the FDA does. Jim, Bianna?",

Russia's upper house of parliament unanimously passed it this morning. Now, the law would ban Russians from all ages from, quote, praising homosexual relationships or publicly suggesting that they are, quote, normal. That includes advertising, books, films and any form of media.But one Russian couple, one prominent Russian couple has been leading an effort to challenge the Kremlin's views on gay marriage. They publicly shared the news of their wedding and have also protested the war in Ukraine. Joining me now from Berlin is Mikhail Zygar. He is a friend of mine, a journalist and author of All the Kremlin's Men. Mikhail, good to see you, Misha, thank you so much coming on with us. You shared your pictures of that special day, where you marry Jean- Michel in Portugal. You have left Russia now, and you are an expat after protesting the war, so you are living in Europe with many other fellow journalists who are protesting the war as well. There we see pictures. On that day, when you posted those wedding pictures, you said that we got married, love, freedom, truth and happiness. It's time to start liberalization from yourself. What do you mean by that, liberalization? MIKHAIL ZYGAR, AUTHOR, ALL THE KREMLIN'S MEN:  You know, actually, we've got a lot of fissures (ph) with our liberty in Russia, and I think that we've got -- after the war has started, we all have to think about our own responsibility and about our own guilt and what we should do and what we could do. So, I think that is very important for any Russian and that was my wedding toast, actually, at our wedding day. I suppose that probably after that terrible war has started, we should not recognize the Russian state anymore and we cannot recognize all those inhumane laws they are voting for. So, we have to set our own precedents, so we, as Russian civil society that opposes the war and is fighting against the war, we should set our precedent, and getting married, we are setting that precedent of legalization of same-sex marriages in Russia a future.",

Besides, a lot of people from Putin's inner circle are supposed to be gays, so it's -- these are the widespread rumors.I don't think that those rumors about, including himself, are reliable, I don't believe that, but, definitely, for the inner circle, that's not a sin and that's not a crime. So, it's quite obvious that they are privately okay with that. But they consider that it's a very cheap way -- cheap and easy way to get the approval of the huge masses of Russian population.
