      "sentences": "That's right, Kate, and I think it's really interesting to account how this all came together, from talking to sources, with my colleagues, we've learned that effectively, the foundation for this deal started to be built back in January.That's when President Biden had a phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And he said, listen, when you come to the White House later this month, there's something I want to talk to you about. That's Vadim Krasikov. That is the former FSB officer we have been talking about. He was serving a life prison sentence in Germany for murdering someone in broad daylight. And the U.S. had come to the conclusion because Russia had resisted past proposals to release these Americans that Vadim Krasikov had to be included. The Germans today had rejected any of those offers to try and get them to involve Vadim Krasikov. But when President Biden met with Olaf Scholz in the White House in the middle of January, we're told according to a senior administration official that Olaf Scholz said to Biden, for you, I will do that -- do this. And that's what really set off the next eight months of trying to put together a deal that included Vadim Krasikov -- but there were fits and starts. It was not exactly easy when Alexei Navalny died in the middle of February, he was someone that they were thinking about, including as part of this deal. So, they had to go back to the drawing board. It was by late March that U.S. officials came up with a full list that could be included in this massive swap, including Krasikov. President Biden actually wrote a letter at that time to Olaf Scholz on this topic, and then it was in early June, and I want to bring you to the Summer time months here, Kate, where Germany agreed to include Krasikov, then this list was presented to Russian Intelligence officers in a third country, a Middle Eastern country by CIA officials. And it wasn't until about two weeks before this swap happened that Russia actually transmitted formal notice to the United States through Intelligence channels that they had actually accepted the deal. And that's what put the wheels churning on all of these efforts to actually, logistically bring this together. Over the last few hours, 24 hours or so, we have heard the Biden administration, as you said, talk about the importance of alliances in bringing this to fruition. Listen to what the Vice President said last night on the tarmac when those Americans had landed here in the United States. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But joining me now is founding partner and Washington correspondent for \"Puck News\", Julia Loffe. Julia, really appreciate you being here. I want to step back a second and look at what President Biden said on this.Do we have a sense in regards to working with many allies, NATO included to make this happen? Do we have a sense of why Donald Trump wasn't able to secure Paul Whelan's release when he was in the White House? JULIA LOFFE, FOUNDING PARTNER &amp; WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, PUCK NEWS: Well, we know from the \"Wall Street Journal's\" reporting actually that the Russians did approach him about freeing Paul Whelan in 2018 after he was arrested in exchange for Viktor Bout and a Russian pilot that had been taken prisoner by the Americans in a few years earlier. And the Russians had felt that these people had been unjustly imprisoned in third countries, not in the U.S., that the U.S kind of violated all kinds of terms by arresting Russians in third countries, and Donald Trump said no. So, when President Biden yesterday in his press conference with the hostage's families, said, you know, in response to a question, why didn't Donald Trump do this? He said, you know, he could have done this, but he didn't. And it seems from the \"Journal's\" own reporting that he was approached with a deal and he said no.",

And you know, there were people inside the German government, including ministers who were against this deal, who were against releasing him and against kind of the precedent it would set, especially in terms of not getting Germans out, but being leaned on by the kind of older brother -- diplomatic older brother, the U.S. to get one of theirs out. And to do that, you need the kind of solid, strong friendships that President Biden described. If you see -- I've written about this before, if you see alliances as a kind of what have you done for me lately thing, if you treat your allies the way a lone shark would treat somebody who owes them money, there's no way that they're going to do this for you.
