      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.After being delayed four times this week, the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote today on a resolution calling for a suspension of fighting between Israel and Hamas and an increase in humanitarian aid for Gaza. The U.S. says it is ready to support this latest version. The Czech Republic is dealing with its deadliest mass shooting in decades. After a gunman killed at least 14 people in Prague, 25 others were wounded in the attack at Charles University. A new report from \"The Detroit News\" says that then-President Donald Trump was recorded pressuring two Republican election workers to not certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. The paper says that in a phone call days after the vote, Trump told the Republicans they'd look terrible if they signed the certification. Adding, we can't let these people take our country away from us. Everybody knows Detroit is crooked as hell. \"The Detroit News\" also says the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, then told the Michigan Republicans, do not sign it, we will get you attorneys. To which Trump reportedly added, we'll take care of that. Right now, U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith is strongly urging the Supreme Court to make a quick decision on whether Trump has presidential immunity from alleged crimes he committed whilst in office. But the former president wants the high court to stay out of the dispute for now. CNN's Evan Perez has more from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Jack Smith is saying that this is an urgent matter, this is something that the public has an interest in finding out what the resolution is. And obviously, the election is ahead. He doesn't directly say that, but that is obvious what is behind all of this. I'll read you just a part of the filing where he says, quote: The public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors an immediate definitive decision by this court, the charges here are of the utmost gravity. One of the things that the special counsel does is they cite the 1974 United States vs. Nixon case. This is a case that had to do with the then president's claim of executive privilege over the White House recordings, the Nixon tapes, and that case was heard just like the way Jack Smith is trying to get this one done. He skipped over the appellate process and went straight to the Supreme Court. It was handled in about two months, and about 16 days after oral arguments, the Supreme Court rendered a decision. That's exactly what Jack Smith wants to happen in this case. Pointing out of course, that this trial is supposed to start in March, and you know, obviously the election is coming up later next year.
