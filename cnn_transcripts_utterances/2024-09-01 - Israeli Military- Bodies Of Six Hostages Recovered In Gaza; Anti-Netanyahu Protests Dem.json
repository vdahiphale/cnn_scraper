A group representing the families of Israeli hostages is calling for Prime Minister Netanyahu to address the nation, and as they say, take responsibility for abandoning the hostages.Netanyahu released a taped statement this morning blaming Hamas for the murders of the hostages and accused them of not wanting a ceasefire deal. CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Jerusalem. So, what do we know about where these bodies were found? The reaction from officials, and is there any definition yet? Any clarity around the description of their being found -- being killed a short while before the bodies were discovered?",

And in that vacuum a lot of pain, a lot of suffering, a lot of angry accusations. The vast majority, as you were saying, of the families of the hostages are saying that the Prime Minister should take responsibility and own the fact that it is his own personal style of negotiating -- in terms of negotiating that have led to the deaths of these hostages. The Prime Minister, in his recorded statement, has pushed back very strongly, putting the blame for all of this on Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In recent days, as Israel has been holding intensive negotiations with the mediator in a supreme effort to reach a deal, Hamas is continuing to steadfastly refuse all proposals. Even worse, at the exact same time, it murdered six of our hostages. Whoever murders hostages does not want a deal. For our part, we will not relent. The government of Israel is committed, and I am personally committed, to continue striving towards a deal that will return all of our hostages and ensure our security and our existence.

You have the Prime Minister's, Minister of Defense, you have Golan, who last week engaged in a shouting match with the Prime Minister over his reluctance to do this deal, and basically said to the Prime Minister, you have a choice. You could have the hostages back, or you could have the Philadelphia Corridor, which is the corridor which separates Egypt from Gaza, on which the Prime Minister has demanded an Israeli presence there in order to further prevent Hamas from resurging. So pressure is rising, and remember, last year for 40 plus weeks in a row, hundreds of thousands of Israelis mobilized in the streets in order to turn back the Prime Minister's determination to rearrange the Israeli political system and emasculate the power and independence of the Israeli Supreme Court. So, it could be a new factor, but you saw the Prime Minister's statement. He's doubling down.

They want a deal done to bring the rest of the hostages home, that this can be done. The defense minister here has talked -- has asked the prime minister to call another cabinet session to revisit his decision to keep troops on the border between Gaza and Egypt, the so-called Philadelphia corridor, which seems to be one of the big issues blocking the hostage deal. The defense minister essentially telling the prime minister that he is undermining the negotiation process.

And there will be protests around Israel tonight, this evening, protests in Tel Aviv, protests in other cities.
