Overnight, federal regulators seized control of First Republic Bank and its $229 billion worth of assets. And then they immediately sold it to the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase.Right now, Wall Street is reacting positively on the takeover news. The Dow actually up. First Republic is now the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, the largest since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third U.S. Bank to fail since March. Regulators are hoping that this move is going to boost confidence in the U.S. banking system, especially when it comes to regional banks across the country. CNN's Matt Egan joins us now live. He's been following all the latest details on this. Matt, First Republic Bank had been teetering for quite some time. Why did regulators choose now to act? MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Well, Boris, the situation simply became unsustainable. The First Republic was losing tens of billions of dollars of deposits. Its share price was down by 97 percent in the span of just a week. So, something has to be done. And California regulators, they decided to step in and just shut it down. The FDIC seize control and after a competitive bidding process, they sold it to JP Morgan. So, let me run you through some of the numbers here. JP Morgan is paying $10.6 billion to the FDIC to buy most of First Republic. Crucially, JP Morgan is acquiring all $92 billion in deposits at First Republic, and they're taking on about $173 billion in First Republic loans. So, what does all this mean to people who have money at First Republic? Well, I think the key here is that your money is safe. Those funds are just moving from one bank to another. Officials say you're going to have full access to all of your deposits, even above the $250,000 that the FDIC insures. Now, I think the bigger question though, here is what does all of this mean for the broader economy and the risk of a potential credit crunch? Now, during report -- a call during -- during your call today with reporters, JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, he expressed some confidence here that this banking crisis could be wrapping up soon.

This is the woman who accused Trump of assaulting her in the New York Department Store in the 1990s. Ahead of today's testimony, a judge denied Trump's request for a mistrial. Trump's lawyer argues that the judge made pervasive unfair and prejudicial rulings against him.CNN's Kara Scannell, she's been covering the case. She's outside the courthouse in Manhattan. So, Kara, we continue the cross-examination of E. Jean Carroll by Trump's attorneys. We know their goal here is to try to undermine her credibility. What's been happening in the last hour? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Jim, that's right. The name of the game today for Trump's defense team is to try to attack E. Jean Carroll's credibility. But they've been focusing on -- or her actions after this alleged rape at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s. Now, part of the questioning has been you know, if you were so traumatized by this experience, then why did you do certain things after that? One of them, they pulled up a spreadsheet of some spending that E. Jean Carroll did at Bergdorf Goodman, over a 10-year period when she was there at least 20 times and she spent at least $13,000. And they asked her about that and here's what her testimony was. She said I made that clear that Bergdorf is not a place I'm afraid to enter. Now, they also questioned her about for -- some of her Facebook posts. In one Facebook post, she said that she was a massive fan of The Apprentice. That was the reality show that Donald Trump starred in for a number of years. [14:20:07] Carroll said that she was a fan of the competition between the aspiring business entrepreneurs, but she said she didn't watch the portion of it at the end where Trump fired certain contestants from the show. She also was asked, you know, why didn't she ever call the police when she had advised numerous writers to advise column to do that very thing. You know, all again, steps to try to under a god attack or credibility. Now, they also showed a number of clips, including when she was on Anderson Cooper, soon after her book came out in 2019, as well as some other saying that she was looking for some publicity for this book. She said, of course, she was. She wrote a book. She acknowledged that it didn't sell. She called it a dud. And she also was asked, you know, through all of these interviews that you gave, you -- the only time you became emotional and cried about what happened to you was on your testimony on the stand. She did become emotional several times during her testimony last week. And Carroll acknowledged that yes, that was true. That was the only time that she did and she said you know in this courtroom, I'm being forced to tell the truth, Jim.",
