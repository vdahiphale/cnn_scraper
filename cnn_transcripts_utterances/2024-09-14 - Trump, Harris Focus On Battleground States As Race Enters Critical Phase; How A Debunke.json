And we begin this hour with the race for the White House, entering another critical phase.Vice President Kamala Harris continues to try to build on her momentum out of Tuesday's presidential debate. She's wrapped up a pair of rallies in the swing state of Pennsylvania where she campaigned in rural Republican leaning counties. Tonight, Harris will speak at an award ceremony for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington, D.C. She's also launching a new campaign to mobilize Latino voters. For more on these developments. Let's bring in CNN's Eva McKend. Eva, the vice president gave an interview to a television station in Philadelphia before wrapping up her visit there in Pennsylvania. So what did she have to say?",

This is a very intentional effort of the campaign to play up the Cheney endorsement, to essentially argue to these Republicans, they are welcomed into the fold.Take a listen to how the vice president is thinking about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: In my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of us as Americans have so much more in common than what separates us. Most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other. I think people are exhausted with that approach. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Counties that they may not necessarily be able to win outright but to still illustrate to those voters that they want their support. Counties like -- excuse me Cambria County in Pennsylvania, where the vice president was on Friday.And so this is all part of the strategy, Fredricka, to bring these Republicans into fold, to not only try to appeal to diehard Democratic voters, but to other voters, bring them into the coalition as well.",

Now, again, previously, as soon as the ball was kicked, all 11 members of the kicking team would start sprinting down the field to try and tackle the receiving team. Lots of speed, lots of space.This season, only the kicker is back here, while the opposing teams are lined up all the way over here, separated by just five yards. And none of those players can move until the ball has been caught by the receiving team or it hits the ground. It reduces the speed and the space of the play. It's what competition committee co-chairman Rich McKay says is one of the biggest rule changes in 30 years. RICH MCKAY, NFL COMPETITION COMMITTEE, CO-CHAIRMAN: The problem is, is, we're trying to not just make this game better next year, we're trying to keep the game going for 10, 20, 30, 40.
