      "sentences": "-- to speak. So, when I say some of the things that can be done diplomatically, I was speaking with sources in the region last night who say what they're trying to do is get a plan together that shuts down all of Hamas' international offices around the Arab region and other places where they may have them in the world as well, as it is with ISISISIS has no foothold, no purchase to have a public platform in any countries around the world. And this is part of what the mechanism is to take on Hamas, is to shut them do, is to essentially -- politically, as well as militarily, as well as what we heard from Secretary Blinken there describing the way that life should essentially be valued on both sides when the response is taken, which was very clear in his language there apart from having obviously no daylight between him -- between the United States and Israel on the moral clarity about what -- the barbarity of what Hamas has done, the response that is required. But I think part of that response comes by shutting down Hamas internationally and diplomatically in this region. I know that is something that's being worked on behind the scenes. And a small footnote to that, speaking earlier this year here to a senior U.N. Representative in the region, very familiar with all the Palestinian military. Look, we're very concerned because we are beginning to see an emergence of the ISIS brand of radical Islamist thinking and behavior. We're seeing their language, their propaganda. We're even seeing sort of potential small cells emerging in the Palestinian community, and that was giving him a huge degree of concern because it opened the door to exactly what we've seen here, this magnitude of barbarity that we haven't seen before here. POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR:  And so, clear that call, Nic, from Prime Minister Netanyahu for -- to any entity, any country around the world, any regime that would harbor or aid Hamas in any way. Nic, thank you. We'll get back to you very soon. I just want to tell our viewers, on the left side of your screen, those are live images of strikes in the port right outside of Gaza City, as well as we go to our colleague Jeremy Diamond. He joins us in Ashdod, Israel. Jeremy, what can you tell us from where you are?",

Beth, when you listened -- look, this is quite literally a demonstration of unity of the U.S. and this administration being completely aligned with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government, the Israeli people, at least, publicly. What did you take away from the remarks that you heard from both the prime minister and the secretary of State?BETH SANNER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, SENIOR FELLOW, HARVARD'S BELFER CENTER AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  I think that what we just heard was ?perfectly said about what the goal of this was, and to kind of inoculate as much as possible this operation against criticism. And just to point out a step further that, you know, the siege that is going on, they've shut down now in Gaza, all water and electricity, and the Red Cross is asking for just electricity and supplies to go to hospitals, that's been denied because this is like total war. And I think this shows that it's going to get trickier and trickier as this operation moves on. The images that will be coming out of civilians dying in Gaza will be complicated. And I also want to get back to also the idea of the -- likes going on here with the Iranian president and the Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman, talking last night and what -- and what's going to happen also with Blinken in the rest of this trip.",

He runs the West Bank. They don't control Gaza. But that is to try to keep this from escalating and also, to show this, as Blinken really pointed out, the difference between Hamas, a terrorist group, and the Palestinian people.The Iranians, as they spoke -- as he spoke to Mohammed bin Salman, the readout from that, they were trying to really make the whole Palestinian question as a unified one, whereas the Saudi crown prince and Lincoln and others are trying to really separate that out.

How confident are you that it is good enough to execute whatever is going to come next while protecting and rescuing those hostages? MAJ. DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESMAN:  Well, as we were saying before, that incredible speech, and I'll just say as a soldier in the Israeli army, we have our moral clarity, but to hear the United States shares values of life and liberty, which are the same values that Israel shares of life and liberty is a great encouragement, I think an inspiration for the Israeli people who have a very long road ahead. Regarding the issue of the hostages, again, this is an incredibly personal issue, as both the secretary and the prime minister spoke about. We have increased our intel dramatically. We have robust intel that we've been gathering. We have two generals that have established two different -- almost, you would call them ministries that are dedicated to this. And as that increased, we've also increased our intelligence on the Nakba squads, who are -- were really the front guard of that incurred into our -- the Israeli territory sent by Hamas with that mission to destroy. We now have many of their names or identities or locations. And as we've said, they are the front guard that are responsible for carrying out this massacre.
