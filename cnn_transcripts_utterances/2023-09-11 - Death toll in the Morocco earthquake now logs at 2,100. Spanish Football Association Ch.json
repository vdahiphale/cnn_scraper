I'm Paula Newton, ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom.\"Rescuers in Morocco scrambling to find people who may still be alive following with a devastating earthquake as the death toll tops 2,100. An urgent search here in the United States. Police say an escaped killer is now taking new steps to try and blend in. Plus, victory for Spanish women's soccer off the field. The official who gave this woman player an unwanted kiss. He's now out. Details in a live report from Valencia. So, rescuers in Morocco are of course racing against the clock to find more survivors of Friday's powerful earthquake as the death toll fortunately continues to climb. More than 2,100 people are now confirmed dead after the country was hit by the 6.8 magnitude quake, the strongest in more than 120 years. Near the quakes at the center in the Atlas Mountains, scenes of destruction and devastation with homes in small villages reduced to piles of rubble. Many have spent yet another night outside in tents, and some have been told they'll need to remain in these makeshift camps for at least another week. CNN's Nada Bashir is in Marrakech for us with a live report. Nada, good to see you on the ground there. Now, since this earthquake struck, we've clearly seen the pain that's been inflicted. It's likely to last in this country for generations. But right now, in terms of the concern about what people have to do in order to continue to mount those rescue efforts. What's needed, what is in place, and what about other needs like food, water and medical care?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Paula, you're absolutely right. The key priority at this stage continues to be the search and rescue effort. And what we've seen over the weekend is a struggle by the authorities and by the rescue teams to make it to those regions hardest hit by the earthquake on Friday night.Many of those regions impacted most were in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains in remote areas that are difficult to get to, but also were made difficult to get to by damage to the roads. So, it has proven to be a struggle so far. We've heard from eyewitnesses describing that struggle, describing not seeing rescue teams on the ground. Some of these villages have been nearly entirely flattened according to eyewitnesses, and we've seen the destruction, the devastation in these areas. It is hard to describe. Some of these villages completely gone, so you can imagine the devastation that these communities are going through. But of course, that search and rescue operation is still very much ongoing. We are now beginning to see international rescue teams coming into Morocco to support in that effort. There has been some delay in that front. Some of the people that we've been speaking to questioning why there has been delay on that front. But we have heard from the Moroccan government thanking those from the United Kingdom, from Qatar, who have sent in teams, including Spain, to help with that search and rescue operation. But of course, the death toll is steadily rising, but so is, of course, the spread of the impact, the extent of the impacts. And there will be a shift eventually, a focus on the humanitarian relief front. And I mean, if you look at the villages, there is a huge amount of need here in Marrakech. What we've been seeing over the weekend is families sleeping in the streets at night because they're afraid of the potential impact of another aftershock. They're afraid that their homes simply aren't safe, that they could fall victim to another earthquake. So that is the concern for many here. But what we have seen is locals going out to donate blood. We've seen locals gathering items, goods, taking them in vans to deliver to those remote areas. So there has been a community outpouring as well as an international outpouring of support.",

But I looked at my friends and said, let's just go for it, let's see if we can get up there. And we had a carload of goods. We've got about a kilometer outside of the village and they stopped us and they said, that they had to close it off because they were trying to organize a number of dead bodies and there was military crew there, also some Spanish aid. So we just had to leave our goods in a locked facility with the government and we were told that was going to get to them. And a lot of other volunteers, Moroccans from London were there. So it's, and I think we were like the second carload of people going up there. So there are, there is a lot of need and desperation up there for people to get goods.

Investigators here earlier, it said that the latest developments are considered quote \"a minor setback.\"Though when you look at those developments, that certainly could be considered an understatement given that authorities really have no idea where do we begin searching right now. And here's why. As you retrace the steps of this escape killer since Saturday night, they believed that one point, he managed to escape that perimeter near Lockwood Gardens, which was being looked at by authorities for several days. Eventually, he made his way into, or at least onto, a dairy farm, which is where investigators believe he managed to steal a van because the keys were left inside. Cavalcante believed to have gone on a drive about 22 miles or so north into the Phoenixville, Pennsylvania area, where a surveillance camera at the residence of a former colleague of his actually captured him there. And when you look at it, this is really the latest image that we have, at least one of them what we have, showing Cavalcante appears to be in fairly good spirits especially for being somebody who's been on the run for a week and a half. The hoodie that he's wearing going to investigators he actually stole from that dairy farm. Eventually Cavalcante then resumes its drive, making it west to northern Chester County specifically in East Nantmeal township, that is where investigators say the vehicle literally ran out of gas forcing him to ditch that car. And that is where there is a temporary perimeter setup. Authorities are searching that particular area, though they have no reason to believe that it could potentially still be there. During a press conference on Sunday, Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens addressing some mounting criticism that this individual was able to slip past hundreds of men and women in law enforcement. LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: I'm not going to make an excuse to you. I wish it had not happened. Unfortunately, there are a lot of circumstances. There are a lot of issues associated with that property. Tunnels, very large drainage ditches, things that could not be secured, you couple that with weather, aviation being down for a night.

Just walk us through what was going through your mind in those very special moments.NOVAK DJOKOVIC, 2023 U.S. MEN'S OPEN CHAMPION: Yeah, I mean, of course it's an incredible achievement again. I was just hoping he's gonna put his last forehand in the net, which happened, and I felt a huge relief because it was a very demanding physically grueling match particularly in the second set. You know, I did my best in the last 48 hours not to think about what- if scenarios. Two years ago, I feel like, you know, I probably let the emotions control me on the court. I was a lot on the line, you know, possible golden slam. And I lost to the same opponent in straight sets two years ago. So I learned my lesson and, you know, I felt that when I was struggling the most, actually physically and being under huge tension and stress, particularly in the second set, every time I would look at my daughter, she was sitting courtside, facing me, facing the bench where I was seated, she would give me a smile and a fist bump and that would of course melt my heart and give me this kind of energy and strength and also playfulness that I needed in that moment. So, of course, once I shook the hands of my opponent today, the only thing I wanted to do right after that is hug her and then hug my wife and my son and my parents, all the team. Because yes, it's an individual sport, of course it comes down to how you're going to perform on the given day. But is a team effort behind the stage because they put in a lot of energy, you know, into my life, into my career and sacrifice and support. So, I value that very, very much.",

And you mentioned the need for reinvention, which is something that he talked about when he was alive, the need to be better and strive for more. How much is that on your mind now as you look to where you're headed from here?",
