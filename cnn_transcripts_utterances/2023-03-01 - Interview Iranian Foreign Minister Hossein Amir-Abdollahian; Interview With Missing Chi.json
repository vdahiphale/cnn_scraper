CNN has seen a restricted report which found uranium particles enriched to almost 84 percent, which is very close to the 90 percent needed to make a nuclear bomb. And it comes amid alarming allegations of human rights violations by the regime against protesters. And shocking accounts of torture and sexual assault at the hands, even of the revolutionary guards. Meanwhile, Iran is also suspected of sending attack drones to Russia for Putin's vicious war in Ukraine. Foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is in Geneva this week speaking at the U.N. Human Rights Council. And in a rare interview since the death of Mahsa Amini, rocked his country, I sat down with him for a challenging conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As you, know thereare many people who wondered why you would be giving a human rights speech, given what is going on in your country. You did actually say that no country can claim to implement human rights perfectly. So, I want to know whether you admit that Iran has really cracked down, has not just not implemented human rights but has killed people. There are reports of prisoners and ordinary protesters having been assaulted sexually, having been tortured. We have seen pictures of police and other security forces using live fire against peaceful protesters. Is that what you mean when you say, no country can claim to implement human rights perfectly? AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translator):  You are of Iranian heritage like I am. In the Iranian civilization, and over thousands of years of Iranian history, we have human rights inscriptions on stones originating from Iran. Iran is the first country that has had human rights inscriptions in its museums and in museums around the world. In our religious and Islamic texts, human rights is one of the most fundamental issues, and we have always been advised to observe that. The constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran also emphasizes that. We observe human rights very well. But when I said in my speech that human rights is not fully implemented by some countries, I mean those who advocate human rights, but in practice, they don't observe them.",

We have seen summary executions of at least four people. And the protests are less than they were. But I want to ask you to respond. I want to ask you to respond to the fact, when you say the Islamic Republic of Iran respects human rights, one female protester says that she was detained inside the revolutionary guard facility for more than a month and raped by three different men. She went to a cleric, a mullah, afterwards because she was having suicidal thoughts. She was so upset. CNN spoke with that cleric. Is that acceptable? Is it acceptable for a woman, whatever she has done, to be arrested and raped? And there are many, many, many reports of sexual abuse in this situation against women and men.

So, again, I'm trying to find out what you and what the government is going to do. Because even, even Ayatollah Khamenei recently has said, women who do not wear a hijab are not irreligious, they are not violating religion. Some other people have said that. We've heard from the former speaker of parliament, Mr. Larijani, who, at the beginning said, do we really need to make all this chaos over a hijab? So, I want to know whether you except it because it is also traditional women. Older women who've gone in the streets. It's men, it's young, it's very different than previous protests. Do you accept that women can have peaceful demonstrations for change and for their own rights? Do they have the rights? You say that it's the most developed democracy.

The other partof the question is, how much are you enriching to, there is one press report that says, 84 percent. Can you tell us? AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN (through translator):  With regards to JCPOA, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been and is the most committed of all the parties involved in JCPOA negotiations. The party that left the JCPOA, was Trump and the United States. The United States should not adopt deceptive behavior. And instead, should return to JCPOA and adopt a constructive approach. Under the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we have decided to continue dialogue in order to return to JCPOA. We have had very long discussions in Vienna. And the United States is accusing Iran. It is saying that the Iranians don't have the necessary resolve. They said, we were at a stage of reaching an accord, but it is the Iranians who are too demanding. I will tell you explicitly that in the past few years we saw that the U.S. officials were unable to make a decision because of their own internal problems and the pressures they are under. They are still unable to make a courageous decision to return to JCPOA. And, of course, the Iranian parliament in the past few weeks, especially since the riots and the U.S. interventions and interventions by three European countries in the peaceful demonstrations in Iran have been putting a lot of pressure on our government. I was in parliament last week, and they said, who do you want to make an agreement with? With the United States and three European countries that have been trying to change the system during the riots in the fall? Why are you negotiating with them? How can you trust them? Nevertheless, we are still on the path of dialogue. We have a roadmap with the IAEA. And on two occasions, Mr. Aparo, Mr. Grossi's deputy, came to Iran in the past few weeks, and we had constructive in productive negotiations. And we have also invited Mr. Grossi to come and visit Iran soon. Therefore, our relationship with the IAEA is on its correct natural path. And we have said this to the U.S. side through mediators that we are on the path to reach an accord. But if the Iranian parliament adopts a new law, then we'll have to abide by the parliamentary act. So, the window for an accord is still open. But this window will not remain open forever. The U.S. party has been sending us positive messages through diplomatic channels. But in its media remarks, they make very deceptive remarks that are totally different. And really, as an Iranian for foreign minister, sometimes I have serious doubts. I received a message from the U.S. party, emphasizing their commitment to accord, but then in the media, they say that we are not at a point of accord. And that JCPOA is not a priority on our agenda. Which version should we accept? Nevertheless, we are still on the path of reaching an accord. We believe a couple of outstanding issues between us can be resolved and it can be finalized. But that requires the U.S. side to say the same thing that they are telling us confidentially and through diplomatic channels. And even if they don't want to tell the media everything, at least don't deny it in your media and then tell us that it is because you are under pressure by the U.S. journalists and have to make such remarks because of your internal situation. Look, if the U.S. side wants to come back to its commitments in the JCPOA, they need the courage of their convictions. We have the courage of our convictions and we have shown it.

And the details are that it would basically create a presumption of illegality if you don't meet certain conditions, right, which would make it easier to deport people. It says that, you know, most -- if you cross the southern border illegally, if you don't notify the authorities that you are coming through this app, or if you don't apply for asylum in a country that you have passed through, which is, you know, most likely in Southern Mexico. And obviously, the, you know, advocates say that this is as inhumane as anything that the Trump administration, you know, envisioned. So, just, what is your top-line reaction to this?",

Separating children from their parents, separating infants from their mother is inhumane and it violates just basic laws of decency. OK. Now, my view is that what this administration is doing is built off the success they had with Venezuela last fall. They basically created a policy for those coming from Venezuela to say, there's a right way and a wrong way to come here. Let's create this legal pathway for you to come here and apply for asylum. Follow that. Don't just show up on our southern border. That program saw some success because the numbers of Venezuelans, after that program was announced, declined significantly. The basic point here is you can't padlock a burning building. You have to give people away to leave legally and safely. And so, the administration is building on that to say that we are creating these lawful, safe mechanisms for you to seek asylum in the United States. Here is the way you do that. You know, use this app or apply in country or apply in Mexico and your asylum claim will be considered. And so, they are trying the Venezuela experiment but on the much larger scale. I have no doubt that once this policy goes into effect there will be legal challenges to it. People have a basic right, if they qualify for asylum in this country, to receive asylum. Under the law, even though you might qualify legally on -- for asylum, because you have a well-founded fear of persecution in your home country, there are certain things that can make you ineligible for asylum. For example, if you are a convicted felon someplace. And so, the administration is trying to broaden those bases for in eligibility to encompass, not following the pathways that are prescribed. I am sure there will be legal challenges to that. And we will see how the courts consider it.",

The push factors are the biggest factors. They overwhelm the system. But our broken system does have these features that operate as magnets. And what this administration is trying to do, at least in the short-term, it is to address those facets of our broken immigration system that are serving as magnets. Measures like this will cause a downturn in the numbers of apprehensions on our southern border. We saw a downturn in the month of January 2023, for example. But so long as the underlying push factors persist, the numbers are always going to revert back to their norms, to their longer-term trend lines.",

For example, in 2016, my last year in office, we got Congress to appropriate $750 million to three countries, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador for this very purpose. For example, enabling a coffee grower in Guatemala to get better at delivering his product to the market gives people in that country hope. It enables them to encourage workers to stay in Guatemala because they have a future. Funding for anti-corruption efforts can work. Now, getting to the will we, you know, do we have the will? I fear that we do not. People want quick fixes to this problem on the southern border. And it is not a problem amenable to quick fixes. Just like there's no quick fix to climate change. This is not something that can go away just because you issue an executive order or you, you know, somehow close the southern border. So, we have to come to the recognition that this is a problem that requires years to solve and address. And I have talked to both Democrats and Republicans over the years who recognize that. Politically, is it attractive? Not very. But the reality is, if we're going to address this, and this one of the hard lessons I've learned when I own this problem, you have to address it at the source.",

People are somehow afraid of the browning of America from our southern border. So, it's become an over politicized issue. And politicians -- politicians on the right, frankly, stoke this and it has become very difficult to reach compromise on this. As recently as 2013, Comprehensive Immigration Reform passed the U.S. Senate with 68 votes. That is a whole lot of Republicans as well as Democrats. At some point along the way, this became a talking point and it has become more attractive on the right and the left to politicize this issue, scream at the other side, call them evil and not do the hard work to come together and try to reach compromises, which too many people view as politically costly.",

The Republican Party has walked away from that and doesn't want anything to do with this issue except to scream and complain about the numbers crossing the southern border. Again, it all tracks back, Michel, to where do the political incentives lie? Or at least, where do politicians perceive that their political incentives lie? In my opinion, Americans should judge -- voters should judge their representatives based upon stuff they get done not simply what they scream about and what they say they stand for. If we had a report card for members of Congress for the number of bills they sponsored and got passed versus simply, where do you stand on all these overheated issues, we'd see a lot more getting done in Washington, including immigration reform.",
