Then, Evan Gershkovich, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, who like Whelan, had been convicted of espionage by Russia and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Finally, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kermasheva, whose two daughters and husband rushed across the tarmac to hug her, an emotional moment for all on a truly historic day that saw 24 prisoners in total exchanged, seven different countries involved.

That has been highlighted now on numerous occasions by President Biden. And we are learning more about the details of actually what went into securing this deal.We know, of course, that President Biden, during his address to the American people just over a week ago, in which he announced that he was dropping out of the presidential race, he said during that address that securing the release of wrongfully detained Americans continued to be a priority for his administration, that he would continue to work around the clock to secure this. And now we are learning that at the time of this call, he was aware that a deal could well be imminent. And just a few days ahead of this call, he had spoken with the prime minister of Slovenia. This call has been described by one official as the final puzzle piece, so to speak, in trying to secure this exchange agreement. That call centered around a Russian detainee held in custody in Slovenia. And, of course, President Biden has been very clear there has been close coordination not only with Slovenia, but with counterparts in Poland, in Germany, in Norway, in Turkey. So there has been a lot when it comes to international efforts there. And, of course, we saw the logistical coordination, of course, in this exchange deal, as we have seen in the past with the Turkish government as well. And according to the White House, President Biden, in fact, called the leaders of those nations yesterday afternoon to give his personal thanks to those leaders for their support and involvement in this exchange agreement.

So, of course, that is a key point of concern. That was actually a question pressed to President Joe Biden yesterday. He said that this has been an issue for some time now. This is something they have long been aware of. But this, of course, does not negate the importance of securing the release of Americans detained abroad.

      "sentences": "Two months before Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh traveled to the Iranian capital, a bomb was planted in the guest house where he would eventually be staying. That bomb was planted two months before Ismail Haniyeh arrived in the Iranian capital, and it was only once it was clear that Haniyeh was inside that guest house in his bedroom that that bomb was remotely detonated, killing not only Haniyeh but his bodyguard as well, and marking not only a remarkable clandestine operation, but also a stunning security failure for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, which was in charge of securing this guest house where Haniyeh was staying.Now, Haniyeh was known to be staying in this guest house previously, which appears to be how this bomb was planted in the right location and ultimately how he was killed. Now, Israeli officials have neither confirmed nor denied Israel's involvement in this, but I am told by the same source familiar with the matter that Israeli officials briefed U.S. officials only after this assassination actually took place on the details of this operation. Iran and Hamas, of course, have made clear that they believe that Israel was behind this assassination. Initially, they said that it was a rocket that took out Hamas's political leader, but this operation speaks to a far more complex, far more clandestine operation and a stunning breach of security for Iranian officials. In the wake of this, Iran is vowing retaliation. It is not clear what form that retaliation will take or when it will happen, but it is, of course, just the latest in a string of events that have put this region increasingly on edge, increasingly on the brink of potentially an all-out regional war. Hezbollah has also vowed to retaliate for the killing of its senior most military commander, Fuad Shukr, which happened just hours before this assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. This string of killings is what the Israeli prime minister has described as crushing blows to Israel's enemies. It is certainly adding to a picture of tactical successes, at least, for the Israeli government, for the Israeli military, but it is also putting this region increasingly on edge and putting Israel and its citizens increasingly in the crosshairs of Iran and its proxies.

That is also something that they have tried to do at various points over the years.

There's been, for the past few months, sort of an undeclared, not truce, but de-escalation between America and Iran.You had in the early months after October 7th regular, dozens and dozens of Iranian-sponsored attacks on American military positions around the Middle East.

But I think in the long run there still is a possibility for a deal. I think Hamas still has an interest in a deal. Most people in Gaza are exhausted after 10 months of war, and they're desperate for some kind of ceasefire. The real question, as it's been for many months now, is whether Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel is willing to agree to a deal.
