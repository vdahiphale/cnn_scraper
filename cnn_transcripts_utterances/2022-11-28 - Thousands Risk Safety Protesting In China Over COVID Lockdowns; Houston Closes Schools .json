No protests of this scale with demands for political reforms have been seen in this country since the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests in 1989 that led to a massacre of unarmed protesters. In cities across the country, we're hearing chants for an end to COVID lockdowns, but also for free speech, democracy, the rule of law, human rights. This is a country where it's extremely dangerous to publicly criticize a party, especially Xi Jinping himself. You risk prison time or even worse. But that's exactly the risk people are willing to take here. And in some places, including in Shanghai, people have been chanting for Xi Jinping to step down. I was there at the protest in Beijing on Sunday night into Monday morning, surrounded by crowds of young people chanting over and over again, we don't want COVID tests. We want freedom. And I spoke to several protesters, including one who told me he motorcycled and biked for more than an hour to get to the scene. And when I asked him how he was feeling, this is what he told me.
