Shaw has apologized more than once for the derailment and he has said that the company is making changes and they will do right by the people of East Palestine.

And they have a bipartisan piece of legislation they are putting forward to put more strength in the railroad industry. And this is something they talked about at length, saying that people of East Palestine deserve this. They called on the CEO to publicly endorse the legislation today.

We saw drone footage that looked like farmhouses demolished by this. Ukrainian armed forces say their air defenses were able shoot down 34 missiles and four of the drones. But some of the weapons did get through. A spokesperson said they do not have the defenses for things like Russia's Kinzhal hypersonic missile, which were fired.

Hitting the infrastructure like this in the cities is mostly a morale type thing but some impact on the military side as well. But it is a weakness, too, Kate, because they don't have any other weapons that they can use successfully in Ukraine at this point. The ground war has turned into a slugfest, with neither side making a lot of gains at this point.
