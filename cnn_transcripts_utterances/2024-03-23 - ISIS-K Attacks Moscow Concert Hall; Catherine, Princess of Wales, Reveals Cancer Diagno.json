To be able to carry out -- carry out this kind of horrific attack amidst the number of resources and the amount of time that the Russian security services, specifically the internal service, the FSB, is supposedly putting on these terrorist groups, is quite an accomplishment.

But at the time that the American embassy made public on March 7th the fact that there was intelligence, that there was there was threat information out there, was just prior to this very sensitive time politically for Putin.

If you go back in the chronology, so I think what's becoming more and more clear is that the U.S. government, possibly in connection with other Western intelligence services, collected this information and then did what it was supposed to do, which is forward the information to the Russian government.The Russian government as we were just discussing elected not to act on it. That was on the 7th. The information that came out on the 7th of March was that there was a 48-hour window on this but that was a public announcement. It's entirely possible that whoever -- whatever terrorist group was responsible for this got access to that and said we might have to adjust and back it off a little bit in terms of time. Two weeks later now we have this particular attack and what we have seen is in this very large mall that's just on the outskirts of Moscow, you have all of these casualties apparently shot by men with assault rifles. The numbers I think are about four right now, as well as incendiary devices, which caused the whole thing to catch fire and then even more casualties resulted. So again, still early days on this investigation, it's going to be difficult to get from the Russians exactly what happened because it's such a closed society and they control the message so much.

We don't know the specificity of it, because, of course, the intelligence is sensitive. But we do know that the U.S. government and other Western governments seemed to be aware of this.

They passed temporary patch after temporary patch. And they finally released a massive government funding package at 3 in the morning on Thursday, leaving themselves not a whole lot of time to let lawmakers read the bill and get them through both chambers. So this has been a long and tortured process. There's been a lot of drama over the last few months.

But when you look at this age group of females are going to have a higher rate of cancer compared to their male counterparts.We've also seen this trend over the last couple of years of younger people getting cancer, of getting colorectal cancer, other types to cancer. And to be honest, we don't have an exact answer for why that is. And so as more information comes out, this is just a wake-up call for all of us to keep a magnifying glass on this issue and to make sure that we meet with our primary care physicians. We don't miss any screenings. And if you feel that anything is off, make sure you talk to your doctor about it. Because getting it early gives you the best chances of survival and getting, getting back to being a normal human being.",

On average, it's around six months and then some treatments can last up to a year.What chemotherapy does is it targets the fast replicating cells. So those are cancer cells. But as you mentioned, hair cells are fast replicating. The lining of our stomach and gut is really fast replicating. So that's where you get nausea, vomiting. You also get immune compromised. So your blood cells and bloodline cells will decrease. And so that's why you may not see someone who's undergoing chemotherapy out in the public, because you want to keep them away from all types of viruses and bacteria out there. Sometimes you'll also have fatigue and numbness and tingling in your hands and arms. And it really depend on what type of chemotherapy you're going through. And everyone responds differently to the various chemotherapies as well.",
