I'm Fredricka Whitfield.It's beginning to look a lot like traffic as a record-breaking number of holiday travelers are expected at airports and on the roads this weekend. AAA expects more than 119 million people to venture out from home this season marking a new flurry of travelers for the record books. Today is the official start of winter and Mother Nature could bring delays to some of those areas. But first let's bring in CNN National Correspondent Gloria Pazmino live at LaGuardia right now in New York. So how's it looking? Are there many delays or, you know, snafus happening thus far?",

Things here have been pretty calm throughout the morning while we've been here and you talk about traffic. But here inside the airport, things seem like, you know, quite organized -- a bit of an organized chaos, I would say. There's definitely a crowd. People are coming in and out. People are having to line up for short periods of time. But for the most part, things are under control. I've spoken to some travelers throughout today. Most of them tell me they're not under huge stress just yet. It's still early in the day and it's still a day -- a few days before Christmas. So they feel like they have time and they're being patient. But as you said at the beginning, Fred, this is expected to be one of the busiest if that the busiest time of travel this year and we are expecting a record amount of people to be traveling. 40 million people from the 19th of December to the second day of the year when many of us will be making our ways -- our way back home and our ways back to work. So it is going to be a lot of traveling and a lot of congestion in the next few years. But many of the people here I spoke to told me that they are feeling OK about it and not too anxious.

What's the motive behind the driver who careened in crowds there in this deadly attack leading to the deaths of five people.The death toll could rise. We've just learned that one of the victims was a nine-year-old child. Dozens more were badly hurt after a car plowed through the crowd and that was Friday night. Officials say the suspect is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who is a permanent resident of Germany and authorities say he has a history of making anti-Islam statements and is a self-identified Saudi dissident. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is at the scene of the attack. We're behind him. We can also see it's become a big memorial there. Tell me how people are feeling and where the investigation is going from here.",

It was very quick. There were a lot of ambulances that were here at the scene, police vehicles, of course, the fire department as well.One of the figures that we got today from a press conference from the local authorities is that they said that patients were evacuated to 15 clinics and hospitals around the greater region here because of course the hospitals here in the city, even though it is a very large city were overwhelmed very quickly. So it was definitely a very fast, a very professional response and I think that's one of the things that the authorities here are taking away as a positive if there can be a positive in all this that the reaction was very fast. One of the other things of course that Germany is speaking about now is the security at Christmas markets and how that needs to be improved in the future, Fredricka.

Some of them said that it might be dissatisfaction towards the asylum policies of Germany's towards Saudi asylum seekers, but it really was unclear what exactly that was supposed to mean. It certainly seems as though there was some sort of process that this man went through. One of the things that really stood out to us today to though is how fast if he did it -- that he was able to cause a lot of carnage. The Germans are saying that the first emergency call came to them at two minutes past 7:00 p.m. last night, and the man was in custody by five minutes past 7:00 p.m. So in three minutes, a lot of people were injured when that vehicle plowed through that Christmas market, Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "All right, new today, President Biden just signed the stopgap government funding bill into law capping off a chaotic week on Capitol Hill. Just after midnight, the U.S. Senate passed the measure keeping the government funded through mid-March. Their colleagues in the House passed the bill just a few hours prior, following a week of back and forth negotiations between Republicans, Democrats and President-elect Donald Trump.CNN's Julia Benbrook is at the White House for us live. So Julia, I mean, this bill got through with overwhelming support, you know, after, well, I guess is the third iteration of it. But, you know, finally Democrats are on board. A great feeling of relief coming from President Biden? JULIA BENBROOK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A chaotic week is definitely the right way to put it. And this time yesterday, we didn't know if lawmakers on Capitol Hill would be able to come to an agreement and get a funding bill to the President's desk before the holidays. But as you mentioned, he has signed that bill into law and released this statement saying, quote \"The agreement represents a compromise which means neither side got everything it wanted. But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity\". Now, this solution comes after a lot of back and forth on Capitol Hill. Congress seemed poised earlier in the week to pass a bipartisan deal, but President-elect Trump spoke out against it and essentially upended that plan. In response to his opposition, Republicans tanked that bipartisan deal frustrating Democrats both here at the White House and on Capitol Hill. The GOP-led House then tried and failed to pass a Trump-backed measure and it included a two-year suspension of the debt limit. That specific part of it received a lot of push back from members on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats arguing that it would make it easier for Trump to pass his tax plan in the future. So let's take a look at what actually ended up in this version of the bill that they just signed into law. It will fund the government until mid-March, March 14th to be exact. It includes $100 billion in disaster relief and $10 billion in farm aid. Now, speaking with reporters after the House voted, the top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries framed this as a win. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D), MINORITY LEADER: House Democrats have successfully funded the government at levels requested by President Biden. This is a victory for the American people. We have successfully advanced the needs of everyday Americans, but there are still things to be worked on and we look forward to that fight in the New Year. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

Well, there's a lot of people thinking that maybe he did it for his own personal interests, having to do with his investments in China. Nevertheless, Trump then jumped on it and we saw that the Republicans in the House of Representatives continued once again to be unable to govern. They couldn't pass the bill. They then went back and we put together a compromise both the House and the Senate, Democrats and Republicans. And so there is no shutdown at least until March. We're going to go back through this whole game once again in March and it'll be even more interesting at that point to see the chaos, once again, that is coming out of the Trump administration. Will Elon play a role in March? My guess is he probably will. Will it be the same kind of kill, kill, kill legislation that he did this time around? Probably so. What will that mean?

We have a clear desire to make sure that every day Americans, the truck drivers, the teachers, the nurses, the people that are working on construction that they were able to have through the Christmas holidays the necessary federal services.That's where we're going to be going in January, February, March and throughout the Trump administration. We're going to continue to fight for everyday average Americans and that will then bring us to the table in March. Keep in mind that one of the principal things that Trump wanted was to grease the skids so that he could pass another massive tax cuts, some $2 trillion tax cut 80 percent or 85 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent of Americans, people like Elon Musk. That will be the major fight coming down in March. We're going to push back on that. Yes, there ought to be a tax cut but these are for the working men and women, the teachers, the truck drivers, the people that are working on construction. And we've got to make sure that those people that do not have an ability to work, that they're properly cared for. That will be the fight. So if there's going to be a tax cut, it certainly ought not be for the super wealthy, the billionaire class Elon Musk of the world. But that's where Trump wants to go. So let's hone in on what we'll be facing over the next three months. Trump will put forth an extension of his 2017 tax cut which put $2,300,000,000,000 hole in the national debt.

But when you look at it from a legal perspective, it's unusual and potentially wrong. And here's why I say that. Number one, what the court said, and that's the lower court. Remember, this is an appeals court. The original court had a two and a half day hearing you might remember, an evidentiary hearing as to whether or not there was a conflict of interest.There were findings of fact made after a number of witnesses testified. And they noted that trial court did that there was the appearance of a conflict of interest. Now, the significance of that, the court of appeals now says is that a conflict -- an appearance alone is a -- gives you the ability to disqualify. That's just not the law. And the dissent, right, has said that's the judge who disagreed with the majority, right, has said that in 45 years there has not been and it's not been the law that because of the appearance of impropriety that you disqualify someone. That has to be an actual conflict of interest, not the appearance. That's number one. Number two, very briefly is usually an appellate court sits in judgment to decide whether the trial court abused its discretion. That means that they exercised judgment that was just so unreasonable as to be overturned. And this court basically said, yes, generally speaking, you don't, unless you're a trial court, unless there's an egregious error made by the lower court with respect to discretion, that's a judgment, a legal judgment overrules. So I think on those two basis, I think it's a questionable decision. And you know, she's right that it's Fani Willis to appeal it to the next court, which is the Supreme Court, of course, of Georgia.",

I want to shift gears now and -- and also talk to you about another big case in the past couple of weeks. Luigi Mangione, he is a suspect in the killing of the healthcare CEO. He could be arraigned as early as Monday. He's facing a slew of new charges in the killing of Brian Thompson. Mangione has 11 charges in New York, including first degree murder as an act of terrorism. He's also facing federal charges now and actually being held in federal custody. So what do you make of the prioritizing of these cases in New York and federal case?",

But we did have similar weather yesterday in South Bend, Indiana as the 12 team college football playoff kicked off with the game between Notre Dame and Indiana.And those Fighting Irish players, I mean, they set the tone from the start. They went out there on the field and warmed up shirtless before the game saying those frigid temperatures were not going to bother them one bit. And despite being less than 200 miles apart, these -- for these two schools, this was the first matchup between them since 1991. It was dominated by Notre Dame, though. The teams, they traded interceptions early. But then it was Jeremiyah Love. The play of the game, a 98-yard touchdown run sent the whole stadium into a frenzy. That run tied a school record. And the Irish, they would go on to win 27-17 to get their first ever playoff victory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
