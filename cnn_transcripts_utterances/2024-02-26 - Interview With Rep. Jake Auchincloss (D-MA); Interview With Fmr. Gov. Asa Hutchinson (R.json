That's on hold, but could get back into the hands of the trial court quite quickly.And then they would need to put it on the calendar for trial. He doesn't want to go to trial in that case before the election. So the way to prevent that, according to the sources I'm talking to, is to use his other federal criminal case in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago documents case, and take it. And it's very complex. Try and use the complexity of that case as an argument to move it along on the calendar and box out the other case from being able to take place theoretically in a way that, if it works, could keep Trump from going to both of these trials. We're going to see if this works first this Friday, because Friday there is a very big hearing in the case in Florida. And it is the hearing where Judge Aileen Cannon could be rescheduling that Mar-a-Lago documents trial. It's currently on the calendar for the end of May, right after his New York hush money case, which he will be going to trial on.

Will it be the documents case in Florida or will it be the election interference case in D.C.? So long as Supreme Court keeps dragging its feet on the immunity issue, it gets harder to really tell when the D.C. case will happen. What Katelyn just said about the Florida case is exactly what we're all waiting for is what's going to come out of this Friday hearing. It's going to be a daylong hearing that Judge Cannon has scheduled for. Will she move her trial date? Will she set it in June maybe?

She's given him a lot of procedural discretion. She's given him a lot of opportunities to make arguments I don't think she necessarily had to make him -- or let him do. But she hasn't done anything substantively yet to make me think she's in any way biased towards Donald Trump. We're going to see between now and Friday how that actually plays out when we get these substantive rulings that she has before her, especially on the classified information issue in that case, and the deletions, the discovery that the government is trying to do under what's called the Classified Information Procedures Act.

He's also a former Republican presidential candidate and is now backing Nikki Haley.Governor, great to have you this afternoon. I was fortunate to be in South Carolina this weekend and speaking to a number of voters. Multiple of them told me that they don't totally understand and don't really care about the charges that Donald Trump is facing. He won by 20 points this weekend. What does that tell you about where the Republican electorate is right now? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, they see unfairness in the process, but they also simultaneously say that, if there is a conviction, then that impacts their level of support. That just doesn't bode well for a Republican nominee to go into the November election as -- with a conviction. And so there's a lot to be concerned about on Trump's part. He had a great victory in South Carolina. But whenever you look at the independent votes that moved in the direction of Nikki Haley, the fact that she got 40 percent of the vote, and the fact that, either before or after the convention, maybe both, he will be undergoing criminal trials, and so these are storm clouds that are gathering over Donald Trump. And that's why he wants to wrap this election up very quickly. But I think it's -- it does not bode well for him as he goes into the convention, even though he's going to control the apparatus. He's going to be able to dictate the terms of his nomination if he continues to be strong, so a lot to play out here that we don't know. But, right now, he's in a pretty good position for the nomination, but in a very poor position for the general election.",

Secondly, whenever you look at the prospect of winning, there's just too much unpredictability out there to say, let's throw in the towel now. So I applaud her. And I think she's making the case very well in Michigan that it's about Donald Trump, but it's also about the Senate and the House and whether we win or lose those races.

It is a counterprogramming effort to give an opportunity for conservatives that are more in the mold of a strong United States of America, not isolationism that is advocated by Donald Trump and now CPAC. And so it's a much broader diversity of thought. That's important for the debate within the Republican Party.

The talks had essentially been stalled. You will remember that Israel had called Hamas' demands delusional. So those Paris talks on Friday were really important to try to get the parties back to the table, to try to get moving on the broader points. So it does look like things are progressing. The broader deal that we're looking at right now would be a weeks-long pause in the fighting. Israeli hostages would be released, primarily the women, the children, the elderly, and the sick who remain. Palestinian prisoners would also be released And I'm told that, in order to move this along, Hamas has actually responded to those Israeli accusations of being delusional and backed off some of their key demands, notably on the number of prisoners that they want to see released, on demands that the IDF withdraw from Gaza, that there be discussions about the end of the war. By no means are those off the table, but, for now, to launch this first phase of the deal, I'm told that Hamas has softened those demands. So one source told me that things are progressing. Another source told me that they are struggling to get this across the finish line. There's a sense that this could happen in the coming days, but, at any moment, I'm warned that this is very fluid and that things could fall apart.
