The attack unfolded outside a security screening zone set up for last night's festivities. Now, police say the man wielding the machete was just 19 years old. Fortunately, all three officers injured are in stable condition. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is following the story for us from New York City. Gloria, what else do we know about this violent attack?",

He was just fresh, a few days on the job.This happened, as you mentioned, outside of a security zone because everyone who goes to Times Square to watch the New Year's Eve ball drop has to go through these screening points exactly for this reason. They are being checked for weapons, for items that are not permitted into this event. And that is where police say a 19-year-old male approached these officers completely unprovoked and attempted to strike one of them over the head with that machete we're seeing there on the screen. He then proceeded to strike another officer, and that's when another officer discharged his service weapon, striking the suspect in his shoulder. Now, these three officers were transported to the hospital last night. The three of them are in stable condition. Mayor Eric Adams visited them in the hospital last night and held an early morning press conference to talk about this incident, also commending the way these officers responded to this attack, to the fact that they were working on one of the most important days of the year, security-wise, for the city of New York. Thousands of people crowd the area around Times Square hoping to get a peek at the ball drop. And he commended their actions the way they responded, and how they proceeded to work even after the incident took place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY): One of the officers heard from the police commissioner and I just a few days ago at his graduation, which just goes to show you if it's not the first day or could be your last day, the actions that police officers must take every day are life-threatening situations.

But we have had other cases where offenders have been in areas of study that more or less prepare them to commit a crime. So, Ted Bundy was an example. Dennis Rader is another example. But I will say this, because I think it's really important. His area of study is not a result of cause and effect, in other words, got into criminology, the study of the criminal mind, and that caused him to do this. That's certainly not, in my opinion, going to be the outcome. He's interested in this, but the ideation of committing a violent crime had to be already there in order to motivate him to commit the crime.

So, again, I think that weapon was carefully chosen and it was chosen for a very specific reason. So, to discard it would have been very difficult.

So, any move to vacate the chair, and John Boehner certainly has dealt with this, Paul Ryan had to deal with it, any even threat of this, which started with Mark Meadows not that long ago, really puts us in a constitutional crisis.This isn't political parlor games when you talk about vacating the chair.

I doubt very many Republican voters are going to take the tax returns into account, but they are going to have to reconcile whether you want o put him, knowing what we know now, back in the Oval Office given his performance as president.",
