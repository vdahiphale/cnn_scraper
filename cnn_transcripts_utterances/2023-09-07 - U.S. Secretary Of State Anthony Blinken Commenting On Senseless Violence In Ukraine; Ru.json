He later spent time at a demining center. It comes as Ukraine is claiming further military gains along the southern front lines. During his trip, Blinken praised Kyiv's progress in his counteroffensive and says that those who have enabled Russia's senseless war should pay for it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Secretary of State Blinken had made it clear as he arrived at the American assessment, Zain, of whatwas happening with this counteroffensive, over which so much frustration had been expressed these last few weeks that the current administration's assessment was that things were progressing. And having met with President Zelenskyy, who himself had just come back from a visit to frontline troops in the Donetsk region on the Eastern Front, what Secretary Blinken told reporters at that press conference yesterday was that he had heard that things were progressing well from the Ukrainians, as well. This is, of course, an important message that the American Secretary of State, as he wraps up this two-day visit, will then be taking home with him. It had been all about reaffirming the commitment and the reasons for the commitment and the progress being made to the American people, because, of course, of that waning support, softening support certainly was seen in some of the polls with regard to how Americans feel about the continued ongoing spending for this war, nineteen months now into it. That was at the heart of what he had to announce, the billion dollars of extra help. Of course, he announced this will have to do with specific weaponry and, in particular, ammunition, including controversially depleted uranium munitions, to help Ukrainians on those front lines tackle those very difficult Russian defenses, Zain, that have been being erected now, almost, since the line stabilized in March of last year. What we understand is happening now in the counteroffensive is that there have been further gains. That's what Ukrainians are saying this evening further gains to the north of the strategic aim of the southern center offensive, which is the town of Tokmak. We've watched the troops progress ever so slightly, ever so with so much difficulty over the course of the last few days to the south of Robotyne. And it is that ultimate aim of Tokmak that has been made clear. What they are telling us tonight is that some strategic gains have been made to the north of that town. Essentially, what it would do, Zain, is give Ukrainians the ability to take on the supply routes of the Russians between Russia proper and their territories in Crimea. That is the aim. What we're hearing tonight is that slow but steady progress is being made. Zain.",

      "sentences": "It is and in the context of what you were describing there, the real danger when theseevaporate into dust on impact. You know, it's the momentum and the density that allow them to -- these munitions to punch through the armor and sometimes ignite as they do so, creating this really potentially harmful dust. There are other much more harmful effects for let's say the tank crews. This was designed back in the 70s to take on and destroy Soviet-era T-72 tanks, which is a principal tank that Ukrainian forces face. And that's when they're bringing in the British Challenger II tank and the new U.S. Abrams tanks, which these depleted uranium munitions will be used from, those are going to be high among the targets when you talk about tank battles. So, there is a danger to the troops in the tank, the physical harm of the destructive nature of a massive explosion. The analysis has generally been that inhaling the sort of vaporized effect of these munitions, civilians would need to be very, very close to a very intense battle. However, when it gets into the soil, it settles out into the soil. This is what we've heard from the World Health Organization saying that where there have been concentrations of this munition used, you should look at the groundwater supplies afterwards. You should be very aware of what happens in the groundwater in those communities. And this will, it does potentially create concern going forward. But as far as troops handling the munitions, NATO's own investigations, the IAEA, have also said that there's no significant effect. The assessment is if you get some of this depleted uranium on your skin or you inhale it, then probably your body's going to pass it out. But if you get it in your bloodstream, it can potentially be harmful to your kidneys. But I think it's the long-term groundwater effects that are perhaps going to be the things that Ukraine will obviously have to monitor in the future.",

The military leaders who staged a coup in Gabon say that ousted president AliBongo Odimba is now allowed to travel abroad for medical checkups if he so wishes. Bongo had been held under house arrest since being overthrown in late August. Here you see him meeting on Wednesday at his residence. He's meeting with a U.N. official. In a statement, the junta cited the state of his health, his medical condition, for the decision to free him. Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018 and spent months in Morocco getting treatment. CNN's Stephanie Busari is following this story for us from Lagos, Nigeria. So, Stephanie, just give us more detail on what prompted this decision by the military junta to free him from house arrest and to actually allow him. They said he's allowed to leave the country, he's allowed to travel abroad. Do we know if he will take them up on that offer? Will he be leaving the country?",

He's suffered a stroke, after all, and has some health issues. So, they've offered him a way out to say, you're not feeling too great, so you can travel. Reading between the lines, he's about to join a long list of former deposed African leaders who have gone into exile. France is the most obvious choice because he has his family have amassed a portfolio of luxury real estate in France over the years, over the nearly 42 years that the Bongo family has been in power. And they also have homes in the U.S. So, France -- he's been very close, his Bongo family has been very close to France over the years, so it's likely that he will end up somewhere in France, in one of those many properties I mentioned. But the Bongo family will not be off the hook because his son, Noureddin Valentin Bongo, has been charged by the junta with high treason and it looks likely that he will face some tough sanctions. Not much has been said about him since he was paraded with an aide with millions of seffa found at his aide's home. So, that will be something that we'll be developing and we'll be monitoring closely to see what happens to him.

The poll finds that Biden's approval rating below 40 percent, which is, by the way, the lowest of any president at this point in their term since Jimmy Carter in 1979. There's also broad disapproval of Biden's handling of the economy. In fact, look at these numbers here. Fifty-eight percent of Americans say that he has only made things worse since he took over a couple of years ago. And it's not just the economy in question after question. In this CNN poll, we found that three out of four Americans are deeply concerned about Biden's age. They're concerned about his stamina, both right now and in a potential second term, as well. When asked how they will vote, Biden is either behind or statistically tied against every significant Republican in the field. And that, by the way, includes Donald Trump. And Biden's problems do not just come from Republicans or independents who don't like him. Two-thirds of Democrats say they want their party to find someone else as their nominee. Oh, boy. I want to dive deeper into Joe Biden's re-election problems right now with Toluse Olorunnipa, White House Bureau Chief for \"The Washington Post\". So, I don't even know where to begin, Toluse. I have no idea where to begin. These numbers are devastating for the Democrats. I think, the interesting thing here, or rather the unfortunate thing here for Joe Biden, is that age is such a big factor. And unlike the economy, he can't really do anything about his age. I mean, it's only going to get worse. He's only going to get older. So, what does Joe Biden do? He has just over a year to turn things around. What can he do if anything?",

Even Democrats who support what he's doing are not too sure that he's going to be able to be, you know, have the stand and be forceful enough to stand up against a Republican nominee. And so, he's not really doing what he needs to do to convince his party that he has the stamina and strength to take this on. But he needs to start focusing on his record, talking about what he's done over the past few years, talk about all the laws that he was able to pass and say, I'm old, but I have experience.

Khalife is accused of planting fake bombs at a military base. The manhunt continues in Pennsylvania for a convicted murderer.

So, we expect that the orators and Ms. Artiko have already made a statement to that effect. So, we expect that the other two candidates will take this up to the Supreme Court. But ultimately, when it comes to looking at election law in Nigeria, one of the biggest issues is that it's really more prohibitive and it really supports more the person who has already been declared winner during the election. So, in terms of any long term, I wouldn't just be the next week or to be looking at making sure that through the representatives that their parties have in Parliament and even just in actively trying to lobby and legislate to try to get much more needed reform to the electoral act. Because for the controversy that we've actually mentioned, you know, the elections were actually a bit much more improved that previous polls and that's not to say that the ballot was even hard to begin with. But then it's still a situation where things have improved, but then there's still much more that can't be done. There's much more that needs to be improved. And now the next day, will not be trying to ensure that there's that sufficient to try to make that happen.",

He got on stage, I just played a clip before I came to you, he got on stage and said, you know, now that I'm president of ECOWAS, there's not going to be any more coups.

The optimism right now is that there have been much more reports of diplomatic engagements between ECOWAS, between Nigeria and other senior officials really trying to engage with the military on site in Niger. But ultimately, I think this is really a crossroads not just for ECOWAS but also for the region for the continent entirely about making sure that as much as possible whether it's through sang, through discussions that there are actually much more deterrence for any coup leaders.
