We'll continue to follow that as it's unfolding as we speak.There's also this. Protesters on the streets of Paris, this is a live look at that, setting -- what we've seen so far this morning, people setting dumpsters ablaze, breaking into the headquarters of Louis Vuitton, we've seen clashes between police and protesters, and it's all leading up to a final decision on whether French President Macron's pension plan -- whether it's going to get the green light. That plan would raise the retirement age for the country to - from 62 to 64. And that is one reason that people have been taking to the streets. We can expect that ruling tomorrow. Sara.",

And the Federal Reserve issued a new prediction about the likelihood of a recession in the wake of last month's banking crisis. CNN's Rahel Solomon joins us now. Give us a sense of what these numbers mean to all of us.RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Hey, Sara, good to be with you. Yes. So, this is yet another sign of moderating prices. It took us a while to get here, Sara, but here we are. So, this is the Producer Price Index, as you said, wholesale inflation, factory level inflation, supplier inflation. But what it showed for the month of March is that prices sell for producers about half of a percent on a monthly basis. Put another way on an annual basis, prices are still higher by about 2.7 percent. But take a look at how this annual figure for the month of March compares to the month prior. And you can see the declines, right? 2.7 percent compared to 4.9 percent year over year in February. So, a pretty sharp decline there. We saw falls in the prices of energy and the prices of food. Now in the last hour, actually about at 9:00 a.m. -- in the 9:00 a.m. hour, I spoke to Dana Peterson. She was the chief economist at the Conference Board. And I asked her, do these numbers surprise you? And she said look, I mean supply chains have improved. That's helping on the good side. She said that demand for goods has fallen, that's also helping. But this is what she pointed out. She said the key thing here that's driving inflation, especially consumer inflation, what people like you and me are experiencing --",

And with that, there are now growing concerns about the health effects that this unfolding disaster is having on the community there in Indiana. The EPA is warning asbestos may be in the debris left behind by this massive recycling plant fire. This is what the fire looked like just yesterday, on Wednesday. I mean, you still see how huge it is.CNN's Omar Jimenez has the very latest for us. He's still on the ground for us. Omar, officials say that the air quality tests -- the initial results, if you will, are going to be released today. What are you hearing about this? OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Kate. So, we're basically -- or the EPA is basically looking to see if there are toxins in the air around the ground level. So, it's why they're continuing to do tests as they say 24/7. Now, today, as we take a look at basically what the situation is, emergency management says whether overnight allowed the smoke to settle more in and around the city and getting to places that previously didn't see it. So, I want to show you a little bit of what we're seeing. We're much further back than what we were in previous days just because the air quality was a little tougher closer to it today. You can see it is not about the big black smoke that we saw when this was first blazing. It's not about how high the smoke is. You see how it is now drifting as they've closed in on maybe what was causing this fire have gotten to the center of it, it is drifting over, and the footprint of it is incredibly wide and much lower than it had been in previous days. And again, that is the concern as officials before have said what is in those clouds, those big gray clouds have been definitely toxic. So that's why they're keeping a test on this. You also mentioned that about potentially asbestos in debris. It's why the EPA says to -- that today, they're waiting on results of testing debris for asbestos. And on this particular facility, we had heard from the mayor and others that this is a place that had been cited as being unsafe previously. What we now know specifically, back in a 2019 meeting they were being cited for unsafe. And actually, a judge agreed the -- a year later saying that this is a place that was a fire hazard. And at least an owner of the building said there was one spot that did not even have fire extinguishing capabilities. I should mention that we've reached out to the owner, but haven't heard back. But obviously, a lot of questions we still have here, and tests whose results are still yet to come.",
