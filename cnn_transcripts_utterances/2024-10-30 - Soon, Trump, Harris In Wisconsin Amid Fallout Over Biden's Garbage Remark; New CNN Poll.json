Harris is on damage control while Trump is seizing on the president's remark despite his own repeated references to the United States as a garbage can.Also this hour, CNN's exclusive new battleground polls show Vice President Harris has a slim lead in Wisconsin and Michigan and is tied with former President Trump in Pennsylvania. Stand by for new snapshots of the race with just six days to go. Plus, as early voting in Wisconsin is breaking records, CNN's John King is on the ground there tonight. He'll join us live as he hits five battleground states in five days. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with breaking news from the presidential campaign trail. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are both heading to Wisconsin tonight as fallout from an unforced error by President Biden is weighing on the race with the election now only six days away. CNN has exclusive new polling showing Harris holding a lead over Trump in Wisconsin, one of three so called blue wall battleground states. Harris is also leading in Michigan. But in Pennsylvania, she's dead even with Trump. Our correspondents are in Wisconsin awaiting heiress and Trump events there and getting new reaction to the controversial remark by President Biden. Let's go to CNN's Jeff Zeleny in Madison, Wisconsin first. He's covering the Harris campaign for us tonight. So, Jeff, how is Harris navigating this very delicate moment?",

Take a listen to what President Biden said, words that have been hanging over the campaign all day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something. I don't know a Puerto Rican that I know, or Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware. They're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it's un- American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, by the way, the most powerful line in the speech was, unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at the table. The whole spirit of her speech was contrary to what the president said, and he tried to clean it up later. And, you know, I'd take him at his word that that's what he meant. But these, you know, it's neither the campaign nor its supporters can afford to do this. I will say that it is unbelievably rich for Donald Trump, who has roundly insulted people 12 different ways in every speech and talked about Democrats as, you know, enemies of the people and talked about unleashing the military on political opponents and so on. For him to feign umbrage is a little bit rich. But, nonetheless, here we are talking about it today instead of what Kamala Harris wanted us to be talking about today, and that's not her fault.",

And so Republicans putting it out there and highlighting and talking about the fact that the sitting president of the United States said that Republicans and those who support Donald Trump are garbage. And, yes, he cleaned it up and he put out other statements. But to David's point, I mean, that's what we're talking about today.

This is nothing like that.Let's just compare how Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have reacted and how J.D. Vance and Donald Trump reacted. Kamala Harris quickly disavowed those comments, distanced herself from them, said she disagreed, acknowledged she had seen and heard them and said she disagreed. J.D. Vance told Puerto Ricans, told Latinos to learn how to take a joke and that he had not heard the comment. Donald Trump, who was at Madison Square Garden, also said he had never heard the comment and really never clarified, never apologized, never acknowledged, just kind of moved on. So, the difference is tomorrow we're not going to be talking about this because it's no big deal. It's completely out of step with the campaign that Kamala Harris is running. But we are still going to be talking, and in Pennsylvania, Puerto Ricans are still going to be talking and feeling the reverberations of what happened at that Madison Square Garden rally. Today, Nicky Jam, a pretty big Puerto Rican singer with 43 million followers on Instagram who had come out last month to endorse Donald Trump. Remember, he's the guy who he thought was a girl, called her a woman. Well, he came out today and withdrew his endorsement, renounced it, and said that Puerto Rico must be respected.

Joe Biden himself wants to campaign for her and Harris' team has kept him at arm's length, worried that he is an undisciplined candidate and an unpopular candidate. But Joe Biden wants to get out there in part because of his ego, but in part because he knows his legacy is very caught up in Harris winning and he wants to be part of the campaign.

Let me bring up the state of Wisconsin. You see all those counties. There are 72 counties in Wisconsin. Joe Biden won this state in 2020, even though he won only 13 of those. So, how did he do that, 13 out of 72? Well, the Democratic Foundation is here where I am in the city of Milwaukee. That is the largest county is the foundation of the Democratic base, African-American voters. Can you get high turnout and high victory margins? Well, we met earlier today.
