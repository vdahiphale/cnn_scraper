      "sentences": "Well, I made it across the Atlantic and now yes, Friday night, in the city of London. There's one more hour totrade on Wall Street. The Dow once again. Look, the Dow wasn't up yesterday, it was the NASDAQ that roared, now the Dow is following on. So, there is a good strong rally underway at the moment in the market. We'll have the closing numbers, obviously as the hour progresses. Those are the markets and the reasons why we are with you: Tonight, US politicians are inching ever closer to a debt deal. There are signs of progress. It's designed to avoid, of course, the dreaded default. Here in London, a new study: Workers in the office, 2.3 days a week. What's the 0.3, I wonder? How do you work that one out -- 2.3 days a week -- the impact in the future of the city of London. You're going to hear about it from those who know. And a man opens a plane emergency door while the plane is still in the air, a terrifying experience for all involved. Live from London tonight. It is Friday, it is May the 26th. I'm Richard Quest and in London you bet, I mean business. And a very good evening to you. We are at the cheese grater. I will explain how where and why in a moment. We are in the city of London, the heart if you will, of the UK's financial center and one of the questions we'll be testing is, how much is the city as we will call it still part of Europe's financial center in the post- Brexit post-pandemic world. Shaken by Brexit, and now, of course the work- from-home revolution. So the cheese grater, Leadenhall Building, we are 42 floors up. It is known as the cheese grater, the building. To give you an idea, over there is the shard, behind the walkie talkie. Over there is the Gherkin. It is London's sixth tallest building. It's nestled closely to all the other famous buildings that have come up over the last few years. You can see from the sky. Of course, when I started as a financial journalist, none of this was here. The NatWest tower, I think it was then in those days, I can see the Lord Mayor of London agreeing with me, was the tallest building. That of course has all changed. So tonight, we're going to be putting some perspective into all of this. Tonight, I'm going to be speaking to the owners of the building, CC Land. You're also going to hear from the Lord Mayor of London, and it wouldn't be London if we didn't have the renowned HSBC economist, Stephen King, to guide us through it all. And I mean, you have to say this is an absolutely extraordinary setup that we have here this evening, on a Friday night, delighted to be here. First, though, let's go to Washington. Time is now growing ever shorter, to raise the US debt ceiling. Wall Street is higher on hopes of this last- minute breakthrough. Look at that. It's been up all session, strongly up, and I think we may put a bit of weight on in the last hour holding on to triple digits, more than 300 gains, and the triple stack shows a similar situation. The NASDAQ is on a tear. It was NVIDIA yesterday that did the deed. Now, I wonder where the 13,000 on the NASDAQ, we might see it before you and I say good night tonight. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than one percent. Here is what we told is the rough outline of the budget agreement to raise the debt ceiling. It will be a two-year deal. It would cap discretionary spending except for Defense and Veterans programs, and they were cut funding to the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS. This is by the way, money that they only just got in the last budget deal. Matt Egan is with us. Firstly, Matt. Number one, how close is this deal to being done? And secondly, I imagine it is going to have to be Democrats and middle of the road Republicans that will push it over the over the edge.",

I mean, Democrats are not going to be happy about cutting the funding for the IRS crackdown that they just got. I don't think Republicans are going to be thrilled about lifting the debt ceiling for two years, perhaps not capping spending as much or for as long as they want to.

Amid this debt ceiling drama, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge is now heating up. It's the PCE. It's a measure of personal spending, 4.4 percent year-to-April, it rose. And that, of course, is increasing the possibility of a rate rise in June. Stephen King, he is the author of \"We Need to Talk About Inflation.\" He makes the argument that we're on the cusp of a new inflationary era, blaming it on the hubris of the world's central bankers. Did you always think, Stephen, that we were going to end up with inflation again? STEPHEN KING, AUTHOR, \"WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT INFLATION\": The simple answer, Richard is absolutely not. I had a long career worrying about deflation rather than inflation, a world of falling prices rather than rising prices. And I guess, I began to worry probably the beginning of 2021, because you had this extraordinary collapse in the pandemic in terms of economic activity, but rather than inflation surprising, on the downside, it began to surprise on the upside.

Just short of that 50 plus one percent threshold needed to declare a victory. He has now in the last few days had the support of the party, which came third in that race. That is about five percent of the vote. So, if you consider it from that perspective, he could potentially have the votes now in this second round to declare a victory. That said he may have the support of the head of this Nationalist Party but there are other members of this party that are throwing their support and their weight behind. The opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu. So, it still remains to be seen of course. And this is a significant feat for the opposition. We are talking about six very different parties on the political spectrum coming together in the most unified way we've ever seen the opposition really here in Turkey behind Kemal Kilicdaroglu. And of course, this is a significant step for them. So, a loss at this point. They did, of course, achieve just under 45 percent of the vote in the first one would be a significant blow to any hope, really, of the opposition being successful and taking down a president who has been in power now for more than two decades. But look, the campaign is still ongoing, even though we are very, very close to those ballots opening on Sunday morning. We were at one of those rallies earlier today. We had the opposition on one end of the street, the A.K. Party, of course of President Erdogan. On the other side of the street, Turkey's interior minister even stopping by for a visit.
