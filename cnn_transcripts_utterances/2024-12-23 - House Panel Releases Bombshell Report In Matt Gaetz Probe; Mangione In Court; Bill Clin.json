Plus, Luigi Mangione, accused of assassinating a CEO, back in court to enter a plea today, with his attorney blasting the police and New York City's mayor for using her client as, quote, political fodder.

      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, sex, drugs and a minor. A bombshell report released by the House Ethics Committee, reams of evidence released, including text messages that reveal the first -- for the first time, the full scope of former Congressman Matt Gaetz's sex scandal. According to the report put out just this morning, Gaetz, who was Trump's nominee for attorney general before stepping aside, allegedly paid multiple women for sex, including a 17-year-old, while he was a sitting member of Congress and also did illegal drugs while in office. Well, tonight, a slew of text messages that suggests Gaetz wasn't always so willing to pay up. There's a lot here. Here's one exchange. A woman writing: So I'm not going to be taking care of this -- I'm not going to be taking care of for last week? Gaetz allegedly responds: I gave you 250 today. I figured redacted would pay for your Uber. Last week, you gave me a drive by. In another exchange between women who say they met with Gaetz, a woman starts complaining in a message this, quote, Matt never paid me. How much did he pay you? The other woman responds: WTF. He gave me 400. And Gaetz's then-girlfriend also messaging with some of the women who were typically paid for sex, according to this report. Quote: the guys, Representative Gaetz and Mr. Greenberg, his associate, wanted me to share that they are a little limited in their cash flow this weekend. Matt was like, if it can be more of a customer appreciation week, dot, dot, dot. Now again, this is all said to have taken place while Matt Gaetz was a sitting member of Congress. The House Ethics Committee, concluding it, found substantial evidence that, quote, in 2017, Representative Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl. It goes on to say that during the period 2017 to 2019, Representative Gaetz used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, on multiple occasions. We'll note that Gaetz has never been charged and he denies all the allegations, and the committee found that the 17 year old did not tell Gaetz she was a minor, nor did Gaetz ask her age. With all of this coming out, Matt Gaetz tried today to block the report from being released, unsuccessfully filing a lawsuit this morning and acknowledging this evening that the point is moot since the report is now out. Tonight, Gaetz is responding, though, posting online in part this: There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses. Katelyn Polantz is OUTFRONT, live in Washington all over, as this was released this morning. Katelyn, there's a lot of detailed evidence in this report. What more are you learning?",

I'm hearing that from Republicans and Democrats alike today. What is the most damning thing in this report, in your opinion? REP. GLENN IVEY (D-MD):  Well, I think you covered a lot of it. You know, certainly the allegations or the findings with respect to the sex with the 17-year-old are very powerful. And, you know, the prostitution issues and the like. I mean, there's -- there's a lot there. So it's, kind of, overwhelming. I think in some ways when you read it all and put it all together, and our staff did a great job of doing a very thorough investigation and bringing us the information so we could do that, put it in the report and allow the public to see it now.",

IVEY:  Well, I think the point is that, you know, the report is out there now and the public can see it and review it and decide for themselves what they think. And, you know, your lead in report mentioned, you know, other possibilities as far as, you know, whether it's Department of Justice or local law enforcement taking a look at these things, too, it's available for them as well. So, you know, Mr. Gaetz has the right. He's got a First Amendment rights, just like anybody else. He's got a very big platform as well. He's got the right to say his, you know, his position and give his points of view. And the public can take a listen to all of it and, you know, draw their own conclusions.",

And you know, how they -- how they decide to move forward with it is up to them. But again, I think it was important for the public to see it and also for our colleagues to see it so they understand, you know, what the committee was doing, why it took so long, and how to conform their conduct as they go through this.

So, you know, that's my take. The bottom line, though, is, you know, what does the public decide? You know, I always thought that sunlight is the best disinfectant. This is important for us to put that out there and give the public a chance to take a look at Congress as a whole. You know, the Ethics Committee is charged with making sure that were doing the right thing and staying on the right track. But ultimately, we all know that the public has the final word on who comes back and who doesn't. And it's important for them to know that there's stuff like this going on in Washington.",

The decision to publish a report after his resignation breaks from the committees long standing practice, opens the committee to undue criticism and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponize the committee's process.

And I think, as I said, it's important for the public to see it and draw their own conclusions. So I know there were certainly colleagues that dissented, and they cited one instance that they tried to distinguish, but really didn't say anything about the other three. And I'd note, too, that the Senate's done this as well in certain cases. So I think we're on pretty firm ground here. And I trust that, you know, our colleagues, we've been able to work together in a very bipartisan way on this committee dating back to, you know, the Santos findings and that investigation. And there's a bunch of other ones that have taken place between now and then, and we've always managed to work well together in a very good and bipartisan way.

You see his lawyer there putting her hand on his shoulder, emphasizing he's a young man trying to draw that contrast, that he's not the shooter, the killer that he's been charged with being.And also interesting in court, there were four rows for the public and they were filled. They were waiting on line, just like the reporters, to get into the courtroom. The majority of them were women and young women, which is just interesting. You don't really know what to draw from that, although clearly there's -- this sensation about him. You see the people outside court protesting in favor of him in a sense, which you don't usually see when someone is facing such serious charges. Also, even the fact that we saw these images and the video of him, that is something that hasn't happened in the New York state court system in at least a decade, going back to when Dominique Strauss- Kahn, the former head of the IMF, was charged with sexual assault. This charge was ultimately dropped. But that was the last time that people I've talked to can remember there being cameras and broadcasts from the courtroom in New York. So, a real rare glimpse into this, which is fascinating given the public fascination around him. And obviously the high profile nature of this alleged assault.",

Mark, Mangione enters a not guilty plea. Not unexpected. What kind of work does his defense team now had ahead of have ahead of them? And what do you see as their options? MARK O'MARA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Well, a lot of options are coming up. First, of course, we had that first track, which is the forensic or evidence focused track, which is can they prove he did it? It seems that what we have seen so far, the strong case is there for the state, because we have the forensic evidence. We have some DNA evidence, we have fingerprint evidence, video evidence. And it looks as though they've put together a very strong case. But of course, the defense team still has to attack that chip away at it. Whether or not it was done properly. But at the same time, the track that they really have to focus on is the mental health mitigation. If in fact he did it, which seems as though its a strong case, then the question is why? Because of potentially some mental health concerns. But an interesting third track that may be here that they're going to weave into it is can they carefully start blaming big industry, not for the shooting itself, but for maybe their clients obsession with what happened, and maybe start looking and feeling into people's, you know, disdain for big industry, big insurance in this case. And that may buy them a little bit of that mental health mitigation dynamic to it. It's going to be very interesting to see how the defense team weaves all that together.",

I was watching it very closely. It was happening during my show this morning. And then he's in the courtroom cameras again, talking to his attorney. You see him smiling at least one point.

CASEY JORDAN, CRIMINOLOGIST, ATTORNEY &amp; BEHAVIORAL ANALYST:  Gosh, I see confidence to the point of being smug or even indignant. But at the very least, he is unperturbed. Now that confidence can stem from a lot of things. It could, you know, as Mark just pointed out, I anticipate a mental health defense down the line. But is it that he is delusional and doesn't really understand, you know, how much serious trouble he is in? Or is he just confident because he is a child of wealth and privilege, and he's pretty sure that, you know, the attorneys that have been hired are going to do their best to get him out of this some way or the other?

I asked the Trump transition team and they declined to elaborate, but I did talk to several people in Trumps inner circle. And look, they said that this came out of left field for them as well, and they were caught off guard. It's not something that he campaigned on over the past year and a half.It's also not something that they have understood, have saw him talk about recently behind the scenes as well, and they don't really know where the origins of this come from. The one person did tell me, look, Trump dines regularly with friends and new acquaintances, and he's been entertaining business leaders and world leaders, and he gets ideas in his head. And then he quickly decides whether or not to act on that. So that could certainly be the case here. And another person told me he has been infatuated with taking steps to improve U.S. standing with trade, and this would certainly fall into that category. Now, there are a lot of specifics that are lacking here. How would Donald Trump go about seizing the Panama Canal through pressure through the military? This is a piece of land and a port that has been operated and controlled by the country of Panama since 1999, based on a treaty that the U.S. signed almost half a century ago. And unraveling that at this stage would be difficult.",

Here's why it's important. There -- there is a major player in the Panama Canal that's not Panama. It's China, right? So the Chinese control the two biggest ports at either end of the canal. In 2017, the Panamanians rejected the notion that they rejected Taiwan as a country. They sided with China. They recognized China. They signed the belt and road initiative with the Chinese in 2018, expanding their sphere of influence in an area which 70 percent of all traffic is U.S. traffic going through from one port to another through the Panama Canal. The treaty, which was signed, leaves an out for the United States that says if the neutrality of the canal is threatened, that we could take it back. You know how we do it? With the U.S. military. I don't know if anybody remembers Operation Just Cause, but we sent the U.S. military down there to kick some and oust the president and put a new president in. We did it within about like 24 hours. So we could do it. If I was the Panamanians, I wouldn't cozy up to the Chinese too much. If I was the Chinese, I wouldn't get too cute.",

So in that sense, it's not totally surprising. Where I do think he might run into trouble is that the Republican coalition now contains a lot of folks who have been Republican for a long time. They love fighting communists. They love going and fighting around the world. And a lot of new people who say, I don't really want to send American troops down to Panama, for instance, David. And so I do wonder, you know, how far can he push these negotiating tactics, knowing that when it comes to projecting American strength, there are pieces of the Republican coalition these days that say, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not interested in doing that.

First, President Niden had suspended federal executions when he came into office. There was a worry that with President-elect Trump coming back into office, that that could be reversed. And some advocacy groups had warned about executions en masse when that happened. And second, this is really Biden delivering on a campaign pledge. While he was a staunch supporter of the death penalty earlier in his political career, when he ran for president in 2020, he said that he was going to abolish it, in his words, because we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every single time -- Kate.",
