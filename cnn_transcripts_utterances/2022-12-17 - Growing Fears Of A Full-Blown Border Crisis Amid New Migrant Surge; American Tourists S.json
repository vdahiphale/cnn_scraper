Right now, cities along the southern border are bracing for an increase of migrants after a federal appeals court rejects a Republican-led challenge to keep Title 42 in place. That Trump-era policy allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants who crossed into the U.S. from Mexico, citing health concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. Well, the court ruling will allow the policy to end next week and set the stage for a challenge in the U.S. Supreme Court. But for many border cities, resources are already strained. In El Paso, Texas authorities are grappling with a surge of over 2,000 migrants daily. CNN's Ed Lavandera has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

During this meeting the committee will also be voting to release its final report which we're expecting to come out on Wednesday. Now, back to the criminal referrals, the Department of Justice will definitely take a look at whatever the committee sends over because the two sides have not really shared much since both investigations have been underway, particularly the DOJ will be interested in what evidence the committee has to back up these potential criminal charges. But some of these charges specifically relating to Trump have been out there previously. A federal judge has said that he believes that Donald Trump may have obstructed an official proceeding in an earlier court case involving the January 6th Committee. But just to take a step back here, a criminal referral from the January 6th Committee to the Department of Justice will largely be symbolic in nature because the Department of Justice already has ongoing criminal probes into January 6th. But if the members get up there on Monday and say definitively that they believe that their investigation, their 17-months-long investigation with over 1,000 witness interviews, specifically piecing together every minute-by-minute of Donald Trump's actions on the day of January 6th, if they say after all of that they believe they have evidence of Donald Trump committing a crime, that is a powerful closing message, Fredricka.",
