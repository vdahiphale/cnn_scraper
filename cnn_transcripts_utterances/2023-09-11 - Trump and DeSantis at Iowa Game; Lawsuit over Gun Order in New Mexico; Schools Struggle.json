      "sentences": "Politics and passing, glad handing on the gridiron, the ground game, the literal one, and the campaign one on full display in Iowa before this big college football matchup. Donald Trump stopped at a frat house before the Iowa/Iowa State game. While Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, he visited several tailgates. Both candidates then went to the game, with Trump, and I think you can hear it here, getting a bit of a mixed reception with both cheers and some boos.All right, with us now, Rhonda Colvin, senior political correspondent for \"The Washington Post,\" and Heather Caygle, managing editor for \"Punchbowl News.\" And, Heather, look, this was in Ames. If there is a blue area in Iowa left at this point, this is pretty blue. Still, Donald Trump goes to a game, gets booed. Ron DeSantis, down in the crowd, shaking hands with people. What were the dynamics at play there? HEATHER CAYGLE, MANAGING EDITOR, \"PUNCHBOWL NEWS\": Yes, John, I mean, I think the boos I'm not too worried about. Like you said, this is a pretty Democratic-leaning city in an overall red state, right. But I did think it was so interesting that former President Trump was up in the suite, kind of above it all during the game, and then Ron DeSantis, like you said, was down mingling in the crowd, taking selfies with potential supporters. He also sat with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, which I think is really important to point out. She has said that previously that she's not going to endorse in the primary, but then more recently we've seen her leave herself a little bit of wiggle room in case she does choose to do so. President Trump and his supporters have went after her for not immediately backing him. So, I think the fact that DeSantis was hanging out with the Iowa governor, which was also really, really interesting. And just the two of them. Trump is above -- he's leading double digits in these polls, so maybe he can afford to be in the suite, whereas Ron DeSantis is really trying to play catch up here. So he really needs to be out with these, you know, fans and crowd and kind of get people to know who he is and get to know them better.",

The governor also cited the deaths of two other children in the past couple of months and two mass shootings in the state earlier in the summer.Now, New Mexico has about the third worst rate of gun fatalities in the nation. The governor says that, listen, when it gets to a point where New Mexicans are afraid to be out in crowds, afraid to take their kids to school, afraid to leave a baseball game, then, quote, \"something is very wrong.\" So, there are now metrics. And if an area reaches certain grim stats, then these new orders kick in. Take a listen to the governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM (D-NM): We have far too many ER gunshot visits and we have far too many crimes involving firearms. We are suspending open and concealed carry. The purpose is to try to create a cooling off period while we figure out how we can better address public safety and gun violence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so more schools are now having to get creative.Look, we visited Lancaster, Texas, where the public school district has turned to doubling up some classes, fifty kids in the room, because there's only one certified teacher available at that time. They are also moving some courses online. They've contracted dozens of classes with a virtual learning company, including an algebra class that we sat in on that was being led by a teacher a state away, over in Louisiana. And we've heard from several of those online learning companies that told me, more and more districts across the country are now turning to those programs because of the shortage. And the impact of those band-aid solutions is really being felt right now by students and the districts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, one in 10 teacher positions are either vacant or filled by someone uncertified for that subject according to the Learning Policy Institute. And at least 23 states, Sara, have lowered certification standards to get teachers into classrooms more quickly.
