And that's where they a found that these routine childhood vaccinations like the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, or like the polio virus vaccine, these will have prevented, like you said, more than 500 million illnesses, about 32 million hospitalizations, and more than 1 million deaths. This is all within a child's lifetime.And the researchers even took their analysis further to say with these prevented hospitalizations, illnesses, and deaths, that would have resulted in a direct cost savings of about $540 billion in medical costs and even more than $2 trillion in indirect savings like societal impacts, like if a parent has to stay home from work to take care of a sick child. So the researchers say this shows the benefits of routine vaccinations. And right now, we're heading back to school. This is a good reminder for parents to make sure their children are up-to-date on their routine vaccinations.",

It's clear now that he is worried that, despite polls showing this to be a very close race, tied or Harris slightly ahead nationally, that there might be a larger swell of support that modern-day polling is not picking up.

Twenty- four years of service is significant. It's way beyond the point at which you get your retirement benefits at 20.And he left not to vacation or because he wanted to pursue some business angle. He went back to public service. In fact, his example, his lifetime example is one that is inspiring, in my view. And this deprecation of his military service, first of all, it's unfounded.

It is essentially the same structure of defence and assistance that we've given to the Israelis since the beginning of this terrible episode on October 7th.

They want to try to undermine the campaign of former President Donald Trump and they want to try to sort of generally sow social discord within the United States and what Microsoft has done here in this report is give us two concrete examples of how they're doing this.What we have seen from Microsoft is that there are at least two fake websites made by -- allegedly made by Iranian operatives, one of which is sort of targeting more conservative leaning voters and one of which is targeting sort of more Democratic leaning voters. One of these fake news websites calls an out directly, calls and I will quote directly, calls former President Donald Trump an \"opioid- pilled elephant in the MAGA China shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\" Another fake Iran created website targeting more conservative-leaning voters, claims to be a news site out of Savannah, Georgia that is a \"trusted source for Conservative news\" and it really focuses on LGBTQ issues and gender reassignment. Microsoft has also, in this report, revealed an attempt by Iranian operatives to try to hack the email account of a senior campaign official with an unnamed campaign. We don't know which campaign this is. CNN has reached out to the Harris campaign, they have said that they have not been notified of any effort to target them in this way. The Trump campaign hasn't responded to requests from comment from CNN. But Kate, I really think what this report demonstrates is really the proliferation of foreign actors that have kind of taken a leaf out of Russia's playbook in the 2016 election to try to use social media and the internet to try to influence American voters and to try to just sort of generally amplify discord inside the United States and weaken America that way. Now, we should note that Microsoft has emphasized that neither of these websites appear to have gained any traction, but that could change. Microsoft officials saying that this is Iran really kind of laying the groundwork with contentious issues to sort of ramp up their efforts to meddle in the election going into November. And important to note also that intelligence officials have long said that while they contract the efforts and the intent behind foreign governments who are attempting to interfere in American politics in this way, including Iran, China, and of course Russia, what they can't measure is the influence on American voters. Does it actually change any votes -- Kate.",
