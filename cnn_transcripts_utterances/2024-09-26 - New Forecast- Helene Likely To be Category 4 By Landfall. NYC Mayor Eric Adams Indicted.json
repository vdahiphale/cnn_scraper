And we're going to start this hour with breaking news in a brand new forecast for Hurricane Helene, which is now expected to slam into the U.S. today as a, quote, \"extremely dangerous category for hurricane.\" Helene is still gaining strength as a barrel sports Florida. It's among the largest storms in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 100 years.Any moment, we're going to get an update on storm preparations in the early impact in Florida with Governor Ron DeSantis. We're going to bring that to you live. We're going to start with CNN's Elisa Raffa in the hurricane headquarters. Elisa, walk us through the new forecast. What are they saying?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we have a Category 3 hurricane on our hands right now with 125 mile per hour winds. I point that out because a Category 4 hurricane starts at 130 mile per hour winds, so we're really talking about a difference of five to 10 miles per hour here, right? So right now it's a very high end Category 3 teetering on that Category 4, which is why the National Hurricane Center is saying, hey, look, it's still sitting over very warm ocean waters right now. It has all the ingredients it needs to strengthen. So there's really not much to stop it from gaming that five miles per hour that it needs to just get to that category and become a Category 4.Either way, whether it's this high end Category 3 or it makes that five mile per hour difference to a Category 4, we're still talking about the same catastrophic, unsurvivable impacts when it comes to the storm surge and the heavy rain and everything else we've been talking about. The radar, you can see, again, still with the outer bands that have been lashing all day, finding winds, sustained winds at 50 miles per hour right now in Fort Myers, 32 miles per hour in Key West. Here's the look at the latest track, again, still in the same spot for the Big Bend area, just to the Easter of Apalachicola. Again, with this high end Category 3, possibly teetering on this category for the hurricane warning stretching towards Macon, and then that blues, all the tropical storm warnings. Because again, the storm is incredibly wide, 400 miles, stretching all of these damaging, catastrophic winds possible that could really wipe out some of the power. Here's a look at the storm surge. Again, still 15 to 20 feet. This isn't going to change whether it's that high end Category 3 or that low end Category 4. It's those impacts that matter. When you have the ocean just rising 20 feet of it with destructive wave isn't coming in, that's going to do damage. That's the unsurvivable part that people need to escape and need to evacuate from. Again, it's a very wide storm. It's really topping the list of some of the largest as far as breath and width of it. And that's why we're really worried about the span of power outages, not just for Florida, with the hurricane force winds that could be catastrophic in the Big Bend, but look at the tropical storm force winds again, that stretch into Georgia where we're worried about widespread power outages even into the Carolinas. And I don't want us to forget about the rain part of this. The rain doesn't care what category it is. That rain is going to squeeze out no matter what. We've got that high end risk for rain, heavy rain from Asheville down to Tallahassee. Officials in Asheville are actually asking people to evacuate because they are worried about more than a foot of rain, maybe approaching two feet in the mountainous area, numerous landslides, and you have a high risk like this. It's only issued 4 percent of the time, but it's responsible for 40 percent of our fatalities and 80 percent of our flood damages. Again, some of this rain up in the western Carolinas will be over a foot. And again, in a mountainous terrain, they're worried about landslides that could be unprecedented. The weather service they're really calling it an event that people there have never seen before, not since 1916. And again, this rain will squeeze out no matter what the category is. Jake.",

That is where Helene will make a direct hit. But the storm is expected to pass directly over where I am in Tallahassee, and it would be the first storm they've seen on record to hit Tallahassee as a full force hurricane. And as it approaches a Category 4, you can imagine easily, only 20 miles inland, it could still be a Category 2 storm, very powerful as it passes over this city population, some 200,000 with all kinds of trees, Jake.The county administrator warned me that they expect 1000s of trees to come down, hundreds of roads to be closed. And what's happening right now is really last minute preparation, or I should say, staging. The preparation has happened now. People are just waiting at the hotel that we're hiding behind right now for shelter. Inside this hotel, firefighters from Miami who have come up to be on call for tomorrow, just in case they're needed to go to the hospitals, to evacuate them, if the power is out, if they're flooded, if there are trees down. [17:05:08] We saw power companies lining the roads, the highways, in and out of Tallahassee overnight staging to try to get that power up when it inevitably goes down in these overnight hours. Again, this storm is moving quickly, about 20 miles per hour, which means it won't have time to weaken as it passes over land, which is why it will hit Tallahassee. It's expected to so hard and still be a hurricane when it crosses just north of us into Georgia, millions of people, Jake, in its path.",

It's really difficult for you to make out because it's on my left here, but the water from the bay at this point is just pouring into this street that we're standing on, and that's why you're seeing kind of all of this water that is just rushing in this one direction. It is clearly going in the same way that the wind is blowing out here. It has not stopped for the better part of the last couple of hours. This is the worst weather that we have seen here in Pinellas County, and we've been here since about 06A quick look at the radar, Jake, and we can see that the storm is just to the southwest of us. It is going to stay to the west of us when it continues its path north. And so this right now is probably some of the worst weather that we're going to see. And it's this kind of flooding that really has emergency officials concerned when we're talking about Hillsborough County, which is over in the Tampa and the Tampa Bay area, and then Pinellas County, which is home to St. Pete and St. Petersburg, as well as Clearwater. All of this is happening, all of this wind is hitting, all of this rain is falling, and we're still not quite hitting the storm surge that is expected with this hurricane, even though it's not going to hit direct here, we're talking about anywhere between five to eight feet, and that's going to take place well into the night, well into midnight, and around one in the morning when high tide hits. Again, Jake, since the last time we spoke to you, the water from the bay out here is just pouring in where we're standing right now is just becoming a parking lot flooded. Folks really have not been out here for a good part of the afternoon, thankfully, because earlier this afternoon, folks really thought that things weren't going to be as bad as they are, and they were out here taking a look at how things were exactly.

This area, I'll tell you, really floods no matter how close a hurricane gets. This is a 30-year in a row that our team from Miami has covered a hurricane from this one location. Two years ago, we covered Hurricane Ian from here, the storm hit to the south, this area flooded.Last year we came to cover Hurricane Idalia, the storm ended up hitting way to the north up in like Perry, Florida, this area flooded. In both of those cases, the hurricane stayed offshore, didn't really have a direct impact in the Pinellas County or the Hillsborough area. But even with that being the case, there's just nowhere for all of this water to go. And so as that storm pushes through, what it does is it pushes all of that bay water, all of the Gulf water, into some of this low lying area, and then you add in the wind, and you add in the rain, and this is what happens, it all just -- when it comes together and you add in high tide, there's nowhere for this water to go. You used to be able to, in fact, George, if you can, you might be able to make out the one car over here that's probably doing the one thing that folks don't want you to do, which is drive in this kind of flooding.

Me, personally, I don't think we should be cutting funding from education, from libraries, from parks and sanitation. We differ on those things. But again, there's no denying the fact that I have constituents coming into my office where it's taking them the -- the HRA, you know, our government three months to process food stamp benefits that people are losing apartments because their housing vouchers are expiring before the government is able to do their end of -- of the bargain.It's the difference between people being hungry and homeless and people being fed and sheltered.

And the other flip side of the coin is and the mayor himself has -- has been on record saying these things because he is a former NYPD officer. You know, he -- he self describes as a law and order guy.Typically, when things happen in our city, high profile things he'll say, hey, if the cops made an arrest, that person did something wrong, right? There a bad guy. Public defender here, again, innocent until proven guilty, due process, but in no way are we saying that this is politically motivated. And it's just not how these investigations work. You know, they take a lot of time. They -- they -- they get the subpoenas signed by judges. They have to allocate and -- and convene a lot of different evidence. And I'm telling you that indictment document is pretty detailed.",
