Exactly three weeks before Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in two critical battleground states. Harris is in Detroit, Michigan. She is just moments away from a big interview there in a town hall-style talk with radio host Charlamagne Tha God. Harris is trying to shore up support among Black voters, especially men. Meanwhile, Trump is on his way to battleground Georgia, where early voting started today. He's going to take a town hall with an all- female audience in the next hour and then hold another campaign event this evening. But the former president has already made a lot of headlines today, as he took questions at the Economic Club of Chicago. And the topics ranged from the economy to global affairs. Trump is even asked which state he thinks will decide the November election.

We have tried to ask him these questions at various press conferences about his tariff plan. He has usually ignored those questions or he's having friendly interviews in which he doesn't answer questions about the tariffs, and just a reminder, he has called for massive tariffs to the point where economists say would actually hurt the economy and cause more inflation.Today was the first time he was actually pushed on that. Now, of course, it's Donald Trump. So he was able to evade a lot of these questions or answered in broad terms, but having him actually try to be accountable for those tariffs. He mostly just said, you're wrong. They're wrong. But again, it was the first time he had been pushed on it. Now the other thing that was interesting saying and not surprising as we've heard it before, is he refused to commit to accepting the election results in 2024 and to a peaceful transfer of power.

She also talks about crypto currency as well.So there's an acknowledgment that these policies would resonate with Black men, but also more Americans broadly. And what we hear from the vice president in Democratic surrogates is, listen, the former president may be appealing to some Black men, a marginal faction of Black men, though that margin could be consequential in an election based on this machismo. Ultimately, it is her that is going to deliver policies that most resonate and speak to those communities. I'm also curious to see how she talks about immigration tonight. It no doubt will come up because it comes up on the Breakfast Club on Charlamagne's show, and I don't know how satisfying it is going to be for her to sort of repeat that same sort of rehearsed response about the former president squashing the bipartisan border enforcement bill. I think that she's going to have to grapple with some of the misinformation that we hear among some Black voters about immigrants ration about services that undocumented immigrants are getting. And I've asked the campaign about this as well. So curious to see how much this moves the needle tonight, but we he know that the campaign is very focused on Black men and making her case to them.",

On June 25th, I went back and looked at the polling before Joe Biden got out of the race, Trump was at 25. So it's actually Mr. Trump who's lost half of his black support. The Harris campaign has work to do. There's no doubt about it. So it's a great idea to go on \"The Breakfast Club\" or have Charlamagne Tha God host your town hall meeting. The guy from \"The Breakfast Club\" is just terrific. I think it's a great idea. You have to earn those votes. Democrats are often accused, I think rightly of taking black voters for granted.

I think that is perhaps a greater concern for the Harris-Walz campaign, than perhaps maybe the 15 percent point that the former president may get, which is an increase is certainly should not be ignored. I mean, I think Republicans it may have an opportunity in the long run to appeal to not only black men, but Hispanic men, as well as we have seen, men writ large over the past eight years now so too slowly move away from the Democratic Party. The Republican Party, I think has to do a little bit more. But as it pertains to Black men, I think the vice president has a lot of work to do, releasing a plan, I read through it. I thought there were some good points in there. I don't really view some of the issues that she's attempting to focus on through a partisan or ideological lens.
