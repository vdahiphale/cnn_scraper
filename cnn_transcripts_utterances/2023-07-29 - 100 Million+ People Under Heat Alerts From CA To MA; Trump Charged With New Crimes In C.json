Phoenix marked its 29th consecutive day of over 110 degrees. The Medical Examiner's office in Phoenix in fact is bringing in refrigerated containers in anticipation of a possible overflow of heat-related deaths.And with high temperature scorching in the Northeast, New York City's mayor is sounding the alarm about its deadly potential. Cooling centers and public pools in the region are offering extended hours to help residents stay safe.

Of course, turn off the air when you're leaving your home. All of this, of course is to avoid the potential for blackouts.That's the last thing we want here in New York. And another thing we should note about New Yorkers, we are in an ideal spot because there are trees, there is shade, there is green grass. But New York is one of those cities where it's an urban hotspot, the temperature can be 10 degrees warmer than in other parts of the region because of all the concrete. The asphalt. Areas that don't have a lot of trees and grass. And that is why you're finding a lot of folks gravitating to spots like this, as I said, in and out of water fountains.

These two new obstruction charges stem from allegations that Trump and these two Mar-a-Lago employees not only tried to delete this surveillance video, but also that Trump himself is the one who requested that it'd be deleted because he wanted to block a grand jury from getting access to it. Now this grand jury is the one who's investigating his handling of classified documents.And the indictment itself really paints a picture and makes the case that prosecutors say Trump was the one who led the way and was directing this effort to obstruct the probe into his handling of classified documents. I want to point this one specific part of the indictment that really makes this point clear. It's a conversation between one of those two Mar-a-Lago employees, Carlos De Oliveira and another employee. And Oliveira makes very clear. He says, look, \"The boss wanted the server deleted.\" And the boss, obviously there, De Oliveira seems to be referring to Donald Trump himself. So, prosecutors really laying out a comprehensive case as to why Trump and these two employees engaged in effectively a cover up and why all three should be charged active participants in that.

It's a sea drone, and it is something that Ukraine is now using to target Russia increasingly, in the Black Sea. Take a look.

Wars out into the open water under the control of this pilot who asked we don't show his face, callsign Shark. This is Ukraine's latest sea or surface drone designed to attack Russia in the Black Sea. They've never been shown to the public before. This model is armed with 300 kilograms or almost 700 pounds of explosive and can hit a target 800 kilometers 500, miles away. They're very easy to control, Shark tells us. And they have severely limited the Russian Navy's movements. Ukraine sends it see drones out hunting plowing through the waves if spotted the Russian ships frantically open fire. Sometimes the Russians get lucky and manage to take them out. Other times the drones break through the hail of bullets and reach their targets. Last October, Ukrainian sea drones carried out a stunning attack on the homeport of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Russian-occupied Crimea, targeting the flagship, the Admiral Makorov.

Russia has extensive air defense equipment, they have extensive electronic warfare, just like every time the Russians send all kinds of ballistic missiles toward the Ukraine. We're getting daily reports that they are shut down. When you're talking about long-range systems going over a border, you have to address that kind of electronic warfare and air defense systems.And many of the systems the United States are sending are multimillion-dollar rockets, ballistic missiles. And they are, you know, truthfully, there are different techniques that can be used by other types of weapons systems. Everyone is screaming for attacking missiles, but those missiles go straight up in the air, have a ballistic signature and then head toward a target. They can easily be knocked down by air defense systems or jammed by electronic warfare system. The same as Ukraine is doing to many of the Russian ballistic missiles. So it's a tradeoff of what kind of equipment do you really need right now, as Ukraine is maneuvering on the main defensive belts? Are you looking at long-range targets that you can hit with things like Storm Shadow missiles, which run nap of the earth and go closer to the ground and aren't as affected by air defense systems?",

And with Dragon's Teeth on the other side, those are the white obstacles further down on the screen.Beyond that there are minefields. So, when you have to attack those kinds of positions, which are very difficult to do, you need obscuration, you need suppression of the Russian forces and their long-range weapon systems. You need counter fire on their artillery units, and you need massing of equipment. Ukraine is facing in Russia along a 600-kilometer front, they are trying to choose the places of the attack the places of the maneuver and they are doing that by basically breaching some of these defensive lines, four different defensive lines that the Russians have had six months to in place. So this is going to be a very difficult challenge to Ukraine. It's going to take a very long time.",
