All right, if you clicked into CNN 10 last week, you`ll remember it was a big week for the United Nations. The General Assembly held its annual summit in New York.

He also asked countries to commit to timelines to phase out fossil fuel emissions. Significantly increase financial help so that low-and middle-income countries can move to clean energy and invest in climate resilience measures to better cope with increasingly severe extreme weather events.

Think you know the rules pretty well? What about this piece of cardboard? Nope. Does Finnish jam jar? Wrong again. This greasy pizza box? Yes and no. This one`s tricky. Some local authorities accept this for recycling but others don`t because they count grease as food contamination. So it`s not as simple as you might think. All these items are made from materials that can be recycled but there`s a few golden rules to remember. If an item has food residue on it, then it can`t go into the recycling, rinsed at first. It`s the same for mixed materials like sticky tape on cardboard. You should remove it before you recycle. When something`s thrown into recycling that shouldn`t be there, it can contaminate the entire system. This recycling plant in East London sorts more than 400 tons of waste a day.",

So the first is the scrunch test for things likecrisp packets or wrapping paper, which are often mixed with other materials. If you crush it in your hand and it stays scrunched, it`s probably recyclable. If it starts to open, it probably needs to go in the trash. If you can tip the item upside down, maybe even over your head, and nothing comes out, you`re good. If not, rinse it again.
