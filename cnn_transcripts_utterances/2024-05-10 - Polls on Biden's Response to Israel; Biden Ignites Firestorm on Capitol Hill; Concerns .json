RFK Jr. is getting eight. Donald Trump way down here at four. But if you dislike Biden, if you disapprove of the job he's doing on the Israel-Gaza war, look at this, he's getting just 50 percent of that vote. My goodness, gracious. These are people who voted for him last time. RFK Jr. is getting 20 percent. This is just a 30-point margin compared to a 79 point margin among those who approve of Biden on the Israel-Gaza war.

He's trying as hard as he can to limit civilian casualties. The - the - my problem with all of this is those lovely politicians you just show, they're just playing politics, OK. There's real lives at stake. There's one president, and he is pursuing America's national interests. He's defending Israel, helping it - helping them to take out Hamas, but also trying to protect innocent lives in Gaza. That's not an easy thing to do. Of course you're going to get static from both sides. But as a political advisor, as a substantive matter, I'm glad Joe Biden's in charge and not - not the guy who quotes - not quote, who favorably comments about Adolf Hitler. According to a new book, Mr. Trump has said that - that, wait, let me get the quote right, \"well, Hitler did a lot of good things,\" says Mr. Trump. So, I'm really glad he's not there. I'm really glad that Joe Biden is. But, politically, you know, this is not driving voting behavior. This is not. The Harvard poll of young people, where he's really got a problem, Joe does, it's the 15th issue out of 16 asked. The ABC poll that came out this week, it was the tenth issue out of ten issues asked. Biden's got a lot of political problems. But Israel's not at the top of them. His substantive matter - I'm glad he's spending a lot of time, and I think he's doing it just right.",

So you have one side, the Republicans, many of whom are opposed to continuing U.S. military support and financial support to Ukraine, and the Democrats who are - who are generally supportive of it. So, along those battle lines you have the possibility of Russian - the Russians being incentivized to actually intervene in a way that would help Republicans who would be adverse to additional Ukraine aid if - if elected, and to hinder the prospects of Democrats.So, the general motivations are always there.
