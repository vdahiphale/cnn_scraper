But the big story today, Bianna, on the campaign trail is this weather. It is expected to snow in Iowa heavily in just a few hours. Nikki Haley forced to cancel a campaign event today. Vivek Ramaswamy forced a shift, as well. Surrogates for former President Donald Trump, who were supposed to be flying in today, they can't make it.

But the looming snow is presenting a challenge. They were all out though in full force over the weekend. Governor DeSantis, Nikki Haley -- what we're hearing from them is really a shift in strategy. They are really sharpening their attacks against the front-runner, former President Donald Trump, leaning into an electability argument, trying to convince Iowans that they would be better suited to go up against President Biden in the fall. For his part, though, Trump's saying to his supporters, don't take these polls, too seriously. Don't put too much stock in them.

      "sentences": "Well, not much, Zain. We really haven't gotten very satisfying answers from the Pentagon over thelast few days. The reason that they are giving as of right now for why Senior National Security Officials and the White House were not notified until Thursday of last week, three days into Secretary Austin's hospital stay, is because the person who would be charged with doing so, Secretary Austin's Chief of Staff, was actually out sick. Now, we have asked repeatedly whether there was no one else available in Austin's inner circle who could have made this notification and he does not only have a staff of one, as everyone knows, and so we are awaiting response from the Pentagon on that question. But broadly, this is really creating a lot of frustration inside the Pentagon with officials calling it an unforced error. The secrecy surrounding this hospitalization was simply not necessary, according to many current and former officials we have spoken to. Secretary Austin is a deeply private person, and he, of course, has the right to keep his medical conditions private, including the original surgery that he had done on December 22nd that led to these complications. But where officials say the problems kind of arose here is when he entered the hospital on January 1st. And you can see the timeline there, and he was taken to the intensive care unit and still no one was notified, not even his Deputy Secretary of Defense, who had to assume some of his responsibilities while she was actually not even in Washington, D.C. She was out -- she was in Puerto Rico on vacation. And she was not notified until January 4th that he was actually in the hospital. So, there are just so many questions now about why the secrecy, whether some processes need to change surrounding the notification process to up the chain of command, of course, to the President himself who did not find out until days later. And the Pentagon and the White House now say that they are reviewing all of them.",

He was my commander in combat, and I consider him a friend, and I think he considers me that way, too. He is an extremely private person, as your reporter just said. But what I'd also say is very introverted. He does not like to bother people with his concerns, with his problems. He's been, in my view, a great Secretary of Defense, and he's done exceedingly well at the job. This was a blunder on his part. Any Commander knows that they should let their boss know if something's happening. But I think he is probably going to pull the Pentagon Press Corps together as soon as he's released from the hospital and tell them exactly what happened. He is not going to discuss his procedure or what happened, but he is going to tell them, take responsibility, he will take responsibility for the actions and explain some of the details that there's a lot of speculation about right now. In my view, I'm one of those who thinks this has been blown way out of proportion. I've been seeing a lot of people suggest different things, that he should be fired, that he should resign. In my view, that's a little bit over the top. The Secretary made a mistake. He admitted he made the mistake. But also, he has the right to privacy.

And Prime Minister Netanyahu is visiting the troops in Lebanon today, and he made a statement that's being reported in Israeli newspapers, quote, \"We will do anything to bring security back to the North.\" He says that Hezbollah thinks that Israel is weakened since 2006, and he says we will show them that's not the case. That's troubling in my view, but I think Israel has certainly faced their enemy on a two-front war over the last several months. It's just that we've mostly been focused on what's been happening in Gaza.

Well, for the Republicans,meantime, the focus is on Iowa, a mostly rural state with very conservative voters that will hold caucuses, if you can believe it, in exactly one week. It is sometimes said that Iowa cannot win you the nomination, but it can lose it for you. Ron DeSantis has staked his campaign on a strong showing in Iowa. He needs to be at least somewhat competitive with Donald Trump there, but the former president seems very confident that won't happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, it's -- he's the leader and there's nothing wrong that he can do. He can stand up and say John McCain, you know, can't raise his arm. He can say that he would have negotiated. I mean, the silliest thing, he would say, if he was the President in the Civil War, he would have negotiated an end to the Civil War. I mean, he's a clown, but the problem is, is his base just takes everything he says is gospel. And so, I don't think there's going to be any surprises out of Iowa, probably not out of New Hampshire.

His strategy of anchoring his campaign on his falsehood that he won the 2020 election, which is all at the heart of two of his four looming criminal trials, and his explicit calls for retribution have helped him make him the strongest front-runner for a presidential nomination in years.\" As somebody who sat there and was part of the January 6th Committee, just days after that anniversary, are you surprised by the amount of support he's continued to wield focusing on this main issue?",
