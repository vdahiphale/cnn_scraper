Katie Ledecky, seven time Olympic gold medal winner, who was beaten in this event in Tokyo three years ago by Ariane Titmus. She, though, has been exchanging world records in this event with 17-year-old Summer McIntosh over the last couple of years. This is a real moment we will see the three of them go head to head. Also, an emotional, you expect, return for U.S. swimmer Caeleb Dressel. He's had a really tough couple of years since Tokyo, talking about the pressure he was putting himself under. But he's expected to be back with the men's hundred meter freestyle in the relay tonight.

And we reverted very rapidly back into attacks on the other candidates and trying to frame Harris as being incompetent, making fun of her. But on the part of J.D. Vance taking some swipes at women, which are not smart and will be very interesting to see how Donald Trump reacts to that. But this is a very short time. It hasn't even been a full week. The fact that the gap has closed between Harris and Trump. But she is polling, if you look at one poll of 18- to 34 year olds, it was 60 percent Harris and 40 percent Trump.

I mean, what did you make of what she said and the different approach she may take to the Middle East? VINJAMURI:  She's certainly taking a different approach. She made it very clear. She recognized on multiple points the suffering of Palestinians, the images that are being seen. She also recognized the profound distress to families and the community, having hostages held by Hamas. But she is a presidential candidate soon to be with a nomination that is not going to portray this as a one-sided conflict and is really pushing hard on the need for a ceasefire to get the hostages home and to end the suffering of Palestinians. And remember, she was sent during -- just before October 7th on a tour of university campuses, again, intended to really inspire young voters. We know that young voters have a different perspective on Israel and Palestine, that there's been a lot of division over this war, even amongst those who support a state of Israel. They don't support the policies of Netanyahu. A lot of Netanyahu's people don't support his policies. So she really is moving to a position that is reflective of many people in the United States and around the world. That's still a shift and an important one in the context of U.S. elected officials. And she will get -- and we've seen this -- she will get heat from that in the political classes. But again, when it comes to voters, I think that she's tapping into some very important sentiments and feelings. Especially amongst young voters and those Arab American voters in Michigan that we talked about. So there are a lot of constituencies. She's really, Kamala Harris, trying to expand the base of voters who feel committed to and passionate and feel like they're policies, their values are represented.

Some of that confusion was fueled by FBI director Christopher Wray's testimony to Congress earlier this week. Trump announced Friday that he'll return to Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot, for a, quote, \"big and beautiful rally.\" One of Mexico's most notorious drug lords is now in U.S. custody, thanks to the help of El Chapo's son.
