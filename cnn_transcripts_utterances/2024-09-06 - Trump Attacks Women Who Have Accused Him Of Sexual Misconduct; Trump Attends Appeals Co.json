      "sentences": "Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS. I'm Dana Bash, and we are following breaking news. You are looking at live pictures of Trump Tower where Donald Trump is speaking to reporters, which he has been doing for more than a half an hour at this time.After leaving a New York City courtroom where his lawyers are pushing federal appeals panel to throw out the jury verdict that found him liable of sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. His focus so far has been attacking Carroll, and not just Carroll, other -- several other women who have accused him of sexual assault or sexual misconduct over the past several decades. He has been attacking them and their stories one by one. I am lucky to be surrounded by legal and political experts, CNN's Paula Reid and Elliot Williams, as well as Kristen Holmes and Jeff Zeleny. We're going to monitor this and go back in because I really feel that it's important for our viewers to hear some of the way that he is talking and continuing to talk as we speak, because we have the benefit, as I said, of fact checkers and people to put everything in context. Let's just start with -- again, this is about E. Jean Carroll. He did not have to be at this hearing. He wanted to be there. He wanted to be there to come out and to talk to reporters, which he is doing right now. But he is not just making this about E. Jean Carroll. He is bringing up, unilaterally, one by one, stories of women who allege that he made unwanted sexual advances and more to towards them. Let's just give you one example, one snippet of what we have been hearing from the Republican candidate for president, a former president who wants the job back again. He's been talking about this kind of thing for more than a half an hour. Here's an example. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She said, in 1979 I was in an airplane with her, commercial flight, and we became very intimate, and she said I was making out with her. And then after 15 minutes, and then she changed her story a couple of times. Maybe it was quicker that I grabbed her at a certain part, and that was when she had enough. Now, so think of the impracticality of this. I'm famous. I'm in a plane. People are coming into the plane. And I'm looking at a woman, and I grab her, and I start kissing her and making out with her. What are the chances of that happening? What are the chances? And frankly, I know you're going to say, it's a terrible thing to say, but it couldn't have happened. It didn't happen, and she would not have been the chosen one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is Donald Trump, two months out from a campaign where women are trying to decide who to vote for, particularly in the suburbs of key swing states. And he is going one by one against women who have made allegations against him, and not only denying them which is his right to do but impugning them and suggesting that they would not be worthy of his advances.This in particular is Jessica Leeds, who in 2016 alleged that Donald Trump made unwanted advantage -- advances to her on a plane in the 1970s. And again, as you just heard, Donald Trump denied that. I won't get into all of the details here. I just want to talk about -- and by the way, we're monitoring this because he is still going off right now in this event. Kristen Holmes, you talk to Trump sources all day long. Can you explain how they thought that this was a good idea for him to be doing, or the measures that they clearly unsuccessfully took to stop him from having this kind of event?",

He wants to just talk and talk and talk and claim that he is the victim, and that is something we have seen time and time again.So, is this how they thought it was going to play out? No. Did anyone think this was a good idea in this, likely not. I'm not in touch with them right this second. They're all in the room with him. As we saw, his aides are flanking him in that Trump Tower press conference right now. But this is not what they told me he was going to be doing today.",

Jean Carroll case, which is part of their appeal.Forgive me for my voice. I'm obviously losing it. Jeff Zeleny, I just want to say on the politics of this. How is this kind of rambling discussion about allegations of women against him. No matter if this is part of a legal strategy in a court of appeals or not in the court of public opinion on the campaign trail. How is this not a gift to Kamala Harris?",

Voters out there are deciding upon this election. I mean, the sliver of voters who have -- who are still undecided are likely not to be swayed by anything shocking that the former president has done.I mean, who could sort of get beyond the shock factor of what happened in 2016. I mean, in the final -- I think back eight years ago, really right now, during this point of the campaign, we all thought that -- or so many people thought that, you know, this was going to be politically devastating and dooming for him. It was not. So, look, I think at this point, what I am more sort of intrigued by is how focused is he on the race at hand. He is very much in the middle of a very, very competitive race, a different race than he thought he would have. And what does this do to sort of advance his fight against Vice President Harris. It does nothing. So, I'm not sure if it hurts him with his supporters. It doesn't, obviously, but you know, all this is fodder for the debate next week, but something has rattled him without question, and Vice President Harris is at this very moment. She's a debate camp in Pittsburgh, preparing for the biggest moment in the campaign next Tuesday. BASH: Now Paula, I do want to, of course, touch on the reason that he went voluntarily to this hearing -- at this first appeals hearing. And talk about the case in general, because there were two E. Jean Carroll cases. And I'll just put up on the screen. And I want to bring you in for our viewers, what we're talking about. In this case, the jury awarded $5 million in damages. He was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Trump said the evidence, as we've been talking about, allow -- was allowed that shouldn't -- should have been excluded. A decision was not expected before -- the decision for the appeal is not expected before the election actually hold that thought. We have Kara Scannell, who was inside the courtroom today. Kara, describe what you saw in that hearing?",

And this morning, this was probably number three on the list of biggest stories that I'm covering.He is bringing the attention to her and to this case, relitigating this in the court of public opinion. This is his choice. This has been their plan for a while. He is not attending most of his legal hearings, because we know, there's a lot going on in his legal portfolio, but I was told he will attend certain appeals. And I asked why. They said, look, they're important to him. But the fact of the matter is, Dana, any minute he is going to get some really serious legal news. And that is an answer on whether he will or will not be sentenced in his New York criminal case before the election. That is serious. And yesterday, he got some really bad news from Judge Tanya Chutkan that were never received before seen evidence in the January 6 case, will likely be released before the election. So, he has some really damaging potentially events happening on his legal calendar. So, the fact that he's spending all his time, all of this energy, all of this oxygen on E. Jean Carroll, it's a choice. Clearly, it's a poor one personally, potentially politically, but it may also just distract him from the really serious things he could be facing over the next 48 hours.",

Again, it's Donald Trump, so it's as much focus as you're going to get from the former president. But it is certainly not this.

We know from covering politics that the biggest currency in a campaign is the candidate's time. Well now, she doesn't necessarily have to be beholden to these big glitzy fundraisers. She can spend that money on rallies or in community, doing smaller campaign events.So, the campaign likes where they are on that front. They do believe that they are well positioned, and they are touting that a lot of this money is from small donors. People who are newly engaged in the process. So how are they going to use all of this money? We're going to see a lot of it on TV and digital advertising. They're also going to use it to shore up campaign staff and shore up the field offices that they have across the country.

They can kind of take their foot off the gas on that -- on that line of scheduling. But can you just again, put into context this money and what it actually means when you're trying to get votes.

Now, if you talk to the campaign, they say nothing has shifted. This is just where they're spending money. But they weren't even spending money on ads when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket. Now you can see they're pouring all of these resources, and Donald Trump's travel has changed. He has been in Pennsylvania a number of times. He's going to be going back before you saw him doing events in Virginia, doing events in Minnesota. Nobody could understand why he was doing this. They truly believe they could expand the map.
