There still seems to be some contention that maybe none of these would have ended up being seen in trial. That's debatable. Dominions' lawyers, clearly, were planning to bring them up in cross examination if they could, if they had gotten Tucker on the stand, maybe a judge would have stopped that. So there seem to be somehow these get to slip by and the board engages at the very last minute and also what we are reporting is that when the board gets on to this, they start -- they consider bringing in an outside firm to conduct an investigation into what was surrounding these very controversial messages between Tucker Carlson and other people within the company.",

He made some very crude comments in the unredacted messages.And so I think, if there are more messages, perhaps more crude messages in the redacted portions, it became clear I think, to Fox leadership, people like Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, Suzanne Scott, that he believed he was bigger than the Fox News brand. And I think that's a cardinal sin in Rupert Murdoch's empire. And you've seen them in the past, willing to part ways with some of their biggest personalities -- Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Megyn Kelly, when they believe that they've basically ascended past Fox News, that Fox News needs them more than they need Fox News.

Last night, in the key advertiser supported or coveted 25 to 54 demo, they saw the worst ratings since pre-9/11. That's a really staggering drop over at Fox News. The hour before it actually rated higher than the 8:00 PM hour, which is something of an anomaly over at Fox, something that certainly never happened when Tucker Carlson was in that hour. And so I think as we're watching this, it's really interesting to see the ramifications it is having at Fox and also at the smaller right- wing channel Newsmax, which is seeing its ratings surge. And this is of course, what led to the initial Dominion debacle because Fox executives saw this other competitor rising, and that's when they started to make some of these decisions that led to being sued ultimately by Dominion.",

Tucker Carlson talked about doubting these conspiracies in some pretty unvarnished terms. He spoke about Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was driving the conspiracies about Dominion Voting, this idea that their machines, this false idea that the machines were switching Trump votes to Biden votes. So he sets an atmosphere. He is not a major part of that case, but that goes back to the liability idea here.

I'll just say also in terms of the three cases, the Dominion, Smartmatic and Abby's case, I think Abby's civil conspiracy case is kind of the connective sinew between the two cases in terms of what would happen and how the discovery process was really abused and it seems that the attorneys were playing hide the ball instead of following the rules.",

She said she replied, hey, you're that real estate tycoon. And he asked her to help him find a gift. She said they looked at handbags, hats, and then they made their way up to the sixth floor of the department store insta (ph) lingerie department. She said they were joking over a piece of lingerie about whether he should try it on or if she should try it on. But then she said that's when things turned violent. She said that Trump brought her into the dressing room. He shoved her against the wall. She banged her head. She said that he closed the door and then he pulled down his tights and he raped her. Now, Carroll said after that, she contacted two friends. Those two friends are expected to testify for her as part of this case. She said that one of them told her she shouldn't go public with this because Trump would \"bury her.\" Now, Carroll said that she did suffer harm from this. She said she has not been able to have a romantic relationship because, in her mind, flirting led to this terrible event. Now, she also said that when Donald Trump came out publically and denied the attack saying that she wasn't his type and suggested she did it to boost sales of her book, she also suffered then as well saying she was fired from her job as an advice columnist at Elle. She said she received hate mail and that she has not recovered from that. She was fighting back tears at one point when her lawyer asked her, do you regret this? And she said, 100 times that she did. But she said, being able to tell her story in a court of law meant everything to her, so she was happy about that, Anderson.

He said that the attorneys can't know the identity of the jurors. And part of that is because of Trump's rhetoric. The statements he has previously made in some other cases that have been concerning to judges. So, he has tried to keep this under wraps. And then Eric Trump, Donald Trump's son posted something on Twitter this afternoon. And while the judge said that Eric Trump is not before him, he did remind Trump's attorneys yet again that these are concerns. There are statutes out there and that someone on his team should be mindful of this and warn their client. Now, Trump's attorney Joe Tacopina was a caught a little bit on his heels.

Today, the company filed suit in federal court against him alleging a \"targeted campaign of government retaliation.\" DeSantis, who has been criticized by other Republican presidential contenders over his broadsides against Disney, defended his actions today saying they are actually good for business. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA: That actually helped a lot of CEOs around the country because they could go to their board. They could say, look, we don't want to be in the next Disney. We have got to stay out of this stuff and we have got to focus on the task at hand. But I do think that the incentives over the last ten years have been for them to basically bend the knee to the woke mob and try to advance a woke agenda. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But if you look, what you see is Biden's lead over DeSantis has grown by seven points from just two points to nine points. So it seems to me that this play that Ron DeSantis is making for the very conservative part of the Republican Party may be something that works for them. But, of course, even if you win the primary, you still have to win the general election, and Ron DeSantis may be putting that in jeopardy if he does with the primary but the point is, even if he win the primary, that doesn't work and also the fact is, Ron DeSantis is way down in the Republican primary at this point.
