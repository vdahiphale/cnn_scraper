And we begin this hour with a search for answers after the U.S. shut down what is described as an unidentified high-altitude object. U.S. fighter jets taking it down off the coast of Alaska on Friday. Pentagon officials saying they acted swiftly after the object about the size of a small car crossed into frozen territorial waters.It's the second time in less than a week that U.S. fighter jets have shot an object out of the sky following that spy balloon that was taken down off the coast of South Carolina last Saturday. CNN reporter Katie Bo Lillis is live for us in Washington with more on this. Katie Bo, what are we learning about this second object?",

      "sentences": "Fred, this object is still quite a bit of a mystery. What we know is that on Thursday, the military observed this unknown object in U.S. airspace just off the coast of Alaska. They set up military aircraft to kind of try to get a look at this thing. Pilots weren't able to tell a whole lot, they could see that it was flying at about 40,000 feet, which raised some concerns for civilian aircraft, which is part of the reason that we understand that President Biden ordered the military to shoot this thing down yesterday.And they could tell that it was unmanned. But beyond that, what we're hearing from Pentagon officials is they're still using the word object to describe this. You know, they're not even ready to take the step to call it a drone or another balloon, or give some kind of specific description here. We have been told that it is a different size and shape than the Chinese balloon that traversed the U.S. last week. We are told that it is about the size of a small car, and that it doesn't appear to have any maneuverability. Meaning, it's just kind of riding the wind. Meaning its behavior is a little bit unpredictable. We're also told by one U.S. official that it does not appear to have any surveillance equipment on it. But beyond that, we're going to have to wait and see once the military has recovered this object, what they're able to learn about what it is, who might own it, whether it's owned by a nation state, whether it's owned by a private entity, and how it got there. But this was a very different situation, Fred, for the U.S. military than what happened with the spy balloon over the last week and a half or so. The spy balloon, they knew what it was when they saw it. This? Unknown object.",

I mean, what's in common about them is at least the desire or ability to shoot them down. So, the first thing that it's just important to remember is we have to first determine whether this thing is manned or unmanned. So once the military did that with this -- with the second unidentified flying object, then the options or the risk calculation is essentially, is it a threat to the United States?And this second device or object as we're calling it now, clearly, was in in the range of aviation aerospace. And that is just dangerous, right? So commercial aviation airspace has protected altitudes and we just simply can't have other stuff in those protected altitudes. And then whether the shooting of it down, the other calculation would harm individuals on the ground or property. These are the calculations that went into the Biden administration's decision to delay the shutdown until the balloon was over -- was passed North Carolina and why they were able to do it so quickly now. So, that's the similarity. But right now, what we're getting from the Pentagon is not telling us much. And I think that we are likely to learn this as a very different type of device, they're telling us no surveillance and it did not appear to be navigationalable. In other words, no one was navigating it from below. So, we'll find out probably relatively soon when, in fact, it was.",

I -- the first balloon, by the time it's identified, it is -- it is -- and our capacity to do anything about it was more limited because of the decision that we did not want to risk any sort of homeland, any soil in the United States. We simply have to wait a while.So, it couldn't be that entities are testing our system. But I know there's been a lot of activity about thing -- identify things in space. It is also likely that we know about the second device and the decision to shoot it down came so quickly. Because the lessons learned from the week before, we simply have no idea how many errant things are in the air at this stage of which then identification is made. We determined we're not going to use the resources to shoot something down that looks like it's nothing or it might be private sector thing. And the calculation is just different now. The calculation is we're going to -- as long as they're unmanned and they're unidentified and shooting them down could not harm Americans, bring it down and ask questions later.

First, we've learned that the former president's legal team has actually turned over more classified documents to federal prosecutors in recent months. And it really suggests that these efforts to get classified material back from the former president, it still continues. All as the special counsel investigation which is a criminal investigation is ongoing.So, we learned that this turnover of material happened in December and January. It included not only classified documents, but also a laptop belonging to an aide plus an empty folder marked classified evening briefing. We're told that Trump's attorneys discovered these documents in December while they were searching through boxes at Mar-a-Lago. They then turn them over to DOJ. But of course, that discovery was two months after the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago in August that yielded hundreds of classified documents. We also learned that a Trump aide had even copied some of these documents onto a thumb drive, not realizing they were classified. We know that the thumb drive and the laptop have also been handed over to investigators. Then on top of that, on Friday, the FBI conducted a five-hour search of former Vice President Pence's home. They uncovered one classified document, plus, six additional pages that weren't marked classified but were still taken by the FBI for review. Now this search was done in cooperation with Pence. He was actually in California visiting his family when the search happened. But now the question really is what comes next for the former vice president? We know the FBI is expected to search his Washington, D.C. office in the coming days. But the question is will there be other searches? Also, what will the Justice Department do now? Will they ultimately have to name a special counsel to look into this issue with the former vice president especially because we know that Mike Pence is considering announcing a run for 2020 for the presidential run?

We know this is a very serious situation. To them, it's a big game, because they think their toy is at the end of this. When they sniff out human scent, they're going to bark. It doesn't matter what the terrain looks like. They're not going to stop until they get to that strongest scent source. When they do, they bark and alert, and then their handler is going to reward them with that toy. So in this way, we've conditioned them to play this game, if you will. It's a game to the dogs, that they continue to search and search and search where their handler directs them to make sure they find every live human scent that they can smell, but not see. So we've seen the images of all of these folks, these amazing rescuers on the pile searching by hand. The dog is going to bypass them and look for that scent they can't see, they can't put together with a human because they think that person has their toy.

They saw in him the traits that we look for, which are the exact traits that make these dogs not very good pets. They're super driven. They have very high toy drive to the point of obsession. This is not necessarily the type of dog that you want in your house. They will not sit and watch TV with you on the couch. They want to be active. They need a job. We're lucky enough to give them that. It's really that human canine connection, that bond that is so important. And that we're seeing on display now as teams search around the clock in Turkey. Because if you don't have that bond and that relationship and that trust, you cannot do this job very well. It makes it much harder.
