CNN has documented this in a documentary.Does Putin hope, in effect, that Navalny dies in prison? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it's certainly the implication of doing this additional sentence on what were essentially incredibly trumped-up charges. That, you know, he had opposed the war in Ukraine, that he had participated in joining organizations that the state didn't approve of. I mean, there were just clear freedom of speech issues, which doesn't take you very far in Russia. But I think what is really notable about this, Jim, is two things. First of all, even in the old days of the Soviet Union, this would have been an extraordinarily long sentence for a dissident. And it tells you how much Putin wants to keep all dissent off of most communication lines. But the second is, this comes after Putin has been through the whole Prigozhin uprising and, he's now being pressed by dissidents on the left and by his critics on the right, who think he isn't conducting the war well enough.",

So if they get elected, the problem goes away. If you think that Putin only has three ways to win this war -- a crack in the NATO alliance, the Ukrainians running out of ammunition, or President Trump or Governor DeSantis getting elected and pulling the U.S. out, then it would make perfect sense for him to keep a low-level war going through the end of 2024.",

They're desperately trying to get inflation back to their 2 percent target.If you do a little bit of arithmetic, they're hoping that they get wage growth closer to 3.5 percent. That would be consistent with that 2 percent inflation and kind of underlying productivity growth. So the wage growth is still a little on the hot side, a little strong side. I think they'd like to see that come in a little more here over the course of the next few months. But I think they will. All the trend lines look like that's happening. Job growth is slowing. There is an easing up in the labor market. Businesses aren't laying off workers. That's great. That's why we're not going to have a recession. But they are pulling back on their hiring. The other thing that we're seeing is people aren't quitting their jobs at the same rate they were, say, a year ago, and that will also cool off wage growth, because people get bigger pay increases when they switch jobs. So I think everything's coming together for that wage growth to moderate, but still a little bit on the hot side for them.",

Because global investors know that is good money, that they're going to be able to get their money back when they need it and they're going to get paid principal interest when it's owed.

Joining us now is Dr. Arthur Evans. He is the CEO of the American Psychological Association. Doctor, your organization issued a statement in support of the college board decision. Explain your concern here. DR. ARTHUR EVANS JR., CEO, AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION: We did. We issued that support for the college board because psychology is a science of people. It's about understanding how people think, how we feel, why we do the things we do.

So, I think the other thing to note here is this content has been in the A.P. course that is taught around the country. Over 300,000 students take that course each year. In the state of Florida, 28,000 students take that and have been taking that course and taking the exam. And this is information that has been there since 2014. So, the state of Florida has embraced those standards, had incorporated them, had approved them. So we are not quite clear why, at this point, this important content is being excluded.

It is the foundation for many other disciplines or it is a good foundation for many other disciplines. People major in psychology and they go into law and medicine and the social work and other important areas. People believe that that foundation that they get in understanding people is so foundational to so many other areas.
