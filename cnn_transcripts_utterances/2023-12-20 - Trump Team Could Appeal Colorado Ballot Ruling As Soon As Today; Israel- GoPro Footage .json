Trump's appeal to the Supreme Court is expected that any moment as he also tries to use the Supreme Court to stall his January 6th federal case. All eyes on the highest court in the land tonight. Plus, screams for help. There are new evidence showing GoPro footage of the three hostages that the Israeli military shot and killed. At least one of the hostages has reportedly heard crying for help. How did things go so terribly wrong? And RFK, Jr. keeping up his momentum in the polls in these weeks leading up to the primary season. His media strategy, the podcast circuit. And many of his supporters say that is what sucked them in. A special report. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, chip in. Donald Trump, those are the words being sent out to supporters, doing everything he can to take advantage of Colorado's historic ruling, barring him from running in the states primary. This fundraising ad, appearing all over Trump social media accounts. And it reposts every few hours. So you're getting deluge with it. It asks his supporters to, quote, chip in, so Trump can stay on the ballot, trying to make this a mega moneymaking situation. The plea coming as his legal team is right now attempting to appeal the Colorado case to the Supreme Court, a move that will put the nine justices on the Supreme Court in the center of the 2024 election. And tonight, President Biden weighing in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a big financial issue. But one of the other things that we're watching for is obviously when they go to the Supreme Court. They have some time, and we're told Alayna Treene, one of our correspondents he's talking that the campaign, has told that it might be a few more days before we see that appealed to the Supreme Court. They, of course, need to make that appeal. They have a few things they want to bring up, including, of course, the idea that there was not due process in this case in Colorado. But they have a few more days. Obviously, Colorado has to certify its ballot by January 5th. And of course, that's when the vote is actually in March. The question is whether the Supreme Court will be able to address all of this in the next couple of months before voters in -- primary voters, in Colorado go to -- go to the ballot boxes on March 5th, Erin.",

They're going to start now a little bit, you can see that momentum. She's the only candidate that has momentum. So, you know, she's getting kind of that earned media. People are starting to really look in her direction, and those that want to see a one-on-one race, which is most people, are really saying, okay, this is the path. So, the Chris Christie voters are coming over, the Ron DeSantis voters are coming over. She had another poll that kind of backing up the first poll, saying that, you know, she's within, you know, 12, 13, 14 points here, which again sounds like a lot, but for New Hampshire, that's nothing knowing that everything can change at the last minute.",
