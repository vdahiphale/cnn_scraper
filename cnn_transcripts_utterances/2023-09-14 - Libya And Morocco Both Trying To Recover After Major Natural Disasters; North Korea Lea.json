      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is \"ONE WORLD.\" I want to start in North Africa where two countriesare reeling from catastrophic events. Libya and Morocco are both desperately trying to recover after major natural disasters that have killed thousands of people in both countries. Parts of eastern Libya are in ruins after massive flooding while in Morocco, the search for victims continues after a powerful earthquake reduced villages to rubble. We know that aid is slowly making it way to survivors in the hard hit mountain villages of Morocco after Friday's devastating earthquake. The death toll approaching 3000 with more than 5000 injured. Many survivors were left frustrated as they had to wait days for government to help to arrive. With emotions already running high, an aftershock on Thursday, leaving villages on edge, telling CNN they, quote, \"have a lot of fear still in their hearts\". We will take you live to Morocco later on in the hour to see how relief efforts there are shaping up -- are unfolding. I want to turn now to Libya where the death toll has skyrocketed to 8000 after Storm Daniel hit the northeastern part of the country, that is according to Doctors Without Borders. Another 10,000 people at this point are still missing. A giant seven-meter wave struck the city of Derna, washing entire communities out to sea. That new assessment from the international committee of the Red Cross which calls Libya's catastrophic flooding violent and brutal. The damage is caused by a Mediterranean storm that hit over the weekend destroying two dams. You can actually see the vast destruction, roads submerged in water. In these pictures on your screen, the head of the U.N. Meteorological Organization says the massive loss of life could have been prevented if proper emergency management systems had been in place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETTERI TAALAS, SECRETARY-GENERAL, WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION: Yeah, so -- so, that's a conclusion, that if they would been normally operating meteorological service, they could have issued the warnings and also the emergency management would have been able to carry out evacuation of the people and we could have avoided most of the human casualties. Of course, we cannot fully avoid economic losses but we could have minimized those losses by having proper services in place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, Ukraine seems to be ramping military strikes in the south in Russian annexed Crimea. It claims to have destroyed a Russian air defense system there overnight. This, as Russia says its air defenses shot down 11 Ukrainian drones over Crimea earlier today. And in the east, Ukraine says more than 2000 people have been evacuated from the Kupyansk district. Officials say the situation on the frontlines there remains difficult and Russia could intensify its assault operations in that region. All right, Kim Jong Un's whirlwind visit to Russia is taking him across Russia's far east. The North Korean Leader and President Vladimir Putin met for five hours, Wednesday, apparently to discuss expanded military cooperation. That's raising concerns in the west. Japan says any arms deal could be a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions while South Korean officials suggest North Korean weapons are already in use by Russia in Ukraine. We've also learned Mr. Putin accepted an invitation to visit Pyongyang and the two leaders exchanged firearms as gifts. Paula Hancocks has more here on this particular visit and how it's been perceived by another North Korean ally, China.

But the fact is we don't know exactly what if any deal was done at this point. There were no press conferences, no communique, no joint statement from these two leaders, so it is for South Korea, for Tokyo and also for Washington to try and guess what exactly was decided here. We have heard from the new Japanese foreign minister, as well. She was saying that any deal could violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. But then, of course, that may be a moot point considering it's not likely that Russia, or even China in fact, is going to be signing on to any fresh U.N. Security Council resolutions or any kind of sanctions against North Korea. So, there is concern definitely in Seoul. They have been urging North Korea not to do a deal with Russia, not to enter into any kind of military deal. But this is what we've been hearing, not just in Seoul and in Tokyo, but also in Washington, which really proves the point that it's very difficult to see how these countries can try and deter Russia and North Korea. If they are determined to do some kind of military deal, which they do appear to be determined to do, then it is very difficult to see how that can be stopped. We've already heard that the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will be heading to Pyongyang in October, presumably laying the groundwork for a Vladimir Putin visit to Pyongyang, as he has been invited and has accepted, we understand, from both sides. And that would be a very big deal. It's been 23 years since a Russian president went to Pyongyang, and that Russian president back in the year 2000 was Vladimir Putin meeting the late father of Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong-il. So, it is obviously a concern here in the region, but there is definitely a question as to what more can be done to try and deter something that Russia and North Korea seem determined to do. Zain.",

Thousands of supporters on January 8 -- thousands of supporters of Brazil's former president JairBolsonaro stormed the Presidential Palace, Supreme Court and Congress on January 8 outraged over his defeat in the October election. Close to 2000 people were arrested. The four men on trial say they were there to take part in a peaceful protest. That is their excuse. But they are also accused of burning public property, attempting a coup and violently trying to overthrow democracy. Ironically, the trial began in the very same Supreme Court building that was vandalized by protesters on that day. We got word just a short time ago that the Supreme Court has already found the first of the defendants guilty on five charges and sentenced him to 17 years in prison. Joining me now to talk about the significance of these events is Brian Winter. He's the Editor-in-Chief of \"America's Quarterly\". Brian, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, it's not just about the people who sort of smashed into government buildings and broke things and stormed government buildings in Brazil. It's also about the financial backers, the people who are in charge of organizing this particular insurrection. Where are we on that? BRIAN WINTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AMERICA'S QUARTERLY: Well, I think the Brazilian Supreme Court and the Brazilian political class at large is trying to very clearly send this message, \"never again\", trying to show with these quick trials against these people who participated that if you go into government buildings, multiple government buildings, do something that in some ways was even worse than what happened in the January 6, 2021 riots in the United States just because of the scale, that this won't be tolerated, it will be punished. And now, as you know, the quest is on to find not just the people who went into the buildings, but the people who paid for them to be there. Those investigations continue.

So, at least in theory, if that holds, he's out. He may also face prison time for this scandal in which he allegedly ordered aides to sell jewelry that had been gifted to him by the Saudi Arabian government.

I do want to talk about the division, the level of division in Brazil, because even this -- I remember talking about this on air leading up to the election, there was just so much division between the supporters of Lula and of course the supporters of Bolsonaro, not to mention that division was worsened by Bolsonaro's rhetoric itself.

Officials say a fire caused an explosion on a major transmission line. Nigerians are certainly used to dealing with blackouts. The power grid collapsed at least four times last year. President Tinubu has promised to improve supply by allowing state governments to build their own power plants. A Fulton County Georgia judge has separated Donald Trump and 16 of his co- defendants from two other defendants who are seeking a speedy trial. Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell are scheduled to go on trial in October. The judge has not set a date yet for Trump and the others accused to stay on trial, but it is not expected to start at least until December.

The death toll is nearly 3000, with more than 5000 injured from Friday's earthquake. Help is slowly making its way to survivors in Morocco's hard- to-reach mountain areas. The U.S. Agency for International Development has promised an initial $1 million in humanitarian support and has sent an assessment team. Joining us live now from Morocco is Nada Bashir on the ground for us. I think that one of the difficult things for people to understand is why Morocco has been reluctant to accept help from a large number of countries.

We have heard from aid workers on the ground who have told us that in a situation like this, where many of the hardest hit areas are so remote, it actually can be a hindrance to have many international teams coming in without enough coordination in fact, we've seen that just today. It has taken us hours to make it to this remote village in the mountains where we are trying to get to another area that has been devastated by the quake. And that is because many of these roads have sustained immense damage, rocks, boulders falling on. They've only just cleared parts of the road leading up to this village. So, this has proven difficult for aid workers, but we are beginning to see those international teams coming in and they are coordinating, working on the ground with local Moroccan teams. Take a look.
