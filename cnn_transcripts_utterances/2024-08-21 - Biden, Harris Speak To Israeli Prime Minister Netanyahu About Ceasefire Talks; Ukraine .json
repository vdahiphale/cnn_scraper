      "sentences": "We have news just into CNN. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris just spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about ceasefire and hostage negotiations. The call comes at a critical point in the talks.Netanyahu reportedly said earlier there may not be a deal. Some gaps still exist, including whether Israeli troops can stay in an area on the Gaza-Egypt border. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that this may be, quote, the last opportunity to reach a deal. Keep in mind, Gaza's health ministry says more than 40,000 people have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel last October. Meantime, in eastern Europe, Ukraine is pushing into Russia's key Kursk region with multiple drone attacks. But it is still facing a tough battle inside Ukraine's own borders. This Ukrainian military video shows artillery strikes on Russian troops advancing in Ukraine east of Pokrovsk. Moscow launched an overnight drone strike at the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The fighting, the most intense fighting, though, is in its eastern region. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned some residents there to evacuate. Let's get the latest now with CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt. So, Alex, take us through these back- and-forth drone attacks.",

And I think the Democrats feel they're very unfair, but they -- and we've seen this before -- have been effective in some ways. How does he need to confront this, and does he need to do it tonight? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO), HARRIS CAMPAIGN SURROGATE: Well, I don't think this is an issue of fairness or not. This is an issue of truth versus lies, right? The truth is, Tim Walz has 24 years of honorable service. They can't attack his policies. They can't attack his messages because they know it's very popular. So they're trying to do classic political character assassination. It's not going to work, though, because it's not true. He has a long and distinguished history of service, and that stands on its own.",

But he held the position of command sergeant major in his battalion. That's the highest ranking NCO, which is actually significant because that makes him the highest ranking enlisted person ever to be on a presidential ticket, which is a win for working class America because military veterans know that the NCOs, the enlisted are the backbone of the military.This is a really significant moment in history for us.",

[15So I think you're going to hear him talk about what it was like to be a public school teacher, to be a football coach, to grow up working class, to be an enlisted soldier in our National Guard.

Just this last week, inflation dropped below 3 percent, the first time since early 2021. So the trend is in the right direction. We passed incredible things in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. My constituents, the fact that insulin is now capped at $30 a month, the fact that now 10 of the most common and most expensive drugs are significantly reduced in prices. These are wins, and that is money in the pocket of my constituents and people around the country, and we're just going to talk about it.",

So let's start first with John Legend.As you said, he is going to perform a tribute to Prince. Now, the reason why this is relevant, of course, Prince hails from Minnesota, and that is where Governor Walz hails from. So this will be an introduction of sorts from John Legend. Now, John Legend has a long history of supporting the Democratic Party. He performed at the DNC back in 2008 for Obama and also in 2020 for President Biden. Now, tomorrow, when Pink takes the stage, this will be her first major political performance. Although, of course, she has been very outspoken about her political beliefs. Pink is one of the biggest stars in pop music. She has been for decades. And over the years, she hasn't been shy, Boris, about speaking up for LGBTQ rights and women's rights. So it'll be interesting to see what she has to say, what she will perform on the stage. But, you know, she's known for acrobatics. So I think it'll be a pretty, pretty stellar performance.",
