We've heard from UNICEF, warning that this number could rise because children are often the first hit and the worst hit by these kind of humanitarian crises. And we understand from the United Nations that this is now the worst case of child malnutrition in the entire world here in Gaza. What we are seeing right now is the worst that we will see in the world. They say that, I think, one in six of under 2s are severely malnourished at this point. So for these -- and to your question, Kim, for these two areas, they may be able to get more aid, which is desperately needed. That is obviously always going to be positive, to get aid to the areas. It does then need to be disbursed to other areas. And we saw just last Thursday, when more than 100 people died in that very chaotic aid distribution and Israeli fire, that it is extremely difficult to try and disburse this aid elsewhere. There has to be cooperation from the Israeli military. NGOs, including the United Nations, have said that they have been fired upon by the Israeli military in the past and they have not always been able to get through to where they need to.
