And as you were describing, some of the Special Forces literally protecting the hostages with their bodies. And within a minute then, that rescue mission, the rescue team, we're told, that the IDF, Air Force was coming in, the Israeli Air Force were coming in, they were hitting targets right around the location, and they had to extract the hostages within a minute of the operation beginning. They took the two hostages out of the building, took them, they say to a safe place, still under fire, and this appears to account for this heavy intense bombardment around there, took them away to what they describe as the safe area, gave them a quick medical check, and then brought them here to the hospital where they had this -- were reunited with their families.

      "sentences": "Listen, this is not just talk. I know it's been dismissed that way by some Republican senators, Marco Rubio, et cetera. We know it's not just talk for a couple reasons. One, Trump has a track record as president. His own advisers have said that he nearly pulled the U.S. out of NATO at the NATO Summit in 2019. At the end of his term, one of his final moves was to reduce the U.S. troop presence in Germany. He spoke about the lack of a need for the U.S. to come to South Korea's defense, questioning U.S. troop deployments on the Korean Peninsula.So, he has a track record as president where he didn't just talk about these things, but he took steps, right? I mean, there was even a time when he wanted to withdraw from the U.S. commitment to its Kurdish partners in Syria against ISIS. So, there's a track record there. His own senior advisers have told me that in a second term, they believe he would go further to attempt, at least, to take formal steps to take the U.S. out of NATO. He has questioned the U.S. need to or desire to or interest in protecting Taiwan from China as well. They foresee in a second Trump term that this would not just be talk, that these would be concrete steps taking the U.S. away from formal commitments of mutual defense, as with NATO and Europe, and other ones that may not meet that Article 5 standard, but are long-term, decades- long U.S. commitments, for instance, to South Korea, to Taiwan, and other partners. That's from his own advisers who have told me that, not just from outsiders speculating.",

When Jens Stoltenberg, you and I, we've talked to him many times, this is a very dour, serious, unemotional man. The language in his statement shows that he takes this threat seriously.And the other point, to be clear, is that defense agreements, deterrence aren't just about what's written on paper, they're about credibility. Do your adversaries, does Russia believe that Trump would come to NATO, NATO's defense, Eastern NATO partners' defense in the event that it attacks? Based on the former president's own comments, Russia might calculate, well, maybe they're not going to do that. And that's why you're seeing such a consistent and serious response. I want to read as well from the European Council president's statement. He says, they do not bring more security or peace to the world. On the contrary, he's talking about Russia, they re-emphasize the need for the E.U. to urgently further develop its strategic autonomy and invest in its defense. Why is that important? That is Europe saying, in so many words, we can no longer rely on the U.S. under a potential Trump second term to come to our defense. That's a remarkable thing to hear from your own allies.",
