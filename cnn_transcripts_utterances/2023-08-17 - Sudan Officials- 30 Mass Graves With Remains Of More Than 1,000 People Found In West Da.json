We'll look at how they survived and were eventually rescued. So we begin with a gruesome discovery in Sudan as the civil war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces or RSF rages on. 30 mass graves with the remains of more than 1000 people have been discovered in West Darfur. That's according to local officials there. In a CNN exclusive, CNN Nima Elbagir pieced together video from a massacre in West Darfur in June. That in fact, was one of the bloodiest in the region's history. And it ended with bodies littering the streets and eventually being buried in the mass graves. And now we want to warn you some of the images you're about to see our graphic and the report includes distressing descriptions of a conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The streets of El Geneina in Sudan's Darfur region are eerily quiet. Filmed at great risk by survivors. The video shows racist graffiti defacing walls and corpses littering the streets. Seen here in their own propaganda, Sudan's paramilitary rapid support forces, RSF occupied Geneina in June. After a heavy shelling campaign and fighting in their war for dominance over Sudan's army. A CNN investigation has now uncovered some of the cost of the RSF victory here in Geneina. Survivors, aid workers and body collectors described to CNN how together with their allies, the RSF gunned down hundreds of civilians in and around Geneina on June 15th. In one of the most violent massacres to date in the recent history of this genocide-scarred Sudanese region. Using satellite images, eyewitness testimony and geolocating what few videos have made it through the telecommunications blackout, cutting that four off from the world.",

And has threatened military action to restore democracy. Now ahead of Thursday's meeting, the bloc issued a statement condemning an ambush attack in a western region of Niger by suspected jihadist. At least 17 soldiers were killed in the tri-border area. A new round of Russian drone strikes in the past 24 hours hit grain facilities in Ukraine critical for the global food supply. Drone attacks you see there destroyed warehouses, granaries and other agricultural machinery in the port city of Reni along the Danube River. Small ports on the Danube like this one had become vital for Ukraine to export grain ever since Russia pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Deal last month. Meantime, a Hong Kong flag cargo ship carrying food products depart in the port of Odesa on Wednesday becoming the first container ship to leave the Black Sea in a month. The ship transited through a temporary corridor opened up to evacuate vessels that were already in Ukrainian ports at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from London. And you've been following overnight developments. I do want to get to those continuing attacks on those vital ports and the agricultural sector.

But I think where the two leaders, Prime Minister Kishida and President Yoon want to move this relationship is -- they want to change the narrative. They want to -- they want each other's countries to see the other as being on the same side that they share the same vision. They're both liberal democracies, and we're already seeing that shift, particularly on the South Korea side in the way they described Japan. So, I think it's a -- it's a long, slow process. But in the meantime, there's a lot of areas for functional cooperation. There's a need to collaborate on securing supply chains, economic security resilience, these are all important for both countries. And also on the security front, they both have common threats coming from North Korea. So, there are a lot of issues that are pushing them together.
