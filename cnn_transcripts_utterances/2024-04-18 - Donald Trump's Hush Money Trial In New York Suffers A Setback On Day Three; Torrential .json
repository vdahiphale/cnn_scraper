Earlier, one of the seven jurors so far chosen was excused from the case after expressing concerns that part of her identity had been revealed publicly. Prosecutors are also questioning the veracity of a second juror who has already been impaneled. The veracity of that juror's answers to questions in the jury questionnaire. As it stands right now, six more jurors still need to be selected, along with up to six additional alternates, a total of 18. Up until today, the process had been moving along fairly quickly, with the judge suggesting that opening arguments could begin as soon as Monday. A reminder, Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, all tied to an effort to cover up a sex scandal in the final days of the 2016 presidential election. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins me now live from Washington, following the events inside the courtroom. So, Zachary Cohen, one of the jurors has now stepped away. What happens now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, we still have to get to 12 jurors, plus at least six alternates. And we now have one fewerjuror seated than we did as of before this proceeding started this morning. And look, the judge is also weighing whether or not to potentially dismiss a second juror who was seated yesterday. That was juror number four, who was called back in today to discuss this information that was dug up as prosecutors were doing their due diligence. And it's information that does suggest that maybe there was some sort of a non-prosecution agreement that his wife or somebody with the same name's wife had with the prosecutors. It raised some questions in the minds of prosecutors enough to where they wanted the judge to ask that juror some questions. So that juror is currently in the courtroom talking to the judge and attorneys from both sides. It looks like the discussions about what will happen with that juror are still ongoing, but we could potentially see two jurors who were seated yesterday or on Tuesday be removed from this case. But look, we're also seeing jury selection, the process play out in the same way that we did on Tuesday, as well. Another panel of 96 potential jurors were brought in. About half of those were eliminated and dismissed automatically because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. Another nine had other conflicts, so they were let go. And we're now in the process of asking the remaining 39 about that questionnaire, the 42 questions, things like what sort of media do you consume? Have you ever attended a Trump rally? Do you follow Donald Trump on social media? Donald Trump is apparently very engaged today in the courtroom. Poll reports are saying that he is listening very intently to what these potential jurors are saying. But Jim, as you said, this process is continuing to grind along. We still need six jurors and six more alternates before we can have those opening statements.",

But everyone who's participating in that courtroom has to be acting in accordance with the rules, and their actions have to have consequences.

But I wonder, since we have seen similarbehavior in Trump's other legal proceedings, and by the way, there have been consequences, there have been fines issued, but the behavior continues. So, I wonder if it exposes a weakness in these gag orders, because, I mean, here you have a juror who is not leaving because of a threat from Trump, but is worried about an identity being exposed, perhaps in part because of what you might face if your identity is exposed. I wonder if it exposes a weakness in how these gag orders work, as relates to Trump.",

Look, we saw some of this as far back as when those search warrants were first issued down here in South Florida, and there were law enforcement personnel as well as judges who were threatened by third parties. And so the weakness with the gag order is it controls the actions of the people who are participants. It does not and cannot control the actions of people who are not participants, but the thrust behind the gag order is to make sure that the people in court are not inciting these people who are outside the court and who are not subject to the gag orders. So, again, there has to be a consequence. Somebody has to do something to temper down the rhetoric that's going on outside the courtroom, or you're going to lose another juror, or you're going to find it much harder to even get 12 people to sit on this panel.",

And, you know, I come from South Africa, and Iwas so used to just sort of huge downpours, and really shocked to just see this torrential rain hitting Dubai on Tuesday. Record rainfall that Dubai normally receives in one year coming down in 12 hours. And it's equivalent to what London gets in two months. So, just to put that into perspective, we've been trying all day to get to here, to Dubai International Airport. The roads are congested. There is enormous flooding on one of the key arteries coming into the airport. I mean, unbelievable scenes of cars being submerged. Yesterday was one of the toughest days that I've experienced, in fact. I mean, really scary, you know, trying to get through floodwaters and then seeing cars floating in real time and people being stranded. So, we came to the airport. We went into one of the terminals. We saw that Dubai government, the RTA, have now deployed buses to try and get people out of the airport, something they don't normally do. People are used to getting taxis out. But the overall picture is, and this is from Paul Griffiths, the CEO, he says that in the next 24 hours, he expects a slow recovery to normal operation. So, that's really important messaging after 1000 flights were cancelled. And if you think about one aircraft having capacity of around 350 people, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people that were basically stranded either in the airport and people unable to leave Dubai and get to the airport. Now, the problem still remains, is getting to the airport. It took us hours to get to this point. And hopefully, as rescue operations and clean-up operations continue Thursday, a few days after the torrential rains, it's encouraging to see, but it's a big job. They take the water, they basically pump it into trucks, they get it to the sea, they get it into the desert and trying to clean up things. The city, Zain, unbelievably came to a screeching halt. People were so afraid to leave their homes. We had flooding in homes, power outages. One man around an hour and a half away from Dubai lost his life. You mentioned Iran flooding, you mentioned Oman, where 21 people have lost their lives. This is a huge storm that basically hit the whole of the region. And you know, infrastructure here, as well, is just not geared for that kind of weather. In fact, I was talking to one engineer earlier and he says no city is geared for this kind of weather, but definitely a wake up call, Zain, of potentially things to come if we see climate change becoming more of a reality hitting cities like Dubai.",

So, look, this is a very sensitive process and the jurors are supposed to remain anonymous for that exact reason. We're still moving forward with jury selection, though.

We are asking, or the judge is asking jurors, currently 39 jurors, about this questionnaire, about their views on Donald Trump, about whether or not they've ever attended a Trump rally or whether they follow Donald Trump on social media.

That's according to multiple sources. Currently, U.S. House rules say a single lawmaker can force a vote on whether or not to fire the Speaker. At issue is separate foreign aid bills for Ukraine and Israel, a move that is certainly not popular with some people in his party. Johnson tells CNN that only history will judge him.

Look, when you do the right thing, you let the chips fall where they may. I mean, that's my life philosophy and that's how I govern here every single day.

It has a QR code that takes fans to a short YouTube video. You can actually or you can barely see, but the message in the video reads error three, two, one, along with a faded 13. All right, CNN's Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy joins us live now. It's important to note, Oliver, that this isn't really just about Taylor Swift, because we're seeing several cultural inflection points in the United States, I think, over the past year or so where women are really having their moment. You talk about Beyonce, number one country music album. You talk about, obviously, Taylor Swift. But, you know, Caitlin Clark, look at the record she's breaking there in terms of ratings. Barbie, which was released last year, one of the highest opening weekends ever. What is behind this?",

So Caitlin Clark's contract is far less than if she were playing in the NBA. The WNBA still makes far less money than the NBA. And so, these financial models haven't quite caught up yet. But what's also interesting is because they are drawing such large audiences, you are seeing advertising shifts. So, for instance, because Taylor Swift inspired so many women to turn into the Super Bowl, you saw ads for cosmetics and other things that you wouldn't normally see during a normal Super Bowl when they're primarily targeting male viewership. And so, you're seeing some of these models start to shift around, recognizing that women are tuning in for these things. They are leading the way in these fields. Of course, there's still a long way to go to provide equality here.",
