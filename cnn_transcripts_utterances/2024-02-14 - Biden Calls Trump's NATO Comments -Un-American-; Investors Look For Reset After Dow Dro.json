The report did, however, paint a picture of a president with, quote, \"A poor memory who didn't properly protect highly-sensitive information.\" It's an image that is certainly difficult for Biden's campaign prospects and one Republicans have been seizing on, especially as polls, for months, have shown Biden's age is a major concern for voters -- even Democrats.",
