LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Any little tick or habit that a candidate may have is something that voters could seize on, and it could change the way they view the candidate. TODD (on camera):  Analyst Hans Nichols believes, if the September 10 event is the only debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, there will be more pressure on both of them to perform well at that debate and to not mess up. Of the two, Nichols believes there`s more overall pressure on Vice President Harris, because she`s had fewer unscripted moments recently. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

AU.S. defense official tells CNN it is still burning in the Red Sea after being attacked on August 21st. The tanker is carrying one million barrels of crude oil and Pentagon officials warn of an environmental catastrophe. While the fires have not yet reached the barrels, U.S. officials say the vessel appears to be leaking either fuel or engine oil into the busy waterway. The 25-person crew was rescued following the attack, but attempts to salvage the tanker have so far been unsuccessful. The Houthis attack on the Sounion is part of a months-long campaign against commercial ships along this route. The Iran-backed militants say it`s in response to the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that affects hemoglobin, the major protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. More than 100,000 people have it in the U.S. alone, millions worldwide.

Sickle cell disease changes the shape of the round red blood cellsinto sickle-shaped red cells, causing severe pain, limiting the oxygen circulation to your organs. It wreaks a lot of havoc in the body. The disease has so much stigma. In Kenya, health care is decentralized to the county governments. In 2017, I made a decision to go back to my home county, Taita-Taveta, to solve sickle cell in Kenya. Taita-Taveta has an alarming rate of sickle cell disease. Access to care for sickle cell is very far away, and the government has very little resources. We are solving sickle cell in a holistic way. We are looking at the basic access to care. We`re also looking at the individual. (Through translation) how are you guys? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation):  Hi ma`am. We are good.",
