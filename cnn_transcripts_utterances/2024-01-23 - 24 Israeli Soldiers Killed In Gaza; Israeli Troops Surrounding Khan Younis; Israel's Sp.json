It comes as hundreds of people displaced on hospital grounds in Gaza's second largest city are trying to flee as Israeli military activity ramps up. Russia unleashed a barrage of missiles across Ukraine on Tuesday killing at least five people and wounding dozens more. Ukrainian officials say a school and a gas pipeline were hit. And voting is underway in the New Hampshire primary. Former US President Donald Trump hoping for a victory that could knock out his only remaining Republican opponent, Nikki Haley. Israel's prime minister is calling it one of the most difficult days of a three-and-a-half-month war with Hamas. 21 soldiers were killed in a single incident in Central Gaza Monday when a pair of two-story buildings exploded and collapsed. Three others died in separate incidents. Now, the explosion happened very close to the Israel-Gaza border, just 600 meters from an Israeli kibbutz. The IDF saying it's likely explosives the soldiers were laying to demolish the buildings went off after a tank protecting the soldiers was hit by a rocket's propelled grenade. That news coming as the IDF says Khan Younis in Southern Gaza is now surrounded by Israeli troops. The Hamas controlled health ministry says nearly 200 people have been killed there in the past day. The Palestine Red Crescent says hundreds of displaced Gaza residents are having to flee hospital grounds where they had gone for safety. We've got Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv standing by as well as Ben Wedeman in Beirut. They're with us this hour to take us through the latest news out of the region. Great to see you both. Jeremy, let's start off with you. I mean, we've seen the death of these soldiers, these IDF soldiers, which, of course, Netanyahu has been describing as one of the toughest and worst days since the start of this war. Take us through how these deaths occurred, because we know these were explosives that were also laid for demolishing buildings. How are they connected to what we saw?",

In the previous 24 hours, 190. What we're seeing in Khan Younis is the city is essentially surrounded. There is intense fighting going on in areas around hospitals where thousands of people have taken refuge, for instance, at the Al-Amal Hospital, one of the main hospitals in Khan Younis. According to the U.N., there are as many as 13,000 people, civilians, taking shelter there and the adjacent headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. We've heard from doctors at the Nasser Medical Complex talking about an inability of people to actually leave the area because of the fighting, Israeli snipers in the area, making that very dangerous. So, the situation is just going from bad to worse. Keep in mind, it was just a few months ago that people in the north of Gaza were told to go to Khan Younis, rather ordered by the Israelis to go to Khan Younis because that area would be safer. Clearly, now, Khan Younis is not at all safe. But the roads are clogged with those who are trying to leave that city, reach safer areas, making it very difficult for ambulances to get people to hospital. And those hospitals, many of them are also doubling as cemeteries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WEDEMAN (voice-over): By hand, they bury the white-shrouded body of a young girl on the grounds of the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. The soft sand at the hospital, one of the only safe places to put the dead to rest. The girl suffocated, they couldn't save her, says her grandmother, Sadi Abutayma (ph). Khan Younis is now the focus of Israel's offensive in Gaza, where Israel believes some of the hostages as well as some of Hamas' leaders are located. But after weeks of intense operations, they found neither. The war is well into its fourth month. Israeli leaders warn it could go on until year's end. The prospect of an early halt to fighting brushed aside by the White House.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Eleni. There are all these proposals, all these ideas from both Israel and Hamasand the mediators, Qatar, Egypt, United States and others. So, Israel is certainly under a lot of pressure to try to get its hostages released from Gaza. Obviously, Hamas wants to see an end to the war, Israel indicating that that is not their intention. One of the proposals that I've just learned about that was raised by the Israeli intelligence chief, David Barnea, he raised it last month initially with his CIA director counterpart, Bill Burns, is for the Hamas leaders to leave Gaza, essentially allowing them to walk away, which would just be extraordinary that the architects, the planners of the deadliest day in Israeli history would essentially be allowed to leave Gaza. Of course, it could benefit Israel as well. It would weaken Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It would essentially allow these Hamas leaders to come out of the tunnels and go elsewhere. We know that Israel plans to mount operations to target Hamas leaders around the world. But, Eleni, I think it really does speak to this pressure that Israel is feeling to come to some kind of agreement that would lead to a ceasefire, that would lead to the hostages coming home. Our colleague, Barak Ravid over at Axios reporting that Israel has proposed a two-month ceasefire, which is the longest period of time that Israel has proposed during this conflict. It also speaks, Eleni, to the lack of progress that Israel has made at destroying Hamas, which is their stated goal. The highest level of Hamas leadership, they are still alive. They are still on the battlefield. Some 70 percent of Hamas fighters, by Israel's own estimates, are still on the battlefield. So, this is one proposal that has been raised by the Israelis. I'm told that in a meeting earlier this month between the Qatari prime minister, who's a main mediator with Hamas, and the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the Qatari said this will never happen. And this is something that I've also been told by officials, both American and international, that these leaders, Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza, Mohammed Deif, the head of the military wing, and others, that they would never consider leaving Gaza. That they are ideologues. They are true believers. They are religious zealots. They would rather die fighting their sworn enemy, Israel, than leave the Gaza Strip. But in any case, Eleni, it is remarkable that Israeli intelligence would suggest this to begin with.",

Then they bombed Erbil, Iraq, also killing civilians. And now, they are carrying out executions. So, the pressure point, in my opinion, is the International Community not be distracted and keep the Iranian government accountable. And the best thing to do at the moment are two things. First of all, all the countries that have diplomatic relations with Iran, especially not only European countries, obviously, all of European countries, but in addition, what would build pressure on Iran is if countries like Japan, Australia, South Korea, Latin American countries, which are deeply opposed to that penalty and exercise of it. If they joined together, recall Iranian ambassadors and express their outrage at this trend, and at the same time, they should all come together in March when in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Iran's fact-finding mission will be presenting its report of the atrocities last year. This is the time the International Community can show that through these mechanisms, international multilateral mechanisms, it can hold the Iranian government accountable.

But the commander says sometimes it's all they can do. Every shell that is suitable for the paladin we use, he says, it's better than no shells. The Russians face no such shortages in this area. Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia produced around 2 million rounds last year and acquired around 1 million from North Korea. Massive barrages have laid waste to Bakhmut and much of the surrounding area. At the headquarters of the 93rd Mechanized Brigades Artillery Division, the frustration is palpable. From their drones, they can see the Russians gather to continue their assaults on Ukrainian positions, but they often can't take them out because they need to conserve ammunition, the commander tells me. The ratio is about 10 to 1, he says, ammunition is very important to us. Russia is a country that produces ammo. They have strategic reserves. Yes, they use old Soviet systems, but Soviet systems can still kill. Even without enough ammo, the Ukrainians say they are stopping most Russian assaults here. And the M109 crew did manage to fire at Russian positions. But they know they'll need a lot more firepower to stop Russian advances.

So, we're going to have to wait on that. The U.S. DOJ has not commented on this. But I want you to take a look around me because this entire area has been taken over by the State of Texas. You see this razor wire that coils around and there's several layers. On the other side, you see some Texas National Guard members and more razor wire. What's so extraordinary about this entire case and several lawsuits that are going on between the Biden administration and the State of Texas is that the big fight here is who has authority over immigration law and border security. Texas is arguing that Texas has authority. That's why they've deployed all of these measures. And the Biden administration argues that it's the federal government that has that authority. Now, all of this got prominence and a lot of attention about two weeks -- starting about two weeks ago when the State of Texas up the ante took the extraordinary step of taking over miles of the Rio Grande, blocking U.S. Border Patrol from accessing this area.

Spinal taps are, you know, intrusive and, you know, they also cost a lot of money. A simple blood test can democratize care for people and really identify if a person as at risk for dementia before symptoms begin. TODD (voice-over): The new study shows this blood test, ALS path, compares well for accuracy with brain scans and spinal taps to be able to detect and possibly predict who has Alzheimer's even when a person appears to be normal. DR. SHARMA: Individuals who develop Alzheimer's disease, they develop the pathological changes in the brain up to 20 years before they may show symptoms. So, with this test, we can actually see those pathological changes in the blood. So, yes you may be able to capture this well before they develop this themselves. TODD (voice-over): According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 6 million people in the U.S. are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer's. And the number of people affected is projected to double in the U.S. in the next two decades. While there is still no cure for Alzheimer's -- DR. ISAACSON: When a person is still at the earliest phase, it's called a mild cognitive impairment phase, we now several FDA approved drugs that have been shown to have some disease modifying or disease slowing effects. TODD (voice-over): Which makes early detection with this blood test even more critical. Jack Driscoll has this advice to anyone who tests positive.",

Or maybe just too many outstanding performances in 2023 to include everyone, right? Well, as expected, \"Barbie\" got its share fair of nods. But shockingly, not for best actress, Margot Robbie, and best director, Greta Gerwig. Huge snubs. And as predicted, one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2023, \"Oppenheimer,\" racking up a load of nominations. And most are predicting Christopher Nolan will take home best director Oscar. Let's go now to Elizabeth Wagmeister live in Los Angeles where it all took place earlier this morning. Elizabeth, great to see you. Look, we knew \"Barbie\" was going to be included and of course \"Oppenheimer\" as well. But pretty shocking that we didn't see it for Best Actress as well as Best Director as well. What surprised you with the nominations?",

And as you said, also, Greta Gerwig not getting into the Best Director category. She wasn't necessarily expected to get in there. But when this was the biggest film of 2023, making over $1.4 billion, huge record- breaking moments for females in film, this is a big surprise. And then when you look at the supporting actor category, and you have Ryan Gosling. who did make the cut with the nomination this morning, he was expected, of course, well-deserved, but it's kind of art imitating life, right? When you see a movie that is about female empowerment and the two women not getting nominations. But of course, it's not like Ryan and Margot were up against each other. They were in separate categories.",

Emma Stone is nominated again. Also, it's nominated for Best Picture. So, I think it'll be a big year for \"Poor Things.\"",
