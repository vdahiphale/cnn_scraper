The markets are essentially in a holding pattern as we await results from the Fed meeting later on this week. Those are the markets and these are the main events: Iran releases five Americans after they spend years under detention. Comedian, Russell Brand, is facing allegations of sexual assault. He is denying those claims. And Clorox is warning on product shortages after a cyberattack last month. We'll explain. Coming to you live from New York. It is Monday, September 18th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and I too mean business. Tonight, five Americans are on their way home from Iran where the US says they were wrongfully imprisoned for years. Their release is the culmination of strained talks between the Islamic Republic and the United States, which has freed five Iranian prisoners and unfrozen $6 billion of Iranian funds. Here's our Becky Anderson with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice over): Smiles, hugs and tears, as five Americans detained inside Iran for years are finally freed and on their way home. Among them, Siamak Namazi. He was arrested in 2015 while on a business trip to Iran, and charged with having relations with a hostile state. After nearly eight years in prison, Namazi was Iran's longest held American prisoner. Feeling abandoned by the US earlier this year, he appealed directly to President Biden in an unprecedented interview with CNN from inside the notorious Evin Prison.",

ANDERSON (voice over): Also freed, dual Iranian-American citizens Morad Tahbaz and Emad Shargi. Tahbaz, an environmentalist was arrested while on a trip to Iran in 2018. Shargi, a businessman who moved with his wife to Iran from the US in 2017 was also detained in 2018 on similar charges to that of Namazi. ANDERSON (on camera): For years their fate tied to tensions between the two countries, but with the help of a common friend in Qatar, breakthrough diplomacy brought us to this very moment. ANDERSON (voice over): Iran freed the dual citizens in a deal to release five Iranians held in US prisons, and to unblock $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds from South Korea. That cash moving from Seoul to Switzerland before being transferred to Doha, after the Biden administration last week issued a sanctions waiver clearing the way for the money to move. The role of Qatar now changing from mediator to guarantor ensuring Washington's demands that Iran's billions are strictly controlled, and spent only on humanitarian goods, like food and medicine. But critics worry even with Doha's oversight, the moneys could be spent however Tehran decides. There is also concern this latest deal enables what many critics have dubbed Tehran's hostage diplomacy. But for the freed Americans today at least, politics will likely be a secondary concern, as they finally get to go home after years of mental and physical anguish. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Siamak was the longest held American in an Iranian prison. So when they came off that Qatar flight today, around sort of late afternoon, Qatar time it landed, just on the tarmac behind me here to Doha International Airport, the emotion was absolutely palpable. This was a tough, complicated, complex deal involving many of America's partners and Joe Biden thanked those countries -- Switzerland and Seoul, Qatar specifically, and Oman. Qatar, went through eight rounds of negotiations. Of course, the US and Iran aren't in direct talks, they are not in direct negotiations. They have no direct contact. So between Oman and Qatar, these rounds of negotiations, which sort of culminated in real momentum over the last sort of six or seven months, resulted in what we had today. And really, it's an example on a day, and we should applaud this for its success, a day way, you can see that diplomacy can still work. Does this mean that the US will start re-engaging with Iran anytime soon? No, absolutely not, and they've made that point. And they've said that today, they say they still consider Tehran an adversary, they still consider that Iran is a sponsor of state terrorism. So you know, this is a small part. This deal started off as very ranging. It included the nuclear talks, et cetera, but this deal ended up just being about US detainees wrongfully detained in Iran, which this Biden administration has said alongside those who are wrongly detained in other countries, including Russia, they've made it an absolute priority, that they will get these people home. And today, Zain, we saw the results of that. Those detainees have now left Doha, they are on their way home. They will be in Washington, in the hours to come.

Some Democratic lawmakers like House Minority Leader, Hakeem Jeffries have joined the picket line in solidarity. The workers are targeting just one plant from each company. They're threatening to expand if this talks drag on. The action is already affecting suppliers. Shares of Australia's BlueScope Steel closed sharply lower on fears about its US business.

They have been meeting today. No word yet on whether or not there has been any progress. But look, we know in recent days, there has been a really steep divide between the sides with very little progress between the union and really any of the Big 3 automakers -- Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. With the head of the Auto Workers Union saying that additional facilities could go on strike in the days ahead, depending on if there's progress, and you can hear that energy behind me. Look, there are roughly 5,800 UAW workers on strike here in Toledo close to 13,000 across the country, and many of them there, they're on strike pay, $500.00 a week, not making much money. They don't have a salary right now. That's paid by the Union. But so many of them have told me they are ready to strike, Zain, for as long as it takes, because they believe there is corporate greed here, that companies like Stellantis , Ford, and General Motors have enjoyed record profits and compensated their CEOs with 20-plus million dollars a year, and yet they have been fighting for pay raises even close to that, in terms of cost of living adjustments, trying to make more money. They've asked her a 40 percent hike. So far, the automaker is not offering anywhere near that. But again, we're waiting to see if there's any progress today or in the coming days.

One is of course, the police, and these arecriminal allegations of rape and sexual assault. What did the police know? Well, no reports were made from the allegations that emerged through this investigation. The Met Police in London have contacted both \"The Sunday Times\" and Channel 4. They want to make sure that all sources involved know how to report these crimes to the police. And in the meantime, while they don't name Russell Brand, they have told CNN that they received a call over the weekend a report of sexual assault, which was alleged to have taken place in Central London in 2003. So that's actually three years prior to the allegations made in this joint investigation. So they are in contact with that woman and they are investigating that report right now. The other big issue I think, Zain, is the culture with which this all happened. Russell Rand works for big media companies over multiple years in very high profile roles. He was actually fired twice before working for the BBC for inappropriate behavior. He resigned from the BBC again from inappropriate behavior when he was a radio presenter. The BBC are investigating all the claims made, they said today, and they also say that the way they deal with complaints and with talent has evolved over the years. Channel 4 has taken off all of the Russell Brand content on their online platform and are also investigating this because there comes a point where you have to question, what did everybody know? Were complaints made and ignored? Were people looking the other way? Because there are so many allegations here spanning such a long time -- Zain.",

And it's impacting customers in the hotels and around the world as key cards for rooms aren't working, reservation sites are offline. And even to the extent that some of the slot machines are getting almost handwritten notes for payouts. What this is coming back to, the root cause is this continued rise in social engineering as a means of attack. And what's happened is that the cybercriminal is an industry. They are a machine that is there for a profit. And they have optimized how to attack these corporations using both advanced techniques and also relatively simple things that involve the human element. And so, as we're seeing here in these attacks, the social engineering. What they're actually doing is the attacker groups are searching widely available information that's on the web, like on LinkedIn. They're identifying employees that worked for the company, their names, previous employment, maybe their location in the world. And they're using all that information then to call parts of the company such as the help desk and say, hey, maybe, I'm on vacation, I need to urgently gets access. I don't have access. Help me reset my password. And those types of attacks which we might have heard about for years are on the rise.

I know most of the time not to click on certain things. But I have found myself come very, very close to clicking on some of -- some of these links that I shouldn't be clicking on. Luckily, I never do. But I've found myself very close to in the past. Just walk us through because you obviously heard of cybersecurity at Twitter. Are companies investing enough in having the right sort of infrastructure to throw and defend themselves from these sorts of attacks?",

      "sentences": "I think unfortunately, as much as companies are trying, they are not investing enough. And they're not necessarily investing in the rightdefenses as this attack evolves. The fact of the matter is, is that every day we are diligently at our jobs, you know, doing our work, responding to emergencies in the day to day of business. And we do try our best, all of us to not click on that wrong link, to not answer that wrong phone call or to interrogate who might be calling us. But it only takes one slip up to make a mistake. And the problem is, is that as an industry, we're relying entirely on the humans who have so many other things to be doing to be perfect 100 percent of the time. What we need to do is move to technology and defenses that takes the human out of the loop or even if the human makes a mistake, they're not actually giving up, \"the keys to the kingdom.\" One example of this is we've continued to tell people use strong passwords, use random passwords you've heard again and again. But now we've been saying for many years, use two factor and you get a code that gets texted to you or maybe it's on your phone. But unfortunately, the human is still in the loop. And they might put the code in the wrong spot, which could be the phisher's Web site. Some of the more advanced technology is taking the human out of the loop. Use a Fido defense key. F-I-D-O. It's one of those physical tokens where you're actually clicking on that token. And that is taking the human out of the loop where the phishers try as they might cannot actually leverage that information even if they fool you. That type of approach is what we need to be migrating to across the board for companies. It varies in each situation. But we need to take the human out of the loop because the human will eventually fall no matter how good they try.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Zain. It is really interesting timing because you -- as you say, you know, so many fewer people arerelying on online grocery delivery. It's a much different time for this company. And I think you'll see that reflected in this $10 billion valuation target. Again, lower than the peak of almost $40 billion valuation a few years ago. But what this company does have going for it now is it so profitable. Instacart in the first half of 2023 reported profit of $242 million. That's above a $74 million loss in the same time last year. And part of this is because the company has started to lean into some different areas, including advertising. You see Instacart using all of that customer data that it has from people ordering groceries and using that to offer advertising say to grocery stores. And so, I think this is sort of an interesting transition as this IPO market starts to heat up again. We may start to see fewer of these tech companies going public at sky high valuations while they're bleeding money in the days of a company like Uber, for example. Now, you might see companies like Instacart starting to wait until they're actually profitable in order to take this move, Zain.",
