But I'm so glad to know that he was the key to that scene behind you ending happily instead of in a very sad way. This has been a very tough storm. Nick, thank you for bringing that to us.Meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking this storm from the CNN Weather Center. Elisa, what are the next few hours look like here? Elisa Raffa: We're still going to find this flooding rain. And then the rivers are still going to be responding to this rain even through the weekend. We now have a tropical depression. All that means is that it's losing the skeleton of its once tropical structure. But it doesn't need that to dump all of this heavy rain. That will continue. We have this outer band that has been producing tornado warnings all day in the Eastern Carolinas. And then this rain stretches into Tennessee, even parts of Eastern Missouri with some of that flooding rain. The flood watches extend pretty far reaching because of all of this rain. I want to point your attention to all of these white outline boxes. These are all of the flash flood emergencies in Western North Carolina. Just incredible how many emergencies there have been. There was one all morning in Atlanta that was thankfully allowed to expire. There's still a flash flood warning, though, as those waters, as you just saw from where Nick is, still have to recede. The warnings, though, continue in North Carolina. A couple of warnings actually where there are dams that are at risk of failing and eroding from all of the heavy rain and record rises in the river. And that's because this area here has seen more than a foot of rain. You could see this hot pink here near Asheville where we've had totals exceed 10 inches. This is a mountainous terrain, so there's really not really anywhere for this water to go, which is why they're worried about landslides that we've already seen some reports of, again, because this land will just kind of slide forward with all of this heavy rain. Still finding some gusts up to 40 miles per hour. Roanoke seeing some of these gusts, 37 miles per hour gusts even in Cincinnati as the winds continue to whip around with some of this heavy rain as well. Some of these totals have approached 30 inches in the mountains of North Carolina. Just incredible, the records amount of rain that we've seen, Table Rock, South North Carolina, 13 inches, Asheville, 13 inches, Atlanta, got 11 inches of rain this morning. Again, we are still worried about that flooding through the day today, especially in the mountains there on North Carolina. And as we go through the weekend, what's left of Helene will just continue to swirl over the Tennessee Valley. Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Excellent. Under the governor's leadership, we had all of those resources, and assets, and personnel staged, and ready to start deploying the minute the storm subsided. What we saw is into the wee hours of the morning, folks were already heading out. They were doing search and rescue. They were making sure that if people were stranded, they were rescuing those folks, and then beginning the tedious work of power restoration. I know we talked about the importance of that.Residents, of course, are eager to get their power restored. Right now, we have a little over 1 million people without power, but that work is ongoing. And we've seen a tremendous amount of progress. So we hope in short order, we'll get the power restored. Of course, people are going to have a lot of damage in that Gulf coast Big Bend area, and even further into Pinellas, Tampa area, we've seen a lot of damage, a lot of destruction. And so we're going to continue that difficult work. We'll stand up all the necessary food and water distribution, and then begin to assist them with rebuilding and recovery.",

The other one was a tree, unfortunately, fell on the home. The other four were still getting information. But what we continue to message, and this is an important part of post-storm, we want people to be safe, obviously, leading up to the storm, during the storm.But what we see is a lot of time, that fatalities occur afterwards. People going out into flood waters where there are down power lines, working with power tools, and maybe not having the necessary safety precautions in place, tree limbs falling on homes and on individuals, generator usage. All of this is ongoing messaging that we'll be sharing with Floridians to make sure they maintain the safety and well-being of their loved ones. But it is something that we're concerned about, and we'll continue to provide assistance. If anyone needs assistance, we'll have plenty of nonprofits along to help, especially the elderly. Sometimes, they want to get up on ladders, and we don't recommend that. We'll have plenty of resources to be able to assist them. But it's a difficult long haul recovery process that we're going to see here in the state of Florida.",

What you see is many roadways, many bridges need to be inspected to make sure they're passable and they're safe. And so once all of that assessment is done, then all the folks can come in and begin that process. We saw it during Hurricane Ian two years ago. There were bridges washed out. We helped to rebuild those in very short order, three days in one case, two weeks in another. People's homes, of course, if there is a tremendous amount of storm surge, like I mentioned in that Tampa Bay Pinellas area, they'll have to start going through that process with their insurance.But I do want to share and provide this information to all Floridians. We stand ready to assist you. We'll be with you throughout the long haul and we'll recover.",
