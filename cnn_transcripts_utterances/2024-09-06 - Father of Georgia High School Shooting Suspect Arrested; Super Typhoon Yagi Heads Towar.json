We'll have the latest on the investigation.Southern China is bracing for a Super Typhoon Yagi, the strongest storm of its kind to hit the region since 2014. We're live in Hong Kong. And Vladimir Putin trolling America's politicians just a day after Russia's accused of meddling in the 2024 elections. We begin with the deadly shooting at a school here in Georgia. The father of the suspected gunman is now facing charges in connection with the attack that left four people dead and nine wounded. This is only the second time the parent of an accused school shooter has been charged in connection with their child's crime. Fourteen-year-old Colt Gray faces four counts of felony murder. Authorities say the teen admitted his guilt while being questioned. Family and friends have been paying tribute to the victims. Two students and two teachers were killed Wednesday, just two weeks into the new school year. CNN's Ryan Young has more on the latest charges. RYAN YOUNG, U.S. CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Still a lot of strange feelings in this community. Of course, now there's news about the father of the alleged shooter being arrested. We spent the day outside the home talking to neighbors and trying to get some information. That's after investigators indicated to us that they believe the alleged shooter's father brought the weapon that was used here in a shooting as a holiday gift. Now that's after Jackson County Sheriff's Department talked to the young man and tried to figure out if he was connected to some online threats. After that happened, the father indicated that there was no weapons that he had unsupervised access to. But that gun was purchased apparently, and then that was the same gun that was brought here and used for such tragedy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the more and more we see parents like this father in this Georgia case charged, like those parents in Michigan, I can't help but believe that parents will start taking very seriously their responsibility.In the case in Michigan, those families -- those parents were sentenced to some very serious jail time, and in this case, we have second-degree murder charges. These charges carry life in prison so, this father could be facing a very stiff prison a sentence and I would have to imagine that in combination with common-sense gun laws, we could talk about Georgia. Georgia has no universal background checks, no permits even required to own a gun, no red flag laws which allow law enforcement to take guns away from individuals who maybe have mental health issues. So, it is a state where guns are readily available. So when you think about what is it going to take, obviously we have to do something to make it much, much, much more difficult for guns to be purchased and then left unattended, not in locked spaces and for kids like this 14- year-old to gain access to them.",

Did an investigation with him and his father.He said that he did not make the post, that his account had been hacked. He was in (inaudible) that it wasn't him. Apparently, his father believed him and the father admitted that you know much about the social media site or much about what his son may have been doing on the site. But we also have comments now coming from family members that this was a young boy in crisis, that the family had gone through a very difficult divorce. The family, the father and son had been evicted from their home, and that there were calls for help by this 14-year-old that went ignored. So again, a case where not only the parents apparently failed this 14- year-old, but the system because Child Protective Services apparently were involved with this family at one point as well. So you have to ask, where were the adults? How is it that the adults completely missed that this 14-year-old was capable of and planning this mass shooting?",

Amnesty International released this map, which highlights the farmland and structures that have been damaged or destroyed in Gaza along the border with Israel since October. The group says the IDF used bulldozers and explosives illegally to destroy agricultural land and civilian buildings in eastern Gaza. It alleges the destruction wasn't caused by a drought a combat between Israel and Hamas, and that the destruction was carried out after the Israeli military had operational control over the areas. Amnesty International says the Israeli military had other viable options available and failed to pursue them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed a new foreign minister amid a major shakeup in his cabinet. Andrii Sybiha is replacing Dmytro Kuleba, who is seen as one of the most public-facing and strongest members in Zelenskyy's administration.

We're trying to keep that below 1.50, another month that didn't do it.But tied only with last year 2023. Now, we're noticing though the little trend here in 2024 with the anomalies compared to how quickly we were going up in 2023 at the end of the year. Still though with all of this very warm January through August, temperatures were really doubting that were going to get anything, but the warmest year on record because we had the warmest summer on record. Clearly, temperature anomalies to date well, above where we were even in 2023. So, it is likely that 2024, the entire year will turn out to be the warmest year on record as well. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
