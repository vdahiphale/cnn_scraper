Remember that international networks like CNN can't get into Gaza but do what they can to try and show what's happening to Palestinian civilians. That he's had to seek out that information to make his decision, I think, is interesting in itself. One media analyst pointing out that here in Israel the drums of war have been beating so loudly that it's been hard for the Israeli public to get access through its own media, too much of what's happening two Palestinian civilians. So remarkable story to a remarkable time. And bear in mind that we are now in the third day of four days of protest against this work here in Jerusalem -- Boris and Brianna?",

He is trying to understand the best path forward. But understandably, he's in this very difficult position of trying to thread the needle in a way in which he brings Ukraine aid to the floor of the House, but he doesn't trigger this effort to remove him from office. And that is proving to be very difficult. In conversations I've had over the course of the last two days, it's become clear that Johnson has not decided, Brianna, on what the best strategy is at this current moment. We've heard him floating a couple of ideas, perhaps using this as a way to give a loan to Ukraine that they could pay back. Another option that he has floated is doing some kind of lend-lease program. He's floating a lot of ideas right now to see and understand what might be able to get the kind of traction where he can actually put this on the floor. Meanwhile, Democrats are giving him room to maneuver, making sure that he does have some semblance of options because they want to see Ukraine aid. This has been a big priority for the White House. The Senate has already passed their bill. But Johnson making it clear in the interviews over the last several days that whatever he puts on the floor is not going to be that Senate-passed bill. Instead, he is looking at a series of other potential options, Brianna, but he still has not made a final decision.",

And they've been locked in what is now a years-long court battle to essentially seek reparations.Now, as you mentioned, a lower court initially dismissed -- well, they initially allowed it to go forward, and then they granted a motion to dismiss later on. So then it was dismissed. Then they appeal to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. That appeal was essentially granted to provide this opportunity for oral arguments. And that's what we are hearing today. So that hearing is underway. These survivors are making their case, which I just want to point out for context here, the Supreme Court is not deciding whether they get reparations or not. They are deciding whether these survivors essentially have the right to go to trial. Because even if the state Supreme Court grants them and sides with them here, it only just goes back down to the lower district court and then they proceed toward that trial process. So that gives you an idea of how much longer and how much more convoluted in some senses, this process could be. And to state the obvious, these survivors or 109 years old. Time is really of the essence for them if they plan to be here to see any form of resolution in this case. And I asked one of these survivors, because I sat down with one of them, 109-year-old Viola Ford Fletcher, about why she keeps showing back up to court because she's had to come in time and time again over the past years. Even on her birthday, last year, she was sitting in court as part of these -- as part of these case proceedings. Take a listen to some of what she told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think, by now, most people should know, wear these, not these, right? I mean, you need to wear the proper eclipse glasses. I think most people know that by now. But the problem that the American Astronomical Society is finding is that now there's quite a few counterfeits out there. And so it can be tough to know if you're trying to purchase some eclipse glasses online now, which ones are real and which ones aren't. You can go to reputable Web sites, like CNN.com, NASA, or places like that. But there's also an at-home test that you can do. And basically, it's quite simple.
