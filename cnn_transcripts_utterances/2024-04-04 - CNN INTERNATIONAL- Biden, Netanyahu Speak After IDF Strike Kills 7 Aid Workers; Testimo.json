We begin with the roughly 30-minute phone call between what sources say was an increasingly frustrated President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That call focused on the IDF strikes that killed seven aid workers delivering desperately needed food in Gaza on Monday. The pressure on Biden to deliver not just forceful words, but an actionable consequence for Israel's deadly military failure appears to be at an all-time high. The White House says he made clear to Netanyahu the strike was unacceptable and demanded, quote, specific concrete and measurable steps to prevent humanitarian suffering and to protect civilians and aid workers.

You have the U.S. president here though, however, saying this is unacceptable, this strike on the World Central Kitchen and it clearly, the U.S. does not believe Israel is doing enough. I just spoke to an Israeli government spokesman there who did not seem to be open to that criticism, right? Seemed to be pairing it. Do you see any movement, but by the Israeli government on this, despite pressure from its strongest, closest ally? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  We certainly need to see some type of movement. And I think the challenge was laid out in your discussion that just preceded this, which is the IDF has got a trust and confidence issue not only with those that are trying to provide aid but certainly in terms of the rest of the globe looking at how the IDF is prosecuting this. The point I'm making is Hamas has got to be destroyed. We can put that smack dab in the middle of the table. And what needs to be done as they need to be rooted out. And leadership need to be found wherever they hide, and they need to be -- they need to be eliminated. The challenge is, the IDF can come forward at this point, say, okay, we made a mistake and clearly, this is a mistake. This was not a targeted intentionally (AUDIO GAP). This was a grave mistake. This is incredibly unfortunate across the board and there are damages in this type of warfare. But the deal is the IDF needs to come forward and say, okay, let's create a safe zone, let's create a no fire area. Let's protect in terms of creating routes times for distribution, lets establish what the procedures look like, and then lets established very specific points on the ground where distribution then needs to be handed off in a very specific way so that the aid workers are not, again, exposing themselves unnecessarily into the depths of this fight, where these kinds of conditions can take place irrespective of the coordination efforts that must take place. So it really is a matter of trust at this point, if the IDF raised a hand. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't, that raised a hand at this point, said, we want to try to fix it. I don't know that they're going to have a very easy time doing that.",

And you had a -- what I would call to the Israelis, a more credible victim. They don't trust the U.N. aid agency, that U.N. aid agency doesn't trust Israel.But the World Central Kitchen has fed both Israelis and Gazans. And the IDF was increasingly leaning on them to get aid in there. So I think that's why you heard from Kirby today when he spoke from the White House briefing room, that the Biden administration expects to see some sort of announcement on changes in procedures in, quote, the coming hours or the coming days. They want Israel to come out and say, here's what we're changing. And I think your interaction with the government spokesman shows a little bit of the difference in how the IDF is treating this versus how the Netanyahu government is treating this.

They were waving white flags. They were shot. And there are other instances and targeting where, listen, civilians have been killed and you wonder how much, how much they abided by, what at least, or the public rules, rules of engagement by the IDF.

You can't have a bunch of dudes hanging over a Mac in isolation saying, pull the trigger on this or pull the trigger on that. That's where you have a challenge.

CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  I have said and others have said, if Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister, were to order the IDF into Rafah at scale. They were to drop thousand pound bombs and send in a battalion to go after Hamas and make no provision for civilians or for humanitarian aid that I would vote to condition an aid to Israel. The challenge is to make it clear that we support the Israeli people, that we want to and will continue to have a strong and close relationship with Israel.

But what we want is a ceasefire that sticks. And if Hamas isn't willing to agree to it, and they attack and Israel is going to respond. I will say to Senator Coons' point, I think we're getting to the point where yes, President Biden will have to apply greater pressure than he has and potentially that may mean conditioning some of the assistance that he has been giving because Israel is not doing enough to allow humanitarian assistance in. They are not doing enough to protect the humanitarian assistance that is in there as the incredible tragedy of the strike in the World -- I'm sorry, on the World Food Kitchen shows.

So Johnson is still imagining that there's some other solution. But as you've seen, even to this moment, no other option has been presented by the House Republicans.

These are interviews with three top State Department officials who were called in, in the days after the Taliban took over Kabul. They were called in from their jobs that had nothing to do with Afghanistan, to go help run this evacuation.They said they were basically coming up with plans on the fly. One of them described creating tactical operations from scratch to try to get Americans, and these Afghan allies to the airport as the Taliban was putting up significant roadblocks to their access to that Hamid Karzai Airport. Now, we know, Jim, that this had been a chaotic and deadly, and awful situation, but these new documents really just give these details even more texture there. They are talking about coming in with no established evacuation plan in place. Once they got on the ground, they're working around the clock to try to get these people out there working to establish plans and then re-established plans as those plans do not work. It really just goes to show how so much chaos there really was there. And this lack of preparation for what they described as an unprecedented event. One of the top officials there, John Bass (ph), said that he isn't sure if it would have mattered if there had been a plan in place because this was just beyond the scale and complexity of what anyone could have imagined. Now, you'll recall, Jim, that the State Department has come under fire from the U.S. military, from the top commanders who were in charge of the military at the time, saying it was a problem that they did not call for this noncombat in evacuation operations sooner.

He thinks that's why Republicans lost in 2022 and he thinks anyone who campaigns solely on abortion is going to have a hard time. So what we do know is that when he made that announcement, he'd be giving a statement that surprised even some of his closest advisers who did not know that they were going to be putting out a statement. We also know that he's been in various conversations and debates privately over what exactly he would say if he did have to take a permanent, indefinite stand on abortion. One of the things he has been talking two different advisors about is whether or not he should back a national abortion ban. He has floated the idea of backing a 15 week abortion ban. There are a lot of people on the right side of Donald Trump who believed that is what he should do. Now, on the other side, there are a lot of people who think you shouldn't weigh in at all. He should pump this to the states, that it is better politically for him to get out of this as a national issue to say its states rights, that's what we were fighting for this whole time.
