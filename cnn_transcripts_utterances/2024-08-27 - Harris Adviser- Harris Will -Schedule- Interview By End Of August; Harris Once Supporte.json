As she prepares to return to the campaign trail with a bus tour through Georgia tomorrow.Plus, free after 326 days. Israel's military says it rescued a hostage held captive in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack on October 7. CNN is live in Tel Aviv with the breaking details. And he'll do anything for Trump. That's why Kash Patel is expected to be a key player in second Trump term. That's also why former Trump officials are worried. I'm Manu Raju. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start with Kamala Harris's next big test, a major TV interview. The vice president said, it would be quote scheduled before the end of the month, that's of course, four days from now. And this will be a major moment for the vice president, who spent her five-week campaign doing mainly scripted events. And it comes as she prepares for another crucial post-convention moment. The September 10 debate with Donald Trump, which will hopefully remain on the schedule. CNN's Eva McKend has been talking to the Harris campaign. So, Eva, what are you hearing?",

The vice president says the housing shortage can be addressed by building three million new homes and rentals. That seems to be a way the campaign is trying to thwart the persistent criticism from all corners regarding the lack of a sit- down interview and the absence of aggressive questions from the press.Ian Sams, a campaign adviser speaking to us earlier this week, and he said that she is in fact, going to sit down for an interview at the end of the month. And then he also noted in their defense, that she is regularly taking questions from reporters on the campaign trail. That isn't sort of a fulsome interview, though, that would answer these big policy questions, like why she has shifted on immigration. And that is something that the press really has a desire to have answers for. Meanwhile, Manu, the vice president and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, they're going to be launching a bus tour across South Georgia tomorrow, concluding with a Thursday night rally around Savannah. Georgia, of course, remains a critical battleground state, and while there's tremendous focus on voters of color in urban centers. They are also focused on capturing those voters so key to the Democratic coalition in rural communities as well. Manu?",

Nice to see all of you.Look she could have come out and had some more interviews early on. Of course, the Democrats will defend her position on all this, saying, look, she's just a candidate. She had to prepare for convention. We had to get all the machinery of a campaign in place in a matter of days. Fine, that's true. But also, to someone who's been on the public scene for some time and can answer questions, has well formulated positions.

They have been pushing their message out. They have just gotten through the DNC.

But there are things that she has said in the past that she's going to have to answer for. And that she suggested -- her campaign has suggested she has changed her position on the issue of fracking.For instance, she said that she -- before in the past in 2019 when she was a primary candidate running for the Democratic nominations, she said she was opposed to fracking. She's changed her position on that issue, Medicare for all, single-payer healthcare. She had been open to Medicare for all. Now, her campaign is saying on background, I mean, not unnecessarily on the record, not from the candidate herself that she is no longer in favor, that those are complicated questions, explain how she reconciles her current views with her past views.",

She has this opportunity to kind of change the narrative, because there is not this instant recollection of something she just said in January of this year. But again, as you said, there are still questions about how you can go from A to B, particularly make those kinds of tight turns at a time where obviously Pennsylvania might be the most critical state, fracking very important in Pennsylvania to change your opinion on that and then not answer questions. And that's obviously what you're hearing from Republicans. And the Trump campaign. I'm not sure that the narrative is loud enough from Republicans and the Trump campaign at this point to try and force her to do something. As you said, Democrats are pretty happy with the way things are going right now, but she has now said that she's going to do an interview by the end of the month.

This is only the fourth time that the Israeli military has successfully rescued hostages alive from Gaza, but it is the first time that we have seen them do so in an underground operation. And all of the other cases, the hostages were rescued from above ground locations in homes and buildings in the Gaza Strip. Now, once he was rescued from that tunnel, we then saw video of him with Israeli soldiers in what appears to be a home or a building in the Gaza Strip. And then he was taken by helicopter to Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel, where doctors there evaluated him to be in good medical condition. That's also where he was finally reunited with his loved ones, including several of his brothers, who said that they had started to lose hope that their brother might even return from Gaza alive. And then suddenly today, they got the phone call that they had been waiting for, for nearly 11 months. Telling them to go to Soroka Medical Center, where they were finally able to embrace their brother. We're told that he asked about his other family members. He was told that everyone is doing well.
