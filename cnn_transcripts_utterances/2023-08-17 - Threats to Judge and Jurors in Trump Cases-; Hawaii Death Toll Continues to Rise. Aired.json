President Biden, the first lady, they will be heading to Maui on Monday to see the devastation firsthand. Last hour, Sara spoke with the White House press secretary, who laid out the message that Biden will be delivering when he arrives.

And he described it as a catastrophic scene. I also just want to mention something that has really stuck with me over the past several days. The governor compared the zone that is currently being searched to searching through the rubble of a war zone or searching through the rubble that was left behind at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks. That's what we're talking about here. That's what 40 cadaver dogs are currently searching through in order to find any possible human remains. Now, the governor has also told us that there is evidence that there was young children that were found in that area. He described coming upon a car that had two people in the front and two small bodies in the back. He was saying that that was likely a family that was trying to get out and didn't make it out. Now, I'm standing just outside of the checkpoint here into Lahaina. And just in an hour or so, it's going to open up, allowing residents, workers and volunteers into the town for the day -- Kate.",

And there are active hot spots still over a week after the initial blaze broke out. You can see that chopper in the distance is from the Maui Fire Department. He's got a bucket dangling below, and, with that precision, dipping it into swimming pools and dropping it on smoldering hot spots in these canyons. There was worry that, if the winds cranked up again, it could start a whole new firestorm up here. Here he is coming right now. This is really the only official presence we have seen, even this long after the initial fire. While we have heard reports that they were going to double the number of National Guardsman and maybe even some Coast Guard to come up and work on the fires, we haven't seen any evidence of that yet. We are seeing actually a couple of folks from FEMA vests talking to homeowners about how to get them into the system for a one-time cash payout and maybe some support on housing repairs. But if this is your house, there is no repair right now. There is opportunity to get a low-interest loan for maybe half-a-million dollars. And we are hearing reports of sort of vulture predatory real estate speculators calling people, especially down in Lahaina, looking to buy their property at the most stressful time of their lives. That's brought a lot of local rage over that. And even the governor says he's going to have the state attorney general make sure no one is taken advantage of right now. But there are so many concerns on so many levels now, the mental health, the physical health, the water supply of Lahaina, which is tainted from all that PVC pipe melting and all those chemicals leaching into the ground. Insurance claims, of course, will start to roll in as well. The big fires in California did real damage to insurance markets there. Who knows how this will play out, given a couple thousand structures that were burned. But so many places are going to be starting from scratch. And that is probably the message the president will receive when Joe and Jill Biden come here on Monday, but, in the meantime, so many people wondering about that fatality number and how quickly it'll jump and how high.

They were published in the indictment that was released earlier this week. And, as a result now of doing their civic duty, their lives are in danger. And it was overnight that we learned from Donie O'Sullivan that far right individuals, anonymous individuals, are calling for violence against the Fulton County jurors. And, in some cases, some of their addresses purportedly belonging to some of these jurors made their way online, including social media profiles, photos. CNN cannot independently verify those posts. We're not naming the Web site where they appeared, but the names of some of those jurors appear to match the official names given on that indictment. So far, those Fulton County jurors have not spoken publicly, but security continues to be something that's a main issue for those tied to the legal process here. We are also learning of a Texas woman who's currently in custody after threatening to kill the judge that is overseeing Trump's federal election case, that judge receiving a phone call in her chambers on August 5. We should mention the judge is black. And the phone call not only said: \"We are\" -- it says -- quote -- \"You are in our sights. We want to kill you.\" But it also included some racist language. DHS special agents caught up with that woman three days later. She's currently in pretrial detention. We're currently outside the Fulton County Jail, where we are waiting for those 19 defendants to turn themselves in, including the former president. We understand, according to our Alayna Treene, that the -- Trump's team is currently negotiating with the Fulton County district attorney.

No, the calendar might be the newest figure to enter the 2024 presidential race. And here's why. We are less than a week away from the first 2024 Republican presidential primary debate, just as the clear front-runner who may or may not show up is facing a slew of legal issues. Donald Trump is now facing 91 criminal charges, remember, across four separate indictments. And then add in two civil trials as well. And here are how things are lining up. On October 2, New York's attorney general goes to trial against Trump and his civil fraud case. Three months later, January -- on January 2, the Justice Department wants to kick off its 2020 election subversion case against Trump. On January 15, then, a judge wants to start the trial in the second defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Fulton County DA Fani Willis, she has just asked the judge to set a trial date of March 4 in Georgia's election case against Trump. March 25, then, is the day scheduled to begin the criminal trial in New York over Trump's 2016 hush money scheme. Then jump ahead, if you can, even, to late May. The federal criminal trial over Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents is set to begin. Sum it all up, it's jam-packed. It's also not set in stone.

HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  I wish I could. This -- it would be ideal if there were some kind of organizing force. But we're talking about -- this is federalism. We're talking about New York, Georgia, the federal system, two different judges. It is bedlam. And Kate nails it. I think the calendar has become a supporting actor in this drama. And let me add one detail. Fani Willis has asked for her trial to start in March. She -- this is a RICO case. The last RICO case she tried -- and it had eight defendants -- went for six months. So, it's -- something's got to give. More than one thing has to give. But it won't necessarily be according to what makes most sense.

So, then the sitting Republican governor of Georgia, his response to that social media posting was this: \"The 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. For nearly three years now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward under oath and prove anything in a court of law. Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible and fair, and will continue to be as long as I am governor. The future of our country is at stake in 2024.

His approach when he ran for reelection and won was to try to just talk about issues like the economy and other things that just avoid this Trump mess. That was -- that Tuesday tweet was his first shot off the bow. And it infuriated -- I know, from my sources that it infuriated a lot of the Trump camp in Georgia.
