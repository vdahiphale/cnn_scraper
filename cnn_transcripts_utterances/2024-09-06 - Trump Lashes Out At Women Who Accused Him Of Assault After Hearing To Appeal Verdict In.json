The man admitted that he was planning to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage and \"break her kneecaps\" and \"if she did not confess\" to whatever he wanted to hear. Now, that's what the former president was talking about to police, the near killing of a political rival's husband. Donald Trump came close to being shot in the head and had a near-death experience and got a second lease on life and this is what he's doing with it. Earlier today, he was in New York in federal court appealing his sexual abuse and defamation judgment. And afterwards, he you talked about it. Take a look. His lawyers were behind him as he talked about E. Jean Carroll, whom a jury determined he sexually abused and defamed. He said and, \"I never met the woman other than this picture which could have been AI generated. I don't know, show up out of nowhere, but its fine, nice picture.\" Now keeping him honest, the photo that he was talking about, this photo is real and the president knows it's real because he discussed in detail under oath during a 2022 deposition, mistaking Carroll for his wife at the time, Marla Maples. Now, in addition to Carroll, he also lashed out at several other accusers, including Jessica Leeds, who says Trump groped her on a flight 1970s. \"It couldn't have happened, it didn't happen and she would not have been the chosen one. She would not have been the chosen one,\" he said. Remarks like that have earned this assessment today from former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But that's beside the point. The problem with this conspiracy theory is that this interview was actually pre-recorded and we had to pre-record a toss to a commercial break and then welcome viewers back after commercial break. So that the entire to parts of the interview would fit into my show that night. So when you do that, when you interview someone for however many minutes and then you toss to a break that will later be inserted into the broadcast. You don't sit there for the entire four minutes of the commercial break with the guest just waiting to then come back to the show. Because its pre-recorded, you don't have to sit there during a commercial break. You just take a few seconds, you make sure that control room is still recording. You welcome viewers back as if you've just come out of a commercial break and you continue with the interview. And that's exactly what I do with E. Jean Carroll. And I know this because we have the tape so while Trump is currently suggesting, I sat through a commercial break on live TV with E. Jean Carroll telling her to be angry or whatever, we actually just paused in a pre-recorded interview for a few seconds.

But Anderson, I just think it is worth pausing to recognize how Donald Trump has successfully neutralized all four criminal cases against him. This case will not be sentenced after the trial. The Florida case has been thrown out entirely, though that's on appeal. The Georgia case is a wall-to-wall disaster for the prosecution, and shows no sign of going to trial. The January 6th case is now bogged down in pretrial proceedings that may not lead to a trial even in 2025. So, Donald Trump had a very good day today legally, as far as Judge Merchan is concerned and he has had a lot of good news on these four indictments, none of which are going to go to trial or even be close to resolve before the election.",

If they believed that Kamala Harris had changed her position on fracking and not one of them felt that way.And they weren't even involved directly in the extraction of gas. These folks were involved in constructing steel buildings that go around the wellheads in support of the oil and gas industry. Anderson, the oil and gas industry in Pennsylvania provides not only jobs, but it provides hope. There are no steel mills coming. Boeing is not relocating a plant there. When oil and gas is go in big, it is good times across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Those communities flourish. People have jobs and in a place where jobs and hope is scarce, you know, taking that away from folks is really devastating.",

I mean, where does fracking lie in that?MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\": I think that it receives outsized detention I think that it's a significant issue, but I think that there's a perception particularly from a national perspective looking into Pennsylvania, that it's a referendum on a particular candidacy, that it's a be-all and it's an end-all and I don't agree with that. I think that the problem for Vice President Kamala Harris is her change of position, not necessarily where she ended up. Because it just furthers this narrative of political expediency. There's an AXIOS report today about her candidacy not receiving scrutiny and it identifies nine different issues where she's either changed her position or has an unknown position to the extent that her fracking perspective furthers that perception, it is problematic. But let me just remind my good friend, David Urban, I'm in those Philly burbs and there's nobody fracking here. So the attention always goes to those who are dependent upon the fracking industry, but where the race matters most,, people or more concerned about the environment.",

And these margins in these counties, as John pointed out in Washington County, was 60 percent I think, John, is what you pointed out? But, you know, if Trump, if Trump gets 70 percent, you know, 75 percent in these counties, that's an extra few hundred votes.And in 60 counties, there are 40 counties with fracking, and if you look at the other 60 counties up that are read, a couple of hundred votes, that's the difference in this race. I agree that the Philly and the burbs, you know, he can't lose that by too much, and it's obviously good for Kamala. You know, east of there, there's a road that differentiates Philadelphia from the rest of the state called City Line Avenue. If you go west to City Line Avenue fracking doesn't really -- fracking matters. Eastern of City Line is Philly. It doesn't matter.

This is our map right now to 270. The yellow states are the toss-up states. There are seven of them plus the second congressional district in Nebraska.Where are our polling tell us? Harris leads outside the margin in Michigan, outside the margin in Wisconsin. Doesn't mean she's going to win them. They're still competitive, but let's give them to her for now right there. Trump led outside the margin in Arizona. Again, doesn't mean he's going to win it, but let's give him that. That gets you to 252 to 230. I'm going to lean North Carolina red. Democrats are getting mad at me right now because there is some polling showing Harris maybe slightly ahead there. Until I want to see more data, I'm just going to lean it right because that's where it's been in every election since 2008 and in many before that. If you do that here's where you are. So let's say for the sake of argument, Donald Trump gets Georgia back, and Kamala Harris can hold on to Nevada, which has been mostly a Democratic state, even though it's tough right now. What's that gets you? 262-256. Nebraska would get whoever gets at one more. It would all come down to Pennsylvania. Let's flip the scenario for the sake of argument. Harris does well in the suburbs like Joe Biden. She holds Georgia. But the economic hardships after COVID in Nevada cause it to go back to Donald Trump. Same idea, 266, 252. Somebody gets that one, it still comes down to Pennsylvania. That's where we are. I can give you other scenarios where Pennsylvania doesn't matter.

KINGall the volatility in our politics and all the volatility in him that you played in that segment at the top of the program, which was breathtaking, by the way, look at Donald Trump. In these volatile times, in all the tumult we've had in our American politics, he's a straight line. He's at 49 percent in Arizona in our new poll. He was at 49 percent in Arizona. That's the result in 2020. That was the result in 2016. In Georgia, this is the one slight aberration, 47, 49, 51. If you look at these six battleground states, two elections that have been settled, these are the final results, and in our polling here, Donald Trump has never gotten the majority, except for in Georgia, once, once. He's the 47, 48, occasionally 49 guy. Now, that's significant. It's going to get you close to 50. But if you're Kamala Harris, you're thinking, I need to get to 49 point what? Right? You want to get to 50. But what is it? And how strong? In 2016, the third party candidates made the difference. When Joe Biden got out of the race, one of the reasons Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. left the race is because support for third-party candidates plummeted. So if you look at Donald Trump for all the tumult in our politics, in the battleground states, he's essentially a flat line. So Harris knows what she needs to be. Now, in some cases, it's 47 percent, 49 percent. That's hard to beat, but at least you know what the target is.",
