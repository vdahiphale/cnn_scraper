(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Jack Teixeira's family leaving federal court in Boston this afternoon, refusing to answer any questions. The 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman made his first appearance in front of a federal judge today. He's now charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and/or material. An unsealed affidavit shows that Teixeira was granted top secret security clearance back in 2021. He had high level access to the nation's most guarded intelligence and other highly classified programs. The affidavit alleges he began posting classified documents starting in 2022 and then recently, on April 6th, used a government computer to search a database using the word \"leak.\" Once it was publicly revealed that someone was leaking classified documents -- MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  This is not just about taking home documents. People who sign agreements to be able to receive classified documents acknowledge the importance to the national security of not disclosing those documents.",

The leaked classified documents included a wide range of highly classified information, including eavesdropping on key allies and adversaries and blunt assessments on the state of the Ukraine war. Investigators ultimately narrowed in on the chat group. According to a U.S. government source familiar with the case, Teixeira was under surveillance for at least a couple of days prior to his arrest. While President Biden played down the security damage on Thursday, today he released a statement, saying, in part, \"I've directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information. And our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.\" But the ultimate national security impact of the leak still to be determined.",

You think about things like extreme risk protection orders or red flag laws. Those enjoy 60 plus percent support in the United States. And even banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines enjoys majority support in this country. And so again, I think it's easy for us to say that these right wing politicians are wildly out of step with where the American people are. Because the American people have said over and over again that we can do more around gun violence, that we can respect the Second Amendment, we can respect responsible gun owners and we can also put some common sense guardrails around, you know, gun -- guns in this country so that we can actually make some meaningful progress on pushing back against the gun violence crisis that is not only plaguing this country but is unique only to this country. We are the only country on planet Earth that is experiencing this kind of epidemic. We also are the most heavily armed civilian population on planet Earth.

That is when attention focused on the crowd. And this man, this 24 year old man, is basically tackled to the ground. He was described as wearing glasses, a mask. He had a gray backpack.

And of course, significant anger being directed toward president Emmanuel Macron not only over this proposal now signed into law but also over the way in which the president chose to enforce this legislation, bypassing the lower house of parliament, where president Emmanuel Macron's party, crucially, does not have an outright majority and bypassing a final vote. We've spoken to some of those protesters who have been taking to the streets over the last few weeks, many feeling angry toward the president. They say he has undermined the democratic principles here in France by choosing to use those executive powers to force this legislation through. Of course, we have seen those protests over the last few weeks. And while they remain significant in number, they have waned somewhat. On Thursday we saw another weekly demonstration for 380,000 people taking to the streets across France and 42,000 here in Paris.

The U.S. Treasury Secretary says the economy can still dodge a recession despite the recent banking crisis. Two U.S. banks collapsed last month, raising fears they could push the economy over the edge. It happened as the Feds started to dial down its interest rate hikes, designed to tame inflation. Earlier this week, the wholesale inflation dropped to its lowest level in more than two years. In an exclusive interview, Secretary Janet Yellen told CNN's Fareed Zakaria she's cautiously optimistic. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  What people call a soft landing is possible. So I do think there's a path to bring down inflation while maintaining what I think all of us would regard as a strong labor market. And the evidence that I'm seeing suggests we are on that path. Now are there risks? Of course. I don't want to downplay the possibility that there are risks here but I do think that's possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I'm not saying that there is something there but that we are on pins and needles because it's the variables, Kim. Because at the end of the day, the U.S. economy can control what it has. But when you think about, like we said, inflation, IMF to come out, that inflation is going to be more in other countries, you don't think that's going to have an impact to the U.S.? The question becomes, as Janet Yellen mentioned, is it? How much is that? And I just feel like we're a little bit in a fragile mode. As of right now, maybe in two months it's a different conversation. But imagine there's another bank turmoil somewhere else in a different country or to that degree. I can see a scenario here in the U.S. where it has some impact and the Fed chooses to keep interest rates a little bit higher, like I can see them play with that because they don't want to go in the other way. And that's what worries me, is that there is this rhetoric of, oh, we don't know but we kind of know what may happen. And if it occurs, they're going to be prepared to tighten the fiscal policy.

This new issue is different, though. Boeing is coming clean about a defect in the manufacturing of the jet itself. The issue, Boeing says, is with a fitting in the rear part of the fuselage of some MAXes. It's manufactured by a third party. Boeing has not said exactly how many MAXes are defective, though there are about 1,000 flying worldwide, more than 300 flying in the U.S. In a statement, Boeing says this is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely. The Federal Aviation Administration, it came down hard on Boeing after the investigations into those crashes, says it has validated what Boeing says is true and is monitoring next steps. The contractor responsible for building these parts is a company called Spirit Aerosystems. And I said on Friday it's still working on an inspection and repair for affected airplanes. For now, this is not impacting travelers but mostly airlines waiting on new airplanes to be delivered and they are waiting on a fix -- Pete Muntean, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
