Nic, I do want to talk to you about some of the criticism that Prime Minister Netanyahu is facing within Israel, particularly from the right- wing factions of his coalition, essentially saying that Israel should be much more aggressive towards Hezbollah.

What we saw yesterday is not the end of the story, if you will. So it's leaving the door open for potentially more strikes. It was significant that Israel didn't strike deep into Lebanon over the weekend. Their targets were in the south. That's where they saw the threat that they were preempting over the weekend. But that, if you will, didn't sort of cross over a red line or threshold for Hezbollah, triggering them, because it's understood that they keep some of their more long-range, sophisticated weapons further away from the border of Israel, further north inside Lebanon. So there's a sense that while the Prime Minister is leaving the door open for other strikes, he's also not escalating the situation. I think the perception here is, and we're standing within line of sight of one of the targets, the intelligence headquarters that Hassan Nasrallah claimed that had been successfully targeted over the weekend by Hezbollah, there were no sound of impact -- no sign of impacts from there, no sign of smoke, no sign of any damage, nothing showed up on social media. The IDF completely denied that any military site, either in the center of Israel or in the north, was hit. So in a way for Israel at the moment, Hezbollah gave it a shot. Israel preempted it. So it feels a little bit like going back to April where Iran launched a huge number of missiles at Israel, and with their allies, Israel was able to knock most of them out of their skies. On this occasion, it was intelligence and Israel's own strikes that allowed it to defend itself they say successfully. So in a way, Hezbollah, despite what their leadership is saying and telling their people, is on the back foot on this one. But, absolutely, the small strikes across the border continue. And undoubtedly, if Israel perceives another mass missile -- mass number of missiles being ready for launching, you can be sure that they will be -- they will be trying to intercept that again before it happens.",

Reuters is appealing for more information on what happened to Ryan Evans. This 38-year-old British national again.

And on Telegram, in particular, this is an encrypted messaging app, which means that the service itself, the company doesn't have a lot of oversight or control over how users are using the platform. Law enforcement also doesn't have a lot of oversight in terms of the conversations that are happening on this platform. And that has made Telegram a really important communication tool in places like Russia and Iran where free speech is curtailed. It's become a really important tool in Ukraine for citizens to warn each other about air raids. But it also that privacy means that this platform is used by drug traffickers and money launderers, terrorist groups to communicate. And the platform has really gained growing scrutiny as it's grown. And now, as you said, has more than 900 million users. And so it will be interesting as we start to hear more from these French prosecutors about what exactly their specific concerns are. French President Emmanuel Macron saying this is part of an ongoing judicial investigation. But it will be interesting to hear what they are concerned about, what these illicit uses that they're worried about are.

Telegram itself says that the company is -- abides by E.U. law and in particular abides by the Digital Services Act, which are these new requirements for social media platforms to do even more to remove harmful content from their platforms. The E.U. has set up special agencies to investigate election misinformation. So it's clearly concerned about this. But to see the CEO arrested is a huge deal. And I think one of the things that's interesting and different about Telegram is it allows these huge group conversations on the platform, up to 200,000 users can be in a single chat. And they're these protected private conversations. Other platforms, mainstream social media networks like Metas, WhatsApp, don't allow such big groups because they're concerned about the spread of disinformation.

So just to give a little bit of context here, the original debate, when it was agreed to between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, was the same rules that we saw at the CNN debate, one of which was muting the mic when the other person wasn't talking. And I will remind you that Donald Trump's team didn't really love that. They actually thought that it would be better for Donald Trump to not have a muted mic. But as time went on, as they got closer to the debate, they thought it actually could benefit him. And here's one thing that's clear. Donald Trump's team feels really good about what happened in the last debate, and they want to really mimic those results, and that included having muted mics. So here, we're at some sort of a standoff that appears between Donald Trump's team and Kamala Harris' team. Kamala Harris' team is saying, you never agreed to the rules with us. We are a new candidate, and we want those mics to be unmuted. Donald Trump's team is saying, oh, wait, wait, wait. When we agreed to the rules that Joe Biden, we agreed to having muted mics. Now here's what's interesting about this. A lot of this is just jockeying on each side for each candidate, because I'll remind you what happened a few weeks ago, when Donald Trump pulled out of the debate, because Kamala Harris was at the top of the ticket, you heard Harris' camp saying, wait, you already agreed to this debate. Donald Trump's camp saying, well, it's totally different now. Now the sides have reversed. Essentially, everybody wants what's best again for their candidate. Of course, the big question now being, what's going to happen on September 10th? Are they both going to show up? And right now, they just appear to be in a standoff about this one issue. Moving forward, it appears that they both want to debate, but how they overcome this will wait and see. Don't think it's very helpful to Donald Trump's campaign to have him go out there and kind of undercut everything that they're saying, and essentially say, oh, no, I'd prefer to have the debates unmuted. But also we know about Donald Trump, he never wants to appear like he can't do something. So the idea that he would get out there and say, oh, I can't do it if the mics are unmuted, it's not something you're ever going to hear from the former president.",

But Harris has to be especially enthusiastic that a lot of first-time donors and those maybe who typically wouldn't give are chipping in $5, $10, $25. I mean, that is certainly good because it reflects the energy within the Democratic base. I mean, obviously, money is very important. To a large extent, most of these funds are just canceling each other out. I mean, Pennsylvania, for example. It's impossible to turn on the TV without saying an ad for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris or one of their super PACs. But at the same time, if you're not raising that money, if you don't have it, then you can really get beat in some of these swing states.

That's -- and that's putting aside the conventional superiority that the Israelis have. Hezbollah is in a situation now where it's still recovering from its involvement in the Syrian civil war. And then two years after that, right, after 2017, where major operations in Syria ended -- Lebanon's economy collapses. Now Lebanon is also in a -- in a position of political stalemate, where Hezbollah to compound that with security conflagration, a destructive war of unprecedented scale with the Israelis.

And, yes,it's correct that Hezbollah began operations unprovoked against Israel began these attacks on October 8th. They've admitted as much. They've tried to kind of thread the needle later, but the Israelis were preventing an attack that was in the offing. So it's not exactly an unprovoked strike by the Israelis. At the same time, look, the Israelis, when they assassinated Fuad Shukr, the way they assassinated him publicly, they claimed it. They did it in Beirut in Hezbollah's stronghold in South Beirut. And the intelligence capability that they demonstrated. There were been reports that he was lured to his demise by a cell phone call minutes earlier. This demonstrated a large and sophisticated capability on behalf of the Israelis and added insult to injury. Basically they humiliated and embarrassed Hezbollah in addition to knocking off their top commander. Hezbollah had to do something that was commensurate with this Israeli offense, let's call it. And at the same time, they have to navigate the situation that we discussed earlier, this lack of desire for war. So they had to thread the needle very carefully to cause the Israeli's pain, but at the same time, not give the Israelis sufficient legitimacy to broaden their campaign in Lebanon. Now, what they're doing now is claiming a success for this operation where there was no success.

And yesterday, he also reiterated this point again that Hezbollah will continue attacking, that it remains undeterred in continuing to attack until a prior ceasefire in Gaza is achieved. Now, this doesn't mean that Hezbollah isn't suffering. They're stuck between this promise that they've made to continue attacking.

But they've gone even a step further suggesting that one of the reasons for a ceasefire now is not because it'll lead to a long-term ceasefire or detente with Hezbollah, but quite the opposite, that it would give Israel the opportunity to regroup its forces and perhaps then focus once again on what many of you as an -- as an inevitable great war against Hezbollah, perhaps even larger than the last one we saw in 2006.",
