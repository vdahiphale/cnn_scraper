Now, Sevastopol is the major naval port on Crimea, Crimea illegally occupied and annexed by Russia.So, Ukrainians so far are not saying that they didn't do it. The British ministry of defense saying it's an absolute fabrication that anyone from the U.K. was involved in this. But the pretext Russia is giving it saying, look, this means that those humanitarian food corridors in the Black Sea where all of these big ships taking the grain in and out of the -- in and out of Ukraine's ports through the Black Sea out to the international community, Russia is saying, that puts all of that in danger. Ukrainian officials are pointing out, well, you know what? That port in Sevastopol is 150 miles away from those grain corridors. I think it's worth remembering here that the deal when it was struck by the U.N., and it took a lot of effort to do it last summer, it came into effect beginning of August. Russia was actually enticed into the deal by getting some breaks on sanctions. And this is part of what brought Russia into the deal -- two separate deals the U.N. made, one between -- one between the U.N. and Russia and one between the U.N. and Ukraine. Back then, the deal was expected to allow about 20 million tons of grain get -- to get into international markets, only 9.1 million tons of grain have gone so far. And from the Ukrainian perspective, this really feels like Russia is trying to find another pressure point like it has done with nuclear weapons, like it has done over targeting electricity supplies here to get the international community to pressure Ukraine into agreeing to President Putin's terms of peace which are unacceptable to Ukraine and its international backers.

Oren Segal is vice president at the Anti-Defamation League center of extremism. A pleasure to have you on, sir, thank you so much for your time. As I understand it, you are part of a first-of-its-kind study that tracked and evaluated the threats to local officials across the country. You did this at Princeton University. Just give us a highlight of the things that you found that really stuck out to you. OREN SEGAL, VICE PRESIDENT, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE, CENTER ON EXTREMISM: Yes. So, threats to harassment of local officials is a clear and present danger to democracy in America. The ADL bridging divides initiatives at Princeton report look that threats over the last couple of years to education officials, health officials, election officials, and found that whether it's harassment or threats of violence. This has been a serious concern throughout the country. And it's often motivated by the conspiracies that we're hearing every single day. WALKER: When did we see this rise and threats and violence? Where did it start?",

So the idea of stolen election narratives and the ability for those to animate people in online spaces, and then have real-world consequences, frankly, was not studied until this point. So, what we did was look at thousands of data points of real-world activity.And our hope is that in order to help protect our democracy moving forward, we need the data to be able to explain how is this happening, where is it happening, and we hope that as the data increases, we will have real strategies to prevent this. Because at the end of the day, the numbers in this report are telling us that trust in our democracy is eroding and that we need to get ahead of it before it's too late.",

Remember, it's mostly going to be in the first half of the day, so we're hoping we can get that all cleared out by the time the trick-or-treaters arrive. And yes, this is the same system. We're talking about the produced the severe storms yesterday, nine -- in total, nine separate severe tornado reports in the last 24 hours. This is the system we're talking about.Today, the good news is the severe threat has gone down. Our main focus is really just going to be all of the rain. It's going to be ever so slowly sliding from the southeast into areas of the Ohio and Tennessee River Valley. And that's where it's going to stay for the most part today before finally starting to shift off to the east and north as we head into Halloween day. So, for Monday, yes, unfortunately, there are going to be a lot of spots that are dealing with those rain showers in the forecast. The bit of good news is we're not talking torrential downpours by any means. Most of these areas are looking at about one inch of rain total over the next 24 to 48 hours. You may have a couple of pockets there, they get up to two inches but again, overall, most of this rain is really going to be on the low end, outside of that relatively nice weather across the central portion of the country for Halloween day. We also have that separate system making its way into the Pacific Northwest. But yes, if you live in cities like Cleveland, Louisville, and Raleigh, you may have some rain chances for trick or treating.",
