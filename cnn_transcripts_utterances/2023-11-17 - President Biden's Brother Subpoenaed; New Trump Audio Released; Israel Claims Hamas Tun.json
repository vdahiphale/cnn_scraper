We expect President Biden to be here shortly meeting with the president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. And, of course, migration is going to be a huge topic for them to cover, and it's something that's impacting really both countries. I have spent a lot of time in Mexico in recent months. They're dealing with the influx of migrants coming through most of Latin America and then coming up, waiting within Mexico to get here into the U.S. And so that, of course, is causing, as you point out, a huge strain on our Southern border. I spent some time in the past couple of weeks in San Diego County with landowners who are right at the border with Mexico. They're frustrated, they feel helpless, and I give you a sense now of what we saw as we were down there. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (voice-over):  For years, migrants who crossed illegally would run from law enforcement, terrified to be caught. Here, we watched them run to them, eager to be processed, knowing they will be released in a few days to await court dates that could be years away. It all seems so orderly. They're given a tag for their carry-on, line up to show their documents, which are then scanned using an app, the men handcuffed to each other before boarding. After what can be several days in CBP custody, the migrants are then bused north into San Diego. Each day, several hundred are released at this makeshift logistics hub funded by San Diego County. It's here nonprofits help coordinate travel to other cities.",

Inside Al Shifa, a doctor tells Al-Jazeera the majority of ICU patients on ventilators have died. The doctors warn that the lack of water and electricity also leaves little hope for the premature babies in their care. The U.N. is calling on Israel to grant access to investigate IDF claims that it found an operational Hamas tunnel inside that hospital complex, as well as a snatch of guns, grenades, and other combat gear. Hamas is rejecting the claim as baseless lies. CNN cannot independently verify the claims of either side. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv.

But I think, given the situation, that's unlikely right now.And that's because Israel has a deep-seated distrust for the United Nations. Instead, it's on Israel, and we have seen the international pressure, to put out more evidence that this tunnel is in fact a Hamas operative tunnel, as they have said it is, and not simply a tunnel of some part of the infrastructure of the hospital itself. Israel revealed those photos and images yesterday, and they promised more are to come. That is the focus of the effort in the Al Shifa complex. And we have geolocated that tunnel entrance to the Al Shifa Hospital complex. But, obviously, we can't see inside. We don't know how extensive it is. We don't know how far down it goes. Those are the sorts of questions that we either need to see ourselves or the IDF needs to present convincing evidence of before we know that this is truly what Israel has asserted for years is there, and that is what they have called Hamas terror infrastructure. It's worth noting, Pam, it's not just the IDF's credibility, Israel's credibility that's on the line here, the U.S. and President Joe Biden very much throwing their weight behind Israel, saying they have independent information and intelligence that Hamas has built facilities underneath the hospital itself.",

Her husband had been murdered. And the second just released a few hours later from the IDF was 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano. Her body was also found and brought back to Israel for identification. Her family had been notified several days earlier that the IDF believed she was no longer, in fact, alive. It is the concern over the hostages that has driven a march from the families of the hostages that started not far from where we're standing in Tel Aviv.

MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PLANS AND STRATEGY:  Well, from the appearance it is, but I think, as Oren said, it needs to be objectively analyzed. Somebody needs to get in there, take pictures, confirm where it is. I'm surprised that they haven't gone in yet, but I suspect they will. And I think we're going to find out it is.

Again, I think this is good to see this, but I don't think it's persuasive. If you're for this war, you're going to say, look, this is all staged. This is probably equipment they picked up.

We are expecting them to take out these attacks inside of Iraq. If we do this unilaterally, it could bring down the Sudani government.

It is the period during which prosecutors have been investigating him for not paying his taxes on time. He has since satisfied those tax liens from the IRS, but this investigation has been now ongoing for over five years. This investigation has looked into everything from money laundering, whether he violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, the FARA law, as it's known, and what we know -- we don't know exactly the scope of this investigation as it stands, but this is a big indicator that David Weiss is getting ready possibly to seek charges against the son of the president, and that could happen anytime soon. You know from covering these things that bringing this thing to a grand jury is a huge, huge step. And so we don't know when these people are being asked to show up. We don't know when they might turn up for testimony, but this is a big indicator that we're nearing an inflection point of this investigation, Pamela.",
