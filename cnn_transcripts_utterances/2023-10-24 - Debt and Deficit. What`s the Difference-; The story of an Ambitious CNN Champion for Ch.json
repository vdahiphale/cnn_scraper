      "sentences": "America lives on borrowed money. That`s why the term debt and deficit get thrown around so much. Let`s first start withour definitions. In a given year, a country will raise money through taxes and spend money on everything that a government spends money on. If it spends more than it takes in, the difference is called a deficit. And the government has to borrow money to pay for it. Now, this leads us to debt and not just any debt, but the debt. The debt is the total sum of government owes. In other words, a deficit is your dirty dish from last night. The debt is your sink. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

To give you some perspective, the richest man in America, Elon Musk is worth 180 billion, according to Forbes, nowhere near the U.S. deficit. How much is a trillion dollars? Well, if you were to stack $1 bills on top of each other, 1 trillion of them would reach nearly 68,000 miles high. That would be into outer space, almost a third of the way to the moon. So what`s happening? According to a lead, U.S. economist Bernard Yaros more than 40% of the recent increase in our national deficit can be attributed to lower revenues from taxes, more spending on programs, such as social security and Medicare also playing a part. As for our current national debt, it`s well over 30 trillion. Check out this interactive article on CNN`s website. Writer, Tami Luhby, compares U.S. debt to snow. Starting with this small snowball in 1922, it represents 408 billion. Over the years, the debt snowball kept growing, literally snowballing passing 10 trillion in 1998, and 30 trillion by the end of 2022, as the U.S. government spent more money than it collected. The article puts that growing debt into perspective with this graph and breaks down the government`s spending for the fiscal year 2022, $6.27 trillion or about $1.38 trillion less than it collected. You can take some time to scroll through the article yourself to learn more about the deficit and debt. We`ll leave a link under this episode on our YouTube channel. Ten second trivia. In addition to Halloween, which of these holidays will be celebrated next week? Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Dia de los Muertos or Labor Day? Dia de los Muertos is a Mexican holiday extending over the first two days of November. And it honors the lives of deceased loved ones. Who`s excited for Halloween? It`s the most wonderful time of the fear. And it`s one week from today. I`m so excited. I candy hardy wait. I`m not going to wear my mullet this year, though, if I`m creeping it real. This is one of my favorite looks. My costume this year is eerie resistible, though. A survey conducted for the National Retail Federation shows that the top costume picks this year for kids are Spider-Man, a Princess or a ghost. And for adults, a witch, a vampire or Barbie, a majority of people said they will be handing out candy and about half planned to dress up or decorate. The survey also found that Halloween spending could reach an all-time record high of 12.2 billion as more and more people are getting into the spirit ready to party and trick or treat in full spooktacular, free pandemic style. Booya.
