At least four people killed, 73 others injured in the attacks. Those number, really, could rise. There is a huge rescue effort under way at this very moment. We'll get an update when we can.Sara. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Just awful. All right. The Biden administration has launched a website for its new income driven Student Loan Repayment Plan. It comes after the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's debt forgiveness program last month. And just a few months before borrowers are set to begin making payments again. CNN's Arlette Saenz is live Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Look, can you give us a sense of when people can actually start applying for this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. Well, the applications are actually open now as this beta website launched just yesterday. Now, the Department of Education launched this beta website, which gives them a sense to address some issues that could arise over this process as the full launch of the website is set to occur in August. But those applications are open and people can begin submitting them now.Now, this is just the latest step that the White House is taking to try to offer some relief to student loan borrowers. This plan is not as sweeping as President Biden's student loan forgiveness program which was blocked by the Supreme Court, but it does try to help people on an issue that matters, especially to young voters. So, if you take a look at some of the details of this plan, this plan would be based on people's income and their family size. It only applies to federal student loans. Private loans are not a part of this. But there are some borrowers who could see their monthly payments wiped down to $0 a month. That includes individuals who are making roughly less than $33,000 a year, and families of four who are making less than roughly $67,000 a year. Another key component of this plan is that interest would no longer accrue on these federal student loans if people continue to make their monthly payments. And in a year when this program is in full effect, some borrowers could see their payments cut in half. So, this is one of those proposals that they're rolling out as that October deadline approaches for when student loan payments will resume after that three year pause due to the pandemic.",

There have been similar programs that the Department of Education has implemented in the past. Congress has given them authority to base these plans based on income. And these plans that have been released in the past, all the way going back to 1994, none of them have faced a successful legal challenge. So, officials are pretty optimistic that this program will be in place for the long haul.",

Also, you know, perhaps declining immunity, both from people not having gotten boosters recently, which makes sense.

A lot of times, content moderation policies change, they change on the fly, they change in response to Elon Musk's attitude that day. But without inconsistent rules, it's really hard for partners of Twitter, including advertisers to feel that this platform is a brand safe place.Now, of course you'll recall when he was first blocked from Twitter after antisemitic content was posted, Elon Musk said he tried but there was nothing he could do at this point. He has not yet commented on why he has changed his mind. But Twitter has told \"The Wall Street Journal\" that they will not allow any monetization of this account. Meaning, you can't run ads against it because it has violated some of its rules. BERMAN:  That's interesting.

Your account can back but you can't necessarily monetize it. Similar to when YouTube brought Donald Trump's account back earlier this year, it's that they can't necessarily put ads around it. But the key thing here is, John, a lot of times platforms don't want to say explicitly how many months you're going to be banned or what those terms are going to be looking like because they don't want people to take advantage of the system and to gain the system.The problem is it does feel as though Elon Musk is trying to bring the, sort of, inconsistent approach where for the people he likes, some rules apply. The people he don't -- he doesn't, other rules apply. And that level of inconsistency has become a very serious business headache for Twitter.",

You can't just erect a major sign without getting the necessary permits involved. Doing something like that could have dangerous for pedestrians trying to cross the street.And so, now, he's facing some blowback from city officials there. And that's important, John, because you'll note that Twitter is facing so many legal headaches in the City of San Francisco with paying its rent.
