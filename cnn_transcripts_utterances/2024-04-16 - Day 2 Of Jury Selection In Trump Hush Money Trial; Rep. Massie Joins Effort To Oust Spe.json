This is a very, very tedious process, very lengthy one.One juror was asked this question about what her opinion of Donald Trump in fact was. Here's how she responded. \"I don't really have one, especially in this courtroom. I think he will be treated as anybody else and no one is above the law. So I am here to hear the facts on both sides.\" And remember, this is a potential juror. She may be in that room right now among the 18, but that doesn't mean that she'll actually sit.",

And another bill that includes other policy measures, including a ban could -- something that could eventually lead to a ban on TikTok. But here's the catch, is expected that the House will use a parliamentary maneuver to essentially put all those bills together in one package and send that over to the Senate. And that is what's causing a lot of angst within the GOP ranks. A lot of Republicans particularly on the hard right have said there should not be another dime for Ukraine. They do not want to tie this to aid to Israel. Democrats, the White House want it all tied together because of what they say is an essential such an emergency for Ukraine. They say that this money is needed right now. Now, this all comes, of course, as the threat to push out Mike Johnson is growing. In fact, Thomas Massie, the -- who is a Kentucky Republican announced behind closed doors that he would support this effort by Marjorie Taylor Greene to push out Mike Johnson from the speakership, any called on Johnson directly to resign.

The federal government says, no, this is sort of a -- this -- after the word otherwise, is a bit of a catch all phrase, and this can cover anyone that was involved in January 6, who knew that official proceeding was going on and tried to disrupt it. Now, Dana, I have to say the questions from most of the justices from the conservative bloc that dominates suggest that they think the government has gone too far in its reading of the statute and that it would end up applying, as Samuel Alito said, in a hypothetical, maybe to disruptions in the Supreme Court, or maybe to peaceful protests outside.",
