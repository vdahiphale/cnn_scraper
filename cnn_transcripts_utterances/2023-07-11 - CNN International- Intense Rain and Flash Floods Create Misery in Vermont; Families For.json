And if you just joining us, let me bring up to date with our top stories this hour.Donald Trump's legal team is asking the Florida court in the special counsel's classified documents case to delay setting a trial date. Trump and the Justice Department had suggested June 18th for the first hearing in the case. And NATO leaders are arriving this hour in Vilnius, Lithuania, for a high-stake two-day summit. The allies will focus on Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and Kyiv's push to join NATO. The White House says that the group will send a united positive signal on Ukraine's path to membership but declined to provide a timetable. And while President Biden was in Lithuania, he declared a state of urgency in Vermont where flash floods are raging. They've wiped out roads and left entire communities underwater. CNN's Miguel Marquez shows us just how bad it is getting there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And then the cresting reports said the river got higher and higher and started pushing towards us. The last time the area flooded and had this much damage which was in 2011 with hurricane Irene. And then as it kept on getting closer, up to the neighbors, and been here for the last ten, 15 years, with experienced it before, and they realize it was time to start getting things off the ground in the house and trying to find places to go.",

An airport spokesperson in the Kathmandu province says the bodies haven't been identified yet, but five Mexican passengers and a Napoli pilot were on board. Nepal has it poor aviation safety record due to bad weather and dangerous mountains. Searchers continue for the sixth person who is in the helicopter with them.North Korea has accused a U.S. spy plane of entering its exclusive economic zone on Monday, but not just once, eight times. The allegations came from the sister of the leader, Kim Jong-un, who is also a senior official in the government, but she provided no evidence. According to state media, Kim Yo-jong warned that if there are repeated intrusions, the U.S., quote, will experience a very critical fight. The Pentagon denies North Korea's allegations. We're getting a remarkable look inside the secretive way Russia's president prefers to move about his country on the rails and in luxury. Documents shared with CNN reveal Vladimir Putin travels on an armored train complete with a gym, spa and even a Turkish steam bath. CNN's Matthew Chance has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A rare glimpse inside Putin's secret train, with leaked documents shown to CNN -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text translation):  It's a special train for the president. CHANCE (voice-over): -- revealing how the Kremlin leader travels amid increasingly tight security and luxury. ABBAS GALLYAMOV, FORMER SPEECHWRITER FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN (: He's surrounded by enemies and psychologically, he wants to feel protected. CHANCE (voice-over): From outside, Train No. 1, as it's dubbed in Russia, seems ordinary. Its heavily armored carriages purposely disguised with regular Russian railways paintwork and grime. State media was once allowed inside, recording President Putin meeting transport officials in a sumptuous board room. The train's other 20 or so carriages, some updated as recently as last year but remained a closely guarded secret, until now. Zircon Service is a Russian company that builds what it calls elite wagons for its clients, specializing in luxury designs for private and state corporations -- and of course, the Kremlin. Among the trove of documents including blueprints, letters and images, obtained exclusively by the Russian Investigative Dossier Center and shared with CNN, is one from Zircon Service, dated August 2018, notifying the Kremlin of a test run for what it calls the sports health wagon that's been ordered. Accompanying photos show what the Dossier Center says is Putin's private gym on board the train. As recently as last year the Kremlin was looking to upgrade the gym with American equipment to replace the Italian machines originally installed. A former member of Putin's personal protection service, who says he fitted the train's secure communications equipment before defecting from Russia, told the Dossier Center the Kremlin leader started traveling by train more regularly in the build-up to the invasion of Ukraine last year.",

Recent weeks have seen Putin more publicly engaged than he has been for years. But in his increasingly hostile world, the security and luxury of Train No. 1 may be sanctuary indeed.
