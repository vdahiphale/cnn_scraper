There was a Chaldean woman, Chaldean-American woman in Detroit who said, I'm a traditional Catholic. Tell me how I could be comfortable, someone conservative can be comfortable voting for you. She started talking about home health care. I don't think Kamala Harris is yet brave enough to sort of walk back, boldly, sort of her California viewpoints.

But in reality, they're different things.And so, if you want to get conservatives who don't like Trump to vote for Harris, you -- you're -- actually have to turn two keys, right? You have to get -- give people permission to betray their party and their ideological principles. And I think -- look, the caveat: they must be seeing something in the data to be doing what they're doing. So, they may be right and smart. We'll find out in two weeks. That said, for a lot of my friends, a lot of my circle who are very anti-Trump, but also very conservative, it would be more effective to hear Liz Cheney, who I respect enormously, say stuff like, look, I think on a bunch of issues, she's going to be really bad. You should still vote for her, because Trump is so unfit. I think that gives people permission to say, I'm a conservative, but screw the Republican Party for putting me in this position.

She has changed up the message to go back to sort of what Joe Biden's message was, which is instead of sort of dismissing Trump as a joke, she's now talking to -- talking about him as a deep threat. It's also changing the sort of events she's doing. The town hall was not a mistake. Right? I mean, she was usually just doing rallies. Now she's doing more intimate settings. And I have to say, some Democrats are also worried about her schedule. She is not going to do any public events today. She's doing two TV interviews in the afternoon, but she's not on the trail. And as of so far, she's not going to be on the trail tomorrow either, until a CNN town hall in Pennsylvania in primetime.

Should she be talking about January 6? Does anybody really care anymore? I will tell you from the data that we were working with when I was there, people do care. They do. And so, I think that, you know, in a moment in the kind of final push here where you're trying to, you know, really, like, put a board in the breach, that it does do that.
