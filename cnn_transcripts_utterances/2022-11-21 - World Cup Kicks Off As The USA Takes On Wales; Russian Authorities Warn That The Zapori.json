Tonight, the World Cup kicks off, the USA takeson Wales as we come on the air tonight, but what is it really like for football fans in Qatar? Then Russian authorities warn that the Zaporizhzhia power plant is at risk of a nuclear accident. What the IAEA is saying this very hour. And then later, Iran's protests, CNN brings you an alleged account of torture perpetrated against protesters in prison. That special CNN report just minutes from now. But first, we begin in Doha with the first full day of action at the World Cup. And as we speak, the third and final game of the day kicks off with the United States versus Wales. There's already been some dramatic action on the pitch, but there's also been as much action off the pitch. Earlier, this moving movement -- moment you can see there from Iran's players. And as you saw there, no lips moving because the team refusing really to sing their national anthem, appearing to show solidarity with the ongoing protests back home. Elsewhere, controversy over FIFA's crackdown on one love armbands. Seven European captains ultimately deciding not to wear the band after FIFA made it clear, players would be penalized. The armbands were designed to promote diversity and inclusion at the tournament. Let's get more now from our Don Riddell who is there in Doha, and CNN's sports Andy Scholes is in Atlanta. Gentlemen, great to see you both. Don, let me start with you. You are in Doha. Give us a sense of what the mood is like as this game kicks off. I think it's already kicked off 2 minutes ago, USA versus Wales, and what a match it will be. Sixty-four-year hiatus I believe for Wales.",

Yes, a huge game for the United States and Wales. The American team hasn't played in the World Cup for eight years. They heartbreakingly missed out four years ago, and remember that in four years time, they are going to be hosting the World Cup, co-hosting with Canada and Mexico. But an even longer wait for Wales, 1958 was the last time they were in the World Cup tournament. So, for similar reasons, both those teams really wanting to make the most of it. They will already be looking at how this group is shaping up. England thrashing Iran 6-2 earlier on, so I suspect England and Wales might now be thinking -- sorry, the U.S. and Wales might now be thinking that one of them is playing for a second place in this group.",

But of course, this tournament has been played on the doorstep of Iran. You were looking at pretty what was an extraordinary moment when the national team refused to sing their anthem before the game. Something like this was certainly possible. There was a lot of speculation before the game that something like this might happen. A number of other Iranian national sports teams have also refused to sing the anthem in recent days and weeks. But this, of course, being the football team at the World Cup. The biggest possible platform for them to do something like this, really was an absolutely massive moment. And we've been speaking to the fans outside the stadium before, many of them were wearing protest T-shirts of their own, some of them didn't want to be speaking with us or be seen to be speaking with us, because they believe that pro-regime spotters were in the crowd, and so they didn't want to be --",

But we did speak to one couple, and they said that they were just hoping that the players could send them asymbol, a sign, a signal that they were at the very least sympathetic to the demonstrators, many of whom have paid for this protests with their lives. And they said, it will begin with the national anthem. If they don't sing it, then we know that they are on our side. And during that moment where the anthem was not being sung, notably, the Iranian supporters nearest me seemed absolutely jubilant. They were on their feet, they were cheering, and it seemed as though to me, they were very grateful for the stance that their players had taken. But it wasn't just Iran and the national anthem. You referenced the \"one love\" armbands which have proved to be so controversial. FIFA basically shutting that down at the 11th hour. Harry Kane; the England captain would have been the first of a number of European captains to wear the armband. But in the end, it was made clear to the England team that he could have been booked for that. And while the Football Association of England said they would have been prepared to pay a fine for this, they couldn't put their players in a position where they would be booked or even dismissed from the field of play. However, the England team did take a knee before kickoff, and of course, this is something that they began to do in the wake of the George Floyd murder a couple of years ago and the rise of the Black Lives movement globally. They did that here at the start of the game, and they said beforehand that it would be a gesture of inclusivity. So it's gone way beyond just the BLM movement, and for them to speak about inclusivity here in Qatar, a country where as I say, civil and human rights are so often denied. You cannot underestimate the significance of that moment as well.",

England scoring three goals before halftime, courtesy of Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Raheem Sterling. And then they just kept pouring it on. In total, five different players scored in a 6-2 romp. It's the second largest World Cup win in England's history. It was also a night of redemption especially for Saka and Marcus Rashford who both got on the score sheet after dealing with a kind of criticism last year, for each missing penalties in the Euro final defeat against Italy. Manchester City's Jack Grealish, he rounded out the scoring, just his second-ever goal for the Three Lions. Up next, Southgate's men going to face the United States on Friday. And as we mentioned, USA right now on the field against Wales in their opening match. Still, no score, very early on in that one. Earlier, the Netherlands got their campaign off to a winning start, 2-0 win over Senegal, the African champions missing their biggest star Sadio Mane. He's been ruled out of the tournament with an injury.

So there's a lot of nervous feeling, especially because, you know, as soon as the draw was announced and we knew that big England game was going to be on Black Friday, everyone was going to be watching. The pressure has now mounted after watching what England did in their opener, winning 6 to 2. You know, the U.S. desperately needs a good result here against Wales to try to alleviate some of that pressure.

I mean, at the moment, there has been no leak of radiation. And actually, the functioning of the plant, in terms of its security has not been affected. But that's more by luck than design. And in fact, the IAEA officials talking about this today, were saying that the fighting and the shelling and the explosions are so close to the power plant that we're talking about meters, not kilometers or miles, meters away from a potential nuclear accident. So that's how stark the warnings are from the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. I mean, for their part, the Russians and the Ukrainians are both blaming each other, as you said. And as I say, this is right in the middle of the frontline in this increasingly brutal battle between these two countries. And there is very little sign at the moment that either side, despite the risks are preparing to step back and to move the fighting, somehow, away from that area which is currently by the way, under Russian occupation. And so, it's a very bleak, very dangerous situation the region is confronting.

We've come here to the Kurdish region of Iran to try and find out more. This is Hannah(ph), not her real name, a Kurdish Iranian woman recently smuggled out of Iran, she fears for her life. After taking off and burning her headscarf on the streets, she was arrested and detained by Iranian Intelligence officers.

It was in these interrogation rooms, she says, that she was assaulted and others were raped. CNN was able to locate the police station through Hannah's(ph) description, eyewitness corroboration and geo-location, using key landmarks. It's in the Islamabad neighborhood of Oromia(ph). Based on this testimony and speaking to a number of sources, a pattern of repression comes into focus. Police centers used as filtration points, moving protesters from one location to another. Often families left not knowing where their loved ones are held. One Iraq-based Kurdish militant opposition party PAC(ph), identified over 240 people who they believe are missing within this maze of detention centers. Human rights organizations believe the number is higher, in the thousands. Some of the victims as young as 14, many are men supporting female protesters. Their punishment as severe as the women's.

Soon after, whistleblowers began to post on various social media platforms. Medics sharing eyewitness accounts of what had been done to Abassi(ph). First of all, they say, there were a few plain clothes men with her and they did not let her out of their site, even during a private medical examination, they were there. \"She was my patient. I went to her bedside, they had shaved her hair. She was scared and was trembling. When she first came in, they said it was rectal bleeding due to repeated rape. The plain clothes men insisted that the doctor write that the rape was from prior to her arrest. And then after, this issue was becoming obvious to all, they changed the entire scenario altogether. The details of these leaks were confirmed to CNN by an insider at Imam Ali Hospital, where AbassI(ph) was brought to be examined. In a statement, the government said Abassi(ph) was treated for digestive problems. The medics who treated her said that was not true. The Iranian regime denies the rape, accusing her of leading protests, an allegation which could see her face the death penalty. At this usually busy border- crossing between Iraq and Iran, it is deceptively quiet. Those who can cross tell us the noose is tightening on protesters. Authorities have for decades used sexual torture against Iranians, and it appears once more, a familiar pattern. Sexual violence deployed to enforce an assertion of moral guardianship.

Now the 22-year-old suspect is also in the hospital. And we are told that he will be charged once he gets out with five counts of first degree murder, five counts of a bias-related crime. You know, investigators have been a little bit coy about saying they were treating this as a hate crime. But the community here was adamant from the beginning that this was a hate crime against the LGBT community. This is a pretty small, pretty conservative town in Colorado. There is a small LGBT community, this club one of the only places that they had to go to. They called it a safe haven. And it was until just a few minutes before midnight, Saturday, when this gunman walked in and almost immediately began shooting. Now, five people dead, at least twenty-five injured. And I've been told by people who were in there, there were maybe thirty to fifty people in there. It wasn't packed. So, a lot of the people in there physically injured, all of them, of course mentally and emotionally injured as well. Now I spoke within the past hour or so to a guy called Barrett Hudson, who was sitting at a table quite near the door when the gunman came in. Barrett turned, saw the gunman, saw him standing there with another man in front of him, the man raised his arms a little, tried to walk backwards, the suspect shot that man dead. Barrett himself was hit seven times. Seven times. Here's a little bit of what he had to tell me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Barrett Hudson, They started counting all the bullet holes. I called my dad. He's my best friend. We have a great relationship. And I called him. And that's because I want him -- I wanted to -- I wanted him to hear my voice and I wanted -- so I told him I was shot. I was bleeding out.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

His parents told the Denver Post that Daniel moved here so that he could be near them, and now he's dead. And the community here, the LGBT community, is saying, you know, we can rebuild, we can reopen the club, but how can we really recover? And they're asking, you know, why? Why do people do this? Worth noting as well that one count, Isa, has this as the 601st mass shooting in the United States this year so far. Isa.",

I believe the debate is right there right now. So, it's really powerful to see their fans protest in that way.

Obviously, it's my first World Cup, but I spoke to some people who have been to several World Cups and they were saying that they're -- this does feel a little different.

They have not been treated the same way like everyone at Twitter. So, let me start you with the beginning here, Isa. They claim they only were offered severance pay after CNN reported on their plight. And after that, they got an email in their personal emails claiming to give them what is called Ghana Mutual Separation Agreement, and it offered a seven-figure. They say this email claims to have been arrived at after a negotiation with the staff. But they say they've never actually negotiated with everyone at Twitter. In fact, they don't even have a way to contact anyone at Twitter because their emails keep bouncing back. So, they've rejected that severance pay offer. They have hired a lawyer and have written a demand notice to Twitter asking Twitter to comply with Ghanian employment laws. They're based in Accra in Ghana. They have also petitioned the chief Labor Office and the Ghana government to compel Twitter to do the right thing. Here's a portion of that notice to that official in Ghana. \"It is clear that Twitter and Elon Musk is either deliberately or recklessly flouting the laws of Ghana, is operating in bad faith and in a manner that seeks to silence and intimidate former employees into accepting any terms unilaterally thrown at them. Without pressure from higher authorities, they are clearly not willing to provide a fair or just package in order to minimize hardship of this takeover and resulting loss of jobs on their workforce in Africa.\" Some of these employees, Isa, were actually hired from Nigeria and other countries.
