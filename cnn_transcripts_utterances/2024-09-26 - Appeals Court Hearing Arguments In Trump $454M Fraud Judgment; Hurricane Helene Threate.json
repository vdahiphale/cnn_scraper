Deutsche Bank did complain when they first found out about the alleged misstatements at omissions. They raised serious concerns with defendants, said that misstatements in the financial statements would be an event of default. They asked for more information.

The trial court was very clear that it was not coming up with a magical valuation for itself. The problem with the Mar-a-Lago valuation is similar to what happened with the rent regulated apartments. The restrictions in the deed are there. They are an objective fact. They are very restrictive. And even defendant's own expert at summary judgment, this is at 16502 of the record, agreed that the restrictions would decrease the value of Mar-a-Lago, but defendants valued it as if those restrictions didn't exist at all.",

The trial court took out the repayment of the Deutsche Bank loan, and I think defendants themselves had taken out already the taxes.

This all comes down to no harm, no foul. We heard this initially. If there were no victims, so to speak, then why has Tish James even brought this case? That's the argument of Trump's attorneys.

This is why we've been moving resources into the area since Monday and having -- we know there's a large population that's really vulnerable in Florida. And so that's why we have so many search and rescue teams that are able to come in and augment the really impressive amount of teams that Florida already has within the state, right?So this is on top of what they already have. And so, for us, it's making sure that we are sending more than we think that we'll need. And if I don't need them, I can send them home. What I don't want to do is be short. I want to make sure that I have enough that can support whatever the state's my request.",

But the water is what kills people.And so, we need to really look at where this storm surge is going to be in Florida. But Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and those Appalachians, they're going to have up to 20 inches of rain in an area that can have significant flash flooding, and that is really life threatening, and it comes so much faster than what we see from a storm surge, right? They're going to have less warning once the rain starts there. So they need to know what they're going to do now. Put those plans in place today for where they're going to go, how they're going to contact their family and their friends, what they're going to need to take with them, like medicine or power devices for medical reasons. It's not too late. They should be able to put those plans together today so they can take the actions that their local officials tell them to do.",

We know from past storms that people don't always heed that, not because they don't want to, but because they can't afford to leave the area, don't have anywhere to go, don't have family members to help them. Is FEMA doing anything to work on that particular issue given what you're talking about with water and the danger that can come from that if people stay in place?",

I think the important thing on the evacuation to remember is if you're told to evacuate, especially from the storm surge area, it doesn't mean you have to go to a whole other state.And I think we often think of those pictures of contraflow lines and backed up traffic. But you really sometimes only need to go a few miles to get out of harm's way. And so the local officials should be able to tell you where there's local evacuation centers that you can go to until the threat of the storm has passed. And then when we get to the point where if they are displaced, then we have the long-term sheltering concerns that we'll have to work with. But the initial sheltering concern is just getting out of this storm's path for right now. Then we can work on what those long-term needs are. And that's why the pre-landfall declaration is so incredibly important that the president approved, is to make sure that those states have the resources to stand up those shelters and to help people get to safety.",
