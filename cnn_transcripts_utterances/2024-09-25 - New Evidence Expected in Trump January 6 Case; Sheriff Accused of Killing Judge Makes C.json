We heard him rally global support for Ukraine more than 2.5 years after Russia invaded his country and launched a war. Zelenskyy brought a chilling warning, that Russia is planning attacks on nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Here's a bit of his message to world leaders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, there are a few words like nuclear disaster that do just that.I thought it was actually quite interesting that he's trying to bring the world in part by saying it is through Western satellite image companies that Russia essentially knows how to target these nuclear power plants. Of course, we are extremely reliant on these satellite image companies to understand what is going on in this conflict. But Zelenskyy kicked off his speech by saying one of the most alarming alerts that he had gotten was in March, so just a few days -- March of 2022, so just a few days after the war began, that Russia was targeting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. That is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. And it is now under the control of the Russian forces. So he has been sounding the nuclear alarm for quite some time, but now he is really ratcheting that up. And now that we are 2.5 years into this war, Zelenskyy is trying to make sure that the world continues to stand with him, that he continues to get the support that he needs to fight against Russia. And the way that he's doing that here in New York, and I imagine he will do it again tomorrow when he meets with the president in Washington, D.C., is warning of this winter coming and one in which Russia will weaponize winter by targeting not just all of their -- Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but targeting the nuclear energy infrastructure. He said that some 80 percent of Ukrainian energy had been taken offline. All of the thermal power plants had been taken offline. And now he's saying, very worryingly, that they will be going -- that Russia will be going after the nuclear facilities in Ukraine this winter -- Pamela.",

So, Colonel, first of all, what is your take on Zelenskyy's warning that Russia is planning attacks on nuclear plants? How serious is this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, it's extremely serious, Pamela. And it's one of the things that you have to look at. The Russians have clearly targeted the energy infrastructure. And as President Zelenskyy mentioned, and Fred mentioned in his reporting, they have basically taken out all of the thermal plants. And, in Ukraine, as in a lot of former Soviet states, they have thermal power as being one of the key energy sources. And it protects them especially in wintertime, providing heat to a large portion of the population. So you have 80 percent of the energy grid that is already decimated. And if the nuclear -- remainder of the nuclear power plants, there should be three remaining in Ukraine right now, if they are targeted, that would basically almost shut down the entire Ukrainian energy grid completely. And that, of course, would be a disaster not only for the Ukrainians, but it would have potential problems that would spill over into other parts of Eastern Europe.",

LEIGHTON:  Well, I think it's ramping up quite a bit, Pamela. And when you look at the use of a ballistic missile on the part of Hezbollah, it was a signal that they could go into an area as far south as Tel Aviv, target ostensibly the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. That missile was shot down, but if they use more of them, if they try to overwhelm the Israeli missile defense systems, that could provide for a significant problem for the Israelis. And it could also mean a widening of the conflict. The Israelis have also moved their forces into the northern part of the country, poised potentially to enter Lebanon, which would mean entering territory that's controlled by Hezbollah. So this war is kind of -- in the Middle East is kind of at one of those points where it could go either way. Either there's a de- escalation or there's an escalation. And right now, we're at that fork in the road, and that is something that could have an impact not only on what happens in the Middle East, but potentially also what happens in Ukraine, because all of these events are ultimately tied together.",

Also important to note, whatever Judge Chutkan ends up ruling about that, about the admissibility of the Mike Pence evidence, that's going to be appealed.
