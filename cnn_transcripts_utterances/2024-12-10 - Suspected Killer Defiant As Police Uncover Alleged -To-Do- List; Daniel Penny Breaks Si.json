They say it includes a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed to carry out a killing. He writes about the Unabomber, saying using a bomb could -- quote -- \"kill innocents\" and that's just shooting would be more targeted. He also muses about what could be better than to -- quote -- \"kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference.\"But police are also honing in on this, a potential back injury Mangione may have suffered in July of 2023. He posted an image online of an X-ray showing the aftermath of a spinal surgery. Did he run into problems with the health insurance industry or the health insurance more broadly? That's what police want to know. And what we do know is that Mangione dropped off the grid about six months ago or so. Friends were looking for him. His family was, too. \"The New York Times\" reports his own mother filed a missing person report in San Francisco back on November 18th, just six days before he showed up here in New York City.
