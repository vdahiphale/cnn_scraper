Economists predicted an eighth-straight rate increases if the Central Bank tries to tamp down inflation without causing a recession. CNN's Matt Egan is inside the Federal Reserve.

      "sentences": "25 basis points, the Fed just delivered its a straight interest rate hike lifting interest rates to the highest level since 2007. All part of the Fed's quest to get inflation back down to healthy levels. But importantly, the Fed is dialing back the pace of these interest rate hikes going from 75 basis points this past summer and this past fall to 50 basis points in December to this more traditional move of 25 basis points today.Now, this was widely expected, widely telegraphed, and yet it is a significant strategy shift nonetheless. The Fed is still trying to slow this economy to cool off inflation, but they've gone from slamming the brakes to just tapping the brakes. And that is a big deal because it lowers the risk of an accident caused by the Fed either in financial markets or in the real economy or both. So, what does all this mean? Borrowing costs are going higher. They're going to stay elevated. We're talking about mortgage rates, credit cards, car loans, all of them have gone up sharply. No relief expected anytime soon. But this is also an acknowledgment from the Fed that they think their strategy is working, that all this tough medicine is in fact cooling off inflation. In fact, the Fed inserted a new line in the statement saying \"inflation has eased somewhat, but remains elevated.\" So, this is the Fed's way of saying, look, we are making some progress, but we're not going to declare victory just yet. And the Fed kept in their statement a line saying that they do expect ongoing interest rate hikes are going to be needed to get inflation back down. During the press conference coming up in the next 25 minutes or so, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he's going to be pressed on just how much higher he thinks interest rates are going to have to go and critically how long they're going to have to stay high, Victor and Alisyn.",

Now, today's search as with the search of Wilmington home about two weeks ago, this was done in coordination with the cooperation of the president's team. And this was planned.Now, the president's personal team had already searched both of these houses. But once this became a full-blown special counsel investigation, it was very much expected that the FBI would want to do their own searches. So, on the 20th of January, we saw the FBI spend about 13 hours in the president's Wilmington home. They found additional classified information there. The big question today is whether they find anything else. And good news again for the president, they did not. But two outstanding questions right now, will there be any other searches? Well, you heard the White House Counsel spokesman right there, he was asked that, and he really dodged that. He made a pretty wide dodge around that question. And there been a lot of questions about how transparent the president's team has been because just yesterday, we learned about a previously undisclosed visit that the FBI made to that former office where this all began, and a lot of questions about why the Justice Department nor the president's team had previously disclosed this, especially because it was a pretty standard step when assessing a situation like this. Another important thing that the White House Counsel spokesman touched on that I think is fair is clearly everyone is trying to move really quickly here. Today, it was Robert Hur, the special counsel's first day on the job, but they've already completed these two searches.
