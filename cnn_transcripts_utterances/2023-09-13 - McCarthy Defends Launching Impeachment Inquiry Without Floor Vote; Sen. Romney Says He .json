Speaker Kevin McCarthy gathers Republican Party colleagues and defends his call to order an impeachment inquiry into President Biden without calling for a vote for it, and without sufficient evidence to, as yet, convince all of his fellow House Republicans. Plus, a defiant convicted killer has been captured, sniffed out by a dog and infrared technology. A witness will be here, one who saw the arrest go down and the killer up close. And a political stunner from Republican senator and former presidential Republican nominee Mitt Romney. A look at the impact as an elder statesman of the Senate walks away. (MUSIC)",

Today, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is trying to get House Republicans on same page after he launched an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, looking into whether Mr. Biden personally financially benefited from his son Hunter's business dealings and perhaps even worse. McCarthy met with the Republican conference behind closed doors earlier today, trying to defend his decision to launch an inquiry without bringing it first to a full floor vote as he had promised he would do. Not even two weeks ago. He said he would do that as evidence of how serious of a matter this was. Here is how he defended his decision to not do so to CNN's Manu Raju right after the meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Nancy Pelosi changed the precedent of this House on September 24th. It was withheld and good enough for every single Democrat here. It was good enough for the judge. Why does it have to be different today? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What he's saying is accurate.However, she did bring it to the floor for a vote five weeks later. As conservative David French writes in \"The New York Times,\" quote: In 2019, the House opened its impeachment inquiry only after it received reports that Donald Trump had attempted to coerce President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine into investigating Trump's chief domestic political opponent, that would be Mr. Biden. McCarthy's move, French writes, comes, quote, without anything approaching comparable evidence. But McCarthy is not just on the defense about how he launched the inquiry. He's also playing defense on why he launched it as McCarthy or any House Republicans has yet to show the public any concrete evidence as of now that President Biden himself financially benefited from Hunter Biden's business dealings. In fact, McCarthy has made several claims during the impeachment inquiry announcement that you have to is listen to closely to. Here is the first one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A bunch of conservatives have been grumbling about McCarthy for a number of reasons mainly because of spending bills and other issues like that. And this seems to be political analysts say an attempt by Speaker McCarthy to try to sate them at least for now. McCarthy is also staring down another major battle, avoiding a government shutdown. He has 17 days until the government runs out of money and he's scrambling to try to get Republicans on board for the short term spending bill to keep the government open.

Though they say there's a smoke, they want to see if there's fire behind that smoke, and a lot of them simply are also uncertain about whether they would vote to impeach Biden if it were to come to that, showing the hurdles ahead for McCarthy as they open up this inquiry. Some of them are also acknowledging that Republicans can face blowback if they go too far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DARRELL ISSA (R-CA): I think we should always take one step after another to -- to go where the facts lead. You get ahead of your skis so to speak when you make an assumption about what you're going to find. REP. TOM COLE (R-OK): It certainly didn't high pressure -- it didn't help Democrats. I haven't seen too much after the impeachment process and didn't go well for us in '98 for Clinton. I don't see it as good politics. But I do think there is enough stuff here that deserves to be looked at. REP. DAN NEWHOUSE (R-WA): I don't want this to be seen as just a response to impeachment from the previous president. This should be based on the facts and the facts take us down that road, then so be it. But it shouldn't be a tit-for-tat. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: He's also uncertain exactly how long this investigation may take shape. McCarthy did not provide a time frame when talking to Republicans behind closed doors, indicating that it would happen in an expeditious manner but does that extend into next year and next year, things get more complicated as it get to an election season, particularly among those Republicans who serve in districts that Joe Biden carried. There are 18 of them, many of them skeptical about this and certainly not ready to vote to impeach. So a lot of questions here, Jake, as Republicans plan to issue subpoenas and have public hearings but could they have the evident and can they get the votes in line, all major questions in the weeks ahead -- Jake.",

But we did know that we were safe because of how many police officers were in the area. There had to have been well over 50 cop cars with at least two cops in each car.So we knew there was pretty high hopes they were going to get him this morning, which we're thankful they did. TAPPER: I don't think people understand necessarily how much people in Chester County were living in terror about this brutal killer being on the loose. You called your landlord at one point, and she said that Cavalcante had been seen in her own yard?",

But yeah, she had said that she had seen something, so she called the cops. They had done a walkthrough of her house. And that kind of just escalated things for us, making us aware we needed to be more secure.Just stay away from the windows, make sure everything was locked again. Yeah, just stay safe, hunker down and let cops do their job.",

Obviously, we were -- like you said, I've got four kids. Two of them are 2-month-old toddler or infants.And so, we were up all night, listening to the scanners on YouTube or whatever. Just being aware of what was going on outside of our house and trying to be extra careful. And if we heard anything, we would either call the cops or give a tip. We've actually seen our barn door open multiple times throughout the last day and a half, and we called that in, just because we didn't know if the cops had been there, we hadn't seen them walk into the back. So that was a little terrifying, as well.",

The killer's has been on the run for 14 days after escaping that Chester County, Pennsylvania prison, is mow in custody again. How a police dog pinned the fugitive while he was sleeping on top of that stolen rifle in tall grass, all within the search parameter. Plus, the new account from one of the Secret Service agents at JFK's side when he was assassinated. Why this raises new questions about the magic bullet theory. We're going to talk to that Secret Service agent this hour. And leading this hour, Republican Senator from Utah Mitt Romney just announced he will not seek re-election when his term ends in January 2025. He released a video statement on Twitter earlier today.
