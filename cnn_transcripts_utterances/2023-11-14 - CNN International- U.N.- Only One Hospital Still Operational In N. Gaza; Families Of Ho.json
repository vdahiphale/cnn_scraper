They say only one hospital in the north of the strip remains operational while southern hospitals can't admit more patients. Then CNN's Nic Robertson travels to the Gaza combat zone with the Israeli military. We'll bring you his full report from what he describes as one of the worst war zones he's ever seen. Plus, we'll have a preview of the main event to the sidelines of the APEC annual summit in California. A bilateral to U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. The U.N. says only one hospital in northern Gaza remains operational this hour. Hospitals in the south are rapidly running out of room as Israel presses its attacks on Hamas. Israel says it has evidence of Hamas fighters in and around Gaza City's hospitals, including this highly edited video. You can see a man with a rocket propelled grenade launcher at the entrance to the city's Al-Quds Hospital. CNN has geolocated the video to the hospital entrance. The Palestine Red Crescent has said there were, quote, \"no armed individuals inside the hospital\". Israel is urging the northern hospitals to evacuate, but Palestinians say that's impossible at the moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have received hundreds of calls for people's crying while they are trapped in their homes in Gaza City and the north. They are unable to evacuate their homes because the whole area is -- there is a military operation and simply anyone who tried to go out will be a target for Israeli militaries. Even us as ambulances, we don't have a safe access to those areas. So unfortunately, we feel helpless. We can't reach the people who are in critical conditions and they need us.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

So it's that point of view, but it's a pretty incredible piece. When you look at it, he does question the IDF along the way as well about what they're showing him.He's witnessed miles and miles of devastation and destruction all above ground. But underground, IDF soldiers show him where they are concentrating their operation. That includes inside a children's hospital that Israel says was used by Hamas. We'll see what evidence they can give us for that. Now families of some hostages being held by Hamas are marching from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, calling on their leaders to do more to bring their loved ones home. They're expected to reach Jerusalem on Saturday, where they plan to protest outside the Prime Minister's office. It comes after a new video emerged on a Hamas social media channel claiming an Israeli woman held hostage in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike. CNN isn't showing any of the video and hasn't confirmed her death either. CNN's Oren Liebermann joined the families in Tel Aviv where they kicked off their march earlier today.",

Many here have spoken about their frustration, the lack of answers they're receiving, the demand that the government do everything it can to release the hostages.Some 240 still held in Gaza from the very young, their grandparents, grandmothers and grandfathers. The message that they are trying to send to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the War Cabinet is, do whatever it takes, make whatever deal is necessary to bring them home as soon as possible. Regardless of the deal, their priority, not destroying Hamas, not destroying the tunnels, but bringing the families home. For the past two weeks or so, they've been outside the Defense Ministry when the War Cabinet has met, trying to make sure that the government hears them in that way. They feel that that hasn't been enough. So now they've taken to the streets of Tel Aviv, where they will march from here to Jerusalem over the course of the next several days. This march, very reminiscent of a march from more than a decade ago, when the family of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was held prisoner in Gaza for five years, decided they too had had enough, and marched from their home in northern Israel to Tel Aviv, by the time they -- to Jerusalem. By the time they arrived in Jerusalem, they had thousands with them and put a tremendous amount of pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a deal to free their son. This, the same idea, but now the family of 239 or so hostages trying to put that same sort of pressure to bring their family home. They're trying to demand answers and this is the way they're doing it now. Oren Liebermann, CNN, on the streets of Tel Aviv.",

Baena and the partner were found dead on Monday inside their home. Authorities say the cause of death is unknown, but they do not suspect foul play at this time.
