If you're just joining us, here are some of our top stories today.U.S. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise is vowing that the bipartisan border bill will not get a vote in the House, even if it passes through the Senate. As House Majority Leader, he sets the floor schedule. A diplomatic source tells CNN that the U.N. Security Council is expected to discuss the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in the Middle East later today. Russia called for the meeting, saying the strikes were a, quote, blatant act of U.S.-British aggression against sovereign states. A Michigan jury will begin deliberations today in the manslaughter trial against Jennifer Crumbley. Her teenage son killed four people in a school shooting in 2021. She and her husband are the first parents in the U.S. to be charged in connection with a school shooting committed by their child. Her husband goes on trial next month. In the U.S., thousands in California are without power right now after a huge storm system brought heavy rain and strong winds. Some cities are reissuing evacuation orders for low-lying areas. Meanwhile, California's governor has declared a state of emergency in nearly 15 percent of its counties. And the National Weather Service says flash flood warnings are in effect for parts of Los Angeles and its surrounding areas. City officials are urging residents to get off the roads.

At least 112 people have died and a state of emergency has been declared. Tens of thousands of acres burning. Chile's president says if any of these fires were set intentionally, the criminals will pay. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GABRIEL BORIC, CHILEAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It's hard to think there are so horrible and heartless people who could be able to inflict so much pain. But if these people exist, we will search them. We will find them. And they will have to face not only the entire society's rejection, but also the law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nayib Bukele claimed victory hours ago. He's faced little organized opposition in the race, really. And he's extremely high in the approval ratings, due in part to his crackdown on violence and criminal gangs.He's defending his record after rights groups accused his government of detaining and torturing innocent people. He compared the mass arrests to chemotherapy to cure the, quote, cancer of the gangs. And he's responding to critics who say he's anti-democratic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NAYIB BUKELE, SALVADORAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): They say that Salvadorans are oppressed, that Salvadorans don't want the emergency measures, that Salvadorans are afraid of the government. Let God tell the journalists to accompany us on this night of total freedom and total security here in the safest country of the Western Hemisphere. Don't be scared of me. I'm just a politician, an official. Believe in the Salvadoran people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're very proud of their democracy. It's one of the most stable democracies in West Africa, maybe in all of Africa. And so, they see President Sall's decision. Some opposition leaders are calling it a constitutional coup. And that is why you're seeing this concern from the economic community of West African states, from the African Union, both calling for dialogue and a new date to be set as soon as possible.And joining those calls, the European Union, the United States, France, all saying this is of concern because Senegal has set a good standard over the past few decades of being able to have peaceful transitions. That is why they leaned on President Macky Sall not to run again when he intended to do so. Part of the background here is that the Constitutional Council last month excluded some key opposition figures from the election. Some of them are in jail. Some of them are not on that poll. That led to some disquiet. So, President Macky Sall appears to have legitimate reasons for that, but it's not been well received in the country, and for good reason -- Max.",
