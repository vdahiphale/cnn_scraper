The man had also posted online threats against other top officials as well as prosecutors who've charged former President Trump. Also, tonight, devastating wildfires in Hawaii ravaging parts of Maui. One resident calls the scene apocalyptic. The flames burning homes and businesses to the ground, and at least six people have died. Others are still missing tonight.

My heart goes out to that family and others. My biggest concern is that we get the fires completely extinguished now. He's right. We have to have all of our water diverted to the emergency, which is what's being done right now. We have several hundred structures that have been destroyed, so that means thousands of people will be displaced. We're moving people who are visiting away from Maui so that all of our resources can be given to the response. We also had to fortify our hospitals. And so, we are in a relationship, of course, with all the hospitals in the state where we have special units for burn victims on Oahu. So, it's health and safety first.

According to prosecutors in one of those threats, Robertson wrote, I hear Biden is coming to Utah, digging out my old ghillie suit and cleaning the dust off the M24 Sniper rifle. Welcome, buffoon-in-chief. The ghillie suit is a reference to this camouflage outfit that Robertson posted to his social channels. And in another threat directed at FBI agents, he wrote, to my friends in the federal bureau of idiots, I know you're reading this and you have no idea how close your agents came to violent eradication. Also uncovered by investigators, a post showing off Robertson's arsenal where he wrote, just getting ready for the 2024 election cycle.

Particularly, the country is very polarized on a lot of different political and social issues.We saw similar threats during the previous democratic administration, the Obama era. We had a lot of threats that came in against the president. And then we kind of had this lull when Trump was elected. But we started seeing a lot more threats directed at state local politicians. Just in fact, we've had this year at least five incidents where state delegates or congressmen have had their homes shot at. So that kind of gives you an idea of the level of political tensions that are out there. And unfortunately, we have some people that will resort to violence to express their political grievances.",

This is the second time DeSantis has fired a state attorney due to political differences. CNN's Steve Contorno has the story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: On the presidential campaign trail, Governor Ron DeSantis often boasts about the time he removed a progressive prosecutor from office. Well, now, he has done it again. On Wednesday, DeSantis announced that he was suspending Monique Worrell. She is the state attorney that represents Orange and Osceola counties in Florida. It's a job she has held since she was elected by more than 66% of the voters in those counties. But DeSantis on Wednesday accused her of -- quote -- \"neglect of duty and incompetence\" and had this to say about her stewardship of the office. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Prosecutors do have a certain amount of discretion about which cases to bring and which not. But what this state attorney has done is abuse that discretion and has effectively nullified certain laws in the state of Florida.",

However, that judge ultimately said he was in federal court and unable to act on a state matter. That gave the green light for DeSantis to remove Worrell today. Sara? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Yet, the governor continues to brag about it, going around the country, telling lies and misrepresenting the truth in that case.And so, it's not surprising that he's going back to the well in a situation where he needs to distract attention from his presidential campaign and try to put it somewhere else.
