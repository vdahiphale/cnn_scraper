Kamala Harris rallies in battleground, Arizona as Trump gets back on the trail, this time in reliably red Montana.Plus, we've got the body. I'm talking about Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura turned former Minnesota governor. He joins me to talk about the VP pick, Governor Tim Walz, and I really can't wait to hear what he has to say about the criticism about Walz's military service. You know what they say, success is the best kind of revenge. Well, look at who just silenced the critics. The Algerian boxer who was bullied online extensively after her opening Olympic bout. Well, she just took home the gold. All right. Right now, Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail. He's about to speak at a rally in Bozeman, Montana. It was actually his first one since Kamala Harris officially became the Democratic nominee and saw a surge in her poll numbers. Now, given how close this race has become, you expect him to be in a battleground state, right? Instead, he's in one that he won by 16 points in 2020. And it's pretty much guaranteed to go red. And there's two ways to ask the next key question. So why would he go there? Maybe the question should be, why would he go there? Well, he says he's helping boost a GOP candidate for Senate in a very tight race, which could end up tipping the balance of the chamber. Now, we don't actually know exactly what Trump's campaigning plans are after tonight. But it is worth noting this is the only event posted on his campaign's Web site. And he said at yesterday's news conference that he will pick up his campaigning at the DNC, which, by the way, ends on August 22nd. That's two weeks from now. Harris and Tim Walz, by contrast, are keeping the pedal to the metal. They're also out West for this time a two-day campaign blitz, starting with tonight's stop in Glendale, Arizona. And while there, Harris appeared to counter one of Trump's personal attacks against her after he claimed yesterday that she isn't smart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

BUSH AND JOHN MCCAIN: Fading Vegas act is the perfect description. I was thinking of old Elvis. It feels like old Elvis left the building. But, you know, I tell you what really struck me today was that in late 2015, the very first time that I went to see Donald Trump was in Arizona. And I remember going there and I remember it being 105 degrees and that there were people lined up for miles and I was just dumbstruck and I said, wow, something's happening here. Well, today, the exact same thing was happening on the ground in Arizona with Kamala Harris, 105 degrees, miles of people standing there. So this really feels like more like a movement than a moment. And that's what it's going to require to beat Donald Trump. And I think it's really interesting observation that Peggy Noonan makes to say when she wrote that she wasn't sure whether or not Harris had actually created the movement or the movement that created her. Meaning, I think that it's this pent-up energy, particularly among Democrats and independents for this joyous kind of -- this joy ride that's happening right now. It's just -- and it's just flowing and it's really lightened up with jet fuel because of the joy factor, which is something I wrote about today in \"Vanity Fair.\"",

This wave was out there. It was wanting something. But don't take anything away from Kamala Harris, this idea. There's a thousand ways to get this wrong and only a couple of ways to get it right, even in this environment. And Kamala Harris has played this brilliantly. She has not put one foot wrong yet. Now, she's got to get through some interviews. She's got to get through the debate. A lot of things can happen. But right now, a hundred politicians given this opportunity would have screwed it up.

Governor Walz served honorably for 24 years in the National Guard. After 20 years, you are eligible to retire at any time you deem necessary. They talk about him missing his deployment. Well, maybe Mr. Vance should ask the real question.What is the National Guard doing deploying to a foreign country in a foreign war? Well, let's go into history and figure out how that happened. That happened because George W. Bush and Dick Cheney went into the Iraq war based on lies. No weapons of mass destruction. No ties to al-Qaeda. Nothing with 9/11. And they ran out of bodies. They needed more bodies. They couldn't implement a draft. That would be political suicide. So what George Bush did was sign an executive order sending the National Guard into foreign deployment. The National Guard is not for foreign deployment. Their name says what they do. They guard our nation from within. So this hogwash about Governor Walz missing a deployment, not only that, he's 24 years, he's an E9. I deployed twice. We never even had an E9 with us when we deployed. E9s are not going to walk the point. They're not going to be involved in any combat whatsoever. They're figureheads being the most senior enlisted within their company, and that's what it's all about. So I think that Vance is doing a disservice to himself and a disservice to the United States Marine Corps. I know a lot of great Marines, and Marines show respect, and Vance is not showing respect. And let's continue. Who does he have respect for? Donald Trump, the biggest draft dodger from the Vietnam War, the rich white boy who bought his way out of it. I come from south Minneapolis. My friends and I didn't get out of it. We either got drafted or we enlisted. I know six or seven or eight of my friends. Donald Trump was your typical rich white boy who didn't have to serve in Vietnam because he could buy his way out of it, and that's who Vance is standing with, this guy who leads from the rear?",
