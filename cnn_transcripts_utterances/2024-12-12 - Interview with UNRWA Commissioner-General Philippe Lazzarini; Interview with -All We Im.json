Everybody around me incollege and in my, you know, 25 years in America were just like you're saying, subconsciously preparing to be with families around these dinner tables. I was that kid that would sit at home without anywhere to go, homesick, watching my family's life, death, close people to me getting married and so on and without being able to take part of these simple human activities that nourish us as humans in a relationship. And it's a simple light to every human around the world. What crime did I commit to be -- to have that stolen from me, to have these minutes of joy and sorrow and sadness stolen from me? So, for many -- I couldn't even -- I didn't want to talk about it, but I made art to make sure to talk about the pain of homesickness. And sometimes the whole piece that I'm making is just my mom's salon and my mom's sofa inside a suitcase.",

I decided to give away all my artwork that was built in that era to proper institutions and museums, to highlight that black era, that dark era that we have went through and to remind us of the Syria never again moment. This is an end of an era, no matter how troublesome, no matter how pessimistic, optimistic people are, there is nothing worse coming or worth fearing than what we've seen as Syrian people under that regime. The whole world can agree that this is an era that will never come back. We can go through turmoil to rebuild and stand on our feet, absolutely, it's understandable, but we have as collective artists to say this has finished. One, to teach ourselves to dream. I need to put a line in the sand to say now, Mohamad, you can't go back. What you going to do about it? So, the work that I have been doing with immigrant and refugee kids here to -- in the diaspora now has a new other dimension where I'm saying, your work has to go into institutions, to educate what had happened, grow on it, learn the mistakes and build the society together. I have -- I'm very eager and curious recent in the last two nights. I'm saying -- I'm thinking to myself. How did the Germans do it? How did they reconcile? How did they come together? How did many nations that went through this come together and forgive and forget while learning? So, with that initiative, I hope many artists, creatives of Syrian will come together and put that line in the sand say, listen, right now is a dark moment. We understand. But time will come where we will have our own institutions and it's time to rebuild the new generation.",
