Trump's take, dismissing abortion rights as an important issue this election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. It's a very small -- I think it's actually going to be a very small issue. What I've done is I've done what every Democrat and every Republican wanted to have done, and we brought that issue back to the states, and now the states are voting on it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while abortion doesn't generally rank as the top three issues to voters, it's one of the highest intensity issues, especially with women and with swing voters, the very voters that he needs to win this election, to dismiss it is such a poor strategy, but I think honestly, the only strategy there is saying like, oh, it's not a big deal and hoping that resonates --",

That's the reason that people put up with a lot of the nonsense that he does.But for many Americans, many women throughout this country, the other thing Donald Trump does is he really narrows the scope and people just -- when he says it, he just limits it to the procedure. But most times, Democrats and women throughout the country look at reproductive rights as a whole. For example, my wife and I, we went through IUI, IVF to have our twins. I mean, it's an entire mantra or entire plethora of rights that Donald Trump wants to take away. And so I think that when you look at it that broadly, it doesn't matter what he says.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, finally, really is the tone of this statement. These three countries signed by the leaders of these three countries in this statement saying that it is finally time to get this ceasefire across the finish line, end the suffering in Gaza, end the suffering for the hostages and their families. So, what they're proposing is another meeting next week, either in the Qatari capital, Doha, or the Egyptian capital of Cairo, to hammer out the final details.This is part of that statement that was signed by President Biden and the two other leaders. It is time to bring immediate relief to both the long suffering people of Gaza as well as the long suffering hostages and their families. The leaders go on to talk about putting forward a final bridging proposal, if needed, to essentially close the gaps. And there, I think, you see a bit of the frustration with the proposals and the counter proposals between Hamas and Israel that haven't gotten the ceasefire across the finish line. So, we could see this meeting happen next week. It is not a done deal. Israel, as you say, has agreed to go. Hamas has not yet, but there's a good chance that this happens. If it does happen, the CIA director, Bill Burns, would represent the United States alongside the Qatari prime minister and the Egyptian head of intelligence. Now, we have heard in the past few weeks U.S. officials saying that they believe that a deal is close. But, Kate, there's no question that these negotiations took a major hit when one of the lead negotiators, the head of the Hamas political wing, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed last week in the Iranian capital, in an operation that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. So, there are significant gaps that they need to work out. A senior administration official saying yesterday it's not like the mediators that are going to get into a room and sign this deal next Thursday, but they do believe that they can close those gaps and it is vitally important to do so now, they say, ten months after this war started against this backdrop of a region that is on the precipice of blowing up, as we wait for Hezbollah and Iran to potentially carry out strikes against Israel.

You said, look, you remain determined to make certain that Israel can defend itself from Iranian aggression. However, you were concerned about this, that the prime minister, as you put it, refuses to implement President Biden's widely accepted proposal, this was back in June, that would lead to a ceasefire, bringing the hostages home and allow for a new surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The prime minister did not outline a realistic plan to post-war Gaza, which you fear meant that he intends to bend towards the extreme right voices of his coalition.Now, that Israel has agreed to these new talks after all that has happened, what is your message to Hamas? Do you have that same sort of tough stance on them?",

We know they started this on October the 7th. So, there's no way that they get out of this. They are. They're not an equivalent to Israel. They are a terrorist organization that initiated this, and I believe they initiated it because we were starting to move to have other countries in the gulf recognize Israel's right to exist.And when you look at Hamas along with Iran, the one thing that they have in common, because, you know, it's Sunni and Shia, and generally they have nothing in common, the only thing they have in common is they do not believe Israel has the right to exist and they would love to attack and wipe them off the map.",

He can't finish a sentence. There is something that is wrong with him. You know, I don't know. Maybe it's he is incomprehensible.

And that's where they found that these routine childhood vaccinations, like the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or like the polio virus vaccine, these will have prevented, like you said, more than 500 million illnesses, about 32 million hospitalizations and more than 1 million deaths. This is all within a child's lifetime.And the researchers even took their analysis further to say, with these prevented hospitalizations, illnesses and deaths, that would have resulted in a direct cost savings of about $540 billion in medical costs and even more than $2 trillion in indirect savings, like societal impacts, like if a parent has to stay home from work to take care of a sick child. So, the researchers say, this shows the benefits of routine vaccinations. And right now we're heading back to school, this is a good reminder for parents to make sure their children are up-to-date on their routine vaccinations.",
