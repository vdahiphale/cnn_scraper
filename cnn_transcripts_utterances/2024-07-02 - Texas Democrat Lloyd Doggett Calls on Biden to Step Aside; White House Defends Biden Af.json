Karine Jean-Pierre pointed to his record over the last three and a half years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  That's why he's acknowledging he's not a young man. That's why he's acknowledging he's a little slower than he used to be in walking and not as smooth as speaking, we get that. But we also want to make sure that we point to the successes he's had, his record, and we want to continue to build on his unprecedented record.

Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett becoming the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election following last week's poor debate performance. The congressman saying in a statement, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself. I'm hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. Today, the White House facing a barrage of questions about the president's debate performance. JEAN-PIERRE:  It was a bad night. He was not taking any cold medication. That is what I can speak to. I've asked the doc -- his doctor, and that's what he stated to us LEE (voice-over):  And urged to release more medical records. JEAN-PIERRE:  We have released thorough reports from his medical team every year since he's been in office.

LEE (voice-over):  Other Democrats beginning to publicly express concern that the president could hurt candidates in down ballot races. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL):  It's his decision.

Biden really had a bad day today. This was the day when the panic following the debate turned, I think, into growing threats to his hopes of staying on the Democratic ticket. We had the bad poll numbers, Congressmen starting to come out, there are many more people in the House who are not speaking publicly but are just as worried about their prospects of keeping the House if Biden is at the top of the ticket. That White House briefing was almost as painful to watch as the debate itself. The White House doesn't have answers. Their answer to questions about Biden's capacity is that he's had a great four years, he's got a very good record, he's older and wiser. But the question that Americans are asking is, can we honestly see the president still in office in two, three, four, five years' time? Does he have that capacity? So, they aren't succeeding in stopping the panic growing, and now it is evolving, I think, into questions about whether the president can stay on the ticket. He said that he's going to do a TV interview on Friday but will air mostly on Sunday. The pace this is developing, that may not be quick enough.",

Is it the American public though, I think, is the question versus the press that continued to press the White House on his capabilities at this moment? What did you make of Nancy Pelosi today? Because she acknowledged that it was a legitimate question, and we heard it there to question whether this was an episode or a condition that people saw in that debate on Thursday night from President Biden.

She has the ear of all those House members that are now looking rather nervously and understanding that they're going to have to outrun an even more unpopular president as they try and hang on to their seats in November. When people are saying things like Nancy Pelosi's saying that, you know, this is ultimately up to the president, he's a patriot, that doesn't really instill a lot of confidence about what really thinking. In many ways, this was perhaps inevitable. This is the oldest president -- sitting present in history. He will be 82 years old at the time of the inauguration. He's asking Americans for a second term. Any slip up at any point in this campaign was always going to unleash questions about his health and his capacity. The fact that it 50 million Americans and the White House hasn't been able to give answers, Biden hasn't been out there that much either since the debate, that big contrast that the Biden campaign wanted from that debate was Biden, the sober -- you know, somber president standing against this wild, dangerous candidate Donald Trump, that's been obliterated by what's happened over the last week.

And so, this is what a Category 3. And so, this is what a Category 3 wind will do. Category 4 there in Carriacou was just devastating. I've seen pictures. I've seen aerials. There's not a home that hasn't had some type of damage and many are catastrophically damaged. So, yes, we still have a storm of 250 kph. Although, there is a Hurricane Hunter aircraft, that you just saw in my other picture, flying to it now to make sure or to see what it is. I don't believe it's 250 anymore. I think we'll probably be dropping down to around 220. But it's still going to be a major hurricane as it crosses over Jamaica. There will be storm surge with this. And I vividly remember Katrina, although we said, oh, it's only a Category 3, only a Category 3 surge. The problem, Julia, is that it it's been a five and a four. It's going to come in here with four surge, without a doubt. So, although the official forecast is somewhere between two and three meters of surge, there could be waves coming onshore that will be well above two to three meters without a doubt in that storm surge. Where does it go from here? Well, the models are turning it as it gets back toward Tampico and up even maybe even to the Western Gulf of Mexico. Before that though, Jamaica will have 250 millimeters of rain that not even including the salt water that's going to come on shore. So, yes, this is going to be a big storm for them. It's going to be a big storm even for Grand Cayman, likely a Category 3 going over the Cayman Islands, Cayman Brac, Little Cayman, Grand Cayman, and those are very, very low islands. So, it won't take much to get a lot of water over the Cayman Islands. And so, people there are going to have to be very, very careful. The focus now is on Jamaica. It's first -- Cayman, you're going to be there on Thursday morning, but it's still a very, very dangerous storm. Even though it has lost some intensity, the waters are getting slightly cooler, but it's encountering just a little bit of wind shear out there. Hurricanes like to be all by themselves. Don't touch me kind of thing. I've said this before, like my cat. Don't touch me. I'll be happy. And so, hurricanes just want to be happy all by themselves. And now, it's not happy anymore.

Electrodes are placed between the amputation site and the leg itself, and signals from the nervous system can go directly to moving and directing the bionic leg, and the bionic leg is able to sense its own positioning and send signals back to the nervous system. And in one study, Julia, researchers found among people who had amputated legs, they underwent a specific kind of surgery and they were equipped with this bionic leg, the bionic leg was found to increase their maximum walking speed by 41 percent. So, it helped the users to walk more quickly and more smoothly in a way similar to the speed of walking we see among people without amputations. And as you mentioned, Julia, CNN did speak with a woman in this study, and she said as soon as she was equipped with this bionic leg, she felt like she wanted to take off running. She said it felt like she had no amputation at all. And that's impact that we're seeing this technology have on people, Julia.",

But also, what were the drivers? And they were unique to every country. And those drivers were sitting -- staring at our faces within the data, those variables, and how one could have found some intervention points, especially related to things like climate that were affecting many of those 20 countries that saw -- witness the Arab Spring revolution and how that could have been a source of potentially maybe avoiding some of the challenges that we saw in the revolution.",

It actually gives humans their freedom of action back, especially leaders to be able to make decisions early on, decisions that can potentially avoid the need for military action. It helps us win peace, I think, by doing so. And leaders become more important and not less, because with those insights, they can actually intervene. But the question then becomes, and this is an open question, how does our current systems across the world adapt and adopt to this rapidly changing technological landscape, especially embedding these insights into decision making cycles that were largely manual and human driven, a legacy of the way we've been doing intelligence for decades? The second part of your question, whether it could be used by bad actors. Well, as far as we're concerned, we are allied to just -- we only work with the United States and its allies and partners. The protection of this data is absolutely paramount for us and we treat it with extreme care and we are only trying to build this digital nervous system across democracies around the world and nations that are aligned with United States and its allies and partners.",
