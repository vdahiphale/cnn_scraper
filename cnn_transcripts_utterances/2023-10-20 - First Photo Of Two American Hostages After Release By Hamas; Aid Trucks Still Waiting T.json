The crisis in Gaza at a desperate new level as angry crowds take to the streets across the Middle East in protest. Also tonight, House Republicans are starting over in their search for a speaker, extending two weeks of chaos and paralysis. GOP hardliner Jim Jordan forced to drop out after losing a third floor vote and a secret ballot that sealed his fate. Plus, a huge new development in the Georgia election subversion case, lawyer Kenneth Cheseboro, accepting a plea deal and admitting an open court to conspiring with Donald Trump to put forward a slate of fake electors. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

This is the first photo that we have seen of them since they were abducted during that horrific attack on October 7th. They're there with Israeli soldiers. They are being reunited with their family tonight, something that is certainly grateful news for them.I mean, this is an Illinois woman and her teenage daughter that are now here in Israel. They have been reunited with their family. They are on a military base and right now they're undergoing medical checkups because, of course, they have spent nearly two weeks in the captivity of Hamas since that attack happened. And I should note they live in Illinois. Judith and Natalie were here in Israel. They were visiting Judith's mother, who was turning 85, it was her 85th birthday, so they were here celebrating that in the end of Simchat Torah, the Jewish holiday, of course. And that is what happened when that attack unfolded. And they were in the kibbutz with Judith's mother when that happened. They were in separate houses. And, initially, what we had heard from interviews that Judith's mom did, her mom did not want to leave the kibbutz later on when she realized that her daughter and her granddaughter were missing and later learned that they had been taken hostage by Hamas. And so there have been negotiations happening and there were words from Hamas that they were released on humanitarian purposes. Of course, the IDF tonight scoffing at that, given that attack that we just saw that happened where they brutally murdered, raped and kidnapped people by the dozens. And so this is grateful news though for their family regardless. Of course, Wolf, I should note that Natalie is set to turn 18 in just a few days and so her family is hopeful tonight that she will be home to celebrate that milestone birthday.",

CNN's Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche is joining us from the White House right now.

KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It just happened in the last. last hour, Wolf President Biden speaking directly with Judith and Natalie Raanan, the mother and daughter pair who were held captive by Hamas for the last two weeks. President Biden had previously spoken with their family members and earlier today spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss continued hostage relief efforts. But his message to Judith and Natalie was this, was that the U.S. is going to provide the full support of the government as they recover from what the president described as a terrible ordeal. And the president releasing his statement saying he is overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family who's been racked with fear. These individuals and their family will have the full support of the U.S. government as they recover and heal. And we should all respect their privacy in this moment. It is a rare triumph for the administration after more than two weeks of violence and tensions in the Middle East.

Our goal is to try to move civilians out of the way, which if we did call that would be what we meant to do. Hamas' goal is to bait us into killing civilians. They went either way. They kill Israeli civilians. They take it as a win. They bait us to killing their own civilians. They take it as a win.

They say that there are currently some 400 patients there, and in addition to that, 12,000 displaced people.I should add that we have no way of verifying those numbers, but obviously real concern from the hospital's administrators that it is simply unfeasible to evacuate that volume of people in a timely manner. More broadly speaking, Wolf, what we're seeing now in Gaza is basically the complete collapse of the health care system as this issue of the logjam with aid continues to get worse and worse. There is barely enough fuel to keep these generators, that keep these hospitals running. There is a massive shortage of medicine, not to mention food and water. And we actually went to the Rafah border crossing today between Gaza and Egypt, where the hopes had been high that perhaps, perhaps we might start to see some aid trickling in. Today, that was not to be. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WARD (voice over):  For days, they have been waiting.

If the United Nations is standing for Israel, if all these international institutions are standing for Israel, who's there for the Palestinians and don't call it a war?

He failed to win enough votes to get the speakership gavel. In fact, he bled even more support this time around. And so afterwards, Republicans got together behind closed doors and they took a secret ballot vote to essentially dump him as their speaker nominee.

And in just the past 48 hours they have secured these deals from two people who worked quite closely with former President Trump's legal team and their efforts to overturn the results of the election.In open court today, Wolf, Chesebro admitted to conspiring with Trump and two of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, to subvert the Electoral College process. As part of this plea deal, he has agreed to plead to one felony count. He has also agreed to testify in future hearings. He faces up to five years in probation and $5,000 in fines and restitution. He will also have to write an apology letter. But it's notable that, as a first-time offender in the state of Georgia, it is expected that if he complies with the terms of his probation, he will be wiped from his record. If he fills out an application on Monday, he does not have to say that he has been convicted of a felony. So, these have been some pretty good deals over the past few days for these defendants. We expect there to be additional plea deals from some of the other 16 defendants in the coming weeks and months. I've spoken with a few sources familiar with the Trump legal team thinking. They're mostly shrugging off these plea deals, but say they are missing out on an opportunity to preview the case down in Fulton County, which is what they had hoped would happen if these two individuals went on trial. As of now, there is no date set for former President Trump or any of the other 15 defendants. And, Wolf, if you look at that crowded 2024 calendar, it's really hard to see where this trial, which is expected to take over four months, could fit. So, it's unlikely that this case would go forward before the 2024 election.",

And people seem to defy that, and came out in support of Gaza.So there have been quite a few. You've also seen them, of course, in Lebanon. You've seen them in Jordan, where a huge population of Palestinians live, more than 3,000 people. They have been fairly widespread, and growing, except for here. The larger one happened after that hospital blast that Israel said it is not responsible for, and you saw a huge number of people in Ramallah then.

The fear has ratcheted way up. The fear of attack, on Palestinians, feel like they are also being helped by the Israeli military. So, it is a very messy situation.
