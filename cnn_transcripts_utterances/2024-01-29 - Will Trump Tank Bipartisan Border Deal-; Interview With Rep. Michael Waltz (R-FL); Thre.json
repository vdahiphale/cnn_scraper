A key negotiator says an agreement could be ready for the Senate floor in days, though, but is the bipartisan agreement dead before it even gets a vote because of former President Trump?",

These are the first U.S. military fatalities from outright attacks since war broke out between Israel and Hamas on October 7. President Biden, who met with his national security team this morning, is promising to respond, and the world is waiting to see what that will look like and if it could risk dragging the U.S. into a broader war in the region. This morning, CNN got some insight into the administration's decision- making. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Apparently, according to officials, that enemy drone closely followed an American drone that was returning to the base. And there was some confusion about the origin and identity of the enemy drone. And that led to a delay in the U.S. response. And, ultimately, that drone did make impact near the living quarters of this base called Tower 22, which is in Northeast Jordan, right on the border with Syria. In total, the base houses around 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel. And the number of wounded is expected to continue to rise as U.S. service members are presenting with symptoms consistent with traumatic brain injury. Now, the question that remains is, who was responsible for this attack? The U.S. has pointed the finger at Iran-backed militias, but they have not yet said which group was responsible for this drone strike. We know that there have been over 150 drone attacks, drone and rocket attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria just since October. But, previously, the injuries that resulted from these drone strikes were either nonexistent or they were pretty minor. This is the first time that officials say these groups were actually able to succeed in what they believed they were aiming to do, which is, unfortunately and sadly, kill U.S. service members. And we are expecting to get the names of those service members as soon as today, given that the next of kin notifications to their families has now been completed, Brianna.",

He is a former Green Beret who served multiple combat deployments, including in the Middle East, as well as in Afghanistan.Congressman, how should the U.S. respond here specifically? What would or could it look like? REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL):  Well, Brianna, I think, first, the administration needs to take a step back and appreciate and realize that their Middle East policy is failing and deterrence has failed when it comes to Iran. All roads, whether it's Hezbollah, whether it's the Houthis, whether it's Hamas, or whether it's these militias in Iraq, all roads lead back to Tehran. The appeasement strategy has failed. This de- escalation attempt has actually only invited escalation from the Iranian regime. The president said Friday Iran's gotten the message. Clearly, they have not. And now we have three service members dead because of it. So I'm looking on this administration to do a 180 and set politics aside. Just a few years ago, under the previous administration, ISIS was defeated, Iran was broke, and we had -- literally, we had peace breaking out in the Middle East with the Abraham Accords under President Trump. And now we have this. So they have got to -- look, we just had Sabrina Singh on this network lying to the American people and saying -- she's the Pentagon spokeswoman -- and saying the conflict has been contained. Tell that to the Navy SEAL families that just died in the Red Sea. Tell that to these three service members' families. Tell that to the thousands of soldiers that are in bunkers every night under assault from Iranian-backed militias. Until we make Iran pay -- and there are all kinds of ways to do that, through cyber, through hitting their operatives in Iraq, through hitting their operatives in Syria. There are all kinds of options. But until we make Iran pay in a way that's meaningful and not bombing empty warehouses in the middle of the night, which is what the administration's been doing, then deterrent is not going to be restored. Iran does not believe this administration is going to hit back in a way that they care about. And every time you hear, well, we just want to de-escalate, they hear a green light to push further.",

Their oil couldn't be exported. We were actually enforcing the sanctions. So, at the end of the day, if the administration wants to do something effective, then they have to back away from this vain hope of getting back into an Iran deal and the appeasement that goes with that, go back to maximum pressure, dry up the coffers, and that will have a deterrent effect across the Middle East, in addition to a kinetic attack on their operatives. That doesn't have to be inside Iran. They're all over the Middle East, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen. So there are a number of things that we can do, but what we hear is this, well, you have to invade Iran in order to have a deterrent effect. No, that's not what we did in the last administration. And we know what works. At the end of the day, the Iranian regime cares about its money, its control on power, and its influence across the Middle East. And there are ways to affect that.

Now, they're also agreeing on a provision that would speed up the process for those who are seeking asylum at the southern border, so some pretty big concessions there from Democrats. And, significantly, President Biden has indicated that he would sign this package into law. But, Boris, as you noted there at the top, there are some other key figures in the GOP who are not on board with this deal. And that is primarily former speaker (sic) Donald Trump, who, of course, is now the front-runner for the Republican nomination. He has been openly urging Republicans to reject this deal, in part because he wants a campaign on this issue, and he doesn't want to hand Biden and the Democrats a win. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, as if on cue, put out a letter on Friday and has been saying through the weekend that this deal, as he understands it, is likely dead on arrival in the House. So the pathway right now for a border security deal is very uncertain, even though Republicans have been demanding a number of these things, this proposal is likely to be fairly conservative, and even though Republicans are the ones who are insisting on border policy changes in exchange for Ukraine aid, as opposed to just border security money, which is what Biden had initially proposed in his package for Israel, Ukraine, the border, and Taiwan. So once this deal is announced, negotiators are still going to have to sell it to the rest of their colleagues since there's going to be opposition both on the right and on the left, we should mention, and just at this point, again, very uncertain how successful that sales job is going to be, Boris.",
