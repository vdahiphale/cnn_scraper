According to local media, six people were killed and seven others wounded. Authorities say it's not clear whether the shooter is among the dead.According to police, an event was taking place at the Jehovah's Witness' kingdom hall at the time of the attack, which is believed to be an isolated incident. There is no word yet on motive. We will bring in more information when it becomes available. Moscow unleashed a massive barrage of missiles and drones across Ukraine on Thursday, leaving at least six people dead and more than 20 wounded. Russia used a new tactic in the strikes, firing different types of missiles and drones at the same time. That included some missiles the Ukrainians can't shoot down like Russia's hypersonic missile.

More than 80 different types of missiles used, plus several Iranian-made drones. The result of that was several people killed, several injured. Neighborhoods, residential buildings destroyed.The city of Kyiv, the capital, 15% of that city had no electricity, no power for a period of time. We understand that air raid sirens in Kyiv were going off for nearly seven hours yesterday. Kim, you can imagine how terrifying that was for residents. Then there's this unprecedented or rather very rare attack on the city of Lviv. All the way in the west of the country, that was also targeted yesterday. That's right up near the Polish border, a place that has been considered a safe haven and where no one really has died of attacks by Russian missiles for -- since last spring, since last year. So, truly extraordinary in the scope and scale of it. Just to give you a sense of this, Kim, I know we have a list to show you, a graphic to show you of all the different types of weapons that were used. I want to pull that up. Again, over 80 types of missiles. If you take a look at that list, something might stand out. For example, the Kinzhal cruise missile, that's a hypersonic missile, so it's able to evade Ukrainian air defense systems. Very crucial that that was used. You're also seeing that this is an air, land, and sea attacks. These missiles were fired from warships in the Black Sea. So, a truly gruesome attack in just again that scope and scale of weapons used by Russia. For its part, the Russian defense ministry is saying that this attack was retaliation for across border and alleged cross border attack by Kyiv. Now, Kyiv itself has denied that attack. But again, it shows you how much that retaliation impacts civilians far from the frontlines. Ukraine considers this, of course, a violation of the rules of war.",

They have issued their highest alert level for flash flooding in and around (INAUDIBLE) County. And to put that into context, this is the first time they've done that since 2010.Still overnight, the moderate rate of flash flooding for the San Francisco Bay region. And then look for the day on Friday, that high risk level extends for the south, including San Luis Obispo as well as the central Sierra Nevada mountain range. I will explain why this is important. Remember all the various atmospheric river events we've covered so far this winter dumping copious amounts of snowfall, burying homes and vehicles quite literally, right? Well, guess what? This particular storm is going to be significantly milder than the previous atmospheric river events because we're tapping into that deep tropical moisture just south of Hawaii. In fact, you can pretty much track that cloud cover train all the way from Hawaii into the state of California. The various computer models that meteorologists look to show and indicate that the freezing level is actually going to be a thousand feet higher than what we previously anticipated yesterday. That means more rain will fall out of the system on top of that deep snow pack that you saw just a moment ago. There will still be snow, several feet of it across the Sierra Nevada mountain range, but more rain anticipated across the Central Valley all the way to the coastline. This is going to allow for rapid snow melt, the potential for flash flooding, landslides and mudslides. National Weather Service is picking up on that heavy rainfall and our flood watch continues. Here's the first atmospheric river event, lasting through the day on Friday, moves inward along with that moisture plume, and then looks what's waiting in its wings, another rain and snow event anticipated by the end of the weekend and into the early part of next week.

It is not the reality when Democrats control both chambers of Congress, let alone when House Republicans are in the majority in that chamber. However, the budget, as the president detailed in a long, wide-ranging speech in Philadelphia, is so much more than just a policy document, more than just a document of values or priorities. It is very clearly a political document. And the president making clear that whether it's near term fiscal battles like increase in the debt ceiling or even laying out a platform for a likely 2024 reelection bid, this document is critical.

But still, symbolically, this is very significant because now Xi has been given a third term for all the important titles he holds. And really, this is the latest reminder that he is the most powerful Chinese leader in decades. His iron grip over the party, the state, the government and the nation remained as firm as ever despite rumors and speculations. This is also, you know, a new era where we can see how he wants to further consolidate and reassure the party's dominance in every aspect of Chinese life, not just in politics and ministry, but also the economy and society. But, of course, he still faces challenges on multiple fronts. The economy is facing a lot of strong headwinds both domestically and internationally. Rising tensions with the U.S. and the west, in general, is something he actually highlighted himself, name-checking the U.S.-led west as out there to compress, to suppress, and contain China, but vowing to fight back, so things may get even worse. But, if there is one thing that is clear, that is now this is very much a one-man show. But the potential pitfall with that, Kim, of course, is he may find himself in a situation where he has no one else to blame when things go wrong as we saw last November when protests erupted nationwide against the draconian zero-COVID policy.
