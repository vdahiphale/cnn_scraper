      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is One World. The tension between Niger and its regionalneighbors is growing. The Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, plans to meet Thursday to decide its next move. The bloc gave Niger's military junta until yesterday to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, which, of course, did not happen. ECOWAS has said the use of force is still a possibility. Niger appears to be getting ready with the junta calling for troops from around the country to go back to the capital. On Sunday, the junta shut down all airspace over Niger. That's led Air France to suspend flights to and from Niger's capital and neighboring countries, as well. CNN's Larry Madowo is following this story from Nairobi. Larry, here's the thing. If ECOWAS puts on the table the idea of military intervention, if President Bazoum is not reinstated and does not follow through with that, what are the ramifications of that, do you think?",

But ECOWAS boxed themselves in with this decision. By threatening military action within a week, they have either to go through with it or risk losing that credibility, but they have to save face somehow. They made it seem like this was always going to happen. Now, President Bola Tinubu, who's chairing the heads of state summit, is calling another summit to deliberate on what they will do which is buying time, I guess, as political or diplomatic options are considered here. But the military has been making a big show of how much support they have. For instance, this extraordinary video from the main stadium in Niamey, which was failed by supporters of the coup, keen to show France, keen to show the West, but especially keen to show ECOWAS that they support the military against any external aggression. It's important to note that so far, we have not seen any pro-Bazoum voices, and I will get to that in a second. First, I want you to hear from some of the protesters who were there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNKNOWN (through translator): If ECOWAS forces decide to attack our country before reaching the presidential palace, they will have to walk over our bodies, spill our blood, and we'll do it with pride. It's France that's behind this ECOWAS force that wants to attack us. UNKNOWN (through translator): I think that everywhere in the world, they see that the people are mobilized. They're going to have to crush us all to reach the presidential palace. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That is a valid point of view held by some in the country. But also, we have not seen any strong supporters of President Mohamed Bazoum's government. Yes, they exist. But in a country where there's very little independent media, state television has been controlling the narrative here. And all they're showing is these rallies across the nation supporting the military, as if there are no people who support President Bazoum, who feel slighted by the military taking over. The only time we saw them, Zain, was on July 26, the first time that President Bazoum was held at the presidential palace and people spontaneously gathered outside the National Assembly to support him, to say he needs to be released, and they want a path back to democracy.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think if you sort of take it at very, very basic principles, this was the second in aseries of discussions like this with countries, not all of them, many of them though, supporters of Ukraine, others undecided, others like India, China, the UAE, South Africa, who are all impacted economically by the war and to varying degrees engage with Russia and Ukraine would like them to not engage at an economic level because engaging at an economic level with Russia whether you're buying coal, buying gas, buying oil. That helps fund the war in Ukraine. So, Ukraine is out to try to explain to those countries not to do it, but at the same time those countries are also out to explain to Ukraine, you're not perhaps not the biggest player here at the table, you've got strong allies, but there are ground realities. President Putin is somebody we do business with, and we don't like the fact that our economies are being rattled. So, you know, you may have to come to a different consensus about what peace looks like in the future. Ukraine believes that their 10-point peace plan is the one to go with, and that means that Russia should leave all of Ukraine's territory. I think it's very telling here from what one of the biggest players around the table had to say. And before I say that, it's telling that Saudi Arabia was able to get them, China, to the table, and the Ukrainians were very grateful for that. And I think that's a significant sort of part of the expansion of the talks, what Saudi was able to bring to the table and the players it was able to bring to the table. You had the Saudi host sitting right in between the U.S. delegate and the Chinese delegate. These things are not insignificant. But the Chinese takeaway is, look, this has bought a degree of trust in all the parties around the table and a degree of understanding of what the international consensus is. So, if China says that, even if it's not moving to the same goalpost that that Ukraine wants, it is a more successful peace narrative than we've previously had, but the reality is the war is still being fought and there's no end in sight. Indeed, the Russians, as you said, weren't at the table, and you know, one of their strongest or most vocal politicians is saying this is no time for peace talks with Ukraine.",

In the context ofMykolaiv and President Zelenskyy's visit, there will have been a high degree of concern about what is seen as collaborators. You know, going back more than a year now, the city's governor there has been extremely concerned that buildings that are getting targeted in Mykolaiv, it really gives the impression that the Russians know who's in the building and when they're in the building. So, there's this real concern about collaborators. That's probably writ large around Ukraine, but we know for sure Mykolaiv. So, this woman, unnamed woman, that the Ukrainian intelligence services are pointing the finger at here, she was working on a Ukrainian military base about 30 miles, 50 kilometers from Mykolaiv. She was running a store in that base. And what the intelligence services are saying is she was trying to gather information about precisely where Zelenskyy would be and at what time. And they believe that that was going to help bring in Russian airstrikes on his position, assassinate him. And they also say that this woman had been told to try to get information about Ukraine's electronic warfare sites, vital for sort of Ukraine's air defenses holding off the cruise missiles and drones and all those sorts of attacks. So, this is somebody they now have in custody. But this won't be the search, the end of their search for collaborators.

Now, what we know from the U.S. military is that U.S. Northern Command and NORAD, they did respond to this Russian and Chinese fleet presence in the Bering Sea off the coast of the Aleutian Islands last week, and they sent, according to the U.S. senators from Alaska, roughly four U.S. Navy destroyers, as well as reconnaissance aircraft to kind of track the movements of these Russian and Chinese vessels. But U.S. Northern Command in a statement to CNN, they did say that these did not pose a threat to the U.S. or Canada and that they were in international waters the entire time. But still, it's raising a lot of concerns, especially among the lawmakers from Alaska, about how close Russia and China are getting to the U.S. and to Canada with these exercises because this is not the first time that they have done this. They conducted this kind of exercise last summer, as well, and at that time, the U.S. response was, according to Dan Sullivan, one of the U.S. senators from Alaska, tepid. That is the word he used, because it really only was a U.S. Coast Guard vessel on a routine patrol that encountered these Russian and Chinese ships. Well, this time around, the U.S. military is responding much more forcefully. We saw the Navy destroyers, the planes, and they're emphasizing, you know, that this is part of their growing response, of course, to these Chinese and Russian activities, which are posing, you know, if not a threat, they are at least just very provocative, right, especially at a moment when the U.S.-China-Russia relations are so tense. Now, the U.S. Senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan, he actually described this, quote, \"as a new era of authoritarian aggression led by the dictators in Beijing and Moscow\". As you mentioned, Zain, China did release a statement saying that this was not directed at any third party or was part of kind of routine exercises, but still bound to raise a lot of questions here about the military cooperation between them and of course about how close they're willing to get to the United States, Zain.",

Civil officials in the capital of Juneau have issued an emergency declaration after an outburst from a glacier- dammed lake and inundated the region. The record high flooding also prompted some local evacuations, as well. In Italy, wildfires have forced the evacuation of more than 600 people from tourist areas around Sardinia. Italy's fire brigade says strong winds fueled more than 40 wildfires on the island. The flames came close to urban areas and even reached a popular beach resort. Investigators are looking into arson as a possible cause. And Somalia says 45 jihadists belonging to an al-Shabaab group were killed in a joint international operation in central Somalia. An army statement says 10 prominent leaders were among those killed. Al-Shabaab is the largest and most active al-Qaeda network in the world. That's according to U.S.-Africa command. All right, it is a pivotal week that could determine Niger's political future. Last week, ECOWAS, the 15-nation bloc of West African states, threatened Niger's coup leaders with military intervention if the country's democratically elected president was not reinstated by the end of the weekend. Now, 24 hours later, President Mohamed Bazoum is still not back in power and his whereabouts are not clear. So, what exactly happens next? ECOWAS now has a decision to make whether or not to bring in troops. Any intervention could have a profound effect across the region, a region by the way that's already been beset by coups and of course would be fertile ground for Islamic groups to gain more power.

Now, we're close to 24 hours after the deadline has passed, it doesn't look like a military intervention will happen. Now, the ECOWAS is now facing legal but also operational challenges for a military intervention to take place. Nigeria did not get the approval of their Senate to send troops to the ECOWAS.

I think that the ECOWAS has tried to play on the diplomatic negotiations on threats and thought that it could potentially bring back President Bazoum. And I think the main mistake that ECOWAS has made was to draw this red line and saying that if you do not reinstate President Bazoum, that's the only condition that will make the sanctions and take away this threat of military intervention. Now, the diplomatic negotiations have not been successful. Last week, Nigeria sent the Sultan of Sokoto, who is a very respectful religious leader in the region. So not only in Nigeria, but also in Niger and also the former President of Nigeria Abdulsalami who is a military leader to negotiate with the Niger junta. The negotiations were not successful and what we've seen in the last couple of days is Niger closing its airspace. So, now what should we make of this? That clearly shows that the Nigerian junta is not ready to relinquish power, that they are ready to fight, and that they will make sure that the ECOWAS is unsuccessful in its attempts to reinstate President Bazoum.

They have three school-aged children. The school year is fast approaching. If they don't have the documents necessary or a place that they've called home for at least two weeks, there is a challenge there where they cannot actually register the children to start school this coming semester. So, it's really just a myriad of challenges right now for the asylum seekers themselves. But as for the city, it's finding places for these asylum seekers to call home. And it's gotten to a point where Mayor Adams has not ruled out the possibility that they could even erect tents in the iconic Central Park to house asylum seekers. So, this all really, there's still many moving pieces in all of this well over a year into New York City's asylum seeker crisis. Over 100,000 people have turned to the city and out of those, about 56,000 of them are still in the city's care. The system is certainly buckling under pressure. Zain.",

We have continued to hear not justfrom New York City officials, but also officials in Washington acknowledging that this continues to be a federal issue, that many of these asylum seekers are presenting themselves before a federal system. They are petitioning for asylum. But according to New York City's mayor, they have not seen a leading role from the Biden administration, though they do continue with their conversations. Now, the White House, for its part, maintains that they are engaged in those talks with the administration of New York City's mayor. But still, we have not seen any actual sort of concrete movement, especially any sort of long-term policy that would specifically address this issue coming from Washington, even coming from the state. So, this is why the city level is really calling on that involvement, both at the state and at the federal level, for some kind of response to this crisis that continues to worsen by the day.",

Nigeria ultimately lost and England ended up advancing to thequarterfinals after winning in a penalty shootout. Even after their star player, Lauren James, was sent off in regulation time. England now face either Jamaica or Colombia. And in another big match, co-hosts Australia are on their way to the quarterfinals after 2-0 win over Denmark. A crowd of over 75,000 packed the stadium in Sydney to watch the match. Australia will either face France or Morocco on Saturday in the last eight of the tournament. For more on this, let's bring in Don Riddell. So, here's the thing. I mean, yes, Nigeria lost and that is certainly a bummer, but Nigeria also proved that they can go toe-to-toe with literally one of the best teams in the world. I mean they lost but it could have gone either way. They gave it everything. That's my summary.",

They held the Olympic champions Canada to a goalless draw. And also, it was goalless against European champions England after 120 minutes. But in the end, it just wasn't to be. We're showing you some of the key highlights here. England thought they could have had a penalty during this game. VAR thought otherwise. This actually was the turning point when Lauren James was sent off for a rather petulant kick at one of the Nigerian players. She earned a straight red card for that. And you would think that that would play to Nigeria's advantage, having an extra player for half an hour. But it wasn't the case. They actually found it harder to play against 10. Nigeria missed their first two kicks in the shootout and look at that from Chloe Kelly the decisive goal in the shootout for England. I think England will feel as though they dodged a bullet here today. Nigeria played incredibly well. The Super Falcons will feel hard done by, but in the end, England squeaked through. That's football sometimes. Sometimes it's very, very close and penalties decided and it's no fun to be involved in a penalty shootout. But England, I think, in that regard, were the better team today but it was the luckiest goal for them.",
