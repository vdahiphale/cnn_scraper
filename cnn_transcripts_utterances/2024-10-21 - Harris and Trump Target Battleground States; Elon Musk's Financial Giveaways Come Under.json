Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been out in force over the past few hours with just 15 days until the presidential election here in the United States. Vice President Harris has been making a push for right leaning voters, teaming up with Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. They're touring three of the key battleground states, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Harris warned that another Trump presidency would be historic in all the wrong ways.

But the place where she can most easily grow her vote, increase her vote is among women, including women who have leaned Republican in the past. Maybe 20 to 25 percent of Republicans consistently in polls over the last four years have shown resistance to Trump. There is a bigger segment of Republican leaning independents who have shown resistance to him. And post Dobbs, you know, we talked about this before, Biden ran well among college educated white women in those states post Dobbs in 2022, after the Supreme Court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion. The Democratic gubernatorial candidates in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and even Arizona ran even better among those women. So, I think there is room for her to grow. She also needs at least some gains, I think, among the blue-collar white women who are also mostly prochoice, but probably don't prioritize it as much as they do economic issues, in which Trump has been targeting with his safety message about crime and Immigration. If she is going to win these states then she is going to have to have a really big margin among women. But to her advantage, in all of the battleground states and new projections that I'm writing about tomorrow on cnn.com, women will cast a majority of the votes. So, if she wins women by as much as Trump wins men, that would be advantage Harris.",

Staying with US politics, critics are calling it a giveaway gone too far from tech billionaire and Donald Trump supporter Elon Musk. Over the weekend, Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, announced a $1 million a day cash award contest for registered voters in U.S. battlegrounds. Now, to get a chance to win, voters had to sign a petition in support of the First and Second Amendments. Musk says he would choose the people randomly.

In addition to financing much of Hezbollah's operations, according to the Israeli government, it is also a financial institution that serves hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians. And so, what this really is, is a part of this kind of broader effort by the Israeli government, as we've seen over the course of last month, to not only break down Hezbollah from a military standpoint, but to also try and bring more political pressure, internal pressure within Lebanon to bear on Hezbollah in an effort to try and get Hezbollah to agree to the kinds of terms of a ceasefire that Israel would like to see, which involves not just a cessation of hostilities, which Hezbollah has in fact floated, but rather to also see Hezbollah withdraw from several dozen kilometers north of the Israel-Lebanon border.

Officials say more than 52,000 workers are on the job 24/7 trying to restore power. And that they understand the growing anger. Without electricity, there's no water, he says. No medicine production, no food distribution. Electricity affects everything, and it frustrates everyone. In 2021, power outages sparked the largest ever protests against Cuba's communist run government. Hundreds of people were arrested and given lengthy prison sentences following mass trials. Cuba's president on Sunday warned people not to take to the streets. We're not going to allow acts of vandalism and much less, alter the tranquility of our people, he says. That's a conviction, a principle of our revolution. A stern warning, but one that likely falls on deaf ears for the millions of Cubans still in the dark.

These power plants are antiquated they are way past being improved, modernized, and there's just no money to do that. As well, Cuba is receiving, for whatever reason, thousands of barrels of oil, less than they used to from allies like Venezuela and Russia.

It's really high in carbs. It definitely has a lot of preservatives. It's very high in sodium. And there's just not any nutrition in these traditional ramen brands. So, Immi is the world's first high protein, low carb, high fiber, and fully plant-based instant ramen. There's really nothing like it in the market.

And in the first year, what we didn't realize is that the formulation you create in your kitchen is often not what a manufacturer can replicate in a production level setting with all of their equipment, their machines, you know, you can't just like expect them to roll the dough in a certain way that you've done at home. So, when we first worked -- in the first year, when we first worked with a U.S.-based manufacturer, they actually didn't have any experience with traditional instant ramen.

You know, we -- I was actually manning the customer experience channel, myself, responding to all the tickets, issuing a lot of refunds, and we almost ran out of cash, we thought we were going to go out of business, but it was actually -- as soon as we launched, we started going right back out to the international manufacturers out in Asia and we set up a whole new production process, a whole new supply chain, all international. And that took another year just to get set up. So, by the time we got to version two, we were again, almost dead, but barely surviving. And we finally made it out of that slump.",

And I think there's a lot of people around the world who are still eating traditional instant ramen, which is filled with horrible ingredients, no nutrition whatsoever, no protein, no fiber, full of carbs really bad for metabolic health because it's spiking your blood sugar. And we said, look, we can provide a better foundation for people. And then, they can always add their own whole ingredients. So, we like being that gateway. And in fact, a lot of our customers call us a gateway into their health and wellness journey, where they don't want to give up this nostalgic, delicious product that they've eaten their entire life, yet they're not ready to make that full commitment to just go on a full juice cleanse or going to full salad cleanse. And so, we are really happy to be that meal they can enjoy throughout the week and again, add their own whole ingredients.",

He'dnever played in the postseason until now, Julia, but all of a sudden, he's in the World Series. It's called the Fall Classic, and it has all the makings of a classic. Of course, nobody has won it more times than the New York Yankees. They're back in the series for the first time in 15 years, led by stars such as Aaron Judge taking on the L.A. Dodgers, who last won it just four years ago. But of course, now they have Ohtani leading the line. These are two massive franchises, East Coast against West Coast. It's going to be such a big deal. It does, though, mean we won't have what's known as a subway series in the Big Apple because the Dodgers beat the Mets in the National League Championship Series. Dodgers winning by 10 runs to five. In Sunday night's game six, shortstop Tommy Edman igniting the L.A. charge in the first inning with a two-run double. Then he added a two-run homer in the third, setting the stage for a star-studded World Series. It is going to be the 12th time that the Dodgers and the Yankees will have faced each other in the Fall Classic. But as you say, Julia, the first time since 1981. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHOHEI OHTANI, LOS ANGELES DODGERS DESIGNATED HITTER (through translator):  it's the place that I've dreamt of playing all my life. And to be able to finally come to the stage and be able to, you know, play and hopefully win it is my next goal. The Yankees are a really good team with a lot of good players and really good coaches. I'm really looking forward to playing against them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And this final series was gripping, going right down to the wire over time in Game 5. The New York Liberty fans, of course, they loved it in Brooklyn. They witnessed their team's first ever title, denying the Minnesota Lynx what would have been a record fifth championship for them. Locker room celebrations are always so much fun. This the moment when the players can finally let their hair down and enjoy the fruits of all their labor. But believe it or not, injuries can happen in these situations. And look at this Julia, Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu posing with the trophy. Suddenly, she got a cramp and that looked pretty uncomfortable for her. Luckily, the training staff was right there to try and work it out. Hopefully, the silverware helped dull some of the pain. She's had a great season and of course, her game three -- three pointer from the logo was a real mic drop winner to win that game. That will be remembered as one of the most memorable moments of the series. And we're looking forward to seeing her and all the other great players in action again, next season. Can't wait for it.",
