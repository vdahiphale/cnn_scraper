This has been something they have been trying to avoid. And in fact, over the course of the invasion of Ukraine, we've only seen NATO strengthened and more unified as a body. And of course, now the prospect of not only Finland joining today but also the prospect of potentially Sweden joining at a later date will be a significant concern for Moscow. This has been a key focus for them, of course, with fears that Ukraine could one day also join the NATO alliance. But of course, this is a significant step for the NATO alliance, a 31st member. We've heard from Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General, speaking yesterday. He described this as a historic step for Finland, for the Nordic region and for NATO as a whole. But also said that he is optimistic that this could be laying the groundwork for Sweden to join at some point. Of course, we've seen that being a key sticking point of the last few months, intense negotiations between Sweden, Finland and crucially, Turkey and Hungary, who have been holding up at the ratification process. There are -- those talks are still ongoing; one would come to Sweden. But of course, there is a real focus on the potential for that to continue to expand, and that will be a real concern for Moscow.",

Those grievances haven't been outlined as clearly as Turkey. Perhaps, although they have said they have concerns over Sweden's approach to Hungary when it comes to descriptions of Hungary's democratic process and the strength of Hungary's democracy.
