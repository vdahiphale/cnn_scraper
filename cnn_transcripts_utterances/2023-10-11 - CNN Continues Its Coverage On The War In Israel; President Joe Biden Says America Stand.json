You're seeing these images, buildings completely reduced to rubble. Civilians there, let me tell you, are facing a desperate crisis. Right now, as I speak, the U.N. says more than 260,000 people are displaced. Washington, obviously aware of what's happening in Gaza, obviously aware of the situation there. It says that it's talking with Israel. It's talking to Egypt as well about the safe passage for Americans and for civilians from other countries, too. But President Joe Biden was very clear about one thing when he spoke yesterday that his support for Israel is unwavering. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The brutality of Hamas, his bloodthirstiness, brings to mind the worst -- the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism.

Now, I've been told that an exchange certainly hasn't been rejected by either side. Any exchange of course would have precedence, not least when the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalip was released in 2011 in exchange for a thousand prisoners from Israeli prisons. His release coming five and a half years after Shalip was captured in southern Israel along the Gaza Strip. And let's -- again for contact -- for context, remember here, the Qataris were the key interlocutors in the recent U.S.-Iran prisoner exchange. They have an open line of communication with Hamas since the mid-2000s. This was at the behest of the Bush administration. And we know in the past conflicts, not least 2021, alongside the Egyptians, Qatar helped secure a ceasefire.

At least 22 U.S. citizenshave now died in Israel, according to a State Department spokesman. Previously, President Biden had said 14 U.S. citizens had been killed. Well, the United Nations has confirmed that 11 of its staff members working with the U.N. Palestinian Refugee Agency have been killed in the airstrikes on Gaza since Saturday. Let's bring in Tamara Alrifai, who's spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. She is joining me live from Amman in Jordan. It's good to have you. Condolences on the loss of the lives of so many of your colleagues in Gaza. Just tell us what you understand to be going on at present.",

This is not, of course, the first time that there have been strikes on the community there, but this time the intensity of these strikes is so powerful. Just explain how important it is that the U.N. facilities are functioning and the point that you're making is that this total siege as described by the defense minister of Israel on Gaza is going to prevent any further fuel, food, electricity, water supplies getting into the besieged area.",

      "sentences": "Exactly, Becky. If you recall, you and I had a similar interview in 2021. This is to speak of the multiple conflicts that Gaza had to gothrough. Sadly, this being one of the most densely populated places on Earth, 2.2 million people live on the strip -- on the Gaza Strip, 1.7 million of them are considered Palestine refugees. This is why UNRWA, the U.N agency for Palestinian refugees, the agency I work for, is very, very heavily present in Gaza with a network of over 180 schools and 25 health centers. So, it is in these buildings that people in Gaza seek shelter and a safe haven when Gaza is undergoing the kind of bombing and shelling that it is right now. And this why when they see a blue fly, many of them run toward our schools. Now, the challenge we are facing is that we had around 50 schools prepared to become shelters. You know, for a regular school to become a shelter for over 2000 people, we need mobile toilets and mobile showers and repositioning of water and food and cleaning utensils, et cetera. We only have 50 of those ready, and people are now in over 90 of our schools. They're actually even in our health centers which is obstructing the work of our health workers. So, there's a lot of chaos and there's a lot of distress, to say the least.",

This is unlike anything we have seen before, even though UNRWA hasaccompanied Palestine refugees throughout several conflicts since 2008. My colleagues are extremely worried, and I want to say a word here for my colleagues -- in support of my colleagues in Gaza. There are around 5000 people running these shelters. Most of my colleagues are Palestine refugees themselves. So, many of them are themselves displaced into these same schools and they fear for their safety and the safety of their families. My international colleagues are managing the operation, making sure that there are enough supplies, but this can turn very, very dangerous because there aren't enough supplies.",

Just the unimaginable 74-year-old Vivian Silver, pictured here in the blue hat, took shelter in her home after Hamas' surprise attack on her kibbutz near the Gaza Strip Saturday. She had been talking to one of her sons about the rockets and gunfire happening right outside her home. But as the violence intensified, she hid in a closet and switched to texting, describing the sounds of shooting and screaming getting closer. And in one last harrowing message, she said the militants were coming inside. That's the last time anyone heard from her. Chen Zeigen joins us live now from Connecticut. He's Vivian Silver's son. Hen, thank you so much for being with us. I have to say before I begin speaking about Saturday and what happened, everything I've read about your mom, she is an inspiration, okay? She is an inspiration. Just the amount of work that she did tirelessly to help Palestinians, to help Israelis and Arabs live peacefully side by side is inspirational to me. God knows what you're going through. Just explain to us what you have heard from anybody else on the kibbutz.
