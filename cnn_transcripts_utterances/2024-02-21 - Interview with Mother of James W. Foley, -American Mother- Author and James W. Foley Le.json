And finally, choreographer Alexei Ratmansky on swapping Moscow for New York after Russia's Ukraine invasion. Welcome to the program, everyone, I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. Also in occupied Ukraine today was Moscow's top general, Valery Gerasimov, handing out medals to troops who fought to take the key town of Avdiivka over the weekend. A strategic location that Ukraine's foreign minister told me on this program last night would not have fallen to the Russians if the vital ammunition supply line was not blocked in Washington. This weekend marks two years since Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But his forces were unable to take this capital or topple the government. And with the support of NATO, Ukraine has been holding Russia off for those two years. But today, with a critical shortage of weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is frantically trying to plug the gaps on the front lines, as we discovered for this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over):  Snow falls softly on new recruits for the Ukrainian Army 3rd Assault Brigade. Drill sergeants push them through their paces with urgent basic training for the trenches, urban warfare, and assault maneuvers. Every woman and man counts now for a battle that seems to have returned to the dire days at the start. 28-year-old Serhii came back from Lithuania to serve two weeks ago, despite his health.",

The same with weapons. There aren't enough shells for artillery and tanks, or the tanks and artillery themselves. On a brief hiatus in the rear, they've had to buy their own mortar. Small caliber, just for self-defense. Problem is, no ammunition. Anastasia practices perfecting her balance, her endurance, regaining the strength to shoulder her weapons, and she wants to go back to the front. I think anything is possible, she says. But whatever happens, we all need to fight this together because the enemy is advancing. No one wants their children to still be fighting the war they and their parents have been fighting ever since Putin's first invasion a decade ago. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (on camera):  Now here in Ukraine, it is not just the soldiers under fire, it is, of course, civilians, including journalists. Some 26 of whom have been killed since Russia's invasion of Crimea back in 2014. It's happening in many of the global wars, but perhaps the toll in Gaza is the most appalling right now. At least 88 reporters and media workers have been killed in Israel's offensive on the enclave. And they have died since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th. That's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. My next guest knows the pain of this more than almost anyone. Diane Foley lost her son, James, 10 years ago, when he was covering the Syrian civil war and was kidnapped and then murdered by ISIS. Now, a committed campaigner to help people like him, Foley has written her story in her memoir, \"American Mother.\" And she joins me from London alongside the celebrated author Colum McCann, who wrote the book with her. Welcome to you both. Diane, you know, I wonder what it took for you to distill all the pain and heartbreak that you've been going through to get it down on paper and write a story for everybody else to read about and understand. DIANE FOLEY, MOTHER OF JAMES W. FOLEY, AUTHOR, \"AMERICAN MOTHER\" AND PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, JAMES W. FOLEY LEGACY FOUNDATION:  Well, it took meeting Colum McCann. It really did. I really wanted to tell the story, Christiane, because I do think that's a way of keeping people alive, but I really needed a partnership with someone who knew how to do it. So, we -- once we met one another, it became clear that Colum would be the one who could help me do that.",

And my biggest feeling was deep sadness for everyone. I mean, we had lost our beloved Jim and, you know, he's lost his freedom forever. He'll never see his family or go back to his home country again. So, that's what hatred begets. It just begets lots of suffering. And so, I thought that might be the last time I ever saw him. So, not knowing anything about the Muslim tradition of not touching a man's hand, as an American, the only way I could say goodbye was to offer my hand and to say goodbye to him.

What do you -- what -- you know, the question I'm asking is, because it brings back to me the image of Mrs. Lifshitz, the elderly lady who was released very, very early on by Hamas, and who turned around and either shook his hand or said shalom something, and there was such a hubbub about it.

And in order to understand, we have to listen to one another's stories, and we have to sort of look across that very, very deep divide sometimes and try and vault away from the deep pessimism into some sort of available light. And you know, I have worked with people in Israel and Palestine, in particular Rami Elhanan and Bassam Aramin.

I always come with primaries in the United States. And we discuss -- you know, the last letter -- so you know. The last letter I sent to Alyosha, that's his nickname, in Russia we go by the nicknames, was on February 9, 2024. So, you know, 10 days ago. And the entire letter was about U.S. primaries, and linked, and there was U.S. primaries, and what's happening to Trump, what kind of court cases, and numbers, and the numbers, you know, that Biden is -- you know, is getting a lot of negative publicity, all this, everything. Long, long letter, because we discuss this constantly with Alexei over letters. So -- and I think it is -- as far as my understanding, the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives, they got an order from the plausible second time president, from Donald Trump, not to support the bill. And I think they just follow the orders because the choice is for them that if Trump -- you know, everybody saw the fate of death of Liz Cheney who was a prominent conservative, who was, you know, a daughter of very prominent conservative and (INAUDIBLE) and went against Trump, was kicked out of the Congress. So -- and I think that, unfortunately, some politicians in GOP, they forgot about the common good, and all they care about is about pork barrels. That's it.",

It happened in summer '22. And then, when I was preparing my first ballet for New York City Ballet as a choreographer in residence, I've been listening to Gustav Mahler's symphonies and I had this image in mind and I understood that I can't let it go, this -- the emotions and the -- you know, I look at things with choreographer's eyes and I read body language.

It's more a contemporary dance field. Dance on point with the classical positions. Something that actually is designed to take you away from reality. Is an uncomfortable coexistence. And I almost felt like I'm not even allowed to go in that territory. But with the help of extraordinary Mahler's music and the beautiful dancers of New York City Ballet, I think we built something that resonated.

First, I do feel that it's -- despite the tragedy of what is going on, I think it's a renaissanceof Ukrainian culture, because many people who were between two cultures, like myself, I received my ballet education in Russia, and I staged many, many ballets with both Mariinsky and Bolshoi. But I am from Kyiv, and I feel more and more Ukrainian now. And I think there are many people like me and also, I think that Ukrainian artists are now seen and recognized because the whole history of domination of Russian empire over Ukraine and then Soviet empire and the post-Soviet, you know, times, it's all the same. The best -- the most talented Ukrainian artists were almost like swallowed by Russia and they became integral part of Russian culture. Many artists who came from Ukraine grew up there and received their education there are still called Russian artists. I have always been called a Russian choreographer. And of course, there is a big part of Russia in me, but I think it is a spotlight on Ukraine at the moment. At the same time, Ukraine is losing so much, so many museums, libraries, clubs, art institutions, schools are destroyed. If you talk about ballet, imagine how many ballet students left Ukraine and now are studying abroad. They will graduate and they will join companies in America and Europe and will be lost for Ukraine. Ukrainian -- big Ukrainian companies keep performing under constant shellings. When the air raid alarm sounds, the performance stops, they go to the shelter and sometimes they continue, sometimes they don't. But big companies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Lviv, they keep performing, and I think it's extraordinary. They show real heroism, yes. I also wanted to add that many artists are killed, they took up arms. And my former colleagues from Kyiv, who I worked with before, they were killed by Russians.",
