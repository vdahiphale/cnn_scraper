The first two, the Russians have limited number of troops defending them, although they do have minefields and wires, they do have some troops in the trenches. And the Ukrainians have been successful against those lines, although it's moving slowly.That map that you're showing from the front line where the red begins all the way to the bottom where those three cities are, we just talked about, is probably close to about 70 miles. So, it is a tough offensive as you are going through various obstacle belts. And like I said, what the Russians are calling their zero line is the one furthest south. That's the one that has the most obstacles, supposedly the best trained Russian forces, although, in different parts of that line, you'll see different standards of quality in the Russian forces. So, what Ukrainian forces are now trying to do is find the best place to continue their attack, and even in some cases have their special operations forces behind those lines and attacking from the rear along with the territorials. So, again, it'll -- it will be slow moving, we've known this from the start. There will be a whole lot of casualties along each one of those four lines on both sides, but it's going to be dependent on how stiff the Russian resistance is. And what we've seen so far is they are -- they have become stiff in some areas and they have runaway in others. So, it's going to just -- I'm going to introduce you to a new doctrinal term this morning, John, and that's DOTS, depends on the situation that the enemy holds and which Ukraine can push through.",

But, of course, Boris Johnson, perhaps, pre- empting the outcome and response to this committee report did step down from his role as member of parliament just over a week ago.So, what MPs are debating on right now, what they are expected to be voting on later this evening isn't necessarily Boris Johnson's parliamentary future, but whether or not they agree on the findings of this committee report. And crucially, whether Boris Johnson should be rejected from having a pass member's access to the palace of Westminster. Now, Boris Johnson in response to the findings of this report described it as a charade. He's accused the committee of twisting the truth in order to serve its purposes. But, look, there are still real anger, real frustration being directed towards the government, and those working under Boris Johnson over those Partygate allegations. And of course, as you mentioned there, this is still very much in the headlines.

It was initially devised by a Belgian mathematician, trying to characterize, \"Normal man\". It wasn't until 1972 that a physiologist actually adopted it for its current use, which is really as an assessment and of screening tool for obesity, but that itself was done primarily in men.And so, the American Medical Association is just pointing out what, I think, a lot of doctors have already been saying, this is kind of a problematic tool when used for individuals. It said last week, that it significantly correlated with the amount of fat mass in the general population but loses predictability when applied on the individual level. And this is really what the issue is. It really doesn't apply well when you're thinking about it as a measure of individual health risk. It doesn't account for differences among races, among sexes, among ages. There's all kind of issues with it. Including that it doesn't account for where fat is stored on the body which can be a really important health marker. The middle versus the hips and the thighs, for example. But this is something that's used incredibly broadly. It's on every medical record. It's used as, sort of, a gatekeeper for weight loss drugs. It can determine your eligibility for certain surgeries. It can also play into life insurance rates. So, this is something that really requires more scrutiny.",
