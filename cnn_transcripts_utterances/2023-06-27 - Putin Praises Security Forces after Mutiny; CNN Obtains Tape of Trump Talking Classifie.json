The Russian President just two hours ago thanking security forces who he sees prevented a civil war. Russia also offering mercy to the mercenaries dropping all charges against the Wagner group after the aborted rebellion. Defense Ministry says Wagner will hand over its heavy hardware. The outstanding issue remains the whereabouts of Wagner's big gun Yevgeny Prigozhin plus Ukraine's gains. President Zelenskyy heads to the frontline saying chips are advancing against Russia on all sides. Ukraine hoping this short live mutiny will weaken Russia's resolve. And Trump tape to CNN obtains recordings of the Former President claiming to have had it in his possession, a secret Pentagon document that he did not declassify. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified papers after report just ahead. And from taping to ticker tape, shaping off Monday's malaise, investors pushing stocks, mostly higher, as you can see that pre market though still a relatively cautious picture over in Europe. We also have a bevy of central bankers speaking this week as policymakers meet in Portugal -- certainly for Fed Chair Powell, who's set to speak on Wednesday and on Thursday. And in the meantime, ECB had Christine Lagarde keeping the message very clear, saying the European Central Bank is set to raise interest rates again next month. And another big confab two sponsored by the World Economic Forum taking place in China, where the premier says Beijing will hit its 5 percent growth target, despite fears of a slowdown. And I think that helped to get proceed with a better tone across the Chinese markets today with the HANG SENG rising for the first time in five sessions. News today to that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is planning a trip to Beijing next month too. It's a truly global tour in store today that we do begin in Russia, where President Putin spoke to his security forces about the Wagner revolt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Does he mean a clash between Prigozhin and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Defense Minister because that's what it looked like from the outside? Perhaps is giving us an insight that we're not getting from the Kremlin, that that's what it came down to. You know, I think what we hear we hear from Lukashenko are a couple of things. You know, I think he's afraid that the contagion can spread. He said that one of the first things he'd done was put his own military on a full state of military readiness. He's told his people not to worry about the Wagner elements coming into Belarus, because they have military experience, and they could be useful and helpful for, you know, for the defense of Belarus. So I think there's a sense here from Lukashenko that he played a role, but he played it, potentially because he was told to. He doesn't want the contagion of revolt, to spread to his country. And he's trying to sort of set a narrative here that he's done this for the right reasons because Russia was suffering. It's the fatherland if Russia collapses, we'll be under the rubble dead as well, meaning if there was a revolt in Russia. There'd be revolt in Belarus as well, which would bring him down. I think this all comes down to Lukashenko's ability to continue to hold on to power and protect it a calamity for Putin is a calamity for Lukashenko. I think that's a simple subscript here.",

CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich joins us now, Vanessa, great to have you on the show with us. It's sort of the perfect storm sharply rising interest rates in the United States, a local banking credit crunch that they've tightened up restrictions and not to mention people not going to work so much in cities. How big is this problem? And could it get worse? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, the commercial real estate industry is a $20 trillion market. And as you mentioned, several factors are playing in here. One of the big ones is that Americans changed the way we wanted to work and businesses responded. So you have high vacancy rates in the country right now about 19 percent. And that is leaving landlords in a bind. Without tenants, they have to come up with creative ways in order to make money.

Skyscrapers and office buildings went stacked high with businesses are experiencing high vacancy rates in the U.S. nearly 19 percent, five and a half percent higher than before the pandemic. STEVEN DURELS, EVP &amp; DIRECTOR OF LEASING, SL GREEN REALTY: I think it's a very unique moment nothing like any disruptive marketplace that I've experienced over the past 40 years.

And so there's like a positive feedback loop where as your model gets better, it gets better at cleaning the data to train the next, the next model. The second strategy is yes, we put this data in front of humans, and we ask humans to generate it. And so we're getting human eyes on each data point checking whether it's of the sort that we want our models to, to observe.",

Like, even before we had computers, humans have been telling stories about,you know, our machines, becoming intelligent automatons, and then taking over the world. And so that is embedded into the public's consciousness in such a deep way that spans literally a century. And so when people look at this technology, they see how smart it is, they interact with it, it's so shocking, it's so surprising that we've been able to develop something that's intelligent. They immediately look back to what they've heard in the past, which are these stories of doom and gloom. And so I think that it's, it's misleading. And it may be even distracts from the real problems that we're going to be facing. You mentioned some of those in the preamble, I think, social media. For instance, the ability for us to spin up a million bots, which are indistinguishable from humans, because they're so fluent, becomes way, way, way more plausible. And there are other risks like this technology is still early, we have to remember that we're in the first year of its deployment; it's a baby as a technology. And so there are places where it's not yet appropriate to deploy. We can't just replace, you know, doctors and judges, and stick in AI. That's completely, that's a terrible idea. And so there are real threats, but they're not extinction. They're not the annihilation of our species. They're much less, you know, gripping narratives, but they're much more realistic and much more plausibly implementable today.",

Today, we expect like I expected it, maybe in a quarter century. By the end of my career, if we had models could do what they're doing today; I would have thought we'd made incredible progress. And so the whole field is reckoning with shock. Our timelines have been compressed in a way that really I think took everyone by surprise. And one reaction to that shock, one reaction to grappling with that poor estimate that we all made, is to say, OK, now, anything's possible. Who knows, maybe in five years, these models will be so capable that they'll, you know, take over the world.
