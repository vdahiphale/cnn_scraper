The number of migrant encounters is actually dropping and by a lot. CNN's Rosa Flores is taking a looking at the new data. Rosa, this is fascinating. It is not what was predicted. First, tell us just how much these encounters have fallen at the border.",

Now according to the U.S. Border Patrol chief, migrant encounters at the border are at about 3,300, 3400 daily. Now if you look back at May 10th for example, the day before Title 42 lifted, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol at the time the migrant encounters surpassed 10,000. So, if you just look at the numbers that's nearly a 70 percent drop.Now despite those numbers being so low the governor of Texas Greg Abbott has continued to call on the nation's governors to send troops to the border. In fact, right now there are troops, according to his office, from Idaho, Florida, Nebraska and Tennessee. Now Jim, I'm in constant conversations with people on the border including border sheriffs. And in recent weeks they told me that they feel that the situation on the border is under control. That the federal government has it under control. But even then, more troops from other states around the country are arriving in the state of Texas.",

What I'm hearing is that migrants are waiting in Mexico because they want to enter into the country legally through CBP-1 or one of the other legal pathways that was created by the Biden administration in the lead up of the lifting of Title 42. Now there's one other interesting dynamic. CBP-1 was expanded afterTitle 42 lifted. And it included that migrants didn't have to wait in northern Mexico per se for their appointments. They could also wait in central Mexico. So just guess what has happened. Well, central Mexico, Mexico City in particular has seen a huge spike in the number of migrants who are waiting there. The head of the refugee agency there telling me that during a portion of May, Jim, they saw such a huge increase in the number of migrants seeking asylum there that they are launching an app -- Mexico is launching its own app next week to deal with that influx. And then if you're wondering, wait, are migrants planning to stay in Mexico? Is that why they're seeking asylum there? No, the head of the agency tells me that these migrants are waiting for the CBP-1 app. They're just filing for protections in Mexico while they wait -- Jim.",

What we don't know is how the carriages actually came off the tracks then hitting, of course, the goods train. Now rescue teams have been rescuing -- are going to the scenes, rushing to the scenes of this horrific train crash. More than 50 ambulances, we've been told, have rushed the scene. Can see one of the trains is actually on its side. We know -- as you can see there, everyone trying -- we don't know the number of people trapped. That's something we do not know. But I imagine given that this happened at 7:00 p.m. local time, Jim, that it would be very crowded indeed. But we have more than 50 ambulances, several fire units present. The Indian Prime Minister, Jim, Narendra Modi says he's distressed by the train accidents -- this is a tweet that I saw in the last 40 minutes or so. And that is says that his thoughts are with the bereaved families. The government has also announced, Jim, compensation. Now India -- for those of you, I'm sure will now -- has one the largest rail networks in the world with millions of people using trains every day, just crisscrossing the country of course.
