And even without President elect Donald Trump's request to suspend the debt limit included in the bill, Speaker Mike Johnson called the vote a win that will set them up for when Trump returns to the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: This is America first legislation because it allows us to be set up to deliver for the American people. In January, we will make a sea change in Washington. President Trump will return to D.C. and to the White House and we will have Republican control of the Senate and the House. Things are going to be very different around here.

And that was Donald Trump trying to pressure the Congress to pass a bill to pay for that wall along the Mexican border that he wanted and never got.And so, you know, we don't know what he's going to do because, again, the Trump style is to sort of mix and match. He does this with international trade as well, where he'll put up a financial or fiscal objection and then try to get programmatic benefits out of it. So in this case, the President-elect pretty much acknowledged that the debt ceiling is going to need to be lifted, but he'd rather do it for entirely political reasons on Biden's watch. What that suggests is that it's going to come up again. And when we're -- when we get to March, he'll probably be trying to trade it for something else, just like he did with that wall with Mexico back in 2018.",

So we're going to keep an eye on both of those because you got a lot of travelers out there today. We'd be wanting to get a head start.So we take a look at the map. Again, you can see we've got those two different systems, the one in the Northeast and then that next one that's really going to start to ramp up in the west as we go through the afternoon hours today. You've still got snow impacting. And yes, take a look at this. Areas of Massachusetts, Maine, portions of upstate New York, but also New York City. Lots of folks in and out of that city, whether that's your end destination, your start destination, or maybe you're just connecting there. We are looking at quite a significant amount of snow coming down at the moment. Right now it's going to come in waves. So we'll get some breaks as we go throughout the day. But that could lead to some delays, especially in the air, but also on the roadways as well. Other air delays possible are going to be in due to the fact that we could still see some lake effect snow as well going through the afternoon and into the evening hours. So something to keep in mind and it's because a lot of these temperatures are just so cold right now. Some of these areas, you're talking 10 to 15 degrees below where they normally would be. It's going to stay that way through the weekend. But we finally should start to see those temperatures rebounding once we get towards next week. So we take a look at this. Again, you'll gradually see those temperatures beginning to climb. It's going to take them some time. And even with that said, it's still going to take four to five days for many of these cities to even get back to normal where they should be this time of year. But we are going to start to see that warming trend. Now, we also talked about the West. This is where we've got a series of systems that's going to be coming into this area. So it's going to over time accumulate to some pretty high amounts of not just rain but also the snow, especially when you get into the higher elevations. You can see here along the coastline, you're talking 2 to 4 inches of rain. That's on the low end. Some spots could see as much as 6 inches of rain. And then the snow likely to be measured in feet in some of these areas, especially as we progress this out, say Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And also just to note, today is the first official day of astronomical winter, guys. It is the shortest day with daylight that you will have throughout the year. Atlanta, for example, going from just under about 10 hours of daylight now compared to the 14 and a half that they get in the summer.",

Not only that but the bottom of the ocean is going to be moved and upset and moved -- move a lot of debris on top of what's there.So, again, it goes back to their confidence in their technology.
