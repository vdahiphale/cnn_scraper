Grant's wife, Celine Gounder, posted the U.S. Soccer statement on Twitter and wrote, I am so thankful for the support of my husband, Grant Wahl, soccer family and of so many friend who've reach out tonight. I'm in complete shock.CNN Don Riddell join us now on the phone from Doha and Christine Brennan is back with us and John Berman is on the phone. We are reporting, trying, from all angles to figure out what would have gone so wrong and lost this tremendous life. Don, tell me, what are you learning right now in Doha about the death of Journalist Grant Wahl? DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT (voice over):  I mean, we're still just trying to I think accept honestly that this is the news that has happened. I was at the same game as Grant tonight. I didn't see him but we both covered this most extra ordinary soccer match between the Argentina and the Netherlands, which went to actually timeout penalties. And I'll be honest with you, I was lying in my bed at 5:30 this morning unable to sleep because of the drama of the game that we've witnessed and I just kind of checked my WhatsApp and saw all this news. So, we're literally just finding out about it. We've just managed to confirm the news that he has died. And I mean, I can't overemphasize the state of shock that so many of his peers and colleagues will be in and the fans also. Grant has been the foremost U.S. soccer writer in the country for the last 20-plus years. I think when you hear what others in the community are already saying, so, for example, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, Don Garber, just tweeted with his passion for soccer and his dedication to journalism was immeasurable. People are describing him as so kind and so generous. And those are sentiments that I would echo having met him numerous times over the years, and, in fact, I saw him on our set here in Doha just a couple weeks ago at the start of the tournament. And to now becoming on here in a breaking news segment to talk about the fact that he's not with us anymore is just -- is really difficult to find the words, to be quite honest with you.",

It is the entire U.S. Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl. Fans of soccer and journalism of the highest quality knew we could always count on Grant to deliver insightful and entertaining stories about our game and its major protagonists, teams, players, coaches and the many personalities that make soccer unlike any sport. Here in the United States, Grant's passion for soccer and commitment to elevating its profile across our sporting landscape played a major role in helping to drive interest in and respect for our beautiful game. As important, Grant's belief in the power of the game to advance human rights was and will remain an inspiration to all. Grant made soccer his life's work and we are devastated that he and his brilliant writing will no longer be with us. U.S. Soccer sends its sincerest condolences to Grant's wife, Dr. Celine Gounder, and all of his family members, friends and colleagues in the media. And we thank Grant for his tremendous dedication to and impact on our game in the United States. His writing and the stories he told will live on. Christine Brennan, I want to bring you into this because this is just truly stunning for so many reasons, and not the least of which as we're reading about his legacy, as many might be introduced or reintroduced or reconfirmed yet again about his journalistic integrity and his coverage. The question is, what happened and we're still trying to understand what took place, how he has passed. We're looking to confirm the details and understand why this person has lost his life while covering the World Cup in Qatar. So, please stick with us as we try to find the information and uncover the details. Christine, what's your reaction?",

Twenty-two-year-old Bakari Henderson went on vacation with friends in Greece in 2017. After taking a photo with a woman at a bar, Henderson was chased, punched, and kicked by a group of men. The attack was caught on video and I must warn you, it is hard to watch. Bakari Henderson died from his injuries. Nine men, the majority of them Serbian nationals were arrested. A Greek court convicted six of deadly assault and gave them nominal sentences. Three out of nine were convicted of simple assault and then released. According to Greek media, no one was convicted of murder. The prosecutors appealed, but in a retrial, a Greek court rejected a tough replenishment. The only recourse now a push to get the case in front of the country's Supreme Court. Joining me now are Bakari's parents, Phil, and Jill Henderson. Thank you both for joining me. Just looking at the photos of your beloved son, it is heartbreaking to think of how he was treated, what led to the end of his life and what you've been grappling with for years now, trying to secure justice. And I should mention for a lot of people thinking about it, well, why would there be the appeals from prosecutors? It's not similar to what we have here in terms of double jeopardy, but it's different where they are. I wonder if you can tell me, Jill, a little bit about what this process has been like and where things are right now in trying to get justice for your son. JILL HENDERSON, BAKARI HENDERSON'S MOTHER:  So, the process has been very challenging for us, very traumatizing for us financially, mentally, spiritually. It's been a tough road. Where we are now is we are basically, as you said, we had two trials. Both of them ended with no murder charges being con -- anyone charged with murder. And so now we are waiting for the court of appeals to go ahead and submit their position so that we can then try to appeal to the Supreme Court.

It suggests that race was part of the equation in what happened to him. And we see that there is no justice in what's happening there. I think the other thing that's important is there are incidents that happen in the United States, like with Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III, right up the road in Maryland, where we see very similarities in 2017 where young black men being killed. And I mean, it just breaks my heart.",

People have to ask themselves. How much they have heard about this particular story about Bakari. And I think without segments like this, people would not know about it.
