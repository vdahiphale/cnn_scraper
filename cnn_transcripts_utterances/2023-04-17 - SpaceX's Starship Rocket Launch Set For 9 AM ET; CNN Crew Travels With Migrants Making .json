The super-heavy booster is packed with 33 engines, and it will attempt to push the uncrewed Starship spacecraft, which sits on top of the rocket booster, into space. If the rocket launches properly the spacecraft will separate less than three minutes into the flight and travel east from south Texas and go much of the way around the Earth before splashing into the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.
