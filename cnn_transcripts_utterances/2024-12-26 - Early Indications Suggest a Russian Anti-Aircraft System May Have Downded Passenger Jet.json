Airplane parts peppered with holes could tell a different, far more ominous story.Also tonight, the president-elect acting territorial staking Christmas claims on Greenland, Canada and the Panama Canal, which belong to other countries or are other countries. Later, how some of nature's mightiest predators, big cats fell prey themselves to the horrible killer that is bird flu as it moves through birds and cattle and now felines, big and small. Are people next? Good evening, Jim Sciutto here sitting in again for Anderson. Tonight, 29 people, including two children owe their lives to a pair of pilots who nursed a badly wounded, nearly unflyable airliner across a large body of water, then somehow managed to put the plane down in such a way and in such a place that spared the lives on the ground and saved so many, miraculously on board. This is the moment the twin-engine Embraer 190 geared down, nose down, crash landed. You see the billowing smoke just short of an airfield in Kazakhstan on the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2 8243 ended up there after something terrible happened en route from Baku to Grozny in Russian Chechnya. What that something was remains unclear. Signs, however, suggest whatever happened damaged systems on board. Which flight crews use to maintain directional control. This is video from on board. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And though Russian officials are blaming a bird strike, pieces of wreckage covered in punctures suggest the possibility of shrapnel entering the fuselage from the outside.Tonight, a US official tells CNN that early indications suggest a Russian anti-aircraft missile may be to blame. Again, there is a lot to this story. We still have yet to learn and much to talk about tonight. In a moment. More from our Pentagon correspondent, CNN military analyst Mark Hertling and aerospace analyst Miles O'Brien join us. First, CNN's Nadia Bashir. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADIA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is the moment an Azerbaijani plane attempted an emergency landing, bursting into flames upon impact. Rescuers rushed to the scene, extinguishing the fire that engulfed the front of the plane and pulling out dazed survivors from the wreckage. Out of 67 people on board, including crew, at least 38 died. Remarkably, 29 people, including two children, survived and were taken to hospitals. Questions swirled on why the plane, which took off from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku enroute to Grozny in Russia, diverted to Kazakhstan. FlightRadar24 shows the plane flying across the Caspian Sea and circling in the Kazakh city of Aktau before the crash, in a pattern, an aviation expert says indicates loss of flight control systems. The crash came shortly after drone strikes hit Southern Russia. And while investigators say they are exploring all scenarios, multiple Azerbaijani sources have told Reuters that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. Video verified by Reuters reveals a rare glimpse into the last moments on board the flight. Oxygen masks down as the camera tilts to the window, showing damage to the wing. Then, in another geolocated social media video, the plane appears to nosedive. In the resulting explosion, the plane fuselage is broken into parts, with its rear half miraculously landing almost intact, but upturned. Parts of the plane scattered across a wide radius. Bodies seen covered in blue blankets. Russia and Azerbaijan evacuated their injured citizens as families in Baku waited to see if their loved ones had survived. For Azerbaijan, it is a time of mourning. (END VIDEOTAPE) [20:05:19] BASHIR (on camera): And Jim, it really is a deeply difficult moment for the family members of those who were killed on board the Azerbaijan Airlines flight, but it is remarkable that there were even survivors following this fatal crash. And now, of course, the authorities in Azerbaijan and those connected with the crash will continue their work to examine the evidence as to what led to this crash. And we are hearing calls for a full investigation being echoed by officials at NATO -- Jim.",

We have seen those on the Ukraine battlefield. There's also much more shorter range localized systems even perhaps if the plane itself was lower, something shoulder mounted a surface to air missile launched from a shoulder could have done something like this. It is worth noting that in the hours before the crash, in what looks like a likely shootdown here, there was a Ukrainian drone attack in Southern Russia and defense experts who have monitored this have said Russian air defenses were active. So it's very possible here that it was either a case of mistaken identity or an overactive Russian air defense that may have shot this down.

      "sentences": "Yeah, and we should always note with the proviso it is early in the investigation, these are initial assessments.General Hertling, as I remember from MH17, these anti-aircraft or air defenses are designed to explode in front of an aircraft or target, littering it with shrapnel to then take it down. Can you can you explain how they work exactly. And perhaps explain how something like this could happen, how they could mistake a passenger jet for a drone? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, not necessarily in front of, Jim, let me just correct you on that a little bit. Some of them are designed to hit on contact. So they have a missile that will actually hit an aircraft and explode. And that's truthfully the best way to knock down a target. But some of these systems, some of the Russian air defense systems have what they call adaptive radar proximity, which means if the radar on the piece of equipment on the ground determines where the flight path is, they can launch a missile toward that flight path, and an explosion will occur somewhere near the aircraft. The film you were just showing showed the MH17 flight in 2014. Most of the shrapnel was in the front of the aircraft. Miles will elaborate more on that. But on this one, you see most of the fragmentation was on the rear of the airplane and some of the passengers have already said that there were both entry passages from shrapnel, but also exits. So that means some of the shrapnel actually flew through the airplane. And I'm sure we'll see and hear from the from the recorders, what happened, what the pilot experienced, how it affected the aircraft as opposed to the MH17, which probably was a catastrophic strike that caused it to just fall out of the sky. This one may have affected some of the control systems, and it certainly affected some of the passengers. I think we're going to hear a lot from some of the passengers and exactly what they experienced with the explosion nearby, not against the aircraft, but nearby, which caused the shrapnel to try and damage. You've seen pictures of US A-10 aircrafts that have a lot of shrapnel wounds coming out of combat. This is the same kind of thing that occurs with some of the Russian air defense pieces of equipment.",

But immediately upon doing so, the US admitted, hey, this was a horrible accident and a very complicated situation.

Here's what the president-elect posted on his social network. \"Merry Christmas to all, including the wonderful soldiers of China who are lovingly but illegally operating the Panama Canal, where we lost 38,000 people, in its building 110 years ago. Always making certain that the United States puts its billions of dollars in repair money, but will have absolutely nothing to say about anything.\" Also, he says \"To Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, whose citizens taxes are far too high. But if Canada was to become our 51st state, their taxes would be cut by more than 60 percent. Their businesses would immediately double in size, and they would be militarily protected like no other country anywhere in the world.\" Likewise, he concludes, \"To the people of Greenland, which is needed by the United States for National Security purposes, and who want the US to be there and we will.\" It's a lot. For starters, Justin Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada, not a governor of a state or province, as they called him up there. Greenland, which the president-elect apparently wants to buy, is part of Denmark, which is a fellow member of NATO, a defense ally, and it's not for sale. And the Panama Canal is not controlled by China, but the country of Panama. It is, however, something the president-elect has mentioned we should note before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: We built a thing called the Panama Canal, we lost 35,000 people to the mosquito, you know, malaria. We lost 35,000 people building -- We lost 35,000 people because of the mosquito -- vicious. They had to build under nets. It was one of the true great wonders of the world. As he said, one of the nine wonders of the world. No, no, it was one of the seven. It happened a little while ago, you know. Fifth of the nine wonders of the world, you could make nine wonders. We sold it under Jimmy Carter. We sold it to Panama for $1.00. The following day, they quadrupled the amount of money that ships had to pay to get across. They didn't lose one ship, and now they've made it much bigger. And now they've widened it. They've doubled it, right? They've more than doubled it. And it's one of the most profitable things. Any time, it's just incredible, right. We gave it away for $1.00. China now controls it. They actually control the Panama Canal. They run it. They control it and we shouldn't let that happen.

This is after a house cat in Oregon died after eating a pet product that was later found to be infected with or tested positive for bird flu. So now this Portland based -- Portland, Oregon based pet food company is issuing a nationwide voluntary recall. The name of the company is Northwest Naturals, and the recall is for a 2-pound Feline turkey recipe. That's one of their raw, frozen recipes. And I should note that this product was distributed all over the United States. Across this country, it was also distributed in parts of Canada, including British Columbia. So there's a lot of concern, Jim, for pet owners, certainly cat owners, about how this might spread. Can their cat get it? Can it spread to humans? So many questions for pet owners.

Why is that important? Because that's how you actually see pandemic strains emerge where two different viruses co-infect cells, swap out genes, and then create this brand new virus. And so this is why we're so concerned. Has it happened yet? No, we have not seen any evidence of severe illness trans being transmitted to individuals who work in the dairy area.

We're almost at 900 herds now in this country infected, of which 75 percent are in California, and it's just continuing to spread. Remember, I just mentioned that issue about the cow udder and how that could serve as the melding pot for developing a new flu virus. It's unacceptable that we continue to see this kind of transmission in these cattle. Much more needs to be done there. We need to be doing more with vaccines. There was a release today from the CDC looking at this case of illness that occurred in the woman in Louisiana. And the good news is that this particular virus looks like it matches up with a candidate virus we have for a vaccine. The problem is there's no -- not one drop of that vaccine made yet.
