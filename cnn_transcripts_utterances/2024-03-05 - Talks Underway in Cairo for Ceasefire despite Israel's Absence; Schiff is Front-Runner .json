Progress on hostage negotiations will be high on the agenda there. It is 9 am in Washington, 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, and this is \"Connect the World\". Also happening right now, voters around the United States are hitting the polls for a Super Tuesday showdown. The results of today's voting could solidify Donald Trump and Joe Biden as the presidential candidates for November's election. We will be keeping you up to date with these two major stories with live reports over the next two hours. And the markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now and if these are any indication see futures markets, suggesting a mixed pretty flat open. Will we begin with a close look at events around the world designed to find a solution to suffering on the ground in Gaza. There is a real sense of urgency on the part of the U.S. evidence in the Secretary of State's agenda today. Right now, Antony Blinken is meeting with the Prime Minister of Qatar, a key broker in these hostage and ceasefire talks. Later, he will sit down with the Israeli War Cabinet Member Benny Gantz whose presence in Washington is causing controversy in Tel Aviv. While at the same time, we have an update just in to CNN on talks happening in Cairo, these events are not happening in isolation. So let's look at them are all. Jennifer Hansler following Blinken's busy day and Alex Marquardt is covering talks in Cairo. Let's start with you, Jen in Washington. What will Blinken hope to achieve with these meetings today? Let's start with the meeting with the Qatari Prime Minister.",

We know that these talks are going to focus a lot on the ongoing discussions over that hostage deal. However, we expect them to address a whole range of issues that Qatar has been a key partner to the U.S. on, be it Afghanistan, other hostage issues. But of course front and center will be how to resolve this situation in Gaza. How to get that ceasefire in place, that six weeks ceasefire that will allow aid to get in and to get the hostages out. We know that these talks are ongoing and thus far have yet to yield a progress aid result to get to that ceasefire.",

He is seen as perhaps the leading opponent to Netanyahu. And we know that Netanyahu likes to have control over these meetings. He likes to know what is going on. We have seen him convene group meetings when Biden Administration -- such as Secretary Blinken have gone to Israel in the past. So it is a big deal for him to have come here to the United States to hold these unilateral meetings on his own. We know that Israel took the extraordinary step to block their own ambassador from coming to these meetings with any gods. Now the U.S. was asked why it was still important to meet with Gantz at this moment, given the controversy we are seeing in Israel. And they say that his role on that war cabinet is what makes these meetings important. They say he has a significant voice on that cabinet that he has influence on that cabinet. And that is crucial right now as the U.S. presses the Israeli government to allow more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. We know that is going to be the top focus of that meeting with Blinken in just a few hours. He is expected to press him on the need to open more crossings for that aid, particularly in the north to ensure that safety is for those convoys that are going into Gaza with that crucially needed aid. So we will see if he is able to actually bring that influence back to Israel with him, Becky.",

It is also a day that while indications will move President Joe Biden and Donald Trump closer to cementing the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations. It is important to note that just a fraction of eligible voters normally cast ballots in what are known as these American primaries, that small percentage ultimately deciding their party's nominee for the most powerful office in the world. And there's more to look at today, beyond the delegate count. For Democrats, will there be any spillover from that uncommitted protest vote in last week's Michigan Primary? And for Republicans, how many voters disenchanted with Trump will cast ballots for Nikki Haley and will she stay in the race beyond today? Let's break this down with Stephanie Elam who is in Santa Ana in California.

The Black Sea commanders, Admiral Viktor Sokolov and Lieutenant General Sergey Kobylash, they're accused of firing repeatedly against civilian infrastructure and endangering civilian life over the past years or so marks I think frankly, an extraordinary moment where the crimes we see against ordinary civilians who are committed on a daily basis appear to be finding some sort of international jurisdiction for their prosecution.
