Israel's military says it was targeting a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Everything is connected at the end of the day to the war in Gaza, and we have to start from there, because what U.S. officials for a long time told both Israel and Lebanon and through Lebanese officials to Hezbollah is that this will not stop, and it was clear to the Biden administration that this will not stop without a ceasefire in Gaza. And I think that also in the meeting between Biden and Netanyahu just last Thursday, this was one of the points that the U.S. was making to the Israelis. We have to get a ceasefire and a hostage in Gaza in order to calm down the north. And U.S. officials were concerned that if you don't get a ceasefire in Gaza, then you'll get exactly to where we are today, that there will be some sort of a rocket launch that will hit civilians and will lead to a very serious escalation. And what senior U.S. officials told me today, that what happened in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights is exactly what they've been worried about and tried to avoid for 10 months. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A missile launched by Hezbollah killed at least a dozen children, young children. The savage Hezbollah terrorists struck these children with an Iranian precision missile. Dozens more were wounded in the attack, and sadly, the death toll is probably going to go very substantially higher. Our hearts go out to the families of these innocent children.

If they were looking for escalation of this type, I don't think they'd be denying responsibility.The Iranian ambassador to Beirut also sent out a message earlier today on Twitter, and I think that indicates as well that the Iranians are not looking for escalation. So I think that the Israelis will be looking at this and thinking, OK, we're going to respond. How are we going to respond? And how can we respond without a full-scale war breaking out? Because I don't think the Israelis want a full-scale war at present. I think that there are forces within the Israeli establishment that are certainly looking for that sort of war. But I think that at the moment, on balance, there are more voices within the establishment, particularly within the security establishment, that knows that if full-scale war were to break out, it would not be a repeat of what Israel is doing to Gaza and the repercussions there. Of course, Gaza has been a complete catastrophe for the people of Gaza, more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians, killed by the IDF and their strikes. But the response upon Israeli towns and cities and civilians has been quite minimal in comparison, because Hamas simply doesn't have that capacity or capability. When we talk about a strike on Lebanon going beyond what's taken place so far, the risk of Hezbollah responding in kind or escalating on Israeli towns and cities, they have far more in terms of people, but also in terms of weaponry.

They did not, of course, three years ago because of Simone having to withdraw after having the problems with the twisties. And I think they're going to come back strong.This is a packed team, as you heard in the piece. And, of course, Suni Lee won the individual all-around three years ago when Simone dropped out. That shows the depth of the U.S. team. I'm not saying there's no other great gymnasts around the world, Brazil and others, but I think the U.S., this is their time. And they have been pointing for this because it has been now eight years since Rio that the U.S. women have won that team all around. So they want it, and they really want to get that back.",
