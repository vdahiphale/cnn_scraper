And we begin with new developments out of Gaza where the Israel Defense Forces as two hostages have been rescued from the southern city of Rafah during a special operation overnight, but now at a medical facility in Israel where they are said to be in good condition.The IDF also says they conducted a series of strikes in one district in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says there's more than 60 people have been killed in those strikes. This video obtained by CNN shows some of the aftermath. The Rafah municipality says at least one mosque was among the targets. And CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv with the very latest. So Nic, what are you learning about this special Israeli military operation that rescue two hostages in Rafah? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, it is of course, huge news here in Israel. It's what everyone in Israel has been waiting for, for the release of more hostages. It's only the second time that the IDF has been able to go in in a military operation and free hostages. It was the end of October for the last one. This was a lightning covert operation, which had the special forces going in into the center of Rafah covertly at 1:49 in the morning, getting onto the second floor of the building, having a big firefight with Hamas there. The two people, the two hostages, they were going into recover and extract were on the second floor. Within a minute of arriving there, the Air Force was conducting those supporting strikes that we now understand resulted in the death of or certainly appeared to have resulted in the death of 60 Palestinians according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. The local hospital where many of the injured and victims were taken, say that they were over whelmed with that. But this operation, the special forces on the ground at 1:50 they got the call from the Air Force saying you need to get out of that building now. And they extracted. They took out the two hostages. Fernando Marman and Louis Har out of the building and led them away under fire to a safe place. And front there, they were taken by helicopter to hospital on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. They're given a quick medical check in the battlefield. But this was a very, very fast military operation, with the special forces going into the building getting involved in that firefight, protecting the two hostages, freeing them and then extracting them out as the Air Force and other forces conducted what a military term should call suppressing fire on what the IDF said were Hamas elements in that area who would have been attacking them. Their family members have now met with them in the hospital. But the timeline there just gives you some sense of the speed this that whole operation the military part of the operation, apparently over in less than 15 minutes.",

The United Nations, other aid organizations as well as several countries have spoken out against Israel's plan. Hamas has reportedly said that a ground offensive in Rafah would end any hostage negotiations.

Now, according to the senior Administration official, this call lasts about 45 minutes, two- thirds of it focused specifically on the release of hostages. Now, U.S. officials have been working around the clock to hammer out a framework that would include the freeing of those hostages, as well as a humanitarian pause. Now there are significant gaps that remain, but it's unclear exactly what they are and what progress can be made in the days and weeks to come. The President Biden, according to the White House, read out emphasize the need to capitalize on the progress so far. This of course, following pushback from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who call Hama's recent proposals, quote, delusional. Now another important element of this phone call was about the military operation that Israel has suggested would happen in Rafah that is a city that has more than a million Palestinians, many of whom have been displaced and have nowhere else to go. Now, a senior administration official said that the U.S. has taken issue with this noting that under the current conditions that U.S. cannot see how this would happen. The U.S. being quite forceful on this point, as Israel says that they would help with the evacuation of these Palestinians.

The same with the Jordanians. The Israeli, the suggestion of moving them into Israel doesn't seem practical. There's been some talk of moving them into northern Gaza. But the Israeli Defense Force is still undertaking military operations, they are against Hamas units.So there really is nowhere for these people to go. And they are very much in harm's way, either as a result of Hamas deliberately putting them in harm's way as human shields, which we all need to accept does happen. Or because the Israelis are undertaking military operations in densely urbanized built up areas, which is packed with civilians. I think what the Israelis will may need to do is not repeat what they did today with that large scale airstrikes. They need to actually end those airstrikes and artillery strikes and simply going on the ground at greater risk to their forces, but it will also reduce the risk to Palestinian civilians.",

There is a greater risk, obviously for the hostages, that there'll be harmed. And at the same time, the Hamas group will try to exploit every single civilian that is harmed for their benefit. So this is a really difficult situation. I do think that it's time for the Israeli Defense Force to stop with these air attacks and these artillery attacks and start going on the ground with precision and with recognition that they have to follow the laws of armed conflict, which express proportionality discrimination and necessity and an international humanitarian law. They cannot go in and indiscriminately kill civilians on the ground.",
