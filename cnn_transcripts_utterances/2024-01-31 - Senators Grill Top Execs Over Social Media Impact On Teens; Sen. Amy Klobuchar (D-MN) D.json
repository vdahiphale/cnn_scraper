So I figure our job is to stand up for her. And the problem is, every which way you turn, they have said, we can't do that, we can't do that, we can't do that.We don't like the states are doing it. It is time to put strong federal protections in place. 28 years without any changes. These are no longer little companies starting in a garage. In the case of many of them, they're trillion-dollar companies. And, of course, we like using their products, but that doesn't mean you don't have rules in place. When a door falls off of a Boeing jet, they ground 700 jets to make sure they're safe and everyone says, yes, that's the right thing to do. Well, how about here? When she loses her son, when we have kids dying, and no one steps in and says, we need to put some clear rules in place to stop this, these companies should be able to get this stuff off of their platforms and the best way to do it is with money. And that means this, they're using money to lobby members of Congress. Well, like with any other industry, people can sue, and then they change their ways, right? They're protected. They have immunity from those lawsuits that got put in place when they were a nascent industry just starting out in the garage and that has got to change. So, for instance, X, formerly Twitter, supported my bill, the SHIELD bill, on revenge porn, as well as Sen. Durbin's bill on getting this stuff off of the platforms. And then Snapchat actually supported the bill for giving law enforcement the tools they need to go after this fentanyl online. So there were, to me, there are cracks in the armor. Things are starting to change. And that, we just simply need to get these once we get through with the budget. I know Sen. Schumer is devoted to getting a grouping of these bills to the floor and we have to - we've got to get the budget done and then let's go and do that.",
