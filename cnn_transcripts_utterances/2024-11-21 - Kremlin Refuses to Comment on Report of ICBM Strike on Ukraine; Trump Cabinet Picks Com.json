      "sentences": "Well, there certainly was. I mean, so one of the things that we've been seeing, and we've been monitoring this very closely on Russian state media, but also from Russian politicians, as well, is that there certainly has been a big escalation in the rhetoric, and there certainly also has been the threat of using new types of weapons and using more weapons against Ukraine. There's some politicians who've spoken about blanketing Ukraine with strikes and telling people who live near air bases that have F-16s that have been provided to Ukraine to quickly leave that area as fast as possible.And in fact, I was watching one of the main state TV shows last night that was on, and they did have sort of a graphic of Kyiv seemingly hit by a nuclear weapon with a big mushroom cloud. Now, of course, that's all just rhetoric at this point in time. But one of the things that we're getting from Russian state media, that we're getting from some Russian politicians, is that if these ATACMS continue to be used against Russia, that they intend to unleash big wrath on the Ukrainians, as they've been saying. Now, of course, right now, that is nothing more than rhetoric at this point in time. We've seen large-scale airstrikes by the Russians and ballistic missile strikes and cruise missile strikes in the past. So far, we don't know if there's anything of a larger quality, but certainly the Russians are saying that this marks a drastic escalation in all of this. And the other thing, of course, that they're also saying as well, Christina, is they say that this changes for them, at least, the very nature of the war in Ukraine, not just pitting Ukraine and Russia against one another, but the Russians now saying, pitting Russia against the United States and its NATO allies as well -- Christina.",

      "sentences": "Yes, if indeed this was an ICBM, but I think in general, the point is very clear that right now, the Russians are saying that with all of these new weapons that are being introduced right now by the United States, or at least being unleashed by the United States in the hands of the Ukrainians, like for instance, those ATACMS missiles that can launch very deep into Russian territory. And of course, also the reaction that that could bring from the Russians, that it would make it more difficult for the Trump administration to come to terms. One of the things that they promised that Donald Trump himself has promised, which is to end the war in Ukraine as fast as possible.Of course, he's been saying he would end it in one day. Even the Russians are saying that's absolutely unrealistic. Nevertheless, the Russians have been accusing the Biden administration in its final days of escalating this conflict, and then therefore making a resolution more difficult. One of the things that we've heard from Vladimir Putin over the past couple of days is that the Russians are very much willing, they say, to engage in talks about ending the war in Ukraine. But that always comes with a massive caveat, that they do have maximalist demands with that, essentially saying that the Ukrainians need to cede the territory that the Russians are currently occupying, and that also the Russians do not want to see the Ukrainians in NATO or significantly armed. Of course, all of that completely unacceptable to the Ukrainians, all of that completely unacceptable to the Biden administration as well. But that's the starting point that the Russians have. And you do notice, it's a very important question, I think, you do notice that the Russians right now are looking forward to the Trump administration taking office because they believe that some sort of resolution can be achieved in a way that is very favorable to Russia. But they're also saying with every escalation that happens before that, the chances of that become less -- Christina.",

The Justice Department says spinning off Chrome could help prevent an illegal monopoly from occurring again. The request could lead to the most significant antitrust penalties against a tech giant in years and change how millions of Americans search for information.Australia is moving to ban anyone under 16 from using social media, calling it a world-leading reform to protect children from harmful content online. New legislation would force social media companies to verify users' age or else face heavy fines. But exactly how that will be done is still an open question. For more, CNN's Hanako Montgomery is joining us from Tokyo.

Yes, as you just described, right, even though we're seeing this debate play out in Australia, it is, of course, a concern for parents around the world.We know that the Australian government looks to ask its nation's internet regulator to impose these regulations to really implement this ban. But the details of how they exactly will do it are still scant. We know that the Australian government, though, looks to impose a blanket ban on all users under the age of 16 from social media, no exceptions. So even if a child gets consent from his or her parent, they still won't be able to create an account. Also, for those who already have accounts, they'll see those deactivated. Now, the Australian government also looks to fine internet companies and these tech companies up to 32.5 million U.S. dollars if they don't comply with these regulations. Now, Christina, this proposed legislation is politically quite popular in Australia. It's got bipartisan support, and it also comes after a series of high-profile incidents of children ending their own lives because their parents say they were abused online. Now, the following is a story about Charlotte O'Brien, a child who ended her life just two months ago. A warning to our viewers, you might find the following content disturbing.

MONTGOMERY (voice-over): In September 12-year-old Australian girl Charlotte O'Brien took her own life after years being bullied on social media. Her parents quickly joined a political fight to protect children from online harm. The Australian government says the best way to do that is to ban anyone under 16 from using social media.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (on camera): Now, Christina, as you just saw, for grieving parents and for those who support this proposed bill, these new regulations are long overdue, and they believe that it could make the internet a much safer place for their kids. But critics argue that not all social media is bad, that in some cases, kids can find actually better communities online and find safe spaces. So clearly lots of debate here, lots of questions still to be answered.
