And so, we hear this confirmed and corroborated by Hemphill who didn't have that physical stamina to go and foot pursuit and go in on that second attack on Mr. Nichols. He said, I hope they stop his ass. So, the problem at the police chief continues to have so much for transparency. We are just finding out about Hemphill. Her problem is multifaceted. She unleashed inexperienced, unsupervised, miscreants on an unknowing community. She created this Scorpion task force. She put these officers on that unit. And then she failed to acknowledge complaints are coming and from the community about excessive use of force. So, she has a part to play. She is complicit and she needs to go.",

They are not going to see this as a ransom, because they know that if there is the default, what it could mean for this economy, which is starting to pick up, which is starting to expand and see some of the effects of what the White House -- the correct course of, you know, administering the budget and the economy.
