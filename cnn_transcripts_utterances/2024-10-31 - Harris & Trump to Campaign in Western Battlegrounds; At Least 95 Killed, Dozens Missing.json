They believe this kind of rhetoric could actually motivate people to go to the polls to back Donald Trump.

Now, that's the kind of danger the authorities, of course, have been warning residents about.Usually Taiwan responds pretty well to typhoons because they're no stranger to this kind of extreme weather. But still, Kong-rey was the third typhoon to make landfall on the island this season. And that is not very common. The last time this happened was back in 2008. That's why they are taking no chances. You mentioned the flight cancellations and market shutdown. And a lot of offices and schools throughout the island have been closed as well. And in addition to the civilian first responders, the government there has placed more than 34,000 soldiers on standby to assist in any potential rescue operations. Now, the slightly fortunate news here is the landfall happened on the eastern side of Taiwan, which is the less populated side of the island. But still, the potential risk lies with a lot of the mountainous regions and remote villages. You could see landslides, not to mention a potential damage to infrastructure, including a power outage. And this typhoon is now continues to move towards the East China Sea and could potentially impact mainland China and Japan as well in the coming days. That's why the outer bands of this typhoon already prompting authorities in Shanghai, China's biggest city and its financial hub, issue a blue typhoon warning. That's the lowest level of China's four tier color coded warning system.
