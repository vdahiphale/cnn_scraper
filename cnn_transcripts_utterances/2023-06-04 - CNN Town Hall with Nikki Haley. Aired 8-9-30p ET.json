Ambassador Haley has been a trailblazer throughout her career in public service, and now she is hoping to make history again as she challenges her former boss and current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, among many others, for the chance to take on President Joe Biden.Now, if elected, Ambassador Haley would become the very first woman and the very first Asian American to hold the nation's highest office. This evening's event is about the voters and the issues that will help determine who wins the Republican nomination for President. And tonight, the voters will have the opportunity to question Ambassador Haley directly. I'll have a few questions of my own. This Town Hall is part of the Republican primary process, and so by design, in the audience tonight are voters who say that they plan to participate in the Iowa Republican Caucuses, both Republicans and also independents who plan to register as Republicans. The audience comes from all over the State of Iowa and is representative of Iowa Republicans. To find tonight's questioners, we reached out to Republican affiliated groups as well as business groups, so farm associations and parent groups and young professional organizations and religious groups and various advocacy organizations. Separate from the audience asking questions are guests of the Haley campaign and the university. We have asked our live audience to be respectful to each other and to the candidates. So voters in the room and you at home have a chance to hear directly from ambassador Haley. And now, please welcome Ambassador Nikki Haley. (CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)",

They took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse.I was at the U.N. I didn't deal with one country. I dealt with 193. And I took the kick me sign off of our backs. It is time for a new generational leader. It is time for us to leave the baggage of the past, the negativity to the past, and start thinking of our families and the families across America. If you look at all the challenges we have, look at inflation, look at the lack of transparency in education, look at what's happening with crime, look at our border, look at the idea that we had a Chinese spy balloon flying over our country.

But I've always spoken in hard truths, and I'm going to do that with you today. Our Republicans did that to us, too. The idea that they passed a $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill with no accountability whatsoever, expanding welfare. Now, we have 90 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps. If that wasn't enough, they doubled down and opened up earmarks for the first time in 10 years. They pushed through 7000 of them in December. Want to know how they're spending your money? $30 million on an honors college in Vermont. 10 million to bring down a hotel in Alaska. $7.5 million on a courthouse in Colorado. That's not how we want to spend our money. All while one in six American households can't pay their utility bill, 60% of Americans are in credit card debt. And then you've got Social Security, which is going to go bankrupt in ten years. Medicare is going to go bankrupt in eight years. We've got to make sure that we go back to being fiscally responsible. What does that look like? What that looks like is let's start by clawing back the $500 billion of unspent COVID dollars that we know are out there. (APPLAUSE)",

You've got all of this money that was spent with no accountability. So yes, is the unemployment coming down? But ask those small business owners, because they're not feeling it on their bottom line. Costs are still high. And you can ask families. You know it when you go to the grocery store. You know it when you have to get something repaired on your car. Everything has gone up.So the unemployment rate, that's great that we can say that we've got a lot of people working, but what good is that when you can actually see that 50% of Americans are saying that they're worse off today than they were a year ago and they're not making as much money. That's the problem. That's why it's important to understand -- I'm not a lawyer, I'm an accountant. And I think it's time we had an accountant in the White House. (APPLAUSE)",

The idea that we left Bagram Air Force Base in the middle of the night without telling our allies, who stood shoulder to shoulder with us for decades because we asked them to be there, think about what that told our friends.More importantly, think about what that told our enemies. So now you have this happening. None of this should have happened. Biden had a whole year to prevent that war in Ukraine, and he didn't do it. Russia surrounded Ukraine. Where was everybody? There was an opportunity to stop it. That's what we have to make sure of. So when you're dealing with Russia and China, I'll give you an example. The Russian plane knocked down our U.S. drone a couple of weeks ago. Remember that? What do we do about it? Nothing. You know what I would have done if I was president? Put two drones up there in a fighter jet and put our naval fleet back in the Black Sea because it never should have left in the first place. (CHEERING &amp; APPLAUSE)",

This is a regime that says, death to America, death to Israel every day, no amount of money changes the way they think.So when you go to the Taliban, yeah, they wanted all of that money. And by the way, Biden left them $7 billion worth of military equipment while they hauled out of there in the middle of the night. But when you pay terrorists off, all they do is more terrorism.

For too long, Republican and Democrat presidents thought that, if they were nice to China, China would want to be like us. That's narcissistic. China -- bless you -- China does not want to be like us. They want to be Communist China. We have to change the way we treat them.So if you know that, let's look at where China is now. They've built up their military. They have the largest naval fleet in the world. They have more air defense systems than we do. They just came out with a fifth-generation fighter jet. How'd they do it? By stealing our intellectual property that we handed them on a silver platter. They steal $600 billion worth of intellectual property from us every year. President Xi started a commission that he personally chairs that says any company that does business in China has to cooperate with the Chinese military. Think about our tech companies. Think about all of our financial data. Think about all of your health care data. Think about your children's lifestyle data. And now know that the Chinese military has all of that. President Xi has said whoever owns the data owns the world, and that's why they're sending spy balloons. That's why they're buying up 400,000 worth -- acres worth of farmland near our most sensitive military installations. That's what they're doing. Now, having said that, how do you deal with China when you know we've got an economy that's so intertwined? You do it through a national security lens -- strictly through a national security lens. So I don't care if Americans buy T-shirts and light bulbs from China, anymore than I care if the -- of the Chinese buy agricultural products from our farmers. I welcome that. What I do care about is if it's a national security risk. When you saw we had COVID, they told you to put on a mask. The masks were made in China. They told you to take a home COVID test. You turned it over, it was made in China. You go down to your local drugstore, all those medicines are made in China. What I -- bless you -- what I will focus on is, when we -- when I become president, the very first day, you look at it and say, \"If China pulled the rug out from under us tomorrow, would we be ready? Would we be safe?\" That's what we need to do. So I don't want us exporting any tech equipment to them. I want us to make sure we're focused. And, by the way, for our farmers, I don't want our farmers to just sell to China. I will be their ambassador. In South Carolina, when I was governor, I sold South Carolina to every one. I will sell our Iowa farmers and all of their products to Japan, to Australia, to South Korea, to Israel. (APPLAUSE) We can sell it to other countries. (APPLAUSE)",

I'm pro-life because I had trouble having both of my children. So I am surrounded by blessings. Having said that, I don't judge anyone for being pro-choice, any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life. If you look at the situation of the life-abortion story that we have today, how did we get to where we are? First of all, prior to 1973, you had 46 different state laws that dealt with life and dealt with abortion. And the people decided what those were going to be. Roe v. Wade came in and threw out 46 state laws and suddenly said abortion any time, anywhere, for any reason. And all Americans had to succumb to that. We don't want unelected justices deciding something this personal. This is a personal issue for every woman and man in America, and it should be treated with the respect that way. So now that the unelected justices are out there and it's back in the hands of the people of the states, which is where it should be, there are some states that have become more pro-life, and I welcome that, and there are some states that have been more on the abortion side. I wish that wasn't the case, but that's what happened. The question that everybody is talking about is, is there a federal role for this? And I think that there is a federal role for this. But if we're going to do that, you have to be honest with the American people of what it takes to do that. In order to pass anything, you have to have a majority of the House; you have to have 60 Senate votes; and you have to have a signature of a president. We haven't had 60 pro-life senators in over 100 years. We might have 45. So if you look at it from that standpoint, don't let anyone in the media; don't let any political party tell you that a Republican president can ban abortion laws in our country because they can't anymore than a Democrat president can ban our state laws. So what can we do with consensus? That's exactly what it is. We come through with consensus and say, \"What can we all agree on?\" I think we can all agree on banning late- term abortions. I think we can all agree on encouraging adoptions and making sure those foster kids feel more loved, not less. I think we can agree on doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortions shouldn't have to perform them. I think we can agree on the fact that contraception should be accessible. And I think we can all come together and say any woman that has an abortion shouldn't be jailed or -- or -- or given the death penalty. Can't we start there? Can't we start there? Because what... (APPLAUSE) Because what the politicos and what the media have done is they've made you demonize a situation when it's so personal that we have to humanize the situation. Our goal should always be how do we save as many babies as we can and support as many mothers in that process as we do it?",

I mean, it was a very emotional, difficult time because you saw what so many people in South Carolina do on a Wednesday night, they went to Bible study.  But on that night, someone else showed up.  He didn't look like them.  He didn't act like them.  He didn't sound like them.  And they didn't call the cops.  They didn't throw him out.  Instead, they pulled up a chair and they prayed with him for an hour.  And when they bowed their heads in that last prayer, he began to shoot.These were people like Ethel Lance.  And she would go around Mother Emanuel Church singing \"One day at a time sweet Jesus, that's all I ask of you, give me the strength to do every day what I have to do.\" Our youngest victim, Tywanza Sanders, who had just finished college, had the world in front of him, and on that night he stood in front of his 87-year-old great aunt Susie and told the killer you don't have to do this, we mean no harm to you. Or it was people like Cynthia Hurd, whose life motto was simply to be kinder than necessary.  That's who these people were.  They weren't famous, but they loved their families.  They loved their church.  And they loved their community.  And we had an obligation to make sure that we got it right. The problem was, in the senate, it passed pretty quickly because the pastor of the church was a senator.  And I'll never get over the night of the murders.  I called him and I said, Pastor Pinckney, I'm so sorry about what happened.  I will be there first thing in the morning.  Anything your congregation needs, we will take care of them. And what haunts me to this day is that his cell phone was in his pocket and he was at the church.  And he was one of the people that was murdered.  So the senate passed it through very quickly, because their brother had been killed.  It was the house that was so difficult. And the house, I remember, they came back and said, let's put a different flag up.  And I said, no, I want the flag to come down. Then they came back and said, OK, they will take the flag down but don't want to take down the pole.  Well, I had been in the South Carolina legislature, I knew what that meant.  That meant that as soon as the flag came down, another flag was going to go up after the national media went away. And they said to me, you could do this.  This would be a win for you. But I didn't want any other governor to have to deal with what I was having to deal with.  And finally they said, we can't do it, they won't pass it.  And I went to them, to the Republican caucus, and I said, I want to tell you a story.  I said when I was growing up, my dad would sometimes let me ride with him to Columbia.  And he would love to buy produce from farmer stands. He liked buying produce directly from farmers rather than in the stores.  And one day we stopped by a produce stand, and the owners, I saw them start to talk, my father wears a turban.  And the next thing we knew, a police car drove up.  And the police stood next to the owners.  And my dad grabbed his produce and he went to the register and he thanked them and he paid. When we got in the car, he didn't say another word to me all the way home.  He was hoping I didn't notice what just happened.  But I knew exactly what happened.  And I told the house caucus that day, when I go to the airport, I have to pass that produce sign -- that produce stand, and I still feel pain. I don't want a single child to drive by this statehouse and feel pain. Take the flag, take the pole down.  And we were able that night at 1:00am, the flag and the pole came down. (APPLAUSE)",

And I feel like Michael and I have raised our kids that way, is that we want to make sure that they know that we're a family of service, and you do for others. And when you do for others, it comes back to you. But about of all things with our kids when we raised them, we wanted them to have a faith and a conscience.

And I'm doing this for my son who's a junior in college, and I'm watching him write papers of things he doesn't believe in just to get an A. That's not us. That's not American. For the first time in our country, 78 percent of Americans have said, they don't think that their children will live as good of a life as them. We can't have that. I'm not going to have that. We've got a country to save. That's why we have to have a new generational leader. We've got to go and fix this country and go back to the values that have made us great.
