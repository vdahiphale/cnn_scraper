Over the past couple of days, we've seen Israel expand its forces in Gaza with targeted raids. But those forces retreated back across the border after the raids. It's -- right now, unclear if this new movement is part of the promise major ground offensive that the IDF has been preparing for since the start of the war three weeks ago.",

And what we can see -- largely what we can see are Israeli strikes from the air. And beginning last night, our correspondents on the border there, we could see the explosions, which were at a rate that we hadn't seen since that those October 7th attacks. Then, we saw those airstrikes, artillery strikes, calmed down a bit, and appears what followed is this expanded ground operation. But again, we just know what the IDF is telling us about the extent as well as the goal of those operations. They say they're expanded. They say they include units, again, armored infantry and engineering units. The question is, how long will they be on there? And what are the numbers of those forces on the ground? We can say that the U.S. view of this is somewhat clear, because we have a comment from the Marine commandant following the return of a U.S. marine general who was advising Israeli commanders here that what is happening now is purely an Israeli operation that the U.S. offered its advice and in a public statement from the commandant -- the Marine commandant that Israeli commanders took some of that advice and didn't take other parts of that advice. We do know that the U.S. was counseling, a conservative approach here based on the U.S. experience in places like Fallujah and Mosul. It appears from those public comments that Israeli commanders were not heeding all of that advice in that experience.",

Strikes on Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, they say, one of those strikes in response to anti- tank missiles that Hezbollah forces fired. And another one of those strikes in response to what they say was an attempted surface-to-air missile strike from Hezbollah. So, Hezbollah forces making their presence known, taking shots at those Israeli positions in the north, not though to the degree it seems that Hamas has wanted. Hamas had some public comments saying they've expected more from Hezbollah. But, of course, we're watching very closely, Victor and Amara, because that could change at any moment, particularly, as we learn more from the expansion of Israeli ground operations inside Gaza, because the fear had been among Israeli forces and others, that as those operations expand in Gaza, that Hezbollah will expand its own retaliation here in the North.

That typically you'll have that expanded aerial campaign to soften up defenses. That's the intention before a ground operation is underway. And if what the IDF is saying is true that you have a large number of IDF forces there now, then, it would only be natural that those airstrikes artillery strikes slowed down a bit because they wouldn't want to threaten Israeli forces on the ground.",

So, let's first focus on this ground invasion, or at least, the fact that you have some Israeli troops or ground forces inside Gaza for these very targeted raids, according to the IDF spokesperson and this expanded ground operation.

You know, the first and interesting thing is that this isn't quite the ground invasion that we had initially envisioned, you know, when this whole tragedy began two weeks ago.What we thought at the time was sort of a massive invasion that would try to hold all of Gaza, or at least the northern part, in Gaza City. And I think the more that those discussions took place with the United States, the more it became clear to the Israelis, that if they did that, they were going to take tremendous casualties among their own troops. So, here, they are doing much more of a kind of command -- of targeted attacks, as you said, which enable them to go in and then turn around, and leave. That doesn't leave much of a target for Hamas. And the interesting question is, is this a stage? Or is this what is going to go look like? And to your question on the hostages, it also then gives them the opportunity to be doing some intelligence gathering about where the hostages are, and makes it easier to do a pause and not have to pull out a large force if it looks like Hamas is ready to negotiate. So far, it's very hard to tell, because we're kept at such distance from this. We haven't seen a whole lot of progress in the hostage area, so, only four people have been released.",

But, of course, on the heels on Friday, with, you know, the United Nations having this vote. 120 nations voting for a \"sustained\" humanitarian truce, a pause or a ceasefire, whatever you want to call it. There were 14 countries who voted against that, including the United States, because it didn't explicitly criticized Hamas. Why has it been so difficult to, you know, get a humanitarian pause so that the civilians can get help? And some of those people stuck inside, at least, the foreign nationals to get out?",

The first is that the main Israeli objective here, they say, is to destroy Hamas.They haven't said over what time period. But if they were planning to do that on a rapid basis, then, obviously any humanitarian pause, and so forth, not only keeps them from doing that, but it also gives Hamas time to regroup, move hostages, improve defenses. The second answer to this is that they are fearful that as they bring in the humanitarian goods, they're also going to be helping Hamas. That's inevitable. And if you have a group of people suffering like this, I can't see an option. But yes, some of this aid is definitely going to help Hamas. And I think a third question, which is, you know, the one that no one's really breaching here yet is, why haven't the Arab states stepped up to help open the Rafah gate and allow some of these long- suffering people to go into the Sinai, where you could see tents and relief operations set up? I think the answer is the Egyptians simply don't want to have them there. But the whole idea of trying to push everybody down to the bottom end of the bottle here and to the southern end of Gaza, just means you're moving the suffering south.",

But that next week, you began to hear tenors of we understand you have a right to defend yourself, anybody's going to want to make sure that they get rid of Hamas, because they can't live with events like this, taking place ever again. That goes to the core of Israel's being. But as they hug them in this tight embrace that were whispering in the -- in their ear, it makes a difference how you do this. And I'm told by administration officials, that they have been very careful to talk to the Israelis first and give them these warnings before going public at each stage. And by the end of this week, you are hearing the president really talk more about being careful about the Palestinians and the humanitarian issues and sort of emphasizing that piece of it. And the question is, has that fully sunk in, in the Israeli strategy. The fact that they haven't done an all-out invasion at this point, partly may reflect that and partly may reflect the divisions within the Israeli war Cabinet about how to go about this.",

So, we're telling where things can be found of that nature.But it's all part of what is essentially two planes of investigations. One, of course, was the more urgent one, the more urgent manhunt part of things, and that came to an end, as we understand a little bit after 48 hours last night, when they found the body of the 40-year-old suspect Robert Card. Now, as we -- as we understand from a law enforcement source, the body was found near the Maine -- near essentially, a recycling center where he used to work and was recently fired. Though the exact location were still not sure. And those are all part of the questions. We're hoping to have answered at the press conference is supposed to be happening a little bit later this morning, including how long they believe this body was actually there. Because, obviously, this is a manhunt that took days at this point. So, that, that was the more urgent plane of investigations. The other comes from trying to piece together why this happened? This is a shooting that took place Wednesday night across two different locations, each about 10 minutes from each other. And then, his vehicle was found abandoned 10 minutes from the second shooting site, which is nearby here. And that was about a 15-minute walk to around the area where his body was found. So, investigators are going through his social media history, also each of the shooting sites as well. At the end of the day, though, this is a sigh of relief for many in this community who were just anxious about where this armed and dangerous suspect, as police described him, could have been. Take a listen to Maine's governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JANET MILLS (D-ME): Like many people, I'm breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone.

You know, did you hear a gunshot? You know, I mean, so there are things that we would like to know, because what they -- what investigators do now, I mean, and we've had, unfortunately, so many mass shootings in this country, that they want to do a profile on this guy, because he's part of a larger group of people who have done this sort of thing. And so, psychologically, you want to know exactly what are the warning signs? What are those things we ought to be looking for before the event takes place?

      "sentences": "Well, look, as we've seen for now, three weeks, the situation inside Gaza's hospitals, and particularly, inside the al-Shifa hospital, which is the largest hospital inside the Gaza Strip has been deteriorating rapidly as a result of the siege, as a result of the overwhelming number of patients that are requiring urgent care because of the ongoing airstrikes that we are seeing.You mentioned that warning from the IDF spokesperson yesterday, Daniel Hagari is saying that there are Hamas command post beneath the al- Shifa hospital. Now, this has been flat out rejected by Palestinian officials and health authorities inside Gaza. It has been rejected by medics that we've been speaking to on the ground, including one Norwegian doctor, Dr. Mads Gilbert, who I spoke to yesterday. He has worked at the al- Shifa hospital for decades. Now, both in peacetime and wartime, he said that if he had any inclination that this was the case, no foreign doctors would stand by and allow patients to be used as human shields. And, of course, there is real concern, of course, from medics, from patients, inside the hospitals in Gaza that this could be a common that potentially in the coming days would lay the groundwork for the legitimization of attacks against hospitals. And that is a concern because, of course, as we know, there are thousands and thousands of patients currently receiving treatment in these hospitals. We've heard from the doctors there, we've heard from Doctors Without Borders, they have said that their doctors refuse to leave their patients behind. They will say that despite evacuation orders from the IDF. But, of course, the secondary issue that we are seeing now also is that there are tens of thousands of people, Palestinians, who have been displaced, either by airstrikes, or because they've been told to evacuate, now sheltering outside on the street, around these hospitals. And that is the fear now. Because for many Palestinians who have been displaced, they see these hospitals as a safe haven. But these latest remarks from the IDF has really raised fears and concerns that they certainly aren't safe havens anymore. In fact, we had warnings repeatedly that if hospitals are targeted, we could see unimaginable bloodshed. But, of course, there is still an ongoing siege there is a limitation on the amount of medication getting into supplies, the reduction in the amount of fuel, and electricity available to these hospitals. And we've heard the warnings from the health ministry in Gaza spokesperson. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ASHRAF AL-QUDRA, SPOKESPERSON, GAZA MINISTRY OF HEALTH (through translator): Hospitals aren't just for patients or the injured, they have become the place for hundreds of thousands of displaced people who were forced by the Israeli occupation to flee towards hospitals and schools. That led to a difficult health situation that will have dangerous health consequences. The lack of water is leading to problems with personal hygiene, which affects all patients and injuries in hospitals. Some patients have open wounds and third- and fourth-degree burns. Infants who are in the E.R., under surgery, and kidney patients. All of those are going to be exposed to health issues due to the spread of disease among displaced people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
