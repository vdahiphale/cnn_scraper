Now, in Tennessee, we've been rolling back gun laws and making them -- guns almost ubiquitous. But it makes guns first of mind when people are thinking about doing terrible things and we've got to -- we've got to make that clearly more difficult. We owe it to the parents. Everybody that's attending every vigil in Nashville feels that there needs to be a public response to this kind of tragedy and to say, enough is enough, and when are we going to learn? And we're a grieving city right now. And guns can be Second Amendment for sure, but they can also be a little bit of a cult.
