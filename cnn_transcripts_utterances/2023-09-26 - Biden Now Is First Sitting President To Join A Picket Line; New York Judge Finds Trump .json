We'll discuss the political impact of his Michigan appearance and the economic impact of the strike with the UAW president, Shawn Fain. He joins us live this hour. Also tonight, breaking news, a New York judge has just found Donald Trump and his adult sons liable for fraud in a lawsuit by the state's attorney general. We'll break down what it means for Trump and for the trial that sets to begin in a matter of days. And January 6th star witness Cassidy Hutchinson sits down with CNN. She's warning that Trump remains the most grave threat, direct quote, to American democracy and suggesting that Trump knew his words might incite violence at the U.S. Capitol. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with President Biden going where no U.S. president has gone before, a picket line. He's taking his pro-union message to a new level as he works to shore up support in the key 2024 battleground state of Michigan. United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain was with the president in Detroit today. He joins us live in just a moment. But, first, let's go to our Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche. She's got more on the benefits and the risks of Biden's trip.

In the last decade, these companies have made a quarter trillion dollars in profits off the backs of our members. They've made $21 billion in the first six months of this year off the backs of our workers. CEO pay went up 40 percent in the last four years. No one said a thing about how that's going to affect the price of cars or the economy. The price of vehicles went up 35 percent over the last four years not because of our wages. Our wages went up 6 percent in the last four years. We've went backwards in purchasing power. And that's the sad reality here. And anytime working class people stand up for themselves, there's always this mantra of fear being put out there that if we pay the workers this, it's going to hurt the economy. It's going to raise the car prices. All these things have happened when we've went backwards in wages.",

That is a big blow to Trump. So, the issue going forward at trial, which is currently set for next week, is this issue of how much Trump would need to pay the attorney general on that issue. There are remaining claims in this case that will also be part of the case going forward. Now, the judge also finding that, rejecting entirely Trump's arguments about how he came up with the valuations for his property, the A.G. has said that he inflated some of those properties over the years in these statements by as much as over $2 billion, even as high as $3.6 billion. And the judge is saying that how Trump derived these valuations was a fantasy world, not the real world. And they also -- he also addressed this question of one of the allegations is that Trump had inflated the value of his penthouse, saying it was three times as big as it was. And that has been one of these claims that has really stood out because it is more tangible than some other arguments here about valuations and appraisals. And the judge said on that, this inflation of the size of his penthouse, that's 10,000 square feet. Trump, in one of the financial statements, said it was 30,000 square feet. The judge said a discrepancy of this order of magnitude by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades can only be considered fraud. So, this is a complete rejection of Trump's defense and he didn't inflate his financial statements, his net worth for a decade. You know, this was the vehicle through which he obtained loans and insurance, and that is part of this ongoing case. Now, I just want to also note that there is still an appeal here. Trump's lawyers have sued the A.G.'s office and the judge last week. An appeals court is expected to rule this week. It's unclear how that will affect the start of the trial, which is now set for Monday. Wolf?",

No, they don't. So, for them to proactively raise this, there are communications equities there.

And so I think as long as you've got the support of the Senate Democrat leader, all these other people aren't going to mean much to Menendez. So, I have heard some members of Congress comment that they think people should be afforded due process, but I think it's hard for Democrats to criticize Donald Trump the way they do under his indictments. Chuck Schumer, in fact, said no one is above the law when Trump was indicted, but at the same time continue to harbor Menendez in the conference.

And I just want to describe the two focal points of this particular hearing was, first, what did Officer Dial's partner say right before the shooting, and what did both of these officers see when they approached this vehicle. Well, prosecutors called Officer Dial's partner who said that he screamed \"knife\" right before Officer Dial opened fire on Eddie Irizarry. But then the defense on cross-examination played a video that appeared to show his partner yelling \"gun\" in addition to \"knife\" right before those shots were fired. Then the defense also said that the knife that Eddie Irizarry is alleged to have been holding at the time of the shooting, they argue that it looked like the handle of a gun. Then the judge dismissed these charges, agreeing with the defense family very, very torn up about this. Take a listen to what one family member said earlier today.
