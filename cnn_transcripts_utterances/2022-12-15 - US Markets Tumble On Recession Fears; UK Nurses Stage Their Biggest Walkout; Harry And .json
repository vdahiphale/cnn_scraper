      "sentences": "In a funny sort of way, it's a hangover today, the global selloff as a result of interest rate rises inthe US, the UK, few others, and as a result, markets are sort of drawn to the reality of these much higher rates probably next year. You see the Dow is up -- it's been down all day. Absolutely all -- well, you can see for yourself. You don't need me to point out a bevy of red, and it's all because of the main news. Recession fears, rearing their head after the sharp drop in US retail sales. That is a symptom, it is not the disease. Prince Harry has described being screamed at by his brother, as he and Meghan broke away from the Royal family. And we will have the Kayak CEO to talk about the most popular travel spots this season, including here in New York. We are in New York, and we're live in New York. It's Thursday, December the 15th, middle of the month. I'm Richard Quest. And in New York, of course, I mean business. Good evening. Yesterday we told you about the interest rate rises in the US; today, US markets have fallen on the grounds that the Fed may be pushing the economy towards a recession, off 900 points at the worst, and the reason the resilient US consumer might be getting tired, weary, and is no longer able to pull the economic train. In other words, feeling the pinch. Retail sales dropped six-tenths of a percent last month, and that has taken its toll. Global markets haven't fared that much better, a sea of red. If you look carefully, I'll guide you to the worst ones. You've got the Xetra DAX off 3.28 percent in Frankfort so the market is down sharply, and China's retail sales were down of six percent. Europe struggles along as well. Central Bank, the ECB is also joining the Fed, slowing down, going to restrictive interest rates at the moment. The ECB and the Bank of England both raised the cost of borrowing by half a point. The Fed did on Wednesday and all major moves from this time last year. Here's why. Just like in the US, there are signs in the UK and in Europe, inflation may have peaked. And so the Central Banks of all three say they've still got more work to do, but not necessarily as much as they have been so far in terms of rate rises. We know the UK is in recession, and Christine Lagarde in the EU says the EU could be headed that way, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I've had somepeople that have mentioned that if or when we do wind up having the official declaration of the US economy being in a recession, it will be the most anticipated recession of all time, and then the reaction is going to be no kidding. We all knew we were in a recession already. What took you so long to finally say it? So there is some hope that because it is expected, this is not your proverbial black swan event. This isn't going to be brought about by some exogenous shock to the global economy. It's just the cumulative effect of all these rate hikes and inflation, finally leaving consumers to throw up their hands and say, can't spend any more. We've had enough.",

Each of the orange balls indicates half a percent. Now start bearing in mind that at the beginning of the year, this was just about empty. This was just about empty. So the EU added half a percent, and the UK added half a percent, and yesterday, the US did the same. So now you get a chance to see. The US is actually the top of the tree at four and a quarter to four-and-a- half percent in terms of the Fed Funds Rate. You've got the UK at three and a half the EU is at two, but then the economy has been much slower there. All these countries are slowing down because of rate rises, and now the rate rises themselves are moderating. The question: How far do they need to go next year? We talk about this phrase, \"restrictive interest rates.\" Now just keep in mind as I talk to global economic analyst, Rana, Rana Foroohar who is with me that the US has done the bulk of this since the beginning of the year, and the UK has had nine consecutive rate rises since the tightening began. So this is an environment that is unprecedented, and Rana, I see you're getting -- you're girding yourself, I see. And if they've got it wrong, and the economic pressures subside, then this thing will then tip into recession and it'll be deep. Rana, what do you make of it?",

You know, Paul kind of hinted at this. But basically, if you were to take out the dip that we saw during the pandemic, then this recovery cycle that we've been in is really the longest over the time that records of this type have been kept. So there is no question in my mind that we're not only due for a recession, it would probably be a good thing. Now, the question is, is it going to be a really hard landing? I think that the chances of that are still higher than any of us would like, for the fact that, you know, you can see from the dot-plot that you've just shown, the world Central Bankers are all racing to try and get inflation under control, which to be quite honest, if we had had, I think, a little wiser policy, we would have had some smaller, slower rate hikes, a couple years after the great economic crisis in 2008, sorry, the great financial crisis and then we would have had room to operate. Now we have no room to operate. They've got to get ahead of it. But at the same time, it's very interesting because people don't feel any sense of, you know, wage increases, we worry a lot about wage increases. Wages are going down if you look at it in terms of a cost of living pictures. It's a tough one. It's a tough one, Richard.",

Now, you had the successive rate rises that we've had, and they don't really cumulatively take effect until next year.

Nurses are walking out of the job in much of the UK, as many as 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing, Britain's largest nursing union are striking in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. It's the union's biggest strike in its 106-year history. Years of hardship for the UK as National Health Service. It is straining under staff shortages, sky high demand and under funding. Scott McLean is in London with more. This all comes, Scott, at a time if you'd like a winter of discontent in the UK, which has meanings to those of us of a certain age.

Look, the nurses will also tell you that this is not necessarily just about money, Richard, they'll also tell you it is about the NHS as a whole, the National Health Service. This is the number of people who attended over the last four years, A&amp;E, as you say, in this country or the emergency room. It's largely stayed the same. What has changed is the number of people who are waiting 12-plus hours to actually see a doctor.

It was so amazing and inspiring, seeing the piece sell at auction and knowing that every penny will help the natural world and will make a real tangible difference. My ultimate goal as an artist and as a wildlife artist, specifically is to use my art to raise awareness and to inspire people and to really connect people with nature.
