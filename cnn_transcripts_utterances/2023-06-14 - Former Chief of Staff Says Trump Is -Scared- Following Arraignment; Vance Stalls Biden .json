Just hours after pleading not guilty to 37 federal felonies over his handling of classified documents, we've learned that former President Trump racked up more than $2 million in his Bedminster fundraiser last night. It was a whirlwind day for the 2024 Republican front runner.Before he flew back to New Jersey, he stopped to greet supporters at a Cuban restaurant in Miami. He looked fairly competent for someone who just faced a federal judge and potentially several years in prison. But his former chief of staff, John Kelly, believes it's all an act. Kelly told The Washington Post, \"He's scared s---less. This is the way he compensates for that. He gives people the appearance he doesn't care by doing this. For the first time in his life, it looks like he's being held accountable.\" I want to bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, right now it's unclear when Trump's next court date is going to be, what should we expect here in the coming weeks and months?",

He held a fundraiser last night as we mentioned, I know you have new details about what happened there. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. That's right, Brianna. So I spoke to a number of people who were present there. They said that Trump was walking around wining and dining these high dollar donors, asking about his arraignment, what did they think, what did they think of his response, even at some points asking how he looked on camera. He was really reveling in all of this coverage. And I didn't notice that Trump's team seemed a lot more relaxed this time than after I saw them after the Manhattan arraignment. They said it's because they believe that they have this playbook down, how to deal with these multiple indictments and looming legal battles and run for president. And part of that was really playing it out in the court of public opinion. And that begins by changing the narrative. That's what we started to see yesterday, that trip to Versailles was a planned trip by his campaign. They wanted positive visuals out there from this day. They knew that there would be no camera inside of the courthouse, so they wanted all of the visuals around him to be supporters fawning over him and greeting him. The other part of that was what we saw last night from the former president, who is obviously using the same lines we've heard before saying that this was all political attacking Jack Smith, saying that he has done nothing wrong but again, trying to shift the narrative. The other part of this playbook is just to continue campaigning as though these things aren't going on. I am told, after his speech, he sat down with a number of his advisers. They went over what events to have next, where to have the rallies, which of the first states or early states to focus on. But it still remains to be seen whether or not these things can be done at the same time. Keep in mind, these legal battles are not over. This is just the beginning of this. So can you run for president and actually fight all of these legal battles, which just simply unknown. I've talked to a number of Republicans who say they're concerned that this is going to harm his electability.",

They found 79 bodies so far.But in the cases like this in the past, what happens is that these migrant boats - people are locked in the lower parts of the boat in order to keep the balance when they make this treacherous journey across the Mediterranean Sea. And so this boat, we're being told, is 3,000 or several thousand - sorry - meters below the water level right now. So it's going to take a long time to understand how many people were on it. Greece, in the meantime, has declared three days of mourning over the loss of life here. But you've got to understand that the European Union as a whole has worked very hard not to accept anyone who's on the boats that do make it over. So there's a lot of eyebrow raising here right now that one of these boats goes down and everybody knows about it, suddenly everybody's caring about it.

Just take a listen to John Thune, a member of Senate GOP leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): We've lost three elections in a row now. He's been the issue in every one of those elections.

He wrote the book \"Gray Day\" on how he helped to capture one of America's most dangerous spies, Robert Hanssen, who actually passed away last week. Eric, you've seen what happens when government secrets land in the wrong hands. These are very sensitive documents we're talking about. What's your biggest concern after reading the federal indictment of Donald Trump? ERIC O'NEILL, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST, VMWARE: Well, Brianna, it's very interesting indictment, as someone who straddles the - both the side of the law, I'm an attorney and counter intelligence, this is one of the more fascinating indictments. It has an enormous amounts of detail, including pictures, which you don't usually see, it's 49 pages. And normally, indictments are just the bare bones facts, because the prosecutor doesn't want to tip their hand about a lot of the evidence that they're going to bring at trial. Remember, this is the indictment and Trump's been indicted, but he still needs to go to trial before a jury of his peers. One thing that I can note about this indictment that's pretty interesting to me is the classification markings on the documents. Now, we don't know what's in the documents and we do know that the United States government tends to over classify. When I was in the government, pretty much everything I touched was classified at some of the highest levels. But some of the markings are very interesting, especially ones that seem to come from human sources and also from signals intelligence, which could be like a satellite intercept. We only know that because some of the alphabet letters that are used after a designation like top secret or secret and also there are letters that are redacted. Those are, of course, some of the classifications of top secret intelligence that's at a higher level or a compartmented level is a better way to say it that are themselves classified, even the names of the compartments are classified, so they're redacted, so that does cause some concern.",

      "sentences": "Yes. These are compartmented information that very few people would have access to, right. So are you saying that you don't think over classification is actually going to be an issue here that we're talking about stuff that is highly classified, because in this indictment, what we wrote about was vulnerabilities of the U.S., right? Vulnerabilities of allies, responses to potential attacks, nuclear secrets, I mean, these are the kinds of things that you would expect to be very highly classified.O'NEILL: That's absolutely true. Now, once again, we only have very brief descriptions. And the descriptions are purposefully vague, not because the prosecutor is trying to hide the ball, but because the documents are classified. We will probably never see these documents, we being the public. Now, Trump's defense team will see the documents and we'll be able to put together a defense against them. Some of the documents might be old, some of the documents might not be as concerning as they look like on paper with the descriptions, but this seems to be a very strong case against Trump, not just because the documents seem to be at a higher level of classification but because where the prosecutor is going. The special prosecutor is making a case for intent, for willful obstruction. That is a very high bar to reach, but it is also laid out in the document. And I suspect that part of this is for a few reasons. One, he wants to float above the whole political side of this debate that's going to happen behind and outside the courtroom, but also to distinguish this case against Trump from one that could, for example, be made against President Biden for keeping documents in his garage.",
