The latest on what you need to know. Ukraine steps up, strikes in occupied Crimea, forcing Russia to temporarily close a key Bridge, details coming up. And a luxury cruise ship runs aground in Greenland. There are at least three cases of COVID on board. We will bring you the latest.As Kim Jong Un's closely watch trip to Russia continues, International Concern is growing about the ramifications. The North Korean leader met with Vladimir Putin for five hours on Wednesday to discuss a closer Military relationship and that's got the West worried. In fact South Korea suggests North Korean weapons are already being used by Russia in Ukraine. Meanwhile, North Korean state media reports Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to visit Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang at a time that's convenient. Up next for Kim according to President Putin and Russian state media, he'll visit the key Military and civilian sites you'll see here and observe Russia's Pacific Fleet. Paula Hancocks joins us now from Seoul with the very latest. I mean, what we should point out is these are great privileges, real honors that are being rolled out for Kim Jong Un.",

I mean, certainly, there's a certain amount of knowledge and Military knowledge that is likely to be shared just by being able to go to some of these facilities. Of course, the question is, what does Russia get in return and the overwhelming opinion among U.S. officials is that the North Koreans will be providing ammunition and small arms, for example, to be used in the war on Ukraine.In fact, the presidential office and official within the office just today saying that they believe that certain kinds of weapons provided by North Korea have already been used by Russia in the Ukraine battlefield. So the South Korean Unification Minister is saying that he has deep concerns about the potential Military drill deal that may have been decided upon. And of course, there were no press conferences. There was no document no communique. We don't know exactly what the two leaders did decide on but there are concerns in the West. Certainly here in the region with Seoul and Tokyo as well. Now we do know from both the Russian and the North Korean side that Kim Jong Un has offered an invitation for Vladimir Putin to visit Pyongyang and that has been, quote \"happily accepted\". It was the year 2000. The last time a Russian President went to Pyongyang. Again, it was Vladimir Putin, who met Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il. So 23 years since the last meeting, and we have heard from the Kremlin that the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will be going to Pyongyang in October. So what we're seeing at the moment is not the end of this. It is just the start potentially, of a much closer alliance and we are expecting that working level meeting to happen in October potentially to lay the groundwork for Putin to head to Pyongyang.

Belarus-Russian President Alexander Lukashenko said to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday according to state media. This as the European Parliament calls Lukashenko, an accomplice in war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. In a resolution adopted on Wednesday, it says Belarus-Russian leadership should also be investigated and prosecuted along with the Russian leadership.Now it's the war itself and Ukraine says more than 2000 people have been evacuated from the Kupiansk district in the country's east. Officials say the situation on the front lines there remains difficult and Russia could intensify its assault operations in that region. To the south, Ukraine says it destroyed a Russian air defense system in occupied Crimea in an overnight attack, while Russia says air defenses shut down 11 Ukrainian drones over Crimea earlier today.

Authorities say they are simply unable to bury all the victims and devastating flooding caused by a powerful storm system and the collapse of two dams. The country's rival governments are providing differing death tolls, ranging from 5,300 to more than 6,000 people with 10,000 others still missing. Hospitals are overwhelmed and morgues are overflowing.The damage is so severe that getting aid to certain areas is nearly impossible. CNN's Senior International Correspondent, Ben Wedeman is monitoring the situation from Rome. A lot has been -- you know a lot of people suggesting that aid isn't getting through because there's so much damage, which is true. But there's also this political situation which is making things very difficult indeed.",

Even though it appears at the moment they have put aside some of their differences to try to deal with this unprecedented catastrophe.But nonetheless, we're seeing it for instance, Algeria, which supports the government in Tripoli, has sent aid to Libya -- Libya, but it sent that aid to Tripoli, which is more than 1300 kilometers away from Derna now where the which is the epicenter of this disaster. So, this has made things more difficult. And in fact, the head of the World Meteorological Organization said that perhaps the death toll, the level of death could have been avoided if the Libyan governments had not been so taken up by their conflict, that basically, the meteorological service which should have provided warning to the people is basically not functioning and that there was no emergency plan in place, no evacuation warning or order was issued, because these governments simply are non-functional in sort of the way that one might expect. Now, we understand the situation on the ground in Derna remains very difficult with hundreds, perhaps thousands of bodies in the streets, waiting to be identified and then buried. But because there's very little in the way of electricity, there's the danger of an outbreak of disease. Now, help is on the way. Saudi Arabia, for instance, announced that it was going to be sending shelter and food. The International Committee of the Red Cross is also sending relief supplies. France is sending first responders, a ship left to the Italian port of Brindisi today and the Thai navy ship with emergency supplies as well. Now the Libyan Port Authority has announced that port of Derna can now receive chips as well. So at least perhaps some aid will start arriving in a substantial way. But it may be some time before we actually know the death toll given that there are still body's been basically washing up on shore in Derna. Max.",

And many Republicans are acknowledging that that evidence does not exist right now.That is why a meeting that is unfolding in the Capitol just a few feet away from here is so critical this morning because it's an opportunity for the Republican chairman who are leading this investigation to walk their members through why an impeachment inquiry was such an important next step, where they're going in their investigation and what they hope to find. But there are still so many things that Republicans are going to have to decide on when it comes to this impeachment inquiry. One of them is just who to ask to testify as part of their impeachment inquiry, what information they still need to get, when and how quickly to subpoena or ask for bank records of either the President or his son. These are all questions that are looming large and there's going to be a difference of opinion. [08:15:00] From some conservatives who are arguing that this should move as expeditiously as possible and others who have more perhaps experience in these investigations who say it's really important to go slowly and methodically. Now, yesterday, Jim Jordan, who is one of the chairmen leading this impeachment inquiry, he went over to the Republican Senate lunch and try to walk some skeptical Republican members through the theory of their case and also walk them through where they're going next. But I was told from Kevin Kramer, a Republican senator from North Dakota, that there was some pushback and some questions about what the evidence was at this point. So there's a question about how quickly this is going to move and who and how targeted this is going to be and those are all things that are going to be under much more of a spotlight now, Max, given the fact that this is now an official impeachment inquiry.",

Now, you know, life expectancy is expected to grow.But I think the problem is, you've got too many people holding on to power for too long with a lack of competitive general elections, because of the rigged system of redistricting. And I think part of the tragedy is it with Romney retiring, frankly, is that he represents what's left at the sensible center in the U.S. Senate, which is necessary for democracies to function. And with him leaving, there's a question of who will replace will the Republican Party get much further right. I was really struck by one of his comments to McKay Coppins, a great reporter for The Atlantic Monthly, who said that -- he told McKay that a large percentage of my party doesn't really believe in the Constitution. That's a problem. That's a problem having to do with the ossification and the polarization of our politics, not just the age, but the age doesn't help.",
