CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts now.So the question this morning, what will Donald Trump appeal today? It really is a multiple choice question. The most probable answer is C right there. Colorado's ruling to remove him from his primary ballot. That appeal is expected any time, only about 24 hours left to file it, there is a deadline. He appealed a similar decision in Maine overnight and did not stop there. Overnight, his lawyers also asked a federal appeals court to rehear his immunity argument in the E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit, and a brand-new legal filing outlines how Trump plans to fight special counsel Jack Smith to get immunity in the federal election subversion case. Oral arguments on that scheduled for next week, and of course, all of this is happening with just days before the Iowa caucuses. CNN's Zachary Cohen here with the flurry of legal developments.

      "sentences": "Yes, John, let's start in May, and obviously with this appeal by Donald Trump, he's just trying to stay on the ballot in these battleground states. And look, his appeal last night to stay on the ballot in Maine really spent a lot of time attacking Maine's Secretary of State, a Democrat, who he called bias.Said his lawyers said that she should have recused herself from this decision, and that she actually had no authority to make it in the first place. Now, the Secretary of State in Maine, the situation is a little bit different there. The Secretary of State is the first-stop under Maine law for questions about who can be on the ballot and who can be removed from the ballot. But it does show how Trump's politics are really part of Trump's legal strategy when it comes to Maine, and arguing this at the state level. Now, he also argues that he can't be removed under the 14th Amendment because the insurrection ban of the 14th Amendment -- because he did not engage in an insurrection. And this is something that might have relevance beyond just Maine. It's also at the core of the questions raised by Colorado's decision to remove Trump from the ballot. As you mentioned, that's a decision that we expect to be appealed as soon as today, and we're waiting to see how that might impact the broader landscape of these states deciding whether or not Trump can be on their primary ballot, and potentially on their general election ballot as we go into the 2024 presidential race.",

And this is an area where just a few weeks ago was filled with thousands of migrants who had crossed in from Mexico.But you know, Eagle Pass is also kind of interesting, it really kind of captures the rub that is the border situation. You know, this is an area that is filled with thousands of federal, state and local law enforcement officers, miles and miles of razor wire along the river. You can see in the background there, steel containers that state authorities have put along the Rio Grande to block people from crossing, but despite all of that, over the last several months, tens of thousands of migrants have crossed through this very area. So, this is the dichotomy here, that you see an area that has built up infrastructure in border security and border infrastructure, and despite all of that, people continue to cross. So those lawmakers coming with this Republican group, more than 50 of them expected including the house speaker, will be meeting with state authorities who have also been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of the migration crisis along the U.S. southern border. But the Biden administration, Rahel, also hitting back at these Republican house lawmakers saying that this visit comes -- is obstructing and hamstringing the delicate negotiations that are ongoing between a bipartisan group of senators in Washington and who have been meeting over the holiday break to try to come to some sort of deal and compromise on a border security bill.

So I think it does further complicate the ability to get any kind of compromise through the House of Representatives. And you also have this dynamic where for months, you know, House Republicans have been calling on Mayorkas to be impeached. And I think it just makes it very hard to imagine some of those Republicans being willing to vote for a border security compromise that is not the house-passed Immigration Bill that they moved forward with last year. So that's one dynamic.  The other question, though, is what happens to additional aid for Ukraine and Israel? As you mentioned, these issues are all tied together now -- and our colleague, Phil Mattingly pressed Secretary Mayorkas earlier on what it will mean if more funding for the U.S. southern border is not passed, and what that means for the conditions at the southern border.

According to state media, again, citing officials on the ground, there were two explosions, one, the first one, just 700 meters away from the burial site of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. The second was just about a kilometer away from the path and checkpoints where pilgrims had been crossing through. Now, important to note that today marks four years since Qasem Soleimani was killed, he was killed by a U.S. strike on Baghdad International Airport, ordered by then President Donald Trump. And of course, we haven't seen this kind of violence necessarily on the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani. So, there has always been heightened concern around the potential for such violence. Hundreds of pilgrims would have been gathering around or heading towards Qasem Soleimani's burial site to mark the four-year anniversary of his death. And of course, there is now a huge amount of concern as we continue to see that death toll rise. Still unclear what the exact motive behind this reported attack may have been.
