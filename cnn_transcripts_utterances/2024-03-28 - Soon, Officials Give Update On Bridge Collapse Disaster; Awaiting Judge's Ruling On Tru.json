What that means, it's a technical term, but it means in simple ways that if they're struck with enough force at just the right spot, a big section or the entire bridge will come down. That is exactly what we saw with the Key Bridge. When that ship hit this one support over here, it triggered a chain reaction that took the whole thing out.This is a bridge that had stood for decades, that handled 11 million cars a year, was undeniably very strong, gone in second. And there have been similar incidents in the past. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge near Tampa, which opened roughly around the time of the Key Bridge, was taken out by a floundering ship many years ago. The I-40 Bridge in Oklahoma, also well in past, was largely destroyed by some loose barges, again, hitting one area. And there are more. Wolf?",

We heard reference there. That's something that's going to stand apart from the bridge itself out in the water. There are many different forms of these, but the point is that these would be something, that would either deflect or somehow slow down, reduce the idea of a bridge getting a free, unhindered shot at this vital part right over here.The other possibility is something that is referred to largely as fenders. In this case, it's built more around the critical part. And it might be out of earth or it might out a steel or might it be out any number of concrete, any number substances, but basically the same effect. What you're doing is you are putting something here that will keep any force from having a direct shot at the bridge. Federal officials say they don't think anything could have withstood the force of this ship hitting that bridge, but maybe if these had been more robust, it could've steered it aside, somehow blunted that assault, and maybe this fracture critical bridge wouldn't fall. And plus, engineers say, what about all the older bridges? Even if you're building the new ones this way, what about those 17,000 other bridges, which ones are in dangerous areas? Which ones are vulnerable to this kind of single impact catastrophic failure? Wolf?",

How significant do you believe that is?S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  It's really significant. It would be significant without any of the wildness and weirdness going around the Trump campaign, but it's even more significant, considering Trump's haul has to be diverted to cover legal fees and fines and all the other stuff he's dealing with. So, it's a big deal that they're raising this much money, not just Joe Biden personally, but the DNC as well. It should be concerning for the Trump team, for sure.",

So, most voters are not paying rapt attention to this campaign right now, though we are, they will be after these conventions and in the fall.
