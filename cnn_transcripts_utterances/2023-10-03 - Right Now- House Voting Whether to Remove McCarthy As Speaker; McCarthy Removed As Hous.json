It is the speaker who is second in line to the presidency. Not a member of the Senate. It is an extraordinarily important piece of our government. They have decided summarily to essentially remove their own head and not put anything in charge of it. And that -- if we wake up tomorrow morning and there is no speaker of the house, that's going to be a real seminal moment for all of us. We'll see what happens, which seems to be on track to remove McCarthy for the moment as speaker. We're still reporting what happens next. It sounds like they'll probably get together in a conference and talk about it. They could potentially try to put somebody else up. McCarthy could try to put himself back up and just vote over and over and over again until somebody gives.

To your earlier question about what Democrats decided just a few minutes ago, our colleague Annie Grayer speaking to Jim Clyburn on the floor tonight, says that a lot of Democrats were upset with McCarthy because of what he said on \"Face the Nation\" this nation, blaming Democrats for bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown.To me, that is not just about that particular moment. For Democrats, it clearly signified that McCarthy is not reformed. He is not interested in doing the right thing for the right reasons. He still has his deeply partisan political hat on. And I think that as Democrats looked at the situation and said is this someone we can work with, is this someone who has the best interests of the body at heart, those comments really cut against that, and clearly hurt him according to Clyburn. Some Democrats that might have even considered voting present, they all rank and file went with the entire group's consensus, which was to not bail McCarthy out in this moment.

And surely enough, the same agents of chaos who made it very difficult 15 rounds for him to become speaker are pulling what they are now. The problem is this is kind of a strategic miscalculation by McCarthy. I'm shocked that there is no bigger effort to try to whip some Democratic support today, even on the margins to try to cut some deals and see if you can pull over even half a dozen of them could have gotten him over the line to vote present.",

Kevin McCarthy has made multitude contradictory promises, and when they all came due, he lost votes of people who maybe don't even ideologically agree with me on everything.

So let me break away from this press conference with Congressman Gaetz, who led the charge against now former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.We are joined now by Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. He's one of the eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, I want to get some clarity on something you said as you were going into the house chamber. You said you were deciding on how to vote, whether to side with your friend, Kevin McCarthy, or your conscience, but that he called you and he said something that, in your view, belittled your faith because you were praying on how to vote. Can you explain how that conversation went? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Yeah, he just basically said something that I thought belittled me and my belief system. And, you know, I -- that pretty much sealed it with me right there. I thought that showed the character of the man. Yeah, I want to listen to him. I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to do it a long time ago, I was wanting to do it while we were -- in Congress, the six weeks we were on break, from august until the first two weeks of September, and I said to him, I wish you hadn't waited until right now to call me.",
