      "sentences": "The public health policy known as Title 42 has been lifted. It had been in place since March of 2020, during the Trump administration, it essentially became a de facto immigration policy, even though it is never what Title 42 was expected to do. But nevertheless, it has been kept in place and kept out around 3 million migrants from requesting asylum since that time.So, now, the question becomes, what will the U.S. southern border look like now that this policy has been lifted? And what is the future of migration here along the southern border? The U.S. border patrol chief says, he no longer expects at this massive rush of people which at some point the Biden administration was expecting would be anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 people per day. The U.S. border patrol chief says, we have already started seeing in the days leading up to this point a larger influx of migrants. So, he thinks that it's not going to be as dramatic at what had been anticipated, and you know, now migrants requesting asylum, it is become a much more traditional, but difficult process. Now, that Title 42 is gone, there are stricter penalties in place that can threaten at the migrants ability to immigrate into the United States. So this really does change the dynamic on the ground here, and one of the things to look for will be the number of people trying to evade arrest by U.S. border patrol officials here on the ground. We're also starting to see an uptick in the number of people crossing in areas away from city centers where there is heavily fortified border wall, and that sort of thing. So the question becomes, how many poor people will be trying to avoid arrest and get away from border patrol agents here on the ground, and continue to enter the country illegally? But, you know, right now, we are getting kind of mixed signals if you will as to what exactly is going to happen here in the days ahead, many more communities bracing for the worst. But, it is a question of, you know, just how intense were this influx of migrants be, we just don't have a clear picture yet on the situation. Ed Lavandera, CNN, El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We are following a number of weather patterns today, from severe weather over the nation's heartland, to the flood threat. But let's focus in on Texas first, because of the larger story here. Title 42 coming to an end, and now we have a level 3 to 5, for both, today and tomorrow for the locations, where we have some of the most traffic moving from Mexico into the U.S. border, Laredo, Eagle Pass, for instance those on the U.S.-Mexican border.Now, look at the rain that is going to across those regions, specifically between the 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. timeframe. And not only will this bring the potential for such flash flooding, but also the potential for large hail and damaging winds. So, migrants potentially crossing the border within this location have to deal with a severe weather conditions, and that is only going to complicate the issues as if the last thing they need to further increase their challenges here as they are dealing with. Look at the flood watches in place across Central Texas, this is part of a larger storm system, another low pressure, just to its north that created severe weather overnight. Let me take you to Noble, Oklahoma, this is just south of Oklahoma city, you can see some of the tornado damage that ripped through some homes, and you can see we also had 16 reports of tornadoes across the Plains, through Oklahoma, and into portions of Texas and Louisiana, also 50 reports of hail, and when damage as well. We have a severe weather threat today. I mentioned Texas. That stretches into Oklahoma once again. That's primarily a wind and hail. But look to the north, level 3 of 5 from Storm Prediction Center, that shading of orange. That's where we have our greatest threat of tornadoes, including portions of Nebraska and Iowa -- Omar.",

This is something that we also saw ahead of the Ukrainian counter offensive last summer, which resulted in Ukrainians it taking back of the wide swath of territory in the Kherson region.The Russians though are just lying down and taking this, there been some 80 reported attacks in the last day in the Kherson region alone, but regardless of whether this official counteroffensive has begun or not, the reality is that Ukrainians have had some success with on the battlefield, in the heavily, heavily fought over city of Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine. There are undoubtedly on the offensive there. The deputy defense minister says they have been taken a mile and a quarter of territory over the last week or so. The Ukrainians say, they have needed to explore gaps in the Russian flanks, though they are not calling this a counteroffensive as of yet. The president says that Ukrainians need more time to get more western weaponry into the country before the counteroffensive can officially begin. The head of the Russian Wagner private mercenary group says that Ukrainian counteroffensive though is in full swing, and he concedes that they have had some success on the front lines, so much though that the Russian defense ministry actually put out a very unusual late night statement last night, denying reports that the Ukrainians had made a major breakthrough. There is also this escalating tension between Wagner at the Russian ministry of defense. The leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has actually invited the defense minister to come see for himself the frontlines, because he accuses the Russian regular forces of retreating, though some Ukrainians say the opposite is actually true, that it was Wagner troops that retreated in that area rather than Russian regular forces. The Kremlin has tried to downplay this dispute, saying that, look everyone is falling into the same direction, yet they acknowledge the situation is quite emotional at the moment -- Omar.",

The bottom line here is, conversations are progressing among the staff level meetings, sources tell CNN, but they haven't addressed so far yet that they feel like they can bring into those five principals, that President Biden and congressional leaders, and that they could go forward and have a productive meeting on their own. There's still more work to do before guests that level. So White House announced that they had postponed that meeting with the five principles, their and staff will get more work in.Now that meeting with the five principals is expected to happen early next week, and staff are expected to meet today, once again. Now, when we talk about what the conversation has been so far, really sources tell CNN it has been about the scope of what is possible, really defining the contours of where the negotiations can take, place to always get to a deal to stave off this catastrophic outcome. Now, the White House says they have been really clear about putting what is off the table, as you can see on the screen, there that includes Inflation Reduction Act, which is a key pillar of President Biden's agenda, and whether it is investments in climate change and other areas. They say that is not touchable. Of course, that is something GOP Republicans have really set their eyes on. Another thing is student debt forgiveness, an olive branch really from President Biden to young people and Medicaid, and SNAP benefits, something else that we heard Republicans talk about in the past, they would be interested in putting some caps on. The White House is saying, not here, not in these negotiations though. Ultimately though, Omar, the White House is coming around to the idea that they are going to have to accept some sort of spending cuts to try and stave off the debt default really when it comes to trying to raise the debt ceiling. But the conversation of course will be about, time because the White House does not want to be here again in the next year, and also spending caps, something the White House does not want to be 10 years, which we know the House GOP have really floated. And so, ultimately, this is going to come down to a conversation of whether or not the White House can of course give up catastrophe, but also stick to the presidents bottom line which is he wants a clean debt ceiling, but will also accept spending cuts on the side -- Omar.",
