Joe Biden's Frank words about Vladimir Putin's latest moves. The Palestinians call it a massacre. The Israelis, a counterterrorism operation. It was the deadliest Israeli raid in the West Bank since the Second Intifada more than two decades ago. And snow in the desert. A winter weather warning for Los Angeles. 800,000 homes and businesses already without power. The bizarre coast to coast storm barreling across the United States. We begin this hour in Russia where President Vladimir Putin appears to be putting an increased emphasis on his country's nuclear forces. In a speech marking Fatherland Day, Mr. Putin committed to strengthening Russia's nuclear triad. A military force structure capable of launching three types of nuclear weapons. These leader's comments coming after he announced Russia would be suspending its participation in a nuclear arms control treaty with Washington. Here's how the U.S. president reacted to that.

We don't have any reports from Western intelligence suggesting that any kind of use of a nuclear weapon by Russia is imminent. And frankly, he's committing to something they have been committing to for the last decades, modernizing their Soviet era, nuclear weapons.But look, it was interesting, for example, that he mentioned putting the Sarmat missile system into combat duty this year. That is something that two U.S. officials have told us that Russia tested this week and that test, they think failed. So, that was one thing to note. But this is all interesting coming up to the anniversary of the war in Ukraine that we've seen this nuclear saber rattling by Russia increase. We saw them withdraw or suspend their participation from the New START treaty that last vestige of the sort of post-Cold War, nuclear arms reduction architecture with the United States. Though they did say that they are going to stick to the numerical limits on weapons and this decision is reversible in the words of the foreign ministry. That failed test of the ICBM, according to U.S. officials, another part of this. And now these comments on this day, which is a holiday in Russia, Defender of the Fatherland Day, sort of reiterating that position. Some will say it points to a limited amount of options for Putin, but officials in Russia are looking at this as essentially a guarantee of Russia's success. You can't defeat a nuclear power they've been saying, Anna.",

China's top diplomat Wang Yi was in Moscow on Wednesday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also met with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Fabrice Pothier is the former director of policy planning at NATO. Now CEO of the political consultancy firm, Russ Musen Group. He joins me now from Santander in Spain. Great to see you, Fabrice. Let's start with Putin's meeting with China's top diplomat. They certainly presented a united front. It comes after the release of American intelligence suggesting that Putin is seeking arms and technology from Beijing.

We've seen that before the Ukrainian -- before the Russian lost the war in Ukraine. But we've also seen that with China at the beginning of the war when the U.S. made sure to try to draw a red line in terms of support that the Chinese could offer to the Russia.So, I think this is part of the same approach. But there is a reason to be concerned because indeed, if China were to provide some sort of military support to Russia, Russia would gain extra strategic depth in its industry and therefore to supply its forces, especially its artillery forces to Ukraine. It won't necessarily be the game changer in the war in Ukraine, but it will certainly make it longer.",

Israel says it targeted a weapons manufacturing site and a military compound belonging to the militant group Hamas. A few hours earlier, the Israeli military said six rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza. Well, most were intercepted, one fell in an open area. So far there's been no claim of responsibility. But that rocket fire appears to be in retaliation for a lethal Israeli military raid targeting Palestinian militants in the West Bank. Well, journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us now from Jerusalem. Elliott, this is -- the second day time raid in less than a month ending in the deaths of unarmed Palestinians, they alleged were unarmed. Israeli military I guess usually conducts night operations. Why are they doing this during the day and risking further escalation?",

Daytime raids are incredibly rare for the Israeli security forces because one, there are many more civilians around and two, there's obviously more risk to their own soldiers. This was carried out according to the Israeli security forces. This was carried out in the daytime because of -- in its words, specific intelligence, indicating an imminent attack by Palestinian militants.Now Israel says that it was targeting three militants in particular. They said they surrounded the house, ask them to surrender. They refused a gun battle ensued. The result of that is those three militants were killed. And in total, 11 Palestinians were killed as a result of that gun battle in Nablus yesterday. And more than 100 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, were injured. Some of them critically. And as a result of that raid, we've seen condemnation from Saudi Arabia, from the Egyptians, Jordanians and the Emiratis. And we've also had a statement from the U.S. State Department saying that it's extremely concerned by the levels of violence in Israel and the West Bank. And, of course, as a result or following that raid by Israeli security forces on Wednesday, we saw those rockets launched from the Gaza Strip towards Israel and then Israel retaliating with those airstrikes. And we've also heard from the militants of Islamic Jihad, for example, warning about a potential explosion and escalation if Israel continues to carry out those raids. But Israel -- and of course, the current government that Israel has, was partly elected on promises to do a better job of protecting Israel from attacks. And it would seem, as we've seen in previous raids by Israeli security forces seeking militants that although this is a red daytime raid, this certainly is very unlikely to be the last kind of raid that we see. And inevitably There will be more violence to come. Anna?",

However, in a low turnout scenario, Tinubu and his ruling party are expected to prevail.MICHAEL FAMOROTI, CO-FOUNDER/HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE, STEARS: It's time for a new era, whatever that looks like.

Nigeria's economy is teetering on the brink of financial collapse, skyrocketing public debt, and criminals stealing hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil, every day from the nation's primary source of income. And a recent attempt to redesign a currency led to a cash crisis and widespread frustration, leaving people queuing for hours to get their own money.(END VIDEOTAPE) BUSARI (on camera): Ultimately, the winner has achieved the highest number of votes nationwide and receive 25 percent of the votes cast in 24 of the 36 days. If not, there will be a second-round run-up within 21 days, between the top two candidates. It's the first time since Nigeria began democratic rule that none of the candidates is an incumbent or former military ruler. So, whatever the outcome, Africa's most populous country will soon welcome a new dawn. Stephanie Busari, CNN, Lagos",
