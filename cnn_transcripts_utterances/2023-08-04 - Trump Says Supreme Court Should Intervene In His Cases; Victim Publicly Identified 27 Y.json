Today, the former president who is facing charges for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election called on the Supreme Court to get involved in the case. It is not clear exactly what Mr. Trump is asking the high court to do. But the former president claims that the charges against him are, quote, election interference. Trump pleaded not guilty yesterday inside a Washington, D.C. courtroom. And his next hearing is scheduled for August 28th. Let's get straight to CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider with more on this. So, Jessica, let's start with this new Trump request.

The 2020 election case from yesterday or the classified documents case down in Florida. Challenges to those could make their way to the Supreme Court.Also, of note here is the fact that Trump's track record at the Supreme Court when it comes to the 2020 election cases in general, it's not good. The Supreme Court has either rejected or refused to even consider every election challenge that he or his allies brought around the 2020 election. And all of that, Bianna, despite the fact that three of the nine justices are, in fact, Trump nominees. So, not a good track record for the former president.",

After that Trump's legal team will have seven days to respond.Now Trump's team, they're already talking about the enormity of the evidence in this case and how they're really going to resist doing anything quickly. In court yesterday, we saw Trump's lawyer John Lauro putting it this way to the judge, saying, obviously, the United States has had three and a half years to investigate this matter and also there are a number of agents and lawyers assisting the government in this proceeding, and all that we would ask your honor is the time to fairly defend our client. What's interesting, Bianna, is the speedy trial act, it does say that trial should happen 70 days after a defendant first appears in court. That 70-day clock started yesterday.

So, that's necessarily the case. They didn't have three and a half years here. DUPREE:  Jack Smith is a new comer. But I think certainly the special counsel's office benefitted from the investigation that the January 6 Select Committee carried out. So I think from the defense's perspective, they've been under investigation for a very long time. The other thing I note, Bianna, is that Jack Smith did a good job in doing this best to try to streamline this complaint to get it on kind of a rocket docket, to get this thing tried sooner rather than later. He did that by charging only president, not charging the other alleged co-conspirators and doing his best to slim down what I think is going to be a very complicated case.

But justice remains elusive as police announced no new charges in her death. Vergata was a 34-year-old New York City resident when she disappeared in 1996. She was one of the 11 victims whose remains were found scattered across Long Island's south shore between 2010 and 2011.Let's go to CNN's Miguel Marquez with more on this. So, Miguel, 59-year-old Rex Heuermann was charged last week with murder in connection to three Gilgo Beach victims. But as of now, police are not linking him to the killing of Karen Vergata? MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  They are not. But they're not ruling him out either. They held a very short press conference out in Long Island today to say that they have identified this woman. They identified her sometime ago. Ms. Vergata went missing on Valentine's Day, back in 1996. Later that month, part of her body, her legs and her feet specifically washed up in Fire Island, not too far from Gilgo Beach. But it wasn't until 2011 that they found part of a skull on Gilgo Beach, and through forensics and DNA, they were able to map the two sets of remains and they figured out who she was about a year ago, but did not release that information because at the time they were investigating Rex Heuermann. This leaves open some possibilities. That perhaps Mr. Heuermann will eventually be charged in this crime. Remember, the investigators went meticulously through his house out on Long Island for about 12 days, become two weeks using ground penetrating radar, digging into his backyard and just taking out reams and reams of evidence from his home there. And it is possible that they will charge him, or that there is another killer or killers out there. Because, remember, in all, there were 11 sets of remains out there. There have been charged in three of them and Mr. Heuermann is the lead suspect in a fourth. But these others are still a mystery -- Bianna.",

Startling this that kind of damage could be inflicted so deep into Russian territory and in places that say they must have felt were impregnable. After the attack, not claimed by Ukraine but likely by Ukraine on the Kremlin domes a few weeks ago, and then a attack on Moscow skyscrapers in the city and then the attack by another Ukraine drone on the Kerch bridge between Crimea and the Russian mainland, utterly startling that this level of attacks are indeed occurring, perhaps a bit by Ukraine to show some sort of military impetuous even though the southern counter offensive is going slower than they would like.

The hearing unfolded behind closed doors with broadcast with poor audio quality and it was being held abnormally within the high security prison rather than in a Moscow courtroom.CNN's Nic Robertson looks at the astronomical price of challenging Putin and why Navalny seems to willing to pay it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Entering a courtroom that looks as flimsy as the legal case against him, Alexey Navalny and his legal team line up to hear his almost predictable sentencing, 19 years. The judge's words utterly unintelligible in the press room next door, convicting Putin's harshest and persistent critic of creating extremist communities. Charges Navalny denied. He was neither bowed nor cowed, even shared a joke with his lawyer. After sentencing, using his Telegram channel to tell his supporters, 19 years in a special regime colony, the number doesn't matter. The verdict is not for me, it's for you. They want to frighten you. Not for the first time has Navalny been made an object lesson at the cost of challenging Putin. Poisoned and almost killed with the deadly nerve agent Novichok almost three years ago, an attack he blames on Putin, which the Kremlin denies. He barely survived, recovered in Germany, then returned to Moscow six months later, despite the certainty of what awaited him. He was arrested and charged with fraud and other offenses he said are bogus. And he's currently serving nine years. In jail, he says he's been denied sleep, kept in isolation, intentionally made sick, and almost completely cut off from his family and lawyers. Putin's brutality has taken its toll. Navalny has lost weight. DARIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S DAUGHTER:  There are no calls, no visits, no human conditions. He's allowed to write 35 minutes per day with a pen and paper and have two books. These are an open strategy to destroy my father's physical health and maybe mental, too.

Obama reportedly expressed to Biden this, I'm going to quote from him, and he's concerned. There is worry that Trump could be a more formidable candidate than many Democrats realize.What do you make this? Because I always go back to when Donald Trump was running initially in 2016. It seems at least early on, I remember an interview that President Obama gave to NBC News where he adamantly said he's not going to be the candidate. So what do you think he's learned from that to sense this level of alarm now to President Biden?",

And I think Obama is right in trying to wake up the rest of the country to the fact that this whole thing of the deep state going after Trump really energizes Republican voters. Republican turnout will be through the roof next year. I think that's what Obama is really concerned about.",

RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  They allegedly call themselves the goon squad, a group of white former law enforcement officers giving themselves that moniker because of their alleged willingness to use excessive force and not report. Now, they pled guilty to federal charges related to an assault that according to a charging document included nearly two hours of torture, physical, racist and sexual abuse of two Black men after a white neighbor complained. Several Black males had been staying at the property and the neighbor had observed suspicious behavior. The officer who received the complaint directed an investigator to take care of it.
