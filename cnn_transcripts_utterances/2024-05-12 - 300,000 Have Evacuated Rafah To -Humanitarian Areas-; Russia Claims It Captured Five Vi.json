So here's a look at them on a map. The original humanitarian area is Al Mawasi, marked in white, an area largely composed of sand dunes. The expanded area is around Khan Younis, marked in yellow. Now this was the scene in Rafah. You can see smoke rising into the air. Hospital officials there say 15 Palestinians were killed in strikes on Saturday, with more wounded. The group Medecins Sans Frontieres says it's transferring the remaining patients from its hospital in Rafah, saying it can no longer guarantee their safety. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Saturday that there would be a ceasefire tomorrow if Hamas would release the hostages it's holding.

But it seems that Hamas agreed to a deal that Israel had not signed up to. And we have a situation now where those talks have, I suppose the best way of describing them, have taken a breather. The delegations are no longer there in Cairo. There is still hope that at some point a deal can be done, that perhaps some verbal gymnastics would allow a deal to be done that would allow Hamas to say that Israel has agreed to end the war completely and Israel to say that it hasn't.

Meanwhile, Russia is claiming progress in its new offensive in northern Ukraine. Moscow says it has captured five villages in the Kharkiv region, but Ukraine says they are still contested. Local officials say at least three people were killed in Russian strikes on the region overnight.

More than 1,700 people have been evacuated from the region since Russia launched the incursion on Friday.

No hate on New Jersey. It is my home state, but it's typically been very blue. Trump lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020. However, Donald Trump claimed on Saturday that he thinks he could be competitive in New Jersey. Come November, he claimed that he thinks he is going to win, and that comes despite my conversations with many Trump advisers who acknowledge that they don't think Trump could likely win here in November, even though they think he's performing better than he may have in the past. And look, I also think that part of the reason we saw such big crowds in Wildwood is because Wildwood is part of Cape May County. It is a very red district within New Jersey. More broadly, a lot of people from Pennsylvania as well traveled to the state for the rally on Saturday. Now, I also just want to bring your attention to what Donald Trump said about the current war in the Middle East. He made one of his most explicit comments yet showing his support for Israel and specifically Israel's military presence in Gaza. Take a listen to how he put it.

So have a look for that because that is the reason we are experiencing this beautiful display of northern lights. We are getting these coronal mass ejection, a solar flare that travels that 93 million miles to reach us here on Earth. It interacts with our magnetic poles and it creates that beautiful display that we are all seeing. This is so rare, I like to coin the term a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because, well, let's think about the pictures that we have seen with this. Palm trees in Key Largo, Florida with a northern lights display behind it. I mean, that is just flabbergasting.

Kansas City, Oklahoma City, down through Dallas, Houston, and even a little bit farther back into Denver, also looking at some showers and thunderstorms into the forecast. But well out to the west, very nice conditions here. Las Vegas, Phoenix, and even Los Angeles, getting some sunshine in the forecast there. In terms of the strongest storms and the heaviest rainfall, that's once again going to be focused across much of the central U.S. You can see as we go into Sunday afternoon, that system begins to spread eastward. Now you're starting to see some of that heavier rainfall push in from Dallas down through Houston, even Shreveport, Louisiana. Then once we spread into Monday, you'll notice that moisture continuing along the Gulf Coast. So now going into places like Mobile, Alabama, New Orleans, even spreading into areas of Little Rock. And then also portions a little bit farther to the north and to say like areas of Missouri, also into Illinois before the system spreads eastward. So looking at Sunday, there is the potential for some excessive rainfall. You'll notice the highest point is really from Dallas, stretching down through Houston. The unfortunate part is that does mean that we are likely going to see some flooding in very close places to where we saw the flooding just a week ago, north and eastward of the Houston suburbs there, but also spreading into Louisiana. Then by Monday, as the system spreads eastward, so does the greatest potential for that flooding. You can see it's really heavily focused right here along the Gulf Coast, but one to three inches is possible for a lot of these areas. You can see right down there. But some of those areas seeing that orange color indicates four or even five inches is not out of the question, even though that won't necessarily be the widespread amounts that we end up seeing. Another concern Monday, too, is actually going to be the return of some strong to severe thunderstorms. Same thing, we're looking at Houston, up through Dallas, over to Shreveport, down into New Orleans. The main threats here are going to be damaging winds, the potential for some large hail, and yes, even having some possible tornadoes as well.",

Of course, this stemming from a February national security memorandum that required the determination on this matter and also whether Israel withheld humanitarian aid into Gaza in violation of U.S. law. Of course, all of this serving as another data point that the Biden administration is using in their ongoing discussions with Israel. But it also comes against the backdrop of the interview that President Biden had with CNN, where he said for the first time that he is willing to withhold weapons from Israel if they launch that major ground operation in Rafah, an area with more than a million displaced Palestinians. Now, those conversations are ongoing, and the President said that he would continue defensive weapons, but there could be a change on offensive weapons.

For example, we know that this has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality. We've shown to reduce the rates of stroke and heart attack, admissions for heart failure, and improve kidney composite outcomes.

And there's a lot of questions as to why this is, but what we do know is that this really seems to reduce inflammation within the body. And we are seeing on the ground, and I can tell you amongst my patient population, individuals that have really had a hard time conceiving are seeing reductions of inflammation and improved ability to conceive.We're seeing this with our reproductive endocrinologists, individuals that have had really significant challenges for quite some time, seeing improved milieu within the reproductive process.  And even individuals that are going into perimenopause and thinking they're in menopause conceiving after quite some difficulties moving into that process. So this is a real phenomenon. But a really important thing I need to state really from a safety and efficacy process is we do ask people stop these medications two months prior to conception. So if you're really in this process of thinking that you really can't conceive, we do ask that you stop these medications, the GLP-1 receptor agonists, two months prior to conceiving. That's what the safety data shows. So I really just want to give that safety announcement right now here on CNN International as we're going into that. So just want to make that clear.",
