They've been bizarre. What do you think Trump is trying to accomplish there? And do you think that's working for him? LIPPMAN: I think some of the attacks this week, were trying to distract the media and his party in terms of happiness, not focus on how it was a very good night on Tuesday for Ron DeSantis. He won 20 points ahead in Florida. He is seen as Trump without the baggage, and so Trump was trying to just like, you know, throwing spaghetti against the wall insane. Let me attack him. Let me let me attack Glenn Youngkin. Let me, you know, kind of throw a million things out there. But I think there's a lot of Republicans who are saying Why are you attacking your potential 2024 rivals even before you're entering the race, and it's seen as kind of dragging them down. And if Trump loses the, you know, primary campaign for president, then he might not even endorse to the over the Republican is and so he is kind of seen as, you know, really kind of flailing around in terms of trying to keep the party from defecting from him even though you have a lot of people blaming Trump for not having a strong enough candidates on Tuesday.",

Now, he is currently at the ASEAN Summit, where kind of the other overarching issue of this moment hangs over every hour of his attendance here in Cambodia. The reality being that that meeting with China, with Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a couple of days is an animating feature of everything. With these ASEAN countries the President trying to make clear that this is a central component, Southeast Asian countries are a central component of the U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific. He has attended the summit on a gala dinner later and they will have a very important meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea tomorrow morning before heading off to the G20. Kind of the entire thread of this Asia trip for the President really focuses on China, China's influence in the region, China's continued acceleration of its own military and economic efforts, all leading to that first face to face meeting White House officials know that is an extraordinarily crucial meeting and the international stage but also one that they feel like the President is going into with some wind at his back given what's happened on the home front, guys.",

And I think, you know, driven in large part by the fact that corporate America kept on a lot of the same goals for carbon emission, even during the Trump years, for, you know, very straight on commercial and marketing reasons. And the move to electric cars and so forth is making, I think, beginning to make a significant difference. But you're right, the question that many are asking is, is Biden the blip?

They are now, of course, the core of the President's strategy to keep China in check. These are the nations with whom -- which China is vying for influence throughout the region.And since the U.S. military presence in Asia still has a long way to be built up. And that's part of the agreement with Australia and other nations, that diplomatic engagement with them is all the more critical. And this is important as Biden heads into that meeting with Xi Jinping because he needs to say that look countries that China is trying to pick off like the Philippines, even places like Cambodia, which don't figure all that frequently in global politics, or places where the United States is now going to make a significant investment.

So Cedric, what do you expect the next steps to be for the Ukrainian military? Especially knowing that there are so many mined areas?",

You know, it's probably not going to be classic urban warfare like you saw in World War II with the Battle of Stalingrad, but what you're going to see is a methodical operation to clear buildings of booby traps, of potential booby traps of mines, things of that nature.The other thing that the Ukrainians are going to have to do, Amara, is they're going to have to move their systems forward so that they can counter any possible Russian artillery that is going to be on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River. So, when you look at where things are on the map right now, you can see that the Ukrainians have moved to that river bank. They are now controlling that area. They'll have to mop up some remaining Russian forces, of struggling Russian forces that did not make it out of the west bank of the Dnipro River, but those that are there will probably either surrender or, you know, in essence be eliminated from the fight. So, this is a very important point for the Ukrainians. They'll have to consolidate their victory here, and in order to do that, they're going to have to methodically move forward and, of course, also make sure that they document everything that the Russians did during this period.",

Now, these are punitive damages, which are really punishment damages for the willful wanton, malicious misconduct to punish the defendant, and also a deterrence aspect so that other people out there do not think that they can get away with something like this.I want to read for you a portion from the decision, so you can see the state of mind of the Judge Barbara Bellis in all of this. She said, quote, \"this depravity, this cruel persistent course of conduct establishes the highest degree of reprehensibility and blame worthiness.\" She also went on to say that the trial showed quote, \"that Jones' use of Sandy Hook engaged the audience and drove up sales and profits, the spikes in sales revenue followings the article, quote, 'FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook', and their use of the plaintiffs even during the trial to make money.'\" Now, the defense attorney for Alex Jones, Norm Pattis, said that this verdict is a tragedy, the ruling is a farce, and it makes our work in the appeal much easier. One caveat to all of this, Alex Jones has filed bankruptcy proceedings, filed in Texas, obviously in federal court. So all of these damages will be a part of that bankruptcy action, and so, there is much yet to come. Boris, Amara?",

And this is the first time they've played a college basketball game on an aircraft carrier since 2012, and this year's game taking place on the USS Abraham Lincoln in San Diego. The visuals -- I mean, just awesome. Pacific Ocean in the background, yet, a full size court smacked out in the middle of a flight deck.And the men and women of our armed forces gathering to watch two of the best programs in the country, Michigan State and Gonzaga and the second-ranked Zags actually needing a rally in this one. Down 12 early in the second half, and their leader Drew Timme stepping up. The pre-season all-American scoring 22 points. Michigan State, they had one last chance in this one, but Jaden Akins shot, he's going to rim out -- outside shots quite tough on an aircraft carrier. Gonzaga to win this one 64-63. In the NBA, the Warriors get another huge night from Steph Curry against the Cavs. Steph, just ridiculous in this one, hits the three to tie the game with just over a minute to go. Then moments later, Steph is going to hit another one to put the game away. After getting a nice screen from Klay Thompson. Warriors win 106-101. Steph, game by 40 points, became the oldest player with consecutive 40-point games since Wizards' Michael Jordan back in 2002. All right, we had a scary scene in college hockey last night. Penn State taking on Minnesota, big hit near the boards, shatters the glass, sending shards flying into the stands. You can see the woman there in the front row clearly shaken up. Everyone appeared to be OK. But there was a delay for cleanup, and so that the glass could be replaced. Minnesota won that game 3-1. All right, what's better than storming the court on a Friday night? How about doing it twice? So Temple fans storming the court after they thought they beat Villanova, the ref though said, get off because there was a foul call, so everyone had to leave. After some more free throws though, they did officially win the game and the Temple fans got to storm the court again. This was Temple's first win over Villanova in ten years. All right, finally, slapping is going mainstream. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC) (END VIDEO CLIP)",
