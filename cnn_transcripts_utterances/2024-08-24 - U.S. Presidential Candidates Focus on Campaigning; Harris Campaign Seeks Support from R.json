This past week, the DNC scored great ratings and raised tens of millions of dollars for Democrats. Now Vice President Kamala Harris has to turn that money and momentum into votes. We will have more on that in a moment.Meanwhile, rival Donald Trump held rallies in two swing states Friday, Nevada and Arizona. That's where he was joined by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who announced earlier in the day that he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump. During their joint appearance, Trump celebrated Kennedy's position on issues and his family background. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  His candidacy has inspired millions and millions of Americans, raised critical issues that have been too long ignored in this country. And brought together people from across the political spectrum in a positive campaign grounded in the American values of his father, Robert Kennedy, a great man, and his uncle, president John F. Kennedy. And I know that they are looking down right now and they are very, very proud of Bobby. I'm proud of Bobby, you want to know the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In that same \"The New York Times\" poll, we saw Donald Trump at 42 percent and Kamala Harris at 45 percent. They believe they can get just a little bit of that 6 percent back could make the difference in the election in November which they believe will be decided by a razor thin margin -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, Arizona.

Thanks so much for being on with us again, Thomas. So I want to start with the new wrinkle to the race. RFK Jr. supporting Trump, the Harris camp is kind of downplaying the effect, as you'd expect. What effect do you think it might have on the campaign? THOMAS GIFT, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  Well, it's great to be with you, Kim, thanks so much for having me. Trump at various points has called RFK Jr. a Democratic plant, a liberal lunatic and the dumbest member of the Kennedy family. But it was really a love fest between them last night at this event in Arizona. Still, it's unclear to me that Kennedy is dropping out is going to have a huge impact on the race. I think different polls seem to disagree about whether Kennedy was siphoning off more votes from Harris or Trump. And there's also some evidence that Kennedy backers are less likely to vote overall. Plus, I think Kennedy's poll numbers have really dropped in recent months. Earlier this year, some polls had him at around 15 percent or so. More recent numbers seem like 5 percent to 6 percent. There something to be said about breaking up the two two-party monopoly but you would have thought that, this year of any year, a third-party candidate would have been able to break through. But RFK Jr. really didn't gain momentum. There was no third party candidate from No Labels. I'm not sure that this is going to have a huge impact on the race at this point.",

I think the big question now is how Harris is going to respond in some more unscripted setting. She's been criticized by Republicans for not doing any press conferences. She's been criticized for not doing any sitdown Q&amp;As with journalists. Eventually, she's going to have to get more specific. And I think that that time it's now.

But you have to raise money in order to do so, in order to keep pace with your opponent. Once Kamala Harris took the torch from Biden, there's a whole lot of pent-up supply from would-be donors that flowed into her campaign. She set some single day records, which has been huge.

Same story when it came to all of these state referenda. So Trump is in somewhat of a difficult position because he needs to court the evangelical base. He needs to make sure that he's appealing to Republicans, Christian Republicans. But at the same time, he is looking at the same polling data that everyone else is looking at.

The U.S. is also imposing new sanctions on about 400 people and entities worldwide that are allegedly helping Russia's war machine. Now this is happening as Russia's president Vladimir Putin suffers the humiliation of Kyiv's cross-border incursion, now underway for more than two weeks. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, he's labeled Ukraine a Western puppet, which is embroiled in an existential struggle with Russia and must be, in his words, denazified.

That the - -like it's been building up to this point that everyone in the face of an invasion, of a foreign invasion, everyone must mobilize. But it doesn't -- it's not really happening. Because if you look at the TV ratings, the propaganda, talk shows are dropping in popularity, where people are actually seeking out just regular mild entertainment, just comedy and popular series, not the endless war imagery. And it's just, it doesn't seem like -- look, it's been going on for almost three weeks now, a foreign invasion on Russia soil. There is like, I'm not seeing any kind of wave of patriotic fervor sweeping over Russia. People, you know, people are actually queuing to volunteer, to enlist in office to offices to volunteer to fight off an invasion on the country. And everybody just seems to be just shrugging it off really. It's really, it's really bizarre. I mean, there's no other way to describe it because that's the way. It's because it's hard to -- it's been a national policy of demobilizing people, of convincing them that they shouldn't be involved in anything, that they should mind their own business. And the government will -- and the Kremlin will take care of the rest. And now, when they actually need people to mobilize, to defend over an invasion, it's not happening.

Monster-size interest rate hikes trying to get inflation back down and today, Jerome Powell, he all but declared victory in battle, saying he is more confident that inflation is going back to where it belongs, back to 2 percent. And the mission, he's saying, has shifted. It shifted from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. And that means a different strategy. Instead of raising interest rates, the Fed is going to be cutting them. Take a listen to what Powell said at Jackson Hole. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it's in the final meeting before the election. Still a lot of debate over just how big of a cut this will be.But another one of the big questions outstanding is whether or not they're going to be able to pull off a soft landing. And listen, Powell, he struck a cautiously optimistic tone on that front. He said that there's, quote, \"good reason\" to believe that the economy will get back to 2 percent while maintaining a strong jobs market. So this would essentially be the soft landing that we've all been hoping for that for a long time, looked very unlikely. Powell said that they are not looking to see any more weakness in the jobs market. And he suggested they're going to be prepared to come to the rescue. If they do see more weakness by cutting interest rates even further -- back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That changes the dynamic a lot in terms of how they go forward with this investigation. It puts a spotlight on the captain and the crew. Now the questions being asked to the prosecutor are basically, are they going to arrest the captain and things like that? They haven't -- they haven't confirmed that they will be doing that so far there but the fact that the investigation is now manslaughter really, really does change the dynamic of things. They also said that they'll have to raise the wreck, which seems obvious in a situation like this. But it will be a multimillion dollar endeavor. And at the press conference, a prosecutor said that that cost will fall on the owner of the ship, which is the family of Mike Lynch. And so that that they are expecting that to happen in the next couple of months, have got to secure it before they raise it and that they will only then be able to retrieve the version of the black box, which they said is inside that yacht, because it's just too dangerous for those divers to go down and try to retrieve that. Going forward, this is now a manslaughter investigation into the deaths of these seven people.",
