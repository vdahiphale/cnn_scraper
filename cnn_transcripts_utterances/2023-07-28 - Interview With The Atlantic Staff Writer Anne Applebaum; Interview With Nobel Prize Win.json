I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ukraine is continuing to make gains in the south after its counteroffensive appears to be ramping up. This as Vladimir Putin post African leaders at the summit in St. Petersburg. The Russian president is painting his country as a \"reliable food supplier to Africa.\" Yet, he pulled out of that crucial grain deal and continues to attack the important port city of Odessa. At the summit, Putin also said that he is \"carefully considering a peace plan proposed by African leaders. Meanwhile, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un is hosting Russia's defense chief in Pyongyang in a further the show of support. So, what might these alliances that Putin forging mean for the war? Anne Applebaum is a historian and staff writer at \"The Atlantic.\" She has written extensively on the rise of authoritarianism, and she joins me now from Warsaw. Anne, it's always great to have you on the show. So, let's talk about this Africa summit that is just wrapped up in St. Petersburg. 17 African leaders attended it compared with 43 in 2019, and they issued a few joint statements, one of unity, I'll read that you, Russia and African countries agreed to pursue compensation for colonialism, return of cultural affects, et cetera. But then, the chair of the African Union goes on to say, Putin's graine offer is not sufficient. Obviously, this grain offer, after he pulled out of the grain deal with Ukraine, saying that Russia alone can supplement grain to African countries. The chair says a cease fire is needed and then, went on to say, Putin has shown readiness to negotiate with Ukraine and now the \"other side needs to be persuaded.\" What should be read into this summit, its outcome, and Russia's continued influence in Africa?",

The biggest takeaway, it appears for many, including myself is the photo of the former head, the current head, I don't know whathis role is right now, of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. We do know that he seems to be alive and well thus far in St. Petersburg. And there you see him standing with a Central African Republic representative. You talk about the role and the relationship between Wagner and these African countries.

Wagner is Russia's foreign policy in Africa. Wagner is also probably the source of a lot of money for Putin cronies. It is not so easy to just cut him off or get rid of him. And that, you know, they created him over many years as a kind of, as I say, a sort of alternate form of foreign policy. You know, he does the dirty work in Africa. He supports dictatorships, he sends in mercenaries to help people out. And at the same time, he controls supposedly a gold mines and other kinds of natural resources and exploits them, and then that money goes back to Moscow. And just eliminating that turned out to be too difficult, even when -- even after he ran that extraordinary rebellion. And so, I think what we are seeing is, again, the development -- with the visible, I should say, development of cracks within the Russian leadership, I mean, there were probably already there, we just weren't able to see them quite so clearly, you know, different people have different interests and they're beginning to compete with one another.",

Your recent piece on the rebellion argued that after spending years of cultivating public apathy, the Russian president found his people indifferent to his own faith.

So, they do it by admitting confusing and contracting propaganda, by discouraging people from forming any kind of independent groups or associations, you know, never mind politics or political parties. And then, when there was a real attack on the Russian state or on the Russian army, it meant that citizens were apathetic about that too. Even more strange was when Wagner and his men were in Rostov, which is the -- essentially, the military capital of the city from which the operations in Ukraine are being run, they -- passerby and people walking down the streets seem to welcome them. They brought them bottles of water and ice cream and, you know, all kinds of other things. You know, and it's -- it was almost as if, you know, finally there were politics to follow. There was an interesting -- someone interesting to listen to who is saying something a little bit different and they seem to almost, you know, interested in intrigued by it.

But I was really struck, and it's almost comical if this wasn't a reality, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said today on RT (ph), \"The Ukrainians hate and are very aggressive towards Putin exactly because they want him to be president.\" So, we can question, I think, how Russians feel about Vladimir Putin.

The guidelines talk about entrenchment of monopoly power, recognizing that sometimes a firm that has a really dominant position can acquire a competitive threat. All of those are ways in which competition presents itself. So, when we started writing these guidelines, we had an important question. The important question is, how does competition in this market present itself? And does this merger threaten that competition? And that question is going to be different for every industry, it's going to be different for every merger. But we have to start with the facts. We have to start with the deep, sophisticated understanding of how competition works. And it works differently than it did 50 years ago. Phones don't have rotors. Documents are not stored in fall cabinets. And with the exception of my dad at the time, people don't stop and ask the gas station for directions.

And so, we, at this moment, have an even more important job to do to be vigorously enforcing the anti-trust laws, protecting fair competition, preserving open markets. Because Congress told us that we have a preference for competition over consolidation, competition benefits consumers through providing better quality products, lower prices, it can benefit workers by providing them more options and opportunities and better wages.

The idea that something could come along and just disrupt the operating system and lead to a new generation of technologies that can provide benefits that we couldn't even imagine at the time. And so, the Justice Department brought a case to protect those new innovations and give them the opportunity to reach consumers, to reach entrepreneurs, to reach businesses.

And that's the beauty of our anti-trust laws, is that they establish legal principles about appropriate ways to be competing and it's up to us as enforcers to be applying those principles in all sorts of context. So, for example, last year, the Federal Trade Commission sued two pesticide manufactures because they were engaging in this pay to block schemes that were blocking generic producers from the market. And as a result of that, farmers had to pay billions of dollars more than they would have, and we as the food paying public also ended up paying for those practices. So, we can see how when you have dominant firms that are engaging in practices that are designed to block out competition that can have very negative effects, and you can see that in digital markets, you can see that in agriculture markets.

And so, if consumers like your product, you're actually able to succeed in the marketplace, we at the FTC here routinely form businesses, including independent pharmacists, independent grocers, people across sectors who come to us and tell us that for them as businesses it becomes very difficult to compete if they are getting muscled out of the market by monopolists who might be engaging in anticompetitive practices. And so, we make a very concerted efforts to be hearing from businesses because we understand that robust anti-trust enforcement is really the way that we're going to see the type of competition and the type of innovation that for decades has kept America at the forefront and delivered significant innovation.

This is an exercise in law enforcement, your statues is written by Congress, and for good reason, because competition and democracy, competition and freedom, competition and economic liberty all go hand in hand, and we're going to enforce the law as written, as interpreted by courts, when supported by the facts in order to vindicate those interest for the public.",

So, these are very similar arguments that we are being made during the Cold War, where there was pressure on anti-trust enforcers to hold back and protect domestic monopolies. And at that moment, America wisely made the choice to trust our system of free enterprise and competitive markets and trust that that type of open competitive system would out innovate a centralized system of state backed monopolies. And that's exactly what we saw. In the decades since, we have seen enormous innovation, we've seen American companies really at the forefront globally. And so, I take a lot of guidance from that history where when we have trusted in our open competitive markets, that is really been what's best positioned to us to compete globally, given just to the ingenuity and innovation that American businesses have been able to provide.",

But in order to do that, we have to make sure that we understand A.I. at a level of sophistication. And so, just as in the '80s, the anti-trust agencies rightly equipped themselves with some of the most talented economists so that we can understand markets better, and we continue to do that until this day, we need to make sure that we're also bringing the technological expertise to understand these technologies with greater sophistication. And we're doing that by hiring data scientists, A.I. experts. But let me also say, one of the big importance changes with A.I. is that data is no longer a byproduct of the technology, it is the product of the technology. And so, we are in a world where artificial intelligence lives and breathes massive amounts of data. And so, to the extent that markets are not contestable and competitive across the economy, including in health care, including in energy and agriculture, the A.I. technologies that are going to be built are going to tip only to the firms that have the greatest amount of data and information. So, it is extremely important that in order to usher in a competitive and vibrant revolution of new technologies for A.I. that our markets are competitive and access the data and information is something that is accessible broadly and that we don't just allow the small number of players with the most data to tip and win those markets uncontested.",

You know, Walter, we want to make sure that everybody is clear that the anti-trust laws entirely apply, even in the context involving A.I. I think sometimes we hear arguments that some of these technologies are emerging in some type of regulatory vacuum, and we think it is extraordinarily important that the market knows that existing laws prohibiting collusion still apply, existing laws prohibiting discrimination apply, existing laws prohibiting fraud apply. And so, there is no way A.I. exemption from the existing laws on the books.
