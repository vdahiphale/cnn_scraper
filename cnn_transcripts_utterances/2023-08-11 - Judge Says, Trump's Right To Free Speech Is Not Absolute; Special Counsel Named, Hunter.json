      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone, I'm Laura Coates, and thank you so much for joining me this Friday evening.Look, tonight, Donald Trump is on some thin ice. In the first hearing with the judge in his, well, third indictment, the one over election interference, she warned the former president about his rhetoric and his agreement, by the way, not to intimidate witnesses in order to stay a free man. But she also favored some of the arguments by his attorneys, for example, on whether evidence can be discussed publicly. More on that whole dramatic courtroom scene in just a moment. But, first, Hunter Biden, he's likely going to trial. Attorney General Merrick Garland effectively appointed a special counsel in the guns and taxes investigation of the president's son. Now, you'll recall there was a plea deal, and it also recently broke down. And we've talked about the questions surrounding how that could have happened, even a judge that questioned the terms of the agreement with the DOJ. But before we get to all of that analysis, you're probably thinking, wait a second, Laura, another special counsel? Yes. This would be the third all at once for the first time in history. And I want to remind everyone for a second, what the threshold is, to get to a special counsel. It's not run on the mill. It's not an everyday, even every administration thing. Among the grounds, number one, is it warranted? Is the investigation itself worthy enough to have something so deliberate and extreme? Is there a conflict of interest, the second point of inquiry? And also, does the public have a special interest in knowing, or something more? So, when those three criteria are all around the collision course, then meet, well, then you have the special counsel. But the real question that everyone's asking is, why exactly did Merrick Garland decide to do this now? And maybe more importantly, since he was involved in the questionable plea agreement and offer that imploded, why did David Weiss ask for this now? It's a huge question everyone is asking at this moment in time. I want to go to CNN's Political Correspondent Sara Murray, to walk us through the special counsel now appointed to investigate Hunter Biden. And the face will be familiar because the name is the same. But, Sara, how did it get to this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, it really is that spectacular implosion you were talking about of the hunter Biden plea deal. Remember, he walked into court a few weeks ago ready to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and take a diversion program on a gun charge. But there was this disagreement over what kind of immunity Hunter Biden was actually getting as part of this deal.And we learned that behind the scenes, that disagreement was not resolved between Hunter Biden's team and David Weiss. And David Weiss decided, look, we're going to move ahead, we are going to go to trial. He went to Attorney General Merrick Garland and sought this special counsel status. So, essentially, he can bring charges in other jurisdictions. He can bring charges in Washington, D.C. or California, something that he would have had to get partners to do as the U.S. attorney in Delaware. Of course, that doesn't answer all of the questions about why we are in this special counsel situation. Merrick Garland said in his remarks today that these are extraordinary circumstances, as they certainly are when the sitting president's son is being investigated. But, again, we've heard from whistleblowers who have questioned whether there was political favoritism in this case. And a lot of what we've heard today from Merrick Garland and David Weiss does not answer many of the questions about why it took to this point for Weiss to be named a special counsel and whether this is simply did bringing charges against Hunter Biden and moving to trial in different jurisdictions or whether there's more that David Weiss wants to investigate.",

First of all, if you were Hunter Biden, you're looking at your attorneys and probably saying to yourself, what happened from the time that we thought we had a plea deal, everything signed, sealed, delivered, it was mine, to this point in time, and now you've got the special counsel? The big question everyone is asking, of course, is, why do you think this happened now?

Because, look, that might be very well the case, and I have no reason to say it's not, but there's a simple way to indicate that independence, and that's designating him as a special counsel. And one of the criteria you mentioned is, is there a conflict of interest? Well, what more a conflict of interest could you have than when the son of the president is being investigated? So, I think it is long overdue. I think it's a good move. I think it deflects a little bit of the criticism, but I'm not sure it really makes a difference at this point.

But listen to what Hunter Biden's attorneys had to say earlier on our airwaves about this idea of, I wonder if something else is coming into play. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY:  After five years of what has to be one of the most thorough investigations that office has ever done, started by a Republican attorney general, given to a Republican U.S. attorney, using an experienced career set of prosecutors thought that the only charges that were appropriate would be two misdemeanor failure to file charges and a diverted gun charge for the 11 days that Hunter possessed a gun. And that was after five years of painstaking investigation. So, whatever his title is and whatever happens next, we're confident that that should be the same conclusion. And if it's not, then something other than the facts and the law has come into play. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Trump can't share or post any of it.

And I have to say, I thought what the judge did was quite clever, actually, because I think if she has suggested that there would be a gag order coming or that she would revoke or impose harsher conditions on him, that would have caused uproar.

We've never been in greater need of an economic revival and truly a heartfelt spiritual revival in our country than we do right now. We are so divided. We've never been more divided in my lifetime. And I'm speaking about four key issues that are really resonating with Iowans, people in New Hampshire (inaudible) solutions. You know, we've had failed messages out there for so long (inaudible). And America wants to see us come back together to solve our biggest problems, whether that be our budget or whether that be urban America and renewal education or now today the border, all the problems that we're having with immigration and the crisis at the border. We're coming up with real solutions that matter to everyone, whether you're independent, Republican or Democrat, and that's where we're leading today and it's resonating.",

Two to 300 young people are dying a day. And this is what I'm telling America. It's time that Republicans and Democrats get together now and fix this border crisis issue once and for all.We launched a bipartisan thought process two months ago when we launched and then I found Congresswoman Maria Salazar's Dignity Act which is an incredible act and we are supporting it 100 percent and here's why because it secures the border fully from California to Texas. It allows us to have so many great things that Republicans and Democrats need but also treats with compassion the people that have come across our border 20 and 30 years ago, people that have been working here and provides a workforce solution that truly meets the work needs of our country and treats them with dignity. It's not amnesty, but it allows us to meet the needs of our country. It's time that we stop kicking the can. We actually unite our country and solve this big problem together, and that's what I'm supporting right now.",
