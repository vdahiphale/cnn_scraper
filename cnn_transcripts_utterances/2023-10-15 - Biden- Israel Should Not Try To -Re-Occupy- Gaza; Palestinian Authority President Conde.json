So in 2003 while this these hostages weren't taken before the ground war in Iraq started, if you recall, the 507 maintenance company was ambushed based on some navigation areas and Nasri and as a result, several words were taken.And, you know, during that operation, I could see potential hostage rescue situations playing out similar to what happened there. You had a Marine Expeditionary Brigade operating and, you know, complex terrain, you actually had a Iraqi civilian that, you know, provided the intelligence to find private lands at that time.

So I can see that happen in this situation, Anderson, where we may not have actual intelligence, the Israelis may not before ground operations start, but we may be also very reliant on the, frankly, the sympathy of the Palestinian populace.

They were aware that there were food shortages, that there were water shortages. And really what was top of mind as it came to this situation was that humanitarian corridor and having conversations with regional partners to make sure that Palestinians and Palestinian Americans could leave Gaza into Egypt.Now, those conversations are very much still in play, and ongoing as with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in the region and meeting directly with his counterparts. But when national security officials are talking about the situation here, it is clear to them that this is a crisis and that they do not want to see the loss of innocent life of innocent civilians, as Israel starts to ramp up to move in to the region.",

When they actually -- if they actually go in, if Israel does go into Gaza, which is obviously what's anticipated, we keep talking about this tunnel system that Hamas operates out of. That's not for the civilians, but is underneath Gaza that they use, and appears to be quite sophisticated.I mean, if you're the Israeli Defense Forces, and you're preparing to go when, what are the questions about how that system operates, how Hamas uses that, that factors into what they are going to do?",

And what you're talking about is tunnels and shafts to you have to include the shafts coming out of building, even high rise apartments, where you can get underground. And it isn't just something that's just right underground, these are very deep, to prevent them from being bombed and exploded and caving in.But they are also complex. It literally is a city of roads underneath the ground or a city of trails, rather. So they can move around in those. And not only that, Kaitlin, but -- but the U.S. Military trained soldiers to go into caves in Afghanistan and Iraq. And what we found, and it's something that dates back in Military history, if you're a defender inside of a cave or a tunnel, you have a huge advantage over the attacker, because they have to come to you. They're going down different shafts, different corridors. And if you have good vision devices, or you know when to set up an ambush inside a cave, it could take 10 -- we there was one instance in a training environment where 100 soldiers could not dislodge five soldiers inside of a cave complex. The same thing applies inside of a tunnel. Snipers can be in there, the Hamas can also take their prisoners, their hostages there and put them in a strong point defense. They can move them around when they see the Israelis coming. So this adds a whole another condition of the battlefield, which is -- is very difficult, and it's only been improved over the last decade by Hamas.",

These are the same things. And you're showing pictures now of the simplistic -- simplicity of the tunnels.But what you don't see in some of those, are the curves and the angles and the way you can set up defensive positions and the power generation.

Or are they just someone that's there? Are they a hostage? Is it a civilian just trying to get to a new location? These are the kinds of things that are very difficult.I heard the Minister of Defense of Israel the other day, saying that the Israeli for -- saying today that the Israeli forces are really well trained, and they will only kill Hamas. You know, that's a great thing for someone in an office to save, but I'm telling you on a battlefield, when you have new soldiers, newly mobilized soldiers, who have not seen combat before, and who are frightened and somewhat scared of what's going to happen, they're going to shoot at anything that moves.
