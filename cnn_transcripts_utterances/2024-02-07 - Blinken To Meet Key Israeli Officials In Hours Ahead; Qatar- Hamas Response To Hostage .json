The Qataris, who were the key interlocutors here, also described it as positive. But, they also indicated it wasn't a sort of straight up and down yes/no answer to the proposal that had been given over a week ago.And just going into late Tuesday, the State Department was saying the ball was in Hamas' court to give their response. That response, the timing of it, is interesting, because it happened only just before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Doha. So, really not giving him much time to study it before he gets into meetings here in Tel Aviv on Wednesday with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other Israeli government officials. We know that Mossad here is already in possession of the counterproposal. They're looking at it. Hamas themselves have said that they have responded in a positive way to the proposal that they receive, but their language in their statement, which doesn't detail what's in their counterproposal, but their language still indicates they want this permanent ceasefire, which for the Israeli government has been a no go. What was on the table was a ceasefire of perhaps around about six weeks. That could then lead to a longer cessation of hostilities. Hamas also indicating that they want all their prisoners released. So, they want a full exchange of prisoners. That also has been a no go for the Israeli government who don't want to hand back all the Hamas prisoners who are in their jail. So, is there too much daylight between the two sides here? Certainly. Wednesday is going to be a very busy day here for the Secretary of State with all his meetings with Israeli officials to try to close some of the gaps. The positions, as far as we know, are still a part. It's going to take some maximum diplomacy to close it, and it's not clear that that's going to happen in the short term.

They reject Israel's existence. Likewise, no Israeli government, no Israeli citizens would trust a Palestinian state that is run by Hamas, or even the Palestinian Authority, which has shown itself weak and incompetent as compared with Hamas. If there was a democracy in Gaza, they would elect Hamas again. So, there is no way that I see a two-state solution is actually possible going forward.I think we need to really be thinking outside the box here of what are the other types of solutions, maybe even ones that put aside concepts of political recognition and focus instead on economic development, on enfranchisement of a population, on demilitarization.

First, a blatant political stunt backfired when Republicans fell short by two votes to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. House Speaker Mike Johnson says they will try again but only when they are certain they actually have the votes.An almost $18 billion standalone funding bill for Israel sponsored by the Republicans also failed. Right-wing Republicans forced the House Speaker to bring the bill up under a procedure which required a two thirds majority. Well, makers on both sides of the aisle opposed that measure. And a bipartisan deal on immigration and foreign aid is on track to fail a vote in the Senate Wednesday amid Republican infighting and because Donald Trump wants the bill dead. The bill includes $75 billion in aid to both Ukraine and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden had this warning for Republicans if the bill fails. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, to all your bullet points, I would add two others, the indications that the Republican National Committee Chair is going to be forced out very shortly, to be replaced by a Trump lawyer, and the resolution introduced by dozens of House Republicans indicating that Donald Trump did not participate or commit insurrection as President. And all of these stories today really are just telling us how profoundly under the hold of Donald Trump the Republican Party has fallen.I mean, I thought this deal in particular that unraveled in the Senate is remarkable. I've been covering immigration politics since the early 1990s, and the basic framework has always been that Democrats will agree to tougher enforcement at the border and in the interior in order to entice Republicans to agree in some pathway to legalization for some portion of the undocumented population. This was a deal in which Republicans got the enforcement they want without any immigration concessions on the other side. The only concession to Democratic priorities was funding Ukraine and Israel and traditionally for Republicans funding someone standing up to Russian aggression should not have been a concession, and yet that died because Trump wielded so more than any other single reason.",

This is -- it is immigration provisions, virtually an enforcement-only bill. It contains restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum at the border. It gives the President authority to completely shut down the border, which was an idea that was usually explosive as recently as Donald Trump's presidency to the point where he repeatedly threatened it but did not do it. And it provides enormous new resources for enforcement and adjudication, including speed -- accelerating the process by which people will have their asylum claims judged and removed from the country.On a substantive basis, it is essentially a list of Republican priorities on the immigration side. But, the view among House Republicans in particular was that there is no reason to make a deal. We think we're going to win in November and we can impose exactly what we want. Then the problem with that is, can you get 60 votes for these same ideas in the Senate if there is a Republican President demanding?

Bush, a Republican, and what we saw in 2013 again under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was a bipartisan coalition pass an immigration reform bill through the Senate that contained the kind of compromise that I talked before, legalization and return for tougher security as well as, I guess, worker program. Each time it passed with a bipartisan coalition, the filibuster proof majority in the Senate, including Mitch McConnell, by the way, the first time, and then the House Republicans refused to even consider it, both in 2006 and 2013.So, in that sense, what actually killed this bill as much as Trump's opposition and maybe this is just a reflection of Trump's opposition was the House Republicans saying they would not take it up. Senate Republicans saw no need to antagonize Trump to vote for something that was never going to even be considered in the House. I mean, that does fit with the historical pattern. But, as I said, this basically means that even if Trump is elected, his options on the border are going to be through executive authority, that are going to be -- executive actions are going to be challenged in court. Now, he has put forward some truly aggressive and militant ideas, including the largest deportation in American history, the establishment of internment camps and the use of military force against Mexico. But, this deal is, I believe, a better deal than he will be able to get even if Republicans have unified control simply because Democrats won't vote for anything like this with a Republican in the White House without some concessions on the other side that he is never going to make.",

We are not. But the feeling is there, and we have to improve that.

HANS-CHRISTOPH BERNDT, HEAD OF ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY, BRANDENBERG (through translator): It is not only legitimate, it is necessary to think about remigration. Since 2015, more than 10 million foreigners have entered the country, and a large proportion of them are not willing to integrate and live in German society but are instead building parallel worlds. The federal government is not putting the interests of the indigenous population first. SHUKLA (voice-over): In the real world, the report sparked waves of anti-AFD protests.
