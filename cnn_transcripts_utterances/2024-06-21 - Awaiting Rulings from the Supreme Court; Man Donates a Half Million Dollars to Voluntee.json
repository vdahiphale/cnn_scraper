New images show what's left after two wildfires burned up 23,000 acres of land, forcing 8,000 residents to evacuate and killed at least two people. FBI special agents will assist local, state, federal, and tribal partners in the investigation, and the Biden administration has approved an expedited major disaster declaration to help impacted communities.Also, two Disney employees who moves cross-country for a now shuttered project are suing. In 2021, former Disney CEO Bob Chapek moved 2,000 jobs from California to Florida. But two years later, when Bob Iger took over, the company canceled the billion-dollar office complex in Florida as it sparred with Governor Ron DeSantis. The two employees who brought the suit say Disney misrepresented the project and heavily implied anyone who didn't move would lose their jobs. Disney hasn't replied to our request for comment. North Korea, through a statement in state-run media, responded to recent balloon launches by South Korean activists. The statement criticized activists for disregarding warnings and warned of trouble and response without specifying what exactly that could mean. Now the activist group, Fighters for a Free North Korea sent 20 balloons loaded with thousands of anti-North Korean leaflets. This launch follows a previous one two weeks ago that led North Korea to retaliate by sending over 1,000 balloons filled with trash into South Korea.",

We're in probably the last - one of the last four days of the session, extending into next week and possibly into July 1st. And, you know, we've got cases that could affect the upcoming presidential election. One involves whether former President Donald Trump would be subject to criminal prosecution for election subversion from the last election in 2020. That's one of the cases that we're waiting for. We're also waiting to see what the justices say about whether several of the January 6th rioters who attacked the Capitol back in 2021 would be subject to charge that could mean up to 20 years in prison, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. And Donald - one of Donald Trump's four charges by special counsel Jack Smith, on behalf of the Justice Department, also involves obstruction of an official proceeding. So, the contours of that law will be decided by the justices. And then, of course, we're waiting for a major abortion case that the White House is sort of bracing to see what the justices say. There's a federal law that requires emergency room treatment across the country for any needy person, including a woman who might be suffering complications from a - from a pregnancy.

And Ukraine essentially had its hands tied behind its back, could not use U.S. weapons to strike Russia back right across that border. The U.S. lifted that policy, but said that it was really restricted to the - just that one area. Well, now we are learning that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said publicly that this policy actually expands to anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border where you - where Russia is firing into Ukraine and trying to take Ukrainian territory. According to U.S. officials, where Ukraine sees that Russia is using its territory to launch those attacks, then Ukraine can fire back. But still, it is really just limited to the border. The U.S. has made very clear that they don't want to see Ukraine using those long range ATACMS missiles to fire deep into Russian territory because that would mark a pretty significant escalation. And so while we have seen Ukraine use other kinds of weapons, not U.S. provided to strike deep into Russia, the U.S. is still saying, look, you cannot use the weapons that we give you to hit that far into the country.
