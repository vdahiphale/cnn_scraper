This is exclusive new reporting, so let's get right to CNN's Sara Murray. This is an attempt to break through a firewall of sorts Trump has used to avoid scrutiny of his own actions.",

The former president has cited executive privilege, attorney/client privilege in trying to bar a lot of these top witnesses from sharing with criminal investigators looking to the events surrounding January 6th from getting too close to conversations folks may have had with the former president, those in his inner circle. So, what we are seeing with the staffer by the Justice Department tocompel Pat Cipollone and Pat Philbin to testify again is try to get closer to the former president and that inner circle. So, that's a court battle that's playing out in secret. It's a sealed proceeding. We have seen the Justice Department have some success in piercing this sort of privilege shield with other witnesses, though. Sources have also told me and my colleagues, Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz, that two top aides of former Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Short and Greg Jacob, have already gone in and testified before a grand jury. They were facing similar privilege fights, and a judge ruled they had to go back and they had to answer more questions. So this is really important for the Justice Department's investigation into January 6th. We, of course, reached out to a Trump spokesperson for comment. He slammed the weaponized Justice Department and called all the investigations surrounding the former president witch-hunts.",

In Pennsylvania, Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz face out in their one and only debate in this important contest that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. Fetterman is hoping to convince voters he is healthy enough to serve after suffering a stroke earlier this year. And we'll see if the celebrity TV career of Mehmet Oz will help him in his first-ever general election debate. And in New York, incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul will square off against Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin in a surprisingly tight race where crime has become a central issue. New polls show the race is tightening in a state where Democrats have dominated statewide races for some time. Athena Jones is covering that New York matchup. Kyung Lah is in Arizona, where there are new allegations of voter intimidation. But, first, to CNN's Jeff Zeleny at the Pennsylvania debate site in Harrisburg. And, Jeff, the Republican Senate super PAC is planning to make a $6 million buy, hence, my bad bionic man joke, a $6 million buy there to boost Mehmet Oz ahead of this crucial debate.",

They do believe that Pennsylvania offers a good opportunity, that Dr. Mehmet oz has been gradually climbing throughout the last several weeks and months and now is within striking distance of John Fetterman.Of course, all of that dynamic is coming onto the stage where for an hour this evening these two men, John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz, will come face-to-face for the first time. The last several months they've been going after each other quite aggressively from a long distance range, but doesn't all those issues that have been playing out will be front and center, crime, the economy, inflation, abortion rights. So it sounds like a typical debate but this is anything but a typical debate. Of course, John Fetterman has been recovering from a stroke that slowed his candidacy earlier this summer. Tonight there will be closed captions, largely like the ones you see on your television screen, but the candidate will be relying on those to understand the question and make sure he can give the proper answer. We will see how Dr. Oz responds to that. He made his name and fame as a television doctor. The debate stage an entirely different thing. But I'm told by advisers to the Oz campaign that he wants to keep it on issues and they want to show differences on crime, the Biden agenda, et cetera. So, the TV stage behind me here, the TV studio, the two men are going to be in there alone without an audience, just with two moderators and two large television screens with the closed captions. So certainly the most interesting debate we've seen in this entire mid-term election cycle. We'll see if it changes the dynamics of this race -- John.",

It's something that's been around for quite some time.

There was that video you just showed, John, of those two people who were standing there in the back of a pickup truck armed and watching in tactical gear and masks.
