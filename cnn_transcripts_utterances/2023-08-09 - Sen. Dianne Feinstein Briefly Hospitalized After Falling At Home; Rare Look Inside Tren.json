      "sentences": "Yes. Senator Dianne Feinstein suffered a minor fall yesterday in her home. And this is what the statement her office sent out and is telling us today. It says Senator Feinstein briefly went to the hospital yesterday afternoon as a precaution after a minor fall in her home. All of her scans were clear, and she returned home. So, she is no longer in the hospital, John, I think it's important to point that out.But this comes as there have been a series of barrage of questions about Senator Dianne Feinstein's health on Capitol Hill. Remember, she was hospitalized back in February because of complications from shingles. She was then away from the Senate for several months. And when she returned, there were some Democrats who called for her to resign. We should also note that she has suffered a few moments of confusion here on Capitol Hill, including one back in July, right before lawmakers left for a month-long August recess in which she was part of the Defense Appropriations markup. And they were voting to pass that bill. And she thought that they were perhaps discussing more why they supported the bill. She started to read a statement. Her aide told her just to vote, aye. And then you can hear Patty Murray, who's the chairwoman, also telling her just vote aye, which she did a few minutes later. At that time, her office said it was a confusing situation. It was a hectic appropriations hearing. And she just got confused. But obviously, there had been a lot of eyes on Senator Dianne Feinstein's health here on Capitol Hill. She is 90 years old, the oldest member of the U.S. Senate. But obviously, she is now back home after suffering a minor fall yesterday, John.",

As well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes the largest-ever investment in combating climate change. The president's going to do this at a groundbreaking of a wind tower manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. And he's going to pitch it as part of this -- these billions of dollars of investments that we're seeing around the country in manufacturing as well as in the clean energy space.Now, this is part of a broader effort that the president is undertaking during this three-state swing to talk about what he has accomplished in terms of his legislative record and on the economy and climate. Specifically, the president this morning -- an interview aired this morning on The Weather Channel in which the president was doing that very sales job on climate change. Specifically talking about the $369 billion in investments in fighting climate change in the Inflation Reduction Act, talking about his efforts to spur on electric vehicles. But in doing that sales pitch, the president also got a bit ahead of himself. Claiming that he had declared a national emergency, which he has not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that declaration is a formal step that the president could take that climate activists say would unlock sweeping authorities.[11:35:03] Including being able to restrict certain exports of crude oil outside the country. Would also be allowed the president to stop some oil and gas drilling on federal lands. So, that is a step that he has not taken the climate activists would like to see him take. Now, beyond that, of course, the reason why the president is talking up his actions on climate, we know that climate is a motivating issue for young voters in particular heading into the presidential election. And the president very much trying to shore up the various coalitions who support and whose turnout he's going to need if he's going to recapture the presidency next year. Kate.",

They stunk, but now they're good. And that should make Baltimore fans and Baltimore owners happy.But Reportedly, the owners were not happy to be reminded about past troubles and that led to Brown's absence and the Free Kevin Brown chants. So, congratulations to the Orioles owners for turning a successful, uplifting season into a story about rich owners making apparently capricious decisions censoring speech. Way to go. Brown will reportedly be back in the booth on Friday. It really will be interesting to see if the ownership here apologizes. So, one ticket and one big jackpot. $1.58 billion. That's one person who won Mega Millions which means that millions and millions of people did not win. If you happen to buy a ticket in Neptune Beach, Florida, maybe you're smiling today.
