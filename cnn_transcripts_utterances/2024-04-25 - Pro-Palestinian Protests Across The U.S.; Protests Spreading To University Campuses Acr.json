A lot of them students, some of them people from outside who came to join this protest over what's happening in Gaza and Israel. The arrest themselves were actually peaceful. The police gave notice.They told people who had occupied Alumni Park that if they didn't leave they would be arrested and liable for criminal trespass. The police then, phalanxes of police came across three sides of the square leaving one open for people to leave. Organizers then went around, all the people who were staying arms locked waiting to be arrested. They were given the number of illegal organizations that was written in a Sharpie on their arms. Phones were taken away from them and they stood arms locked ready to be arrested now. This all began 4:30 in the morning when people began occupying Alumni Park. They put up tents, the college said you can't have tents so they took them down. And then the protesters said, you know, the university is being a bit nitpicky here. They're telling us take their banners down, so they put the tents back up. And then university safety officers tried to take those tents away and it got very tense. A lot of cussing and it got physical. There was scuffles. One person was arrested taken into a squad car. The crowd of protesters surrounded that squad car and would not let it leave. Chanting let him go, let him go. And eventually the police did let him go. The LAPD decided that it wasn't really worth holding this person on a minor charge for the chaos that it was creating. Once that person was released the temperature dropped way, way down. But during the day the crowd built and built. Chanting, speaking the college closed, all the college gates. You could only get in with a college I.D. as I say. There were people from outside the university coming to join the protest. But they didn't manage to contain it. It got a little bit out of hand. That's when the warning was given 10 minutes to clear the area. Then those phalanxes of police came in. Kept the other protesters back and then a group came in and carried out the arrests. All the while the protesters shouting shame on you, shame on you at the police. As I say, the last of those arrested being processed right now. Nick Watt, CNN on the USC campus in Los Angeles.

But, you know, it needs to be said that this should have come many, many months ago because in the meantime, the Russians have been able to dig in with trenches, with barriers to Ukraine and forces. They've also been able to position more men there. And they've also been able to stockpile more missiles. One final thought, if I can on that particular one, you know, I think that delay, which is very costly to Ukraine in terms of human lives and damage to infrastructure.

One of the key energy providers in Ukraine has -- had lost 100 percent of their generation capacity.And where I live, one of the two ports -- two big ports in Odesa was struck by Russian forces just a few days ago. And, you know, again, it boggles the mind because people should be considering this infrastructure, the ports of Odesa as a critical component of the global food supply chain.

And it does look like, Anna, that that could include, for example, selling off frozen Russian assets.But it's also giving a push to, for example, in Europe where there is, you know, we have to admit sum position to aid to Ukraine. For example, releasing the millions and millions of interest accumulated from frozen Russian sovereign assets and Belgian bank accounts and giving that to Ukraine. So, a lot of thinking going on on how amidst this position, if we want to call it that, in the various democracies that, you know, elected officials can get more money to Ukraine. Because if they don't, it's going to become a lot more expensive. Mr. Putin will not stop at Ukraine.

(Inaudible) 1864 during the American Civil War era, although it was revived earlier this month by a state Supreme Court decision. The Arizona High Court concluded that because there is no longer a federal constitutional right to the procedure, the 1864 ban is enforceable.

      "sentences": "Anna, that's right. The important thing seems to be both sides, the world's two superpowers are talking with regularity at all levels of the government after years of diplomatic deep freeze, which of course was not conducive to either bilateral relations or global stability.Now, I just came back from the eastern port city of Qingdao, where China actually hosted International Naval Symposium. It was interesting and reassuring to see the Pentagon sending its new Head of the U.S.-Pacific Fleet just a few weeks after they sent its newest missile launch system to the Philippines. So, the message here from both sides seems to be let us keep talking despite that growing list of grievances and complaints against each other. As you mentioned, topping Secretary Blinken's agenda is this issue of Beijing's continued support for Russia's defense -- industrial defense complex. That is why Russia has been able to continue its brutal war against Ukraine. Now, this is something American officials have been increasingly vocal about in recent weeks, saying there would be serious consequences for Chinese entities if they continue to provide Russia with not just technologies and tools, but also financial support. So, it is interesting to see what kind of potential sanctions will be levied against these entities. Taiwan, as you mentioned, another hot button issue, especially we are less than a month away from the island democracy swearing its new president, again, from the independence leaning party. Now, interestingly in that massive foreign aid package just signed into law by President Biden, there was actually more than $8 billion set aside for Taiwan and other U.S. allies in this region. But so far, to all these issues, Beijing's responses have been relatively muted, perhaps because Blinken is actually here. They are expected to talk about all of these thorny issues behind closed doors where Chinese officials have plenty to push back on as well, especially the economic fronts where they have been increasingly complaining about U.S. crackdown targeting China, not just the investigations, but also of course, these very stringent export controls. So, the key here is that they are having low expectations, but they are still talking. But whether or not they are only talking past each other or they can have some sort of meaningful dialog, of course, is something remains to be seen, Anna.",

They are made of iron sheets. They are very easily swept away when there is flooding, like what was experienced.
