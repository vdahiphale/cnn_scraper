They opted not to. They're going to hear arguments. It's not expected he's going to win on the merits, but that's helping him with delay.

Andrew Day (ph) told us at the time there were seven people inside this Taco Bell, which is now completely leveled. And if you can have the camera pan over here, I'll show you exactly where he was when this tornado hit. So, here, Jim is -- you know, the brick flooring here of the Taco Bell, pretty much the only thing that is left unscathed. Andrew Day (ph), Jim, was right here when this tornado hit. He hid in a cooler. He was in there with his manager. The building started shaking. The door started shaking. His coworkers were screaming and he just told them calm down. Hold on. And he said it lasted for about five seconds. The door shook so rapidly. The storm so powerful that it pushed Andrew Day (ph) from this side of the Taco Bell all the way over to, basically, where that red car is. So, all the way across the restaurant, Jim. It -- this storm was so powerful, but fortunately it went through quickly. He got out alive. Everybody he was with got out alive. That's the good news here in Winchester, where we know that there were at least 38 people injured. Now, it is time for cleanup. This is a massive effort.
