Syria's new government and its uncertain future, to say the least, are the focus of urgent talks today involving the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. A short while ago, he wrapped up his meeting with the Turkish President Erdogan after sitting down as well with Jordan's King Abdullah and other top officials earlier today. This morning, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to discuss not only events in the region, but also the possibility of securing a hostage deal for Gaza. CNN's MJ Lee joins me now to discuss. I want to get to the hostage deal to see where that stands, but before just about the enormous change were witnessing in Syria here. Is the White House saying that U.S. officials have made contact with rebel leaders there, the HTS group. And do they believe that this is a group they can work with?",

I mean, there's no specific example that U.S. officials have offered of there being direct communication between U.S. officials and this group, but they've made pretty clear that they have various ways of being in touch with any of these groups.So whether that is direct or indirect, obviously, you mentioned Secretary of State Antony Blinken being in the region, and really the purpose of this trip is to oversee and sort of take stock of what is happening in Syria and the communication that needs to continue happening between the U.S. and its regional allies, as they are hoping that the Syrian people will be able to successfully stand up a Syrian government, that the people have actually chosen. I mean, I think that's a big question mark, whether that is actually possible. And even someone like Blinken doesn't know exactly how this will all fare out.",

We feel as optimistic as one can feel. We feel like things are close, and then everything had fallen apart. I mean, so many times before. I do think, though, the fact that this is now not just about sort of the politics of getting this war ended, this was a big deal, obviously, in the election and particularly when President Biden was still a candidate. I think now the bigger question is sort of the legacy of it all and what he wants, sort of his foreign policy legacy to be as far as the entire region is concerned. And U.S. officials are pointing to some of the other big shifts that we have seen in the Middle East, the fall of the Assad regime, that we were just talking about this ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah across the Lebanon border. I mean, these are all things that they would point to, not to mention the weakening of Iran's capabilities. They are pointing to those things to say and suggest that perhaps Hamas might be in a different place, might feel like they have to strike a deal. They just don't know whether they will. SCIUTTO:  And that's a fact. I mean, listen, Hamas has backers, right? They've been weakened. Iran -- Iran in particular.

The Assad regime clearly was using it to lessen the pressure on it, perhaps remove some sanctions, and now it's gone.So there is an active search for him by both the new government as well as intermediaries on behalf of the United States government.

And therefore, in terms of what should the Biden administration, certainly the next one do is they got to engage. You're seeing the Turks are on the ground. The Arab countries have maintained their embassies. Some are going to reopen them. I hear some Europeans are engaging directly with the new transition government, and the U.S. should do the same to figure out for itself whether to trust what's happening, but obviously to verify it.

That's been a very strong conspiracy on the -- on the right about January 6th. And they also said that these -- these informants, these were members essentially of the Proud Boys, the Three Percenters, these are the groups, the violence, the groups that carried out a lot of the violence on January 6th, that these people were being paid by the FBI and they were supposed to be reporting back what they were seeing. Now, of 26 of these informants that were actually in Washington that day, three of them were actually tasked by the FBI to report back. And a couple of them actually went into the capitol. One of them actually went into the Capitol. The other two stayed outside. And so far, we should note that nobody none of these informants have been charged with any criminal activity, according to the inspector general. Now, there's a couple of other important findings that we should discuss. One of them is that the FBI was -- should have gone to all of its 56 field offices and gotten intelligence from its informants ahead of January 6th to try to prepare for that day. And according to the inspector general, they didn't do it, even though they told Congress that they had. It appears that that was an inaccurate declaration from the FBI, but it was not on purpose. And so, now, for the FBI -- look, Jim, the problem here is that this is baked in on the right, on the certainly among the president -- the incoming president's supporters. And you can also see that part of this was also part of the reason why Republicans said that Chris Wray needed to go from the FBI. They believed that the FBI was actually behind what happened on January 6th. And so that that -- that idea, I think, will continue to live on despite this report.",

And that is a big part of their mission, trying to prevent violence from some of these groups. The question is when Kash Patel if he becomes FBI director, is that still going to be part of the mission for the FBI? Is that going to be something that the Trump administration, which is coming in, is going to actually be focused on?

Today, the Federal Trade Commission revived a dormant 1936 law to sue the nation's dominant liquor distributor for ripping off customers.And on Tuesday, a federal judge sided with the FTC, halting what would have been the largest merger in the U.S. supermarket business ever a $25 billion deal between Kroger's and Albertsons. Both are big moves for the FTC chair, Lina Khan, who just this week President-elect Trump announced he would replace with current Commissioner Andrew Ferguson. Ferguson will inherit a number of blockbuster antitrust cases. Here to discuss what's going to change under the incoming president is Diana Moss. She's the former president of the American Antitrust Institute, now the director of competition policy for the Progressive Policy Institute. And I want to begin with a big picture question, because under the Biden administration, they were effectively trying to right what had been, frankly, a bipartisan openness to mergers for many years under this argument that, hey, if its efficiencies and it makes things easier for customers, it's all fine, trying to turn that back or at least establish some guardrails. Trump, of course, Republican, business friendly, is promising a more permissive environment. I mean, is -- are we going to swing back to all mergers are just fine? DIANA MOSS, VP &amp; DIRECTOR OF COMPETITION POLICY, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE:  Good to be here, Jim. I don't think we are going to see that kind of pivot. In fact, you know, we can trace strong merger enforcement, at least back to the Obama administration. And we saw increasingly more vigorous enforcement through Trump 1.0 and certainly through Biden. And I would expect to see some of that continue. There may be -- the answer may be in the nuance, right. The Biden enforcers really wanted to shake things up to make antitrust sort of the tip of the spear, to solve bigger social, economic and political issues. I think we might see more of a retraction to antitrust as more traditional law enforcement.",

That's housing, food, health care, personal insurance, transportation. That's been turning down over the last 15 years. We want to see it turn up. So very heartening to see the federaldistrict court judge in Oregon, deliver a win for the FTC in blocking this merger. The FTC has a history of approving every grocery merger that comes along, subject to divestitures. And as we saw in Safeway, Albertsons, those divestitures failed. And those failures, the failure of that in the form of higher prices is borne by consumers. So the first block of a retail harmful retail grocery merger really in recent history is an enormous win. It's kudos to the FTC. And, you know, similarly on the DOJ side, we saw very consumer-centric antitrust enforcement in blocking the merger of JetBlue and Spirit that protects consumers who are at leisure travelers -- yeah.",
