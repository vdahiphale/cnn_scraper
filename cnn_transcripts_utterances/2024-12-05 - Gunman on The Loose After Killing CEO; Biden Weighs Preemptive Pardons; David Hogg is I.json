The gunman is still on the loose.The wife of the victim, UnitedHealthcare boss Brian Thompson, telling NBC News, quote, \"there had been some threats. Basically, I don't know, a lack of coverage? I don't know details. I just know that he said that there were some people that had been threatening him.\" And she suggested that those threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage. The 50-year-old Thompson was in Manhattan for his firm's annual investors meeting. Now, I do want to warn you, we're going to show you some of the surveillance video of the moments leading up to the shooting. We're not showing the entire clip. It's just too hard to watch. Thompson was walking to his meeting yesterday morning when you can see the gunman emerge from behind him and shoot him. Moments later, the shooter is seen darting quickly across the street. He was then picked up by surveillance cameras escaping on a bicycle into Central Park. Before the shooting, the masked suspect stopped at a nearby Starbucks, providing police with the clearest images so far of his face and with potential DNA evidence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I would say that, you know, to go through the almost ritual of writing words or some pieces of a message onto the bullets that you're going to use in an assassination, to me that - that raises the strong prospect that this person had some sort of personal connection to this killing. So, this is probably less likely to be someone who was hired to do this and more likely was committed by someone who is emotionally or specifically invested in the act, right? There - it's a - a level of like personal kind of expression that you would never see from - from a hired gun, as it were. So, I know that doesn't really tell us very much, but every little scrap of evidence is something additional that the police have to work with at this point. It's also likely they're checking those bullets and those casings for - for fingerprints and DNA and things that could actually lead to identifying who he was.",

He didn't want to be found and approached or questioned with those articles in his possession.If it was just found on the street, seemingly dropped, that's just a mistake. And these things happen. Oftentimes people are caught, despite their best planning, they make one tragic mistake, leave behind one piece of evidence that brings the police to their door. So, I think, for me, it would really depend on a little - knowing a little bit more about the detail of where those things were found and how they were found.

And we also need to have - help more, not just young people, but people from normal backgrounds run for office.I think Tim Walz was actually a great example of this, of running as a teacher and gaining all the experience that he had to out - massively outperform, even in a Trump-held district, right?
