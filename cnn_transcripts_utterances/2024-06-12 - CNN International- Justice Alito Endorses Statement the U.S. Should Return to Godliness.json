If you're just joining us, here are our top stories today.A U.N. inquiry into the first few months of the war in Gaza has found both Israel and Palestinian militants, including Hamas, committed war crimes and other grave violations of international law. A U.N. panel says both sides committed sexual violence and torture and intentionally attacked civilians in a press release. Israel claims the U.N.'s reports are biased and reflective of anti-Israeli discrimination. The fate of the latest proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza remains unclear, as mediators plan to study a response from Hamas. One Israeli official has described it as a rejection. Hamas is demanding amendments, which include a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. And U.S. President Joe Biden says he'll continue to respect the judicial process, as his son Hunter Biden considers an appeal of his conviction on three federal felony gun charges. A jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden was guilty of possessing a gun whilst actively addicted to drugs in 2018, and that he lied on federal documents to obtain it. He's now the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be found guilty of a crime. U.S. Senate Democrats say they are working to pass a new Supreme Court ethics bill this week. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin says there may be some new evidence coming to light about gifts that Supreme Court justices have taken and have not reported. The United States' highest court has come under fire recently for reports of justices accepting expensive gifts and lavish trips, pricey book deals, and even for flying controversial political flags. A left-wing activist group has just added to the top of the court's turmoil as well. She posed as a religious conservative and secretly recorded conversations with Justice Samuel Alito, his wife, Martha-Ann and Chief Justice John Roberts. Those secret recordings were released on Monday. Jessica Schneider explains what they revealed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, no comment from the Supreme Court after two of its most senior justices and one of their spouses are heard on secret recordings discussing sensitive topics.",

SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Martha-Ann Alito also heard on the audio where she addressed the flag controversy head-on. M.A. ALITO: You know what I want?

Chiquita was ordered to pay the relatives of victims of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or AUC, a criminal group connected to landowners and corporate interests in northern Colombia that the United States declared a foreign terrorist organization in 2001.Some details of the cases that were read in court were brutal. Talk of extrajudicial executions, forced displacements and gratuitous displays of violence. But the ruling on Monday was celebrated as a victory for justice.",

And in a statement to CNN, Chiquita confirmed its intention to appeal.And throughout the last 20 years, the company maintained that it had been a victim of extortion by the AUC. But the U.S. justice previously found that Chiquita paid the AUC over 100 times between 1997 and 2004 for $1.7 million in total. Monday's verdicts ruled that the money was instrumental in propping up the AUC and that Chiquita was liable for the human rights abuse committed by the group. The cases heard in Florida are only a small portion of the total number of plaintiffs against the company. And a team of attorneys that brought successfully forward these cases intend to follow with further and further suits against Chiquita. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
