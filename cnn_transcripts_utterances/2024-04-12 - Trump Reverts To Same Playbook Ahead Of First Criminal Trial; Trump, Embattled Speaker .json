ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR  Donald Trump's recipe for loyalty and lies, that's tonight on NEWSNIGHT. Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. And tonight, it's a new season of The Donald Trump Show, but the plot is painfully familiar. Today, there was a new character brought in to play out, an old storyline. Mike Johnson, he made that Mar-a-Lago pilgrimage today, traveling the same route as Kevin McCarthy once did. And the deja vu doesn't end there. Johnson's job is in jeopardy. It's under threat from the far right flank, just like McCarthy's was once upon a time. So, Johnson recycled the old formula, kissing Trump's ring and lending legitimacy to the illegitimate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  They want to turn these people into voters. When you go to a welfare office, they also ask you if you would like to register to vote. And so many people, we think, are going to do that. And you know what, the numbers are so high. There're so many millions of illegals in the country that if only one out of 100 voted, they would cast potentially hundreds of thousands of votes in the election. That could turn an election. This could be a tight election in our congressional races around the country. It could, if there are enough votes, affect the presidential election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Did you catch that? We think, if only, it could.Republicans doing Trump's bidding want to turn fiction into fact, and maybe into probably, but too bad for them, none of what you just heard is true. Here's what actually happens when you register to vote. According to decades of cold hard data, you provide your driver's license or your social security number, and your identity gets checked against a database, you swear under penalty of perjury that you are who you say you are, and that you're a citizen. Non-citizen voting almost never happens. And if you don't believe me, how about the Heritage Foundation? They're a right wing think tank, and they track confirmed cases of non-citizen voting. They found that fewer than 100 cases have happened, not hundreds of thousands of cases of illegal votes. And that's not in one election either, or even two elections, or even three elections, but in every federal election since 2002, that's more than 20 years, barely enough votes to swing a race for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. Now, Donald Trump is a one-hit wonder. He's been producing the same press conference for nearly nine years. Think back to that June day in 2015. Trump's gold escalator ride might feel like forever ago, but his lies about immigrants today are a carbon copy of his script from then. Just listen to the overlap. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems. And they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some are your silver good people. But I believe you could have 15 million already in. Some are terrorists. They come from jails and prisons. They come from mental institutions and insane asylums. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP:  The Trump Show simply has not changed. The themes are all the same. The props, like the speaker, are the same, the rambling, ridiculous claims are a track that no one laughs at anymore. And his promises are the same too. Trump again says he'll testify that he would take the stand and that he would tell the truth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the money that he claimed that he raised, he didn't really raise. So, he's in trouble there. There will be way more field offices for the Biden campaign than the Trump campaign in the swing state.So, the playbook is tired. But the real question is, and you can't get any of these guys to join you, Abby. But you have to ask somebody like Speaker Johnson, what are you doing standing next to that guy? And what happened to the backbone of the Republican Party? How did you let this guy hijack the entire party, the party of Lincoln and Reagan, and throw it in the toilet like this? You know, the guy is a criminal. You know, he's about to get convicted in New York because Alvin Bragg would never be bringing this case. You have to think about the guts to bring a case like this. It's the first case to be brought against a president, a former president. And, you know, he's got overwhelming evidence. And you're standing next to the guy ruining the Republican Party.

And, listen, I'm very proud of Michael Cohen because I was with Michael Cohen in 2012 working with him on the Romney campaign. And, of course, I was with him in 2016 when he was one of Donald Trump's right hand people working with him. And the evolution of Michael Cohen, I think he is one of the people that history will look back upon and say, wow, America came very close to fascism. He had a well-organized campaign from a proto-fascist running who lost in 2020, tried to reclaim the situation in 2024, and there were people in the country like Michael Cohen that had the courage to speak out against the man and hopefully knock him through the ropes. And so we'll see. I predict he'll get convicted in this case. We'll have to see whether or not there will be a jail sentence tied to that. And then the real question is, come November, do you want a convicted felon to be the president of the United States?

As we just laid out there, there has been quite a road to this moment, but it feels like a pivotal moment. Could it have been avoided?JOHN ALLEN, RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND FORMER NATO COMMANDER:  I think that the Israeli decisions to make -- to attack the IRGC leadership in the consulate was one that they had come to a very careful decision on. They didn't tell us that they were going to do that, and that's created a source of friction. And they didn't do it probably because they didn't want us to talk them out of it or to give us the opportunity for plausible denial. But these tensions have been growing, as you said, properly. These tensions have been growing for some period of time. The surrogates and the proxies in the region have been attacking American troops, and the Israelis have been trading blows with Hezbollah in the southern part of Lebanon. So, I think this has been building over time, and the Iranian government, frankly, has to do something with regard to this attack. It doesn't have a lot of popular appeal on the streets in Iran, and to do nothing shows that it's weak. So, this is a difficult moment. It's a pivotal moment. I think the Israelis are going to do everything they possibly can to prepare. I'll just make another point. You know, there's a deep culture of pre- emption in the way the Israelis think about war. In 1967, they pre- empted, and there was a certain outcome in that war. In 1973, they didn't, and there was a certain outcome in that war. I would be very surprised to see if the Israelis have clear indications that an attack is imminent, really about to happen, whether they would take that punch, and whether we'd let the Iranians deliver that punch.",

And there are thousands of Americans in Israel. And so, an attack on Israel, in many respects, is an attack on the American people. And President Biden has a second amendment, or an Article Two responsibility under the Constitution to protect Americans. And that's why he said to Iran today, he gave them both advice and a warning. He said, don't. Don't attack Israel because of the likelihood to be great, not just that there would be loss of Israeli life, but loss of American life, as well.",
