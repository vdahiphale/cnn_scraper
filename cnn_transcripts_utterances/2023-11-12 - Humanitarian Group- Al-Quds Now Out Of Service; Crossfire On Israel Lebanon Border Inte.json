      "sentences": "Hey, everyone, thanks for joining me. I'm Omar Jimenez sitting in for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin in Gaza where an urgent humanitarian crisis is worsening as Israel continues its ground war against Hamas. The situation is growing more desperate for Gaza's health care system. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Gaza's second largest hospital Al-Quds is now out of service due to the depletion of fuel and power outages. Many medical centers in Gaza have become shelters for thousands of people displaced by the fighting. Israel Defense Forces opened a seven-hour evacuation corridor at the Al-Shifa medical complex, Gaza's largest and for the first time since Thursday, foreign nationals were able to evacuate Gaza at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt. Those crossings, however limited to only a pre-approved list. Nine Palestinian patients were also allowed into Egypt for treatment. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Ben Wedeman are monitoring the latest on the ground for us. Ed, I want to go to you first. The IDF says it is trying to help Gaza's sick and injured get to safety, but what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, we had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on CNN this morning saying that there is no reason why that shouldn't be able to happen. We so far have not had any confirmation that this offer by Israel Defense Forces to remove children and babies from the Al-Shifa Hospital, which is right there in the heart of Gaza City, whether or not that has come to fruition today. As you mentioned, there were a number of people who were allowed to leave through the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza into Egypt and that included nine Palestinians, which were four adults and five children that needed medical treatment.That ups the number of Palestinians who have been  able to leave Gaza into Egypt to 129 so far, but despite all of this, we know that intense fighting around that Al-Shifa Hospital has continued throughout the day. This has been an area of intense focus where the Israeli military says that the underground complex of tunnels in this area around Al-Shifa Hospital has been, and they've said this for years, they believe to be one of the primary areas where the Hamas military fighters are able to operate out of, and that is why they are focusing so much on this. Now there is some question as to just how much of a siege has been laid to that hospital. Officials there at the hospital have told CNN over the last couple of days that the fighting in and around the hospital has been intense. The IDF here in Israel says that the hospital is not under siege, but that they have been engaged in serious fighting around that. But this also comes at a time where there is growing skepticism as to whether or not the Israeli strategy of militarily going after Hamas with this kind of intensity is going to come at the expense of hostages. There's a large gathering of people here in Tel Aviv, Saturday, urging for more to be done to release the hostages, some groups and some representatives of families saying that victory in this war in Israel should not be measured by the assassination of Hamas leaders and military leaders there on the ground, but should be measured by the saving of the hostages that are in Hamas custody right now. So you know, some growing skepticism that we've heard from families of these hostages -- family members of the of the hostages saying that they are concerned that this strategy could come at the expense of their loved ones.",

Of course, there's a military campaign to weed out and eliminate Hamas on the side of the IDF, but also trying to rescue some of these hostages.I want to go back to a little bit after October 7th, you said, a little less than two weeks after the October 7th attack, you said providing aid to civilians in Gaza was a very, very low priority and that the focus at that point needed to be on militarily and financially helping Israel. Obviously, since then, we've seen a level of civilians killed by the thousands up to this point, do you still believe humanitarian aid is a low priority in comparison to the Israeli military's needs?",

I think if you're prioritizing those things, Omar, the most important thing is for us to provide financial assistance and military hardware to the Israelis, so they can do what they need to do in Gaza, regarding the terrorists who attacked them and killed over 1,200 of their civilians.Now, no one likes civilian death of anyone, whether it's Israeli or Palestinian, but let's remember this, two things. First, there was a ceasefire on October 6th, Omar, and it was Hamas that broke that ceasefire with their attacks on October 7th. And secondly, Israel has done much to try to get Palestinians moved from the area where the battling is going to be to the southern part of Gaza. It is Hamas that is refusing to let many of those people go to the southern part of Gaza because they want to use them as human shields. I believe that Hamas cares less about Palestinian civilian life than Israel does. And so, you know, Hamas has to take responsibility for this, they can be helping their civilians significantly, and we saw a report just today that Israel sends fuel to run the Al-Shifa Hospital, and that Hamas refused to accept it. You can't complain about not being able to run the incubators and the life support systems at a hospital and then turn down fuel that's being sent by the Israelis to be able to work those pieces of equipment. So Hamas is the hypocrite here, and that is why I think, the top priority has to be aiding  Israel so that we can put an end to this as quickly as possible.",

If leaders in Congress don't understand that all of these things are connected and that American dismissal of our role in any of these instances occur encourages more of them, not fewer of them, we need to send a very clear message by supporting Israel and supporting Ukraine. And believe me, Vladimir Putin is happy about what is going on here in Israel and in Gaza, because he hopes that it will distract certain American leaders who believe that filling the moat and pulling up the drawbridge is the way that America should conduct itself. I believe exactly the opposite. We have to be able to lead the free world. It is the price we pay for being the richest and freest country the world has ever known, and if we want to remain the richest and freest country the world's ever known, we have to engage with our allies around the world. That has always been the formula for American success both at home and abroad, and any suggestion to the contrary, made by anyone in Congress, or anywhere else in our political system, is damaging America's standing in the world, and damaging our future for success.",

His entire conduct from election night 2020 forward has been about lying to the American people, trying to steal the election, and now being charged criminally with that, and cheating the American people out of our democracy. That's what he's doing.So if he wants to talk about a liar, a thief, and a cheater; he is a liar, a thief, and a cheater, and that's what he is and the facts show that. And for everyone out there who is considering, you know, voting in the Republican primaries coming up, I want you to remember something, he is going to trial the day before Super Tuesday for his actions in trying to block and overturn the 2020 election results. And now, he has got Mark Meadows, his former chief-of-staff, who has signed an immunity deal with the government to testify that Donald Trump committed crimes right before him, that Donald Trump was lying from election night forward, and knew he was lying. This is not some rogue left-wing prosecutor. This is not some product of the two-tiered system of justice that Donald Trump complains and moans like a child about. This is the guy who is one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus from North Carolina. This is the guy who was his chief-of-staff and who he called the next James Baker. Now I want to see when he is sitting 20 feet away from Donald Trump in a courtroom, how Donald Trump's going to respond to that, but let me tell you as someone who ran the fifth largest prosecuting office in this country for seven years, and had 130 and oh record of political corruption cases, Donald Trump is going to be convicted this spring of these crimes, and we cannot, as the Republican Party, have a felon as our nominee. Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, and Vivek Ramaswamy all raised their hand at the first debate and said they would support someone even if they were a convicted felon. I'm the only one left on the stage who did not because I believe our standards have to be much higher for the person who sits in the Oval Office.

They're going to say, hey, the banks got paid back or banks don't really care, or we have this little disclaimer that tells them don't listen to anything we say. But all of those, I think fall by the wayside, given that the New York charge here is making a false statement, and that's enough as long as you profited from it, which the Trump team did. One other wildcard I think they'll try to play, they will try to get under Engoron's skin and as things go on and on, if they don't have other -- if they don't make other headway, I think you can really expect to see them, try to make him explode in a way that could serve up an issue on appeal that he was biased.

That one looks like the Chinese are not willing to restart it, and that is what I'm most worried about that the Summit could be a failure, because the really tough stuff that we need the Chinese to agree to, they are showing no inclination of doing that, Omar, instead, they've been talking about all the concessions Biden's made just to get this meeting.So we're likely to see a three-hour meeting where both sides or each side has a different version of what took place in the meeting and how tough they were.

They're focused on what they call the Global South, the vast majority of the global population, and there, they are pushing that they are a peacemaker, but they also never condemn Hamas. They don't actually condemn Putin's invasion of Ukraine. But they imply that they're the peacemakers who are sort of available when the time comes and this is effective.There has been no counter by the Biden administration. They don't want to offend China, then there would not be a Summit. But they're hesitant to call China out as really not helping. Obviously, China should condemn the Hamas attack, and China should condemn Putin's invasion, but they just won't do it because the global south is their game and pretending to be the world leader, while they claim we're in decline, Omar. So this is their larger strategy. It has been going on for 15 to 20 years now, and I think it's working.",

I mean, what can the US do to reach a mutually agreeable stance on Taiwan, if there even is one? PILLSBURYChina wants to keep up its program of intimidation, jet fighters, nuclear capable bombers, warships cruising around Taiwan pretty much every day. So the Biden administration wants that to stop. They will obviously raise it during the meeting. But we'll see soon thereafter, the world will see whether these Chinese intimidation missions are halted or not. My forecast is, I hate to be pessimistic, my forecast is they will not stop these and it will be kind of an embarrassment to the Biden approach. As for China, there's just too much at stake in these elections in January and they want to keep up the intimidation until then at least.",

They are with family members, but his wife and the two in-laws are still missing. So authorities trying to figure out exactly what happened to three people who are right now missing.
