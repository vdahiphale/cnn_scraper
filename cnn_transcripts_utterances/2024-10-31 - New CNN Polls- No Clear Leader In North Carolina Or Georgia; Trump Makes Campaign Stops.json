Ooh.Look, guys, we've been talking all week about the polling data and I just want to note, you know, as my high thing, that Georgia, Georgia is on my mind this afternoon. And why is Georgia on my mind? Because we have new polling from the great state of Georgia and North Carolina. And what does that polling show? Well, I should note that the -- look, the bottom line is this race has been close. It continues to be close. There's no real differences between now and where we were. Everything is kind of the same. But Georgia and North Carolina are quite important. Why? I want to go through history, OK? I want to go through history. And what do we see through history? When was the last time a Republican won without carrying the state of North Carolina or Georgia? Look at this. Georgia, you got to go all the way back since 1980. That's the last time. 1980 in presidential elections. How about North Carolina? You have to go all the way back since 1956. Remember, with Georgia in 1980, what were we dealing with, we were dealing with Jimmy Carter, of course, was the home state nominee at that particular point for the Democratic Party. He barely won anywhere, but he won in Georgia. North Carolina, you go all the way back to Dwight Eisenhower. That was, of course, was when you had a solid South for Republican candidates. But what I really want to do here is, you know, we've been looking at all this polling over the last few days, right? We had two polls, then three polls, then two polls. And I wanted to sort of sum it all up for you. I wanted to sum it all up for you and basically say, OK, what does the map actually look like? Well, if we essentially say the states that we had previously assigned that CNN had said either leaning or likely democratic or leaning or likely Republican, and then said, OK, what we're going to do is we're going to give Michigan and Wisconsin over to Kamala Harris because she had leads where they were significant enough that we could say that we believe she's ahead there. But then the states, the five states in which there are no clear leader, that those states are toss-ups, that those states are toss-ups. Look at this, nobody gets -- nobody gets to 270 electoral votes. Just Kamala Harris is slightly ahead. But the bottom line is, at the beginning of the week, I had no idea who was going to win. Right now, I have no idea who's going to win. And when we get to Tuesday, I can assure you, I'm still going to have no idea who's going to win. There is one thing, though.",

Clearly, the Trump campaign viewed this as an opportunity to sort of capitalize on what was seen as a gaffe by President Biden. We saw Donald Trump sort of stumble when he tried to open that garbage truck door. Nonetheless, he also caused some concern among Republicans, not to mention Democrats, by the language that he used when he once again was talking about women voters, saying that he will be there, that he's going to help them and protect them whether they like it or not.

Now for that garbage truck scene, I want to start with that because, clearly, this is something that the Trump campaign and Donald Trump thought they could seize on part of it is because they do want to shift the narrative away from that those really sexist and racist remarks from Tony Hinchcliffe the comedian on Sunday who spoke at Madison Square Garden calling Puerto Rico a floating island of trash. They thought they really see that Biden moment when Biden referred to his supporters as garbage, which they later walked back and said he wasn't doing. They saw that as a moment that they could turn, you know, the story on its head and put it on Democrats and Kamala Harris. And really, they're trying to draw a contrast with what Hillary Clinton said back in the lead up to 2016 when she referred to Donald Trump's supporters as a basket of deplorables. And that's why you saw -- I mean, I'll give it to the Trump campaign. One thing they love to do is to troll their opponents. That was what yesterday was all about with him donning that vest, getting into the garbage truck, trying to make in some ways a joke out of it, but also again, really trying to shift the narrative around those comments. Now, talking about the women issue here, I mean, one big thing that has been very clear is that Donald Trump has a problem when it comes to women and female voters. It is a problem that the campaign has yet to solve for. They have really gender gap with Kamala Harris, who is performing so much better with women across the country. However, Donald Trump himself continues to argue both publicly and privately that he doesn't understand it, that he thinks that he will be women's protector. And then last night in Wisconsin, he said, he will be their protector whether they like it or not. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Walk us through that. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, she began the day by essentially setting the tone with issues that she feels most comfortable, talking about reproductive rights, talking about healthcare more broadly. We very much expect that to be the message here today. But also, Bianna and Zain, here in Arizona, President Biden only won in 2020 by about 10,000 votes, a little more than that. And so this is a turnout game at its core. And so part of the winning Biden 2020 multiracial coalition included Latino and Native American voters. And a lot of the messaging that we see from the Harris campaign is to those voters. She's talking about the opportunity economy, but framing it where she's really concentrating on the family. That is very much a cultural connection that she's trying to make with Latino voters. She's talking about this issue of reproductive rights, elevating the concerns of women. She has a host of high-profile Latin-American surrogates crisscrossing the country. Today, we will hear from Los Tigres Del Norte, the Mexican group performing, and then Jennifer Lopez later tonight in Vegas. And so this is about having big events that will garner a lot of attention, wake people up who are not paying attention in these critical closing days, and doing all that they can to turn out the base of their party in places like this one to drive up the numbers in Phoenix.",

Well, we know so far that in the region of Valencia, there are a total of 155 mortalvictims after the devastating flood waters that affected many different areas. Let me tell you that right now we are located in Utiel which is west of Valencia. This is a town of approximately 12,000 people. And well, the images of what we see around is so dramatic because the roads are crooked, are absolutely destroyed, as well as some of the ground floors of the buildings where people were normally living until Tuesday afternoon. It was because the torrential rain, it was not expected to be as heavy as it finally was. And that's why the River Magro, the one that crosses this little town, suddenly overflowed and then the floodwaters rush into different buildings and also dragging away tons of cars, of furniture, and just leaving them stranded in any part of this town. I am actually very impressed, Zain, Bianna, about the neighbors on how quickly they are cleaning all the streets, on how they are mopping all the mud from the entrance of their homes. Actually, the image of what we see around here in here in hotel has nothing to do to the previously two hours ago, for example, because the cranes, they have already towed all the cars away to different places. So the streets now they look way better to what it was, for example, this morning. Now Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, has promised this morning when visiting Valencia, all the different affected areas that the government will do everything that is in their hands to help all the victims affected by this catastrophe.",

And right now, they are trying to find all those missing persons, all those missing people that were reported by their families, by their relatives. They are also looking anywhere where maybe it can be a stranded car, where maybe they can find another body. So the death toll, so far, unfortunately, Zain, Bianna is just an approximated figure because the total tally of bodies, it can be way higher as the days goes by.",
