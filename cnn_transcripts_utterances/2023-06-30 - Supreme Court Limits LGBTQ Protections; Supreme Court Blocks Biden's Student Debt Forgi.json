      "sentences": "Just moments ago, President Biden reacted to the major Supreme Court decision on LGBTQ rights. Joe Biden called it an invitation to discriminate that threatens dignity and equality of all Americans.Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York is the only openly gay black man currently serving in Congress, and he joins me now. Thank you so much, sir, for being with us this hour. The Supreme Court just ruled in favor of a Christian web designer who cited religious objections in refusing to make a website for a same-sex couple. I want to get your perspective. You're a member of Congress, but as I mentioned, you're an openly gay man. What was your reaction when you learned of the ruling? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY): Well, the decision is a dark day, not only for the LGBTQ community, but for democracy. And I cannot help but feel that the most consequential policy decisions are being decided not by elected officials, but by the unelected judges of the Supreme Court, particularly, a right-wing, super majority. You know, the Supreme Court is increasingly operating as a super legislature, and laws become politics by other means. And this particular decision reminds us that the greatest threat to LGBTQ equality is the weaponization of religious liberty. Now religious liberty properly understood means freedom from discrimination, not freedom to discriminate. And if the Supreme Court continues to reinterpret religious liberty as a license to discriminate, it's going to have implications for civil rights laws at every level of government, and it's going to have implications far beyond the LGBTQ community.",

Equally, the government could force a male website designer married to another man to design websites for an organization that advocates against same-sex marriage.\"Does he have a point there?",

I think one of the reasons Senate Republicans are also looking at this stuff, that student loan forgiveness plan was actually popular with the majority of Americans. And so, it's something that they have to at least consider and look at. I also think one last point that we haven't really discussed is, student loan forgiveness plan. The Biden administration very much framed that also as something that would help African Americans in the country who are overly burdened by student debt. Yesterday with affirmative action, today with this, that affects a key constituency that President Biden needs to win reelection. And so how his administration shows that they, despite failing on those fronts or despite getting losses at the Supreme Court, how they show that they're still going to address those issues for black voters I think is going to be really important heading into the election.",
