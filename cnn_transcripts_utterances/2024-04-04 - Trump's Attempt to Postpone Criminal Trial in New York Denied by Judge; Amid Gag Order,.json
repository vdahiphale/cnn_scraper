You can see where we got some clouds and rain developing. A weak storm tries to develop here. We also will have some rain up in the Northern Plains as well. You'll have a partial solar eclipse there.

We're looking at a 62 percent chance of landfall along the U.S. coastline from Maine down to Texas, and again, that is above average.Part of the reason is we have a La Nina ocean circulation. What that will do is push the jet stream north, which is our path of storminess. This leaves the wind shear decreasing or kind of that wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere, hurricanes hate that. So, without that around, that opens up a path for more storms to develop. The climate factor of this two is our oceans are much warmer than they used to be, that's more fuel for those hurricanes.",
