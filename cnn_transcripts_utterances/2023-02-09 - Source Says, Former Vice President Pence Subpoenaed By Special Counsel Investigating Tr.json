I'm Alisyn Camerota, welcome to CNN TONIGHT.Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump to testify about his former boss. The special counsel seeking information from Pence about his interactions with Donald Trump leading up to the election and what happened on January 6th. Nothing like that or like this has ever happened before, so we're going to talk about that in just a moment. Plus tonight, the latest installment of the George Santos soap opera. We have new info involving puppies, Amish dog breeders and $15,000 worth of bad checks. And what liberals can learn from Ron DeSantis. There's a piece in The New York Time, that warns liberals not to underestimate DeSantis, quote, he may resemble Trump but in politics but not in his intellect or resolve. Right to the news, here with me in studio, we have CNN Political Analyst Natasha Alford, former Assistant Special Watergate Prosecutor Nick Ackerman and CNN Anchor John Berman. Seamless, people. Seamless. You walked all the way over here.",

AKERMANHis whole point here, with all these items, all these different schemes that Donald Trump had cooked up, were basically geared toward Mike Pence acting outside of his duties as vice president rather than just the formality of voting, just counting up the electoral vote of basically declaring that the vote was no good and it had to go back to the states. That was the whole point of what Donald Trump was trying to do. And when he couldn't get Mike Pence to do it, that's when the violence started. The whole idea was to stop that vote, to stop the Congress from doing anything, to have them go back home.

They were supposed to be for puppies.Here with me in the studio, the Republican strategist Joe Pinion, also back with us, we have Natasha Alford and John Berman. Let me explain. In 2017, George Santos was charged with theft by deception after these bad checks, and I think we can put them up on the screen, six of them for $2,000-plus were made out to -- well, not all of them but that was the high -- made out to dog breeders, in the memo in each one, it says puppies. Joe, obviously, this isn't the first time. He's also wanted for forging checks in Brazil. He's being investigated for a Ponzi scheme, and now, as you know, he also is being investigated for ripping off a disabled vet who had a dying dog, and now these checks total $15,000 for puppies.

The marginal rate of outrage on each new George Santos scandal is actually very small because he's already done 12 bonkers things.
