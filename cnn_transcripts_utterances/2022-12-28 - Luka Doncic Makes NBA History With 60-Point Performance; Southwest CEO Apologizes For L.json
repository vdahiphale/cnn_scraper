China has always believed that the measures taken by countries to prevent the epidemic should be scientific and moderate and should not affect normal people-to-people exchanges.\" Now, Kaitlan, the irony here is that since the start of the pandemic, China has had some of the strictest border controls in the world. But now that the country is finally abandoning zero-COVID, starting to open up and cases are surging, other countries, they're now getting nervous. U.S. officials said they're concerned about the lack of transparent data from China, including viral genomic sequencing, which makes it difficult, the U.S. officials say, to identify any potential new variants from China.

And like I think probably secretly we're regretting it a little bit, but we actually have laughed a lot and had lots of smiles.We were saying that yesterday morning, we left super early. We got into the car at 04:00 in the morning and our stop that early was in Tulsa. I mean, that lovely women in Tulsa at the gas station wishing us a wonderful journey. So that certainly helped to pump us up a little bit, but it's been a little bit of a whirlwind. Maybe if we sat and thought about it a little bit longer, we wouldn't have done this, but I'm not sure. But I'm glad that we did.",

      "sentences": "So we like to travel, but we had an idea. We had some car set aside and we were just wanting to get to Chicago if we could, but that got canceled. So we just went over to --K. MAHER: Enterprise. T. MAHER: -- Enterprise at the South Phoenix Sky Harbor and just what do you have? We got to go. There's really no choice. We were going to go no matter what. But yes, the guy there, well, he was awesome. Got us in a big truck. There's six of us, and went home, went to bed, packed a couple of extra things because we do not have our luggage yet, hoping it's going to be in Manchester. But that was a big deal for us, too. That's why I started, I just had thoughts about Southwest canceling my flight is irritating, but I'm walking around and there's people everywhere and there's just -- there's flight attendants standing there and there's pilots, but they can't get through to the company to get, I don't know if it's approval to get onto the plane. I don't know how it works for that. But I'm thinking about people's luggage. They're not able to get their luggage for a week. I'm thinking, this is crazy. People have gifts or medication or electronics in those bags they just handed you, thinking they get it in a couple of hours and they're not going to get it for a week? If that -- I don't know, but it's just -- those are just my thoughts. I started tweeting out like, Southwest, where are you? Like, I -- it was the oddest thing because we're a loyal Southwest family, like 20 years plus. We look nowhere else except Southwest, are so fun. But this was the first time I've really seen it collapse.",

Hey, I wonder you say how loyal you guys are to Southwest. Do you think that remains after this?K. MAHER: You know, it's hard to say. Someone asked me that yesterday and we've got a little quick trip in January, that is Phoenix to Anaheim. That would be a super inexpensive flight and save a lot of time. And I think the drive is five and a half hours and I don't know that we would risk sitting. It's the time lost, right? I mean, we were at the airport at noontime on Sunday and finally made the call at 10:30 p.m. that we needed to go. We could not afford to lose any more time if we were going to drive, and that's what we face. We've got the flights home on January 6 from Manchester that we're sitting here saying, are we going to get back in the car or are we going to risk trying to get -- it's not just, oh, do you have an extra seat at six people? This is very, very impactful. T. MAHER: Right. K. MAHER: So, we're certainly thinking things through. It's certainly cause pause. That's what I would say. T. MAHER: And we have to get back to work as well. And I hate to say, but I can't rely on Southwest to get the family -- us home, so we might have to leave a little early to drive ourselves back. And again, you know, it's -- this has been a good memory for the family. We've had a lot of fun. But at the same time, it's -- you'd like to be able to rely on a carrier to get you home, but we just can't. We might not be able to, you know, rely on them at this time.",
