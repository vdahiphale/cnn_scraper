I'mBecky Anderson in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, where world leaders are gathered for the COP-16 Conference on desertification, dubbed our land our future. And this is important, the deserts of the Middle East are fitting backdrop for a conversation on land degradation. Well, the presence of the French President at the Summit today a clear sign that this is a global fight. While Macron visits this region, the Emir of Qatar is in the United Kingdom, touring Westminster Abbey on a state visit that began just hours ago. As a key negotiator in the past year and or more between Israel and Hamas, Qatar, an important player here in this region, now working to underscore the closeness of two regions, Europe, the UK and the Middle East. And as NATO Foreign Ministers gather in Brussels to focus on supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Secretary General Mark Rutte is this hour welcoming King Abdullah of Jordan on a day then of diplomacy as regional leaders work with global partners to tackle some of the most important problems of our time and build for the future. Let's start with the conflict tensions growing here in the Middle East, as Israel and Hezbollah accuse each other of breaking that fragile ceasefire in Lebanon. On Monday, Israel launched its largest wave of strikes yet, since the deal with Hezbollah took effect last week. Lebanese officials say nine people were killed that came after Hezbollah fired into Israeli occupied territory for the first time during this truce. Israel's Defense Minister warns his country will target the Lebanese state, not just Hezbollah, if this ceasefire falls apart. CNN's Jeremy Diamond, connecting us with the details today from Jerusalem. And to remind our viewers who have been up in the north of Israel over the past weeks assessing what is going on there for communities who have been displaced as a result of this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. What's your assessment of the past day or so of these strikes as they have seemingly escalated?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the ceasefire is now facing its biggest test to date, Becky, a very tenuous moment duringwhich the parties will effectively have to decide whether to continue to escalate what could quickly devolve into a tit-for-tat once again between Israel and Hezbollah, or whether to find some kind of an off ramp to allow this ceasefire to continue, albeit a fragile one at that. What we have seen over the course of the last week is nearly every single day the Israeli military has conducted strikes in Southern Lebanon, some of those south of the Litani River, where Hezbollah is meant to leave its military positions and move north. But some of those strikes have also been north of the Litani River as well. Israel insists that these strikes are to enforce this ceasefire agreement, saying that they are responding to Hezbollah militants who are violating these -- this ceasefire understanding. But the Lebanese government and now also the United States and France are raising serious questions, and some of them making accusations that Israel is violating the ceasefire. One source with UNIFIL telling our colleague, Tamara Qiblawi that there have been hundred Israeli violations of the ceasefire over the course of the last week. And now, of course, the Israeli Defense Minister is now warning that should Lebanon not find a way to get Hezbollah into compliance with this ceasefire, that the outbreak of war this time will not spare the Lebanese government, that they could now become a party to this conflict, and that Israel will strike them as well.",

We still don't really know what the red lines are on both sides and to what extent they have shifted in recent weeks? But there's no question that President-Elect Trump is now days after a hostage being held by Hamas, an American hostage released was part of a video that was released by Hamas, a hostage video, speaking under duress, urging the president-elect to use his influence to reach a deal. President-Elect Trump now speaking out and vowing severe consequences for Hamas, saying that they will have all hell to pay, in a way that kind of almost suggested U.S. military action against Hamas in Gaza. And again, this is obviously a pressure tactic and perhaps one that could help the ongoing negotiating efforts. But the real question is, if there isn't a deal by the time he comes into office, which is a very real possibility, then what does that response look like? What does the follow through on that threat actually look like? Becky,",

But just a repeat on this breaking news into CNN, the South Korean President has just declared martial law in a late-night TV address. Back to this region and Syrian and Russian forces intensifying aerial attacks against rebel fighters who've captured a broad stretch of territory in Northern Syria in recent days. And it has come at a huge cost. UN says Syrian Army air strikes have killed dozens of civilians caught in the middle of the fighting and have displaced nearly 50,000 people in less than a week. The UN Security Council is holding an emergency meeting in the coming hours to address the escalation in fighting. CNN's Ben Wedeman following this rapidly developing story for us. And we'll get to whether or not you think there's any -- anything to be done by the UN Security Council on this?

The rebels have basically doubled the amount of territory they controlled within the spade of four -- space of four days. They now control a large stretch of the M5 Highway, which is the North South highway linking Aleppo to Damascus. Now, by some estimates, they're within about eight kilometers to the Northeast of Hama. And keep in mind, Hama, symbolically is very important, because that's where, in early 1982 the father of Bashar Al Assad, Hafez Al Assad put down a revolt by the Muslim brotherhood surrounding the city and killing, by conservative estimates, more than 10,000 people. So, this is a city where, even though the Syrian government seems to be in control at the moment, it's not very beloved by the local population, which will probably, if given the opportunity, assist the rebels in taking back control of that city Becky.",

He does, for instance, he can, forinstance, just simply give up on Northern Syria, on Aleppo. Basically, the Turks control the Northwest. The Kurds, backed up by the United States, control the Northeast. What's most important for the regime of Bashar Al Assad is control of the Capital Damascus. The city of Homs which is an important stop along the way to the Mediterranean Coast, which is also the most critical thing for the control by the regime, because that is the homeland of the Alawite majority, to which Bashar Al Assad belongs. It's also, of course, where the Russians have an air base and a naval base. Their only naval base on the Mediterranean. So, in a sense, if they receive enough assistance from the Russians, from the Iranians, of course, who are preoccupied at the moment with other things, from Hezbollah, which is unlikely, given the beating it's taken from Israel over the last year or so. But if it has enough assistance, it might be able to survive in that rump state. But what we're seeing is that the Syrian army, in its current form, is simply struggling to even retreat in an organized manner, let alone hold on to ground.

But he said he's announced this martial law in order to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and anti-state elements. Now when it comes to the threat that North Korea poses, of course, the two countries, North Korea and South Korea, have been -- you know, officially at war for many decades. It's not clear whether this is response -- a response to any kind of specific threat, military threat, from North Korea, or whether it's just a more sort of general concern about the threat that North Korea poses? The anti-state elements that President Yoon speaks of, as well as a reason for this martial law. It's not clear what they are, but we do know that as the President of South Korea, he has been at odds with the Parliament of the country and is opposed to has got lots of opposition within the country, political opposition, indeed, from those opposition forces over the course of the past few minutes, we're seeing reported that this declaration of martial law has been rejected by the Head of the Parliament, the Head of the Governing Party, the Head of the Opposition. We understand that the -- from the Yonhap News Agency, which is the state news agency in South Korea, that the entrance to the part to the parliament building has been blocked.
