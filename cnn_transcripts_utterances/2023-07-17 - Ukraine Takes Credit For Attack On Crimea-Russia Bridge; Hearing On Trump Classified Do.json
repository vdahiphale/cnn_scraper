The Kerch Bridge is the only link between the land and Russia. It's become a vital crossing for Moscow to support its invasion of Ukraine and also a critical artery in supplying Crimea with all sorts of supplies.Russian officials say that there is severe damage to the roadway. But this morning we have learned that rail traffic across the bridge is moving. Let's get the very latest from CNN's Alex Marquardt. He's in Odessa, Ukraine before us. Alex, what more are you learning about the attack and where things go now?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly that the question now is how is Russia going to respond? They're going to take this very seriously for the reasons you laid out, those two reasons that this is hugely important logistically, but also symbolically. This was a personal project of Vladimir Putin's after he annexed Crimea back in 2014. Then four years later, this bridge opened and he was there on hand. He drove a truck across this 12 mile, 90 kilometer bridge between southern Russia and Crimea in order to open it.So this is a very brazen attack by the Ukrainians. Ukrainians remarkably claiming responsibility for this not just saying that they were behind it, but really trolling the Russians as well, the Ukrainian Security Services, the SBU tweeting that the bridge has gone to sleep again, that is a reference to another attack on the bridge just nine months ago that they did not claim back then. So this is very significant for both those logistical and symbolic reasons. The claim does not offer it really any more details about how they carried this out and beyond the fact that this was a joint operation, they say, between the Ukrainian Security Services and the Ukrainian Navy. The Russians, which of course, as you noted, call this a terror attack, adding a little bit more detail saying this happened in the predawn hours around 3 o'clock in the morning saying that Ukrainian see or surface drones carry this out. So Kate, you know, major questions now about what happens, this is a $4 billion bridge. Russia will take this very seriously, the roadway, still, you know, not up and running, cars have been blocked from going across it, the train does still appear to be running going across that bridge, vital, as you say, to supply the Crimean peninsula, not just the civilians there with fuel and food. But the Russians have been using it since the beginning of this war to get military equipment onto the Crimean peninsula, which from which they attack southern Ukraine. That is why it is so vital the Ukrainian say that during this counter offensive, that they tried to split those Russian troops in southern Ukraine and split up that land bridge, which is the only other alternative. Russia has to reach Crimea. Kate?",

In all the attacks that we've seen, whether it's in Crimea or on this bridge nine months ago, or in Russia, remember, there were those drones that were sent at the Kremlin itself. Ukraine has been extremely coy kind of just putting out these tweets that indicate that they may have been behind the strikes, but never fully admitting it.Now Ukraine leaving no doubt and really and they said that they wouldn't offer any details until the war is over. But they did say that it was this joint effort. So a Ukrainian appearing to come out of the shadows to really leave no question about who was behind this, perhaps really driving this point home because this Kerch Bridge is so important to Vladimir Putin and Russia.

Because part of this deal, in fact, the real crux of this deal was in exchange for Russia allowing these ships to pass through the Black Sea and to market safely. Russia would get help from the U.N. to get its own grain, its own fertilizer, and other agricultural products to market.And they say that, frankly, not enough has been done in that sphere. Of course, there are no sanctions on Russian agricultural products or on fertilizer or anything like that. But there are sanctions on banks. And so one of the key demands from Russia has been to be connected to these international payment mechanisms that has made payment kind of tricky at the moment. The U.N. has proposed to connect the agricultural bank in Russia. Obviously, that was not good enough. We just heard from the U.N. Secretary General on this issue, who says that look, access for Russian agricultural products has increased since this deal began. And he said this about Russia's decision not to renew the deal. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: I'm deeply disappointed that my proposals went unheeded.

And he said this earlier, and I quote, these are absolutely unrelated events. Even before this terrorist attack, the position was declared by President Putin. And I repeat again, as soon as the part of the Black Sea agreements concerning Russia are fulfilled, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal.Turkey was one of the brokers of this last summer.

You can see some of the destruction that was caused by this Ukrainian attack on the bridge. And let me show you again, where it is on the map. It is right here. It connects Crimea, which is of course, part of Ukraine, but been occupied by Russia since 2014. It connects Crimea with Russia proper. I want to bring in retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Steve Anderson. General, thank you so much for being with us. So the attack on the bridge here, how much of an operational setback is it for Russia? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, thank you, John. I don't believe it's that much of an operational setback. I mean, they took out the road, the bridge where vehicle traffic uses, but they didn't take out the rail, and they still have barges and ships and whatnot. So they can still get logistics. It's not near as significant as the attack that occurred on the Kerch Bridge back in October. I think that we'll probably be able to fix this within a few days, maybe a couple of weeks. But it's got a huge operational impact, because it's demonstrating a deep strike capability that the Ukrainians have achieved through their intent -- incredible tenacity and innovation. They were able to launch these surface drones, over 500 kilometers through uncharted water through patrolled water by the Russians to attack a pinpoint target. And that's sending a very, very loud signal to the Russian Navy, that look, hey, every ship that's out there in the Black Sea is vulnerable to attack. And if they want to try to enforce some sort of an embargo on Ukrainian grain, every ship captain is out there is going to have to worry about getting hit by one of these sea drones.",

And I think that if they're going to try to enforce some kind of embargo, again, every single ship that's out there in the Black Sea is now a target. Ukrainians are showing that they're capable of hitting those targets.",

However, strategically and politically, it sends a very strong message, of course, if the United States and NATO continue to support the Ukrainians in this fight, but there's many, many problems that the Ukrainians are experiencing right now. One of them is air superiority. So obviously, if they can get F-16 into the fight, more aviation assets, they, you know, we would never launch a counter offensive like the Ukrainians have done without complete air superiority, and they don't have it.But they've got a tough fight. They got 200,000 Russians that have been dug in now for over a year, that with incredible tank traps, and probably hundreds of thousands of tank minds out there landmines that they've got to negotiate. They lack the equipment that we promised them. They don't have the personnel they need. They haven't pushed forward the logistics. And of course, there's the issue of battle fatigue. So I think it's very, very important that we continue to show our support to the Ukrainians with this F-16 support. And I would say this, also, John, I think that the Biden administration needs to prove us contractors on the ground in the Ukraine to help maintain these aircraft. Right now I'm getting reports that perhaps 50 percent of the equipment we gave them is not operational because they can't maintain them.",

This is an individual who is the leading candidate on the Republican side for the nomination, and therefore the rules don't apply. Now, this argument worked with the Special Master, because there was some precedent for it. There were two other district court judges that appointed special masters to oversee Michael Cohen's search warrant and to oversee the search warrant of Rudy Giuliani. Now, those were different cases, they both involve lawyers with lots of privileged information. Judge Cannon, appreciate that distinction.

All they've done is they've complained that they've got too many documents to look at when there aren't really that many documents. At most there are 4,000. The government has set them up in a very neat binder for them, basically flagging the documents that are likely the ones to be admitted into evidence. They have plenty of time to do that. They've been given witness statements already. And they're going to be given all the witness statements in the next week or so.That never happens in a criminal case, the government is not required to turn over those statements until almost the day of trial. So there's really no basis here for them to claim that there is not enough time. In fact, they don't come back with any facts in response to the government's very detailed milestones with respect to the classified documents, and explain why it's impossible for them to deal with basically 31 classified documents between now and December 11th. SIDNER: So it's not the hundreds in the boxes there. It is specific to what is in the indictment. I do want to lastly ask you because you mentioned this Judge Aileen Cannon is a Trump employee or sorry, appointee, excuse me. And Trump this week had no problem praising her and saying that, you know, she'll do the right thing. And she was obviously overruled, but a lot of judges get overruled on cases, get their cases, overturned.

What the Trump papers don't recognize is the fact that the right to a speedy trial is just is not just a right, that belongs to the defendant, but it's also a right that belongs to the people and the government.So the question is, is she going to see through this this time, which I think she will, and set the trial date for December 11th.",
