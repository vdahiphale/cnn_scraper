You hear the sound of the parrotfish, like the noise of the waves. You have those thousands of little coral fragments, and you have the fish. They become your co-workers. It`s something so tangible.

In addition to reopening the galleries, the team is also restoring a view from the rotunda that no one has seen since 1939 by removing a wall which separated the main nave from the Palais de la Decouverte. The final phase of the renovation will continue through 2025, but they hope to finish phase one in time for the Olympic Games. FUSILIER (through translator): We hope that everything will be finished on time, to host the grand fencing and taekwondo events that will be held here. It will be -- it will be just here, in the middle, in the center of the perspective to see that. and the public will be there on the right and on the left. It will be something very beautiful.
