Earlier this month, they filed paperwork in Westchester County. That's just north of New York City, indicating that they could begin to move on Trump's property there. He owns a big estate known as Seven Springs, as well as a golf course in a town of Briarcliff, New York. And, you know, this judgment was also entered in New York, where a lot of Trump's big trophy properties are, including Trump Tower, his triplex apartment at the top of that skyscraper and an office building 40 Wall Street. Now, the attorney general's office could also look to move and see some airplanes, some Trump's bank accounts, put liens on some of these properties as well.
