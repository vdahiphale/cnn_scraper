She obviously declined. Let's get the latest now from CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, we could see up to three days of arguments from the defense team trying to get Jack Smith removed. This is highly unusual, right? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, we will see three days of arguments, and it is unusual how much time Judge Cannon is devoting, not just how much time she's devoting to these challenges of Jack Smith and his appointment, his funding as the special counsel's office within the Justice Department, but also how many people she wants to hear from. You never see that in a criminal case at the trial level before a judge like this, but here Judge Cannon is going to this afternoon hear from law professors, people who have nothing to do with this case, arguing for and against the special counsel. And the other thing that is really interesting about this and the way Judge Cannon is handling it is, she keeps pushing things off in this case. She's having hearings like these. She's hearing some other very important parts of this case too on Monday and Tuesday as these hearings stretch out over the next couple of days, requests from prosecutors about a gag order on Trump, another attempt from Donald Trump's team to toss out evidence and testimony in the case. But even, in some of this, it's just not the thing that you're seeing. And this morning -- and we're going to hear this multiple times over the next couple of days -- Trump's team keeps asking for more hearings. She can't resolve this yet. They want more. They want an evidentiary hearing about Jack Smith and his relationship with Attorney General Merrick Garland. And so they're before her making their legal arguments, but they also keep asking, do more, bring us more to Fort Pierce, Florida. Have us in court more and more and more.

Let's discuss further now with former federal Judge John E. Jones III. Judge, thank you so much for being with us. Are you surprised that Judge Cannon gave this much time for arguments on whether the special counsel appointment is invalid? JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE:  Well, Boris, it's good to be with you again. And, yes, I am. A couple of things come to mind. One is that the Supreme Court of the United States doesn't give anybody three days to argue anything. And, typically, you have got to wrap it up within a very brief portion of time. [13:05:00] And I would rather cliff-dive than hear three days of arguments on anything, let alone something of this import. In two words, this is absurd and it's unnecessary. It's one thing to let these outside parties intervene, meaning that they can file briefs. You know, you can just decide it on the briefs. This is wholly unnecessary. And, moreover, every court that has dealt with an allegation that the special counsel is unconstitutional, illegal, what have you has come down on the side of saying that those arguments are unavailing. There's a great opinion by the D.C. Circuit right on point. I don't know why she's doing this. And this is just running the clock even further.",

Only she knows whether there's an actual bias, and I'm not going to make that allegation. But, at this point, what she's doing is judging in a way that she's trying to avoid a mistake, it seems to me. And she's overdoing it. When you're the trial judge, you have got to be bold.

Biden and the Democratic Party falling well short of that, even though they reportedly raised quite a bit, more than $85 million last month.

They also attributed a lot of that to the guilty verdict. But the majority of that money, $60 million, I believe, was from three wealthy donors; $50 million was raised by this man Timothy Mellon. He previously had given to RFK Jr., but instead has switched loyalties. So, all to say, what Donald Trump has been doing over the last several weeks and throughout his trial was fund-raising, very much focusing on having these closed-door fund-raisers where he's courting these wealthy billionaires. And, clearly, it's seeming to pay off.",

      "sentences": "Well, it might mean that some of these ad buys will need to be smaller. The one across the battlegrounds that they just launched was $50 million.I mean, they still have a significant amount of cash on hand, $212 million at the end of May. And they did raise $30 million at a fund- raiser that was co-helmed by former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles over the weekend. That will count toward the June number. So, that's not in the May haul that we were just talking about. But I do think that it's important to note this shift in momentum, because this really started when Donald Trump's criminal trial began. It was April that was the first month that the Trump campaign and his associated entities began outraising Biden. That went up even further in may, and it could go up even further in June. Alayna was talking about that dinner that Trump held with some financiers the night of his conviction. I'm told by an attendee that it raised $40 million. There were only two dozen people there. And so Trump really has this ability to mobilize not only high-dollar donors, but a very small number of them, to give very large amounts, whereas President Biden and his campaign strategy has been to hold these very large-format ticketed events where they raise less per attendee, and it costs more to put them on. So, it's a decidedly different strategy, but the Biden campaign would argue that $212 million is more than enough for what they need to do now, especially considering that this election is going to be decided by just a few hundred thousand voters across a few states. Do you risk oversaturating them if you have too many ads on the airways, too much mail stuffed in their mailbox? Certainly, there are a lot of strategies to reach those voters, but I think that there is a hope that the debate will help shape some of the thinking of donors going forward.",

He has a close-knit group of advisers that's really been around him for a number of decades. And he believes that they have served him well. They helped him win in 2020, and he's going to go back to the well.And on that front, Bob Bauer, who I know has been on CNN several times in the last few days promoting his book, is expected to be reprising the role of Donald Trump in the mock debates that they're holding at Camp David. I just saw him in the hall. He would not engage on whether he is actually doing that, how he is preparing, when he's going to Camp David. But we know from our sources that that is the expectation of the Biden camp, that they will lean on him once again to play that role. As for the microphones, I think there's generally an agreement that the first debate between Trump and Biden in the 2020 cycle was quite chaotic. It was quite disorganized. It devolved into a shouting match. It didn't serve the voters. And so I think there is a little bit of a collective exhale that there will be an opportunity for each candidate to speak. And the Biden camp certainly believes that having the mics muted, especially for Trump, who is prone to speaking over the other people on the stage, will serve them well in particular.",
