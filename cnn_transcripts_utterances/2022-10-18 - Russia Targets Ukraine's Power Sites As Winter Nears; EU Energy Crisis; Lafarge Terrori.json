A French company is fined more than $700 million for making payments to ISIS in Syria. Well, Russia's new military commander in Ukraine says Moscow's goal is to make the country friendly and independent from the West. Right now, it is trying to accomplish that goal by blasting Ukraine's energy infrastructure to pieces. That's according to Ukraine's president. Russia has destroyed 30 percent of the country's power stations in the past eight days alone. It's an attempt to put the country in the cold and dark with winter rapidly approaching, it left three dead in Kyiv on Tuesday. The mayor of the capital is urging residents to conserve power and water. U.N. officials are warning of a deadly winter with Ukrainian families struggling to find heat sources for their destroyed home.

U.S. director of national intelligence says that means Moscow is relying on low end weapons and technological band-aids. The Kremlin said there is still no end date of Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization plan. At least 40 regions, including Moscow, have already filled or draft quota. And in other developments, the head of Germany's cybersecurity agency has been fired over alleged connections with Russia. Arne Schonbohm leaves the job immediately. It comes after recent reports saying he had links with people involved with Russia's intelligence service. A spokesperson for Germany's federal office for information security says public trust in the agencies neutrality was a key factor in his dismissal. The war in Ukraine has forced the European union to confront it's expensive dependence on gas. A new report shows that wind and solar power have made up 20 percent of the block's electricity mix since February. That's a record. And the growth in renewable power capacity saved E.U. nations nearly $97 billion. But the European Union is still struggling to cope with high energy prices ahead of this coming winter. On Thursday, the European Commission proposed new emergency measures to create a, quote, energy union that but they did not impose a price cap on gas. CNN's Clare Sebastian has the details.

That will get harder as winter takes hold. The E.U. stopped short of proposing an immediate cap on gas prices, a policy that has proved controversial among some member states. Even though European Europe has filled its gas stories to 92 percent, well ahead of its target of 80 percent by November 1st, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson made it clear that winter could still hit hard.",

But also because they want more profit sharing from the energy companies as a result of the profits they made these last few weeks. In the context of that, you have this strike that was called today as you say by transport unions but also some public sector workers. What they've done is they had a march as well. The traffic wasn't that crippled in France. It was a lot of traffic on trains were able to run. But it was more this, a large demonstration on the streets of Paris. There have was one on Sunday against inflation in the high cost of living. But they haven't gotten as many people out on the streets as they managed to today. Here, we're arriving which is the end point of the demonstration, of the march, and it's been remarkably well-attended. We haven't seen these kinds of figures on the streets of paradise than a couple of years. Of course, COVID have made it impossible. There's been some protests about the restrictions. But nothing like this since the very end of the yellow vest protest and the union in 2019. And so, once again, the French back on the streets and it is a difficult time for Emmanuel Macron. He's trying to get workers back into refineries, so the petrol stations can be working once again. But he's also having to push through, as a result of parliamentary division, the 2022 budget by bypassing the vote altogether and in the hope behind that, of being able to push through his controversial reform. So, it's a difficult time politically for Macron, reelected in May, with a very divided political landscape and wanting to push through reforms in the second term. So, this large demonstration, of course, bad news for the French president, as he looks ahead as the fall season, in which he had hopes to get so much through. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
