I'm Bianna Golodryga, filling in for Fareed Zakaria who is off this week.On the program this week marks the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In that year hundreds of thousands dead. Tens of billions of dollars in damage. And there's no end in sight. We'll look at how Russia views this grim year with the anchors of exiled Russian broadcaster TV Rain. Then we'll examine the present and future on the bloody battlefield. Is the war in a stalemate now and how might it finally end? I'll ask the experts. Also, while all eyes are cast upward looking for more Chinese balloons, which of Beijing's other actions are we missing on the ground and in the cyber realm? We'll explore. In the 360 days since Russia's invasion, Ukraine has become the frontline in the global battle for democracy. It's a fight that is being fought in the airwaves as well as on the battlefield. Putin's minions are working overtime to control the message overseas and at home. Under a law passed last year journalists in Russia can be jailed for up to 15 years for reporting what the Kremlin considers fake news about what its military is doing, and to wit, calling the war in Ukraine a war could land one in prison. And because of this crackdown many in the industry have fled including my guest today who run the Russian independent TV news station TV Rain. In 2022 the network famously ended its last newscast with an anti-war message before cutting to an old performance of Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Swan Lake.\" Today TV Rain operates in exile broadcasting its content on YouTube. Tikhon Dzyadko is the network's editor-in-chief and Ekaterina Kotrikadze, an anchor and news director. Welcome, both of you. It's good to see you. Katya, let me start with you. You are at the Munich Security Conference where the first time in the conference's history no Russian officials have been invited. Instead the chairman of the conference tweeted this. \"We want to discuss Russia's future with Russian opposition leaders and exiled people. Their voices need to be heard and amplified.\" Katya, you and TV Rain are among those exiled Russians. What is the mood there one year into the war now?",

During these three days I was talking to Russian liberal, you know, dissidents, opposition leaders, representatives of the civil society, and also with European politicians and experts, and all of them are saying that Russia should be relaunched as a country, as a state, that after this invasion of Ukraine everything has changed.And these people, European, Western leaders, are looking for a different approach to Russia and are asking themselves the questions about whether it is really possible to see this new country, to see Russia as a democratic state, which is, I mean, not obvious for a lot of people here. So the representatives of Russian Civil Society, all of them, they are all in exile. They fled the country just as we did. They were trying to explain that there is a chance for Russia to rebuild a democracy. And I truly believe in this, too.",

And nothing about that has been said. But, still, the accountability is one of the main questions here, really. I mean, what I saw is that everyone was talking about not only the reality but also trying to plan the future and answer the question, how will the world look like and if we want a normal world after this terrible war, then we need to make Vladimir Putin and others accountable for what they did. And this is a crime against humanity. This is a crime of aggression.

That's too early to see these consequences that will happen soon. And the third thing, very important, is the fact that even the polls, which could not be trusted with its digits but we see the trends, that the support of this war is becoming lower and lower in Russia. People are not happy with the fact that Russia is isolated now and that they cannot see any future. So I think that the world should work in these three directions.

So it's a challenge to replace those individuals in order to be capable of conducting offensive operations.I think like any military they face shortages when it comes to equipment or ammunition. And if you look over the past year, a lot of Western military assistance has been critical but it's come at a point where we're sort of just in time for Ukrainian needs rather necessarily leading them.

So I think that he's still got a few really bad decisions left in him and I wouldn't put it past him to escalate to low-yield nuclear use on the battlefield.And not just one, but perhaps several especially if there's major setbacks for the Russian forces on the battlefield.

Often they tend to be either short lasting a few months, or if they go on for this long they typically gone for at least several years.What will it take for the war to end? Well, that's a difficult question to answer. I mean, it can range anything from the Ukrainian military success to a more pessimistic variant where at the end of the day what emerges is some sort of unhappy stalemate on the battlefield. Or, to be perfectly frank, the way the war could progress is that the ending doesn't resolve any of the fundamental issues in this war. That's a (INAUDIBLE) they would happen in 2014 and 2015. This war is a continuation war of the original Russian invasion of Ukraine. And how it ends could potentially result in yet another war. Often these conflicts go in series when neither party is able to attain what they want. So the folks who push for an early negotiation, perhaps, a contrived armistice of some kind, on the one hand that's a laudable pursuit but on the other hand, at this stage it's clear that it would most likely result in Russia trying to rearm and then pursuing the war yet again.

Last week President Zelenskyy provided some intelligence and shared evidence with the Moldovan president of Maia Sandu of an attempted Russian plot for a coup to overthrow the government there.

A little over a year ago the U.S. government declassified its findings that China has been implanting itself in our network of pipelines not for intellectual property theft but to maintain a foothold in the event they would ever need to do something to those pipelines, in the event of some larger geopolitical conflict say over Taiwan. You know, we've seen them hacking our businesses for years.I always say, if you could see a balloon over every American corporation had been hacked by China Americans would be flabbergasted. And we've seen them hack our personal data. They hacked the office of personal management several years ago which is where everyone submits their application who wants a security clearance. We saw them make off with tens of millions of fingerprints for every American government worker who sought a security clearance. We've seen them hack Equifax. We've seen them hack Anthem. We've seen them hack Marriott, aviation companies. Ostensibly they are building out this large, personal database of Americans' personal information. In the beginning I think the theory was that they could cross match which American government workers are traveling and staying in the same place as Chinese citizens as a counterintelligence effort to root out Chinese spies. But it has gotten much more broad than that. So --",

Really the United Nations unfortunately has failed in this moment before the Syrian people and I am afraid there is a very bad precedent being set for the rest of the globe whereby, you know, the Syrian regime does not control these border crossings. Turkey and the opposition do.So the United Nations is choosing -- choosing to accept Russia's dictates as well as Bashar al Assad and not move across the border. Independent organizations, some countries have been sending aid through the borders but the United Nations and its leadership has chosen not to until Bashar al Assad and Russia allow them to. And that is really dangerous. And recently that is exactly what happened. They waited until the Russian government allowed the opening of two additional crossings for three months. And one should ask themselves, why is the government that is caring for its people only allowing the U.N. to access a severely hit area for three months? And that tells you everything you need to know about the nature of the government in Damascus as well as what is happening in the United Nations when it comes to these issues.",
