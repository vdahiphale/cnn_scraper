I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we have breaking news tonight in the war between Israel and Hamas.Israel, marking six months of its war in Gaza with a major development. The IDF is saying it's withdrawing its troops from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, having concluded its mission, and is now leaving to recuperate and prepare for future operations. A good (ph) significant force will still remain in other areas of the strip, this move marking a new phase in the war, as Israel faces rising pressure from the U.S. to dial down operations in Gaza. But Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says he's not backing down, and that pressure from the U.S. will not stop his plans to invade the southern city of Rafah. The prime minister also facing significant trouble at home, with thousands of protesters coming out in force this weekend to demand his resignation. And abroad, as Israel's military says it's preparing to move from, quote, \"defense to attack\" on its border with Lebanon after the country said it hit multiple Hezbollah targets overnight. CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us now. Nic, this is the six-month mark of this war, and we are seeing major developments today. Give us the latest.",

The troops coming out, and we saw them today in a field about a mile or so from the border, dozens of tanks, dozens of armored fighting vehicles. A lot of the troops who had already gone off to begin their recuperation and preparation for the next phase.Preparation was going on on the tanks. A lot of them need repair, intensive work. They've been in battle for months in Khan Younis, a lot of tunnels there. It's been a difficult fight. A lot of soldiers lost, four soldiers killed last night just as they were withdrawing and pulling out. But for the IDF, they're saying they can still go after and get the other commanders from Hamas if they get the intelligence. They're keeping a strong presence in the north of Gaza, the 162nd Division there. And they're indicating that if they need to, then they can send these forces back in to Rafah, that southern Gazan city where about 1.5 million Palestinians currently living.",

COGAT, the government body that handles the transfer of humanitarian aid, says there's some logistical work required before the trucks can cross over. We noticed explosions in the area yesterday, heard them again today, gunfire at the border. A lot of the highways connecting the border to the towns where the aid would need to go, those have been blown up by the intensive fighting. And that government body, COGAT, actually did make a point of saying, despite not getting Erez open and have not set a date for it yet, they say they got the most number of aid trucks into Gaza of any day in the past six months, 322 trucks, 70 percent of them they say had food on. So, it's 228 trucks of food they say went in. This is something the U.N. hasn't spoken about yet. If they got that number where they are, what happened to them, but this is what the Israelis are saying.

      "sentences": "That's right, Jessica. He placed pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make policy changes or else the U.S. could change their policy. And some of those asks are really focused on ramping up humanitarian aid.That includes opening that land crossing you were just speaking to Nic about, as well as opening up a port to get humanitarian aid in, and also just generally ramping up supplies into Gaza. Of course, this was a critical moment. This call was put on the books last week after the deaths of those World Central Kitchen employees. And the sources tell CNN that when the president sort of walked through and ticked through these policy changes that he wanted to see, the response by the prime minister was that it was going to get done. But the president went even further, saying that it needed to get done quickly. And so hours later, we did see the Israeli security cabinet approve multiple of those measures. Now, up until this point, the White House has welcomed the moves since that phone call, acknowledging that there have been frustrations, but also that they are watching what happens moving forward. That's something the National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby talked about this morning. And of course, the U.S. here is really going a step further by suggesting that there would be a policy change if they don't see changes by Israel. The question is what that looks like and what are the metrics here? One senior administration official said something that the U.S. could do is slow down weapons to Israel. But there are all -- I mean, the point here for the U.S., though, is that they are defending Israel. They still believe Israel has the right to defend itself. What happens next, though, still very unclear. DEAN: All right. Priscilla Alvarez for us in Washington. Thanks so much for that reporting. And joining us now is CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Army Commanding General Mark Hertling. Great to have you on. Thanks so much for making time. We are marking the sixth month anniversary.

Hamas has dedicated itself to killing Jews and destroying the Israeli state. They're going to see this delay or this retrofit and the pulling out of the 98th Division as a semi-victory, in my view. That's how terrorists will react.They will publicize this and message this, that yes, their strategy to bring the world and the United States to the fray of saying, Israel, stop your actions, it has gotten too rough. They will see that as a victory. So, I believe we will see an eventual operations inside of Rafah. I don't know when that will be, but I think Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to delay that because he is getting such political pressure from the United States and from the international community.",

Unfortunately, in these kind of counterterrorism operations, you also have to have a political and a diplomatic approach to this. And I don't believe the Netanyahu government has done that. They have not safeguarded the Palestinian citizens inside of Gaza, and that's creating more terrorists. And it's also bringing the diplomatic effort against Israel.So, any kind of operation like this, Jessica, just can't consist of the military arm. It also has to include the diplomatic and the informational arm, as well as the safeguarding of innocent citizens.

Anytime, you know, anything wants to get done, she's going to hold this threat over his head or he can survive by cutting a deal with the Democrats. Now, he has to think about his conscience, because I got to tell you, if Ukraine loses this fight, he will be the guy in the history books that are written about why Ukraine lost this fight. He will be -- they won't necessarily say that he's the one that pulled the aid, but he's the one that could have done something which changed it. And, you know, as he's developing whatever this package looks like, you know, there's talks of loans and I guess there's some pot, potential agreement with that. But I think we need to recognize the fact that Ukraine is it's not us helping Ukraine. Ukraine is helping us by fighting to defend themselves against one of our chief competitors and frankly, enemies in this world. So, he needs -- if I was him, I would come back. I would put the Senate bill on the floor or next case is just strip the Israel portion out of it, since that's a little more controversial, pass it and either send it back to the Senate or send it to the president to sign and have your conscience clear and let the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on the battlefield.",

We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor. I mean, there are members of Congress today who still incorrectly say that this conflict between Russia and Ukraine is over NATO, which, of course, it is not. To the extent that this propaganda takes hold, it makes it more difficult for us to really see this as an authoritarian versus democracy battle, which is what it is.

You know, look at Mike Gallagher, serious legislator, you know, led the China Committee, pushed the TikTok ban, which is actually a pretty good bill. And -- but he's leaving because besides that, it's a performance art theater.I mean, that's really what the House has become is performance theater, mainly for the Republicans. It's all about how loud and angry can you be because you'll get retweets. You'll get, you know, Instagram. You'll be on the news. It's all about trying to yell at whoever's testifying in front of your committee so that Fox News covers it that night. And that's like a huge win in the office. And everybody in your staff celebrates because you made the clip-on Hannity or whatever. And so, there's a lot of people that are serious that are just saying it's not worth it. I mean, Congress hasn't had a pay raise since 2006. I don't say that for sympathy for anybody. But every year, you know, with inflation, they're basically being paid less. And the only people that are coming are those that are independently wealthy or this is the best job they can get or they just want to come and be instantly famous. So, I'm long term optimistic, honestly, because I think the American people -- I've been traveling around a lot, they're sick of this. And when America is sick of something, they rise up and change it. But in the short term, we have to recognize what this problem is in order to confront it and change it.

SHUMAKERWhile you're outside, even if you're not in the path of totality, here's a great thing that you probably notice, listen carefully, you might hear all the birds stop singing. So, as it starts to get dark, you're suddenly going to hear all the birds expecting or reacting as if it's late at night. That's the one thing that's probably going to be pretty notable. You're going to see -- you're going to hear birds acting like it's the middle of the night. And then as the sun comes back, those bird songs are going to slowly going to continue again. That's one of the things that I think we probably can count on. But again, the animals are very bright, very practical, very good at reading the signals around them, and that would be a very normal behavior for birds when it starts to get dark.",

It was a 13-hour closure on the highway in terms of damage.We were told that no structures have been damaged as of yet, but there were two firefighters that were injured. So, we're talking road closures, some evacuation orders and many, many people left without power for hours. You know, this is just the perfect combination of the very strong winds, hurricane force winds with the very dry conditions. So, it affected most of the western half of the southern and central plains. Actually, about 10 million people were under red flag warnings in the plains. And in Oklahoma, firefighters were battling flames in different counties, six different counties, different fires. And they had to bring in air resources. We were told that after those resources came in, they were able to lift some of the evacuation orders early this morning and late last night. We do not know the status of the firefighters at the moment, but we know that the two of them were taken to the hospital for burn injuries. Now, in Colorado this morning, 300,000 people were left without power. We got updated numbers just a few minutes ago, and we were told now 125,000 people are still without power. And some of those outages were programmed and scheduled to help people ahead of time. Others were, because of the weather, officials saying that people still need to be careful because any fire in that area that starts will likely be very difficult to contain, Jessica.",

The legendary coach leading her Gamecocks to an undefeated season, clinched with that national title, which hasn't happened since 2016 by UConn beating, of course, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Caitlin Clark. She had 30 points in this game, but it wasn't enough -- not enough, really, impressive from the bench, really, that -- they really didn't put up numbers that we were expecting to see to make the game even closer toward the end. But still, what an outstanding player. Even Dawn Staley herself said that Caitlin Clark can be credited for lifting up this game of basketball. Certainly, though, that is the last time Caitlin Clark will be putting on an Iowa jersey, ending her career there at Iowa as she is going to the WNBA. But what an incredible game. So much energy in front of a sold-out crowd. South Carolina clinching the national championship. Jessica?",
