She didn't answer.

Bret said, okay, that's fair, Madam Vice President, but it didn't occur under the Trump administration, what about your position? She didn't answer it. There were a lot of unanswered questions.

I disagree with both of you, because I hate to break up such a lovely bromance but what happened here is as follows: she went into hostile territory, and in our media environment, it's a Rorschach test. And so, everyone's going to take from this what they want. There were very strong moments that she had, specifically on defending democracy and on the statements that Donald Trump has made, and that is going to be clipped and that's going to be sent around and people who are persuadable will look at that and say she did well. And there are going to be clips on her responses on immigration and people who are persuadable and think that immigration is a serious issue are going to look at that and think she did poorly. And that is the environment in which we live. But I do agree that this is a very good thing for her to do, because at this point, she needs to go on as many places as she can and she needs to get everyone talking about her because there are no big moments anymore.

They'll reopen at 7:00 a.m., and some breaking news just in the last few moments, a Georgia judge has now thrown out more than a half dozen of those controversial rules from the GOP-led state election board critics. Say that two of them were most problematic. One that would have given county officials an opportunity to create a reasonable inquiry. They say that that might have delayed certification. Another one would have given those officials the opportunity to look at any election related documents. The judge said that those rules were illegal unconstitutional and void -- Erin. BURNETT: All right. Well, thank you very much. I know everyone's been those -- those rules are so crucial and if the nation is waiting on the results from the state of Georgia, crucial to Georgia's counting of votes. Victor, thank you so much. Just amazing to think about it, 12 to 13 percent of the early vote -- the vote in Georgia, how many people voted last time could be in by the end of this week, think about what that could mean, if it continues to exceed expectations about how many people have voted before election day even comes around. OUTFRONT now is Latosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a national organization focused on getting Black voters to the polls. So, LaTosha, I know your organization is based in Atlanta. Black voters in Georgia account for 30 percent of all voters and obviously, we saw a mixed group of voters today, that Victor was speaking to and you just heard Gabe Sterling from the secretary of state's office say it's impossible to tell who this early turnout is favoring, traditionally, people would say it favors Democrats, but this is a new world, the rules have changed, you don't mail in, you come in early. Do you think this enthusiasm in Georgia is favoring one candidate over another? LATOSHA BROWN, CO-FOUNDER, BLACK VOTERS MATTER: You know, let me say, I think having a high turnout in Georgia and to break records of people coming out actually strengthens democracy, that ultimately the work that we have done and other groups is to make sure that people feel free and fair the elections, that they're able to get out and to vote and to cast their ballot. So who wins and who benefits what we know right now is I think that all Georgians benefit when we see this kind of turnout, the -- that you have a healthy democracy, you need to have a electorate that is participating and engaging. And so, that's what I'm really happy about. I think it's too early to say what candidate necessarily will benefit from this, but I think there are some signs that this is certainly going to that -- Georgia is certainly in play again.",

But it isn't now, it's, generally, you can tell, all right? Now I'm just curious from your point of view, the current polls that we have show that Harris trails Biden's support among Black men by roughly points.

And so, I think that's part of why we're seeing. I also think another driver though is around misinformation and disinformation. You know, early on, we heard this before, this isn't the first time that I remember in Georgia when we're looking at the Senate race between Senator Warnock and Herschel Walker, we heard that there was going to be this huge exodus of Black men and they were going to vote for a Herschel Walker. It simply did not happen.
