      "sentences": "Well, I don't think there's any real clear insight on motive. But the use of video and social media, either immediately before an attack, or during the attack, is something that we've seen across multiple mass shooters.It really started with the Christchurch shooter, who broadcast his attacks on social media. And others have done that progressively. I think the shooter in Buffalo did the same thing. There have been many others. So this is a bit of a hallmark of mass shooters. And I think that's important, because it does reveal to us, if not motive, it shows us that this shooter was very aware of other shooters. Had probably spent time reading about and researching about other mass shootings and how other mass shooters had done it. And he's left us some other clues about inspiration, if you will. The use of the IED in addition to the firearms. We see that in other mass shootings. Certainly, became a major issue in the Columbine shooting in 1999. And now, of course, we have this connection between the music that he attached to that TikTok video, the same song that Eric Harris, who was a Columbine shooter, allegedly used in the background of his own personal Web site. So we do know that he was very acutely aware of other shooters, and likely spent time studying and maybe obsessing over those events.",

Iowa law has it that a person has to be 21 or older to acquire a handgun or even a permit to carry a weapon.He likely didn't purchase them himself at a store. So what do you make of that? How does law enforcement go about, then, tracking the weapons that he used?",

They're not the sort of weapons we typically see in mass shootings. It's not an A.R.-15 or a high-capacity magazine pistol with larger caliber pistols. They were probably just the ones he could get. And it points out yet another gap in our gun laws, which is there's really no requirements on individuals or families to secure weapons in a consistent and safe way. And to keep them out of the hands of young people who should not be carrying weapons, certainly not be carrying weapons in an unsupervised manner. So here we are with yet another problem in the way that we think about gun safety.",

      "sentences": "Yes, these are the closing argument breeds due today in the civil fraud trial. The attorney general's team is saying they are not seeking more than $370 million.When they sued Donald Trump, they initially sought $250 million. They are significantly increasing the amount of money that they want to recover. That was from improper gains that Trump had received. They prove this, they allege, to the evidence proceeded at the trial. Now in addition from seeking to bar the former president from serving in a business in New York for life, they are also seeking a five-year ban on his sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. And what the attorney general's office argued is that their intent to defraud was inescapable. They say that the myriad deceptive schemes they deployed to inflate assets values and conceal facts were so outrageous that they belie innocent explanations. Now Trump's team argues -- has argued that their financial statements were accurate, that there's no evidence presented in this case that the bank would've given them different interest rate terms had they gotten different financial statements, or the values, the attorney general's office argues, were they accurate values. The judge has already ruled in this case in a summary judgment motion that the financial statements were persistent and fraudulent. The issue now for him is to decide how much money the Trumps would have to pay and whether there is a ban. But there are also six other claims that the attorney general's office is pursuing. That is why it went to trial. That is a conspiracy claim, insurance fraud, falsifying business records and issuing false financial statements. That is up for the judge to decide. Trump's team, again, arguing that there was no intent to defraud here either. Depending on how this plays out -- the judge has issued a scathing opinion just a few weeks ago rejecting Trump's argument for a directed verdict in which he rejected a lot of their testimony and a lot of their legal arguments -- Boris, Brianna?",

That he said he hoped to do that by the end of the month, or at least into February. So then he will then write a written opinion on this. Trump's team has already signaled that they intend to appeal. In fact, a lot of their arguments during the trial, they said to the judge, they had to put it on the record because they intend to appeal this decision. They did not expect him to rule in their favor. So this is far from over, even once the judge's decision is rendered -- Boris, Brianna?",
