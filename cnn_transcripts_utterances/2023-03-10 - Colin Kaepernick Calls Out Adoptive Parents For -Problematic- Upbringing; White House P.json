Should you, as a Black person, have to consider what the name you want to name your child, have an impact on the resume that it's written on? We shouldn't have to have those conversations. But it's a reality of America. You have to deal with the realities of the world in which we live today if you're going to achieve the world that we all see tomorrow. And so, I think for me, listening to him talk about things that parents of any race, unfortunately, have to talk about Black children in a kind of retroactive view, you know, in a -- not looking at it in a 2022 world where we have had a Black president, where we have seen the horrors of George Floyd up front, we know in undeniable manners that the horrors, the evil sins of the origins of slavery and racism, they still have half-life that links us through to this day.

And then right after that, social scientists, most of them are white, wrote studies that looked at sort of what Colin Kaepernick is going through. They looked at Black and biracial and also Korean children who were raised in white homes. And what we knew then, when you look at traditional research, is that most of us are living in white spaces. So, we have no racial mirrors. And I would hope that we can be a little bit compassionate to be adopting and understand that we love our parents, but yet we're trying to figure out how to be Black, authentic, love our parents but love ourselves. We're trying to figure out who we are, and we're trying to, some of us, trying to honor our ancestral heritage. So, when we're trying to figure this out and our parents are living in predominantly white spaces with white friends, and we don't see anybody that looks like us on our -- at our dinner table, we're putting a whole lot of weight and burden on the shoulders of transracial adoptees.

Okay, so -- so, Alisyn -- so, basically, the foundation of transracial adoption is on a color-blind platform and it's tied to federal policy, the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, married with the 1996 American provision (ph). And it basically says we have Black and brown kids languishing in foster care, we need to push them through, and if there are white families, this is a pathway through.So, many of us were raised not to see color. But in my case, even though I grew up in Washington, D.C., I was living in a bubble with my family. My father is from Netherlands, so he obviously likes to speak Frisian and Dutch and wanted us to know about his heritage. What I'm saying is we need to honor our heritage as well.

And now, I'm with people that look different, they have a different rhythm, they have different values, and we are asked with the transracial adoption policy to suck it up, to smile, to be grateful because we just got saved. And so, what I'm asking and what I think Colin is saying is that we're not projects. We're human beings with a spirit, a soul and a body. And we are connected to a legacy. So, white parents, I think, in doing parenting should also recognize they have an onus to do right by us and to do right by the families in which we came from.

Right? I think even when we talk about the comparison to former President Obama, there was a broader context, a more nuanced conversation, because at the of the day, I don't see the harm in parents trying to protect a child from the very real dangers of being a Black child living in America. And if we're going to have the conversations on Monday about having to know that if the police show up, you want to have your hands on the steering wheel and on the dash board, and we are going to have the real conversation about making no sudden moves, and all of a sudden at the same time we are going to start giving other people whiplash for somehow saying you're trying to protect children for this reality, it is a mixed message.
