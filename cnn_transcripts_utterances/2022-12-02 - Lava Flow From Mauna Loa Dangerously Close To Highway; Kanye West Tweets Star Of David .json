So it's not the, necessarily, the lava that's causing the danger, it's the traffic jams?",

It's just behind the camera here, and then it's a little tough to see during the day. I will show you that you can see the big plume, which looks like smoke. That is not smoke. That's been warned by officials to be very toxic gases. And so that's part of the concern here.But then just a little bit farther down, you might be able to see just past what looks almost like another planet's terrain, that is where the lava ends. So that really is about 2.5 miles away from us. And the concern is, it is inching closer, but slowly. Quite literally at a snail's pace, is how it's been described. So, it's headed this direction. They're saying at least another week is what their anticipation is. If it actually ends up getting to that main thorough fare. Right now, though, they're saying they'd able to at least give a couple of days heads up to folks to say, hey, this is going to be closed off. But as far as that fog or volcanic smog is concerned, that's the other thing officials are warning folks, because we've got some wind pushing through. They're saying if it gets to a certain level, then they're monitoring it, then it could become dangerous enough for them to issue some warnings and have folks to remain indoors. And if needed to go beyond that, then it would be rather extreme. But that's what they're saying, the extent of it would be. If you're looking at some of these images, it is night and day and very distinct when you are looking at the glow of the lava in the dark of night versus what we see now. And that's really just the plume in the sky. Those images are so striking. That's what had folks pulling over, wanting to get a feel for what exactly this was like. And it's interesting because you have locals who, some of -- whom haven't seen this in 34 years, some -- or 38 years, some who are younger than that, haven't seen it at all, and they wanted to get a sense of this, too, because for them, it's a spiritual moment. And it's something that as far as not, at least, causing immediate danger to anybody, it's something that they want to take in for a safe distance. Victor and Alisyn?",

Some people would attribute his start of his real issues once that happened. We've seen him now become divorced, so he doesn't have the support of a wife or that family anymore. We've also, you know, seen a lot of his friends say, we've been trying to stick by you, we just can't do it anymore. I think people were coming to his aid, trying to help him. We've seen different times when he's, you know, lashed out or spoken out. We've seen some of his friends, whether it be a celebrity friends, try to rush to his aid. But now it seems like people are saying enough, because you -- there are things sometimes you can't come back from. And, you know, people, I think they think of themselves and say, I don't want to be associated with someone who is spouting the fact that Hitler is -- there are good things to say about Hitler. So I think at this time, people are just -- whether they're doing it behind the scenes, that's another story, but the public face of it is just, I don't want to have anything to do with him.",

I mean, there are a couple of things at play. For one, media at large doesn't give a damn about hip hop culture, generally speaking.Half the people in conversation about Kanye right now couldn't name an album. And yet there are people who are -- who have spent their entire lives devoted to his artistry. So I think in one respect, there's a conversation about his artistic contribution that people wrestle with when it comes to the question of Michael Jackson and R. Kelly and all kinds of folks who have agreed particular groups. And there's a question of whether or not one should really indulge. I think the other thing, though, in my criticism of the media of which I am a part, I think that there's an overvaluing. I've been really thinking about this. I'm like, listen, there are rappers who have clothing lines even, and popular famous wives. There are some that have existed before. Kanye, exists in the world alongside of him, and for some reason, there's a particular amount of attention that we're giving to this story. I'm starting to wonder, is Kanye in and of himself, even the story? Are we somehow contributing to this manic episode and making everyone have to partake in something that's very hurtful for many, many people? And, you know, is he really the headline? I really just had to parse that a little bit this morning, thinking about him. Obviously, he's way out of pocket. This is a very sick person. Marc Lamont Hill tweeted the other day that, you know, he was trash. This isn't just about someone misunderstood, this is someone who was actually trash. And I don't think that any of us can debate that at this point, whatever community you're seated in. But with respect to how you age him, I think it is different for different groups. And I just wonder if the media itself is being a bit disingenuous about kind of chasing and inflating this story, and the importance of someone who's -- how important is Kanye? You know, like, when you really think about it, to the communist, it's like, is it really fair (ph) --",

I do understand the value in it, because he does have a following and he does reach people. And we've seen it. We've seen it play out after he says the most ridiculous things. We see people hang banners over the freeway in Los Angeles. There are people who can't parse the difference between what he says and what is reality.

Of course, he's known as Captain America, even though he isn't captain of this side. It's the side that came into the World Cup with basically no World Cup experience. 25 of the 26 man squad have never played in this tournament before, but they are getting better and better with every game. They need him against the Netherlands because they are the underdogs. They've only scored two goals in this tournament so far. And Pulisic has been involved in both of them. And so, I think the United States are really good to go. And this is a knockout game, it's win or go home. But in these kinds of games, when they're competitive, anything can happen.
