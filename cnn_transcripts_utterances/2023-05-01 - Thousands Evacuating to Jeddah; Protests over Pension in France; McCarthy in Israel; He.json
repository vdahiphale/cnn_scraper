These protests have been over that controversial pension reform that was signed into law three weeks ago by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. It raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Huge crowds are expected on this May Day, which is France's labor day. CNN correspondent Melissa Bell is on the streets of Paris for CNN thismorning.

But as you can see, the crowds are gathering already.I'm just going to give you an idea of what the streets around the Place de la Republique look like. You can see there the balloons. Those are the trade union balloons that will be part of the march once it eventually gets going. As you can see always, it's well organized. You come. You have a hot dog. They hang out for a bit before they get going. Up there, on the Place de la Republique, you can see one protester has got up there already with his German flag. A reminder that it isn't just in France today that they're protesting, Kaitlan. This is happening in other European countries and over similar issues, the cost of living, inflation. You mentioned the pension reform. That has, of course, been at the heart of the protests here in France ever since that protest movement began on January 19th. But today, of course, is May the 1st. This is about a much wider series of issues that people want to protest about. Inflation, the cost of living, every May the 1st the French come out and demonstrate. They take to the streets. What authorities are expecting today as a result of that pension reform protest is that this could be one of the biggest May the 1st protests that we've seen in a long time, or even ever. So, we're expecting to see large numbers. The authorities say 500,000 to 600,000 across the country. The unions expecting far, far more people to turn out, Kaitlan.",

Remember, this does arise, not just at the time of the \"Pro Publica\" report, but it seems like, you know, every other week we're hearing more about justice who received trips or gifts and did not put them on their financial disclosure forms. The justices, when they said they weren't going to come, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement that included several guidelines that the justices say they follow when deciding whether their off-bench behavior is ethical. The subtext of all that was though, we know best, we're being wrongly criticized and we're also under serious threat in regard to conflicts of interest for speeches or appearances they might make. They said those have to be assessed in the eyes of a reasonable, unbiassed observer who would be aware of all the relevant facts. Again, the tone is, we will know best what to do. And then, at the end of this statement, they said, you know, we're not going to disclose things that could possibly put us under any kind of physical threat. They reinforced, you know, their -- the very real truth that many people in Washington and in the judiciary have been threatened in recent months and years. But it's almost as if they're saying, again, we know best. We're wrongly - we're being wrongly criticized. And we can assess exactly what you need to know, which is not going to be a helpful situation for outsiders, watchdog groups and people on The Hill trying to assess whether they are operating with any kind of ethical guardrails.",

Said, we do not know.And then for Justice Alito to make this claim without revealing any kind of evidence, but at the same time not revealing evidence but suggesting it was from somebody on the left, really is another thing that kind of shakes your confidence in the institution, because I have to say, when you step back and think about how that leak affected deliberations and affected the majority that Samuel Alito had to reverse nearly a century of reproductive rights, that leak froze in his votes.
