We're breaking down the military options.Also tonight, Israeli Special Forces conduct a deadly raid on a West Bank hospital disguised as medical staffers and other civilians. We'll take you inside the operation. Plus, there's breaking news on a huge controversy hanging over Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia. The top prosecutor just entered an agreement, that means he won't be questioned in court tomorrow about his alleged affair with the district attorney. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, growing anticipation about how, when and where the United States will respond to the deadly drone strike on American forces in Jordan. President Biden's revelation that he's made a decision is only adding to questions right now about what happens next. Our correspondents are standing by over at the White House and the Pentagon. First, let's go to CNN Senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee. MJ, what do we know about the president's decision? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we know that the White House has been extremely careful to avoid telegraphing any moves in advance. But, of course, the president and his national security advisers have been waiting for days now exactly what kind of retaliatory strike to take. And officials have made clear that what is to come is likely to be more serious and powerful than some of the strikes that we have seen in the past in Iraq and Syria, and that they are considering a range of options that include strikes that could be multi-pronged, that could happen in stages. And when the president spoke with reporters earlier today, he made very clear that, in his mind, there is one country that is responsible for the deaths of these three Americans. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I do hold them responsible in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people who did it. I don't think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That's not what I'm looking for. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He says he doesn't want a bigger war, but he also wants to respond with serious force. So, how does he do that without a major escalation?We're also seeing the president grappling with the reality that some of these strikes from the U.S. in the past clearly have not been successful in terms of deterrence. And so when the president was asked by our colleague, Arlette Saenz, what will be different about the strikes this time, he simply answered, we'll see.",

We are told that the president expressed his gratitude, his sorrow to these families, and promised that the country would continue honoring their service to the country.We're also learning that, on Friday, the president does plan to attend the dignified transfer of their remains at Dover Air Force Base. We are told that the president actually asked the families in these phone calls whether that would be okay with them and that they gave their permission and encouraged him to be there. And so these three Americans that were killed obviously very much changing the calculation and also just bringing to clarity the cost of this ongoing conflict and the situation in the Middle East for the United States and this president and this White House, Wolf. BLITZER: Interesting. All right, M.J. Lee, thank you very much. Let's go to our Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann right now. Oren, what are you learning?

Did they give you an update -- I know you can't give us a lot of specifics, but did they give you an update on this drone attack? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): They did, Wolf, and thanks for having me. And they did. And it was a pretty somber meeting, because of course, you just look at those photographs of Sergeant's Water and Moffett and Sanders, and you just see these young people who didn't deserve this coming. So, it was a sobering moment. But, yes, as you might imagine, we have a lot of eyes and ears in the region. We have a pretty good idea of how this raid was undertaken, who was behind it, no surprise. We may not know precisely exactly how directly the Iranians were engaged here. But they trained, they funded, they armed these groups. And so there was a lot of conversation about that. And there was a lot of conversation about really achieving the twin very difficult objectives here, sending a very strong message that this will not be tolerated, and it cannot happen again, deterring as you would. But also, again, since neither the United States nor Iran wants a full-out shooting war, how do we do that without increasing the probability of that happening? That's a very tough needle to thread.",

But if you abide by the principle of not substantially escalating to a point where Iran would feel the need to go after more Americans, to kill more Americans, but that, in fact, the message should be about deterring future activity, you're going to do two things. You're not just going to take a strong strike. You're going to take out as much equipment, logistic routes, maybe leaders, as you can. But you're going to be very, very careful about doing something that the Iranians would perceive as substantially escalatory.If we undertook an attack in Iran, no question that that would be viewed as escalatory. And, you know, you could imagine circumstances where that wouldn't be too big a deal if you sort of took out an isolated factory and nobody died. On the flip side, of course, anytime you're operating militarily, you can't be perfectly precise. And if we go in and kill a whole bunch of Iranian civilians, I think we all would recognize that that would be a fairly dramatic response. And now all of a sudden the leadership of this appalling regime in Iran is being looked to for what they're going to do to respond to our escalatory activity. So, you know, you never take anything off the table, but you do want to be very, very careful about inching towards a wider regional war in what is already a very complicated situation.",

He's been paid over $650,000 on this case, while the other contract attorneys on the case have been paid under $100,000. And then, as Paula said, that some of that money was used to pay for personal recreation for Wade and for the D.A. So, none of that goes away.

The simple fact is it still puts a cloud over the work of the prosecutor's office and those are two very different things. People -- adults can engage in various forms of conduct or misconduct that may not run afoul of the law but it still casts doubt on the public's faith in the integrity of an investigation and this continued cloud is going to stay over the case if any of these people are going to come up and testify.",

If the judge hears all the facts and decides there is a conflict of interest relating to the hiring of Wade, the payment of money, the use of that money on the D.A.And if we want precedent, look at this case, because during the investigative phase about a year ago, Fani Willis was, in fact, disqualified from a piece of it because she created a political conflict of interest for herself when she subpoenaed someone and then did a political fundraiser for that person's political opponent. So, she already has been disqualified from a small piece of this case and that same rationale could be used to disqualify her from the larger case. As to the second possibility, dismissal of the charges, that feels remote to me because this doesn't have to do with the actual criminal allegations against Trump and the others.",

Initially, it was Republicans who were demanding policy changes when it comes to the southern border in exchange for Ukraine aid. But now, many Republicans, including Trump and the new speaker, are saying that the Biden administration already has the power to act and that Congress does not need to pass legislation in order to secure the southern border. Our Manu Raju asked the speaker whether Republicans are just doing Trump's bidding here and trying to help him politically. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): No, Manu, that's absurd. We have a responsibility here to do our duty. Our duty is to do right by the American people to protect the people. The first and most important job of the federal government is to protect its citizens. I have talked to former President Trump about this issue at length, and he understands that. He understands that we have a responsibility to do here. The president, of course, President Trump, wants to secure the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZANONA: So, Johnson denying any political motivations here, although he did acknowledge that he has talked to the former president at length about this issue. But even though Johnson says they're not trying to help Trump politically, some of his own members are saying something different. I talked to Troy Nehls just a little bit ago.
