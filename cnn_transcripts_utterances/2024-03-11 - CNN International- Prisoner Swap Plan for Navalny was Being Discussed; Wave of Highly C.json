If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with some of today's top stories.At least four major news agencies have withdrawn an image of Catherine, the Princess of Wales, and her three children, claiming the photo has been manipulated. The picture was released Sunday by Kensington Palace, the first official image of the princess since her abdominal surgery in January. Portugal's center-right democratic alliance narrowly won Sunday's parliamentary elections, getting nearly 30 percent of the vote. The results are not yet final and will take up to two weeks to validate. But the leader of the incumbent center-left socialist party has already conceded. The British-based cosmetics company The Body Shop has filed for bankruptcy and is shutting down all of its stores in the U.S. It also plans to close dozens of stores in Canada. The Body Shop was founded in 1976 by environmental campaigner Anita Roddick. Turning now to the ever-worsening situation in Haiti, where escalating violence prompted diplomatic evaluations from Port-au-Prince this weekend. Our Patrick Oppmann brings us the details, including what the future may hold for the embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is one of those every so often moments because international journalists in most cases are prohibited from being here on Tiananmen Square from reporting from here let alone broadcasting live. It's a reflection of the politics or the security, the surveillance that we have seen develop in China over the years. However the National People's Congress is seen as one of those exception events and we are able to be here live today.As far as this gathering the 3,000 delegates of China's rubber stamp legislature very much according to script but we did get some ideas as to where China may be going in the future. First of all it was here that we learned of an economic target a growth target of around five percent for the year ahead. We heard lots about China doubling down on science and technology as part of its future focusing on things perhaps such as artificial intelligence and its electric vehicle industry. We also learned of China's future ambitions -- military ambitions to again increase military spending. We also got a look perhaps behind what Xi Jinping himself may be thinking in the future. This is a gathering that normally ends with the premier giving a news conference. It's a tradition that we have seen for the last 30 years but this year that did not happen. It was cancelled. Some analysts feel it's a way for Xi Jinping to show his strength, to show his in-charge reputation as China moves into a new era dealing with an economy that has been murky as well as a whole other host of domestic issues. Bianca, this is going to be perhaps a guide map a road of some of the things themes that we'll hear from China in the year ahead.",

Sunday's blockbuster between powerhouse rivals Liverpool and defending champs Manchester City.Both teams going into the game playing catch-up with new leaders Arsenal who'd beaten Brentford on Saturday. This, remember, Jurgen Klopp's farewell season at Liverpool. Huge respect between Klopp and counterpart Pep Guardiola as the pair locked horns for the last time in the Premier League. This was an absolutely superb contest between two great sides and it would be the champions ahead after just 23 minutes. A well-drilled corner routine as defender John Stones who opens the scoring. The injury-hit Reds though were transformed in the second half Darwin Nunez's foul by City keeper Ederson after a poor back pass. And World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister making no mistake from the penalty spot for one all. It would be all Liverpool at this point just past the hour mark. It's the sub Mo Salah with a wonderful through ball and Luis Diaz certain to score you think but the chance is squandered. And then more drama to come a minute from time as City's Jeremy Doku has a good chance himself but his effort hits the inside of the post right in front of the cuff there and then the young Belgian player at the center of a highly controversial moment deep into stoppage time, the contact, the high boot into the chest of Mac Allister. No penalty given though. An absorbing match ends on his evening and just look at the emotional hug there between Klopp and Guardiola the mutual respect between these two rival head coaches. Once again on full display. What a game this was.",
