What do they think about Biden's health? Do they think he's up to the job for another four years? Can either party break out of the demographic and geographic trends that we have seen that have essentially left us in something very close to a stalemate over a decade? And finally, does that Republican House do more damage to Biden through their investigations? Or do they do more damage to the GOP brand through the way they -- by potentially reinforcing this image of extremism that hurt Republicans so much in blue and purple states.

You know, if you read between the lines, what President Zelenskyy is saying without saying it when he says difficult and painful is that there are casualties. Casualties numbers that go unreported here in Ukraine, but yet, nonetheless, the troops there are taking a very heavy hit and on the Russian side, presumably as well, because both sides have been lobbing each other with artillery. Not to mention the fact that these areas are so heavily filled with landmines that it makes it very difficult to make any advance. That's why the frontlines in the Donbas have essentially been more or less unchanged despite relentless attacks from both sides, trying to take territory from each other. It's a very dire situation indeed. There are still millions of people without power as a result of Russian airstrikes even though the power situation has been slowly improving. But just within the last few minutes, Kaitlan, the air raid sirens went off again in Kyiv which of course has the nation bracing for the potential of another Russian attack. There are also cyberattacks that have increased threefold just in the last two years. They're saying 4500 cyberattacks targeting military targets but also civilian infrastructure so far this year.

There's another biography of him provided by the National Republican Congressional Committee where he -- where it says that he attended NYU. He now says that he'd never graduated from any institution of higher learning. We still don't know about his educational background. That's kind of a hole there.In an interview with The New York Post and in WABC, he said that he misspoke when he said he worked directly for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. If you look at an earlier version of his campaign biography, he's very specific about not just the job titles there, but the order in which he had those positions.

My colleague Grace Ashford and I reviewed obituaries and news coverage of all 49 victims who died in that shooting, and we couldn't find any four that worked for the same company, let alone one of the ones in Mr. Santos' biography.I think that there's still a lot to explore here. We still don't know what company he's speaking of. We know that he did spend some time in Orlando and in Florida in 2016. He was registered to vote there in that election. So, I think we're still exploring exactly the nature of those claims. You know, onto the other point, he's also claimed that his grandparents fled Holocaust-era persecution in Europe. CNN, as you know, and the Forward, a Jewish publication, have both reported suggesting that may not be the case. The Times has not independently verified or confirmed that.",
