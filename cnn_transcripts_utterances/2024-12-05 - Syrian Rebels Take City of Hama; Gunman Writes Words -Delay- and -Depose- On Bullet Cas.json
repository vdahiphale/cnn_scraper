Hama has never been under rebel control. And certainly, this is a real body blow for a regime that many thought had survived, so far, this civil war. Kate?",

A new twist from police as the manhunt reaches a fever pitch.Pete Hegseth vows to stop drinking if he is confirmed as defense secretary. Will those words have the impact he hopes they will, as we're getting new reporting on where his nomination stands this morning. And maybe not so prime. Paying for two-day delivery, sometimes overnight delivery on Amazon, but never getting it. A new lawsuit. Sara is out today. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. All right, we want to get to the very latest reporting on the manhunt for a killer here in New York. And there is new information just in on the search for this person who killed health care CEO Brian Thompson 24 hours ago. Words very much written on shell casings of rounds found at the scene. There had been some confusion in some places about that. Law enforcement sources tell CNN that two words were found, \"delay\" and \"deposed.\" \"Deposed\" was written on a shell casing from a round that was fired at the victim. Delay was written on a live round not fired but ejected when the shooter appeared to be clearing a jam. There are images of the suspect at Starbucks also leaving a subway station. Police also have video obtained by \"The New York Times\" of him talking on a phone just minutes before the murder. This, as Thompson's widow now reveals to NBC, quote, \"I don't know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\" But let's get to the shell casing and the words written on them. With us now, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. You've got new information, and also, I think a new visual representation of what we're talking about.",

So that's a shell casing that's found on the ground, and they find these tiny letters on it. \"Delay\" is found on a live round. That's a full bullet that he probably ejected trying to clear that jam. Those are the two words they found. But investigators doing research into what could this mean, \"delay,\" \"depose,\" found the maxim of deny, delay, depose, variations of the maxim deny, delay, defend, which is actually the name of a book. These are sayings, and you can find them all over the Internet and reddit and other postings about insurance company practices of trying to find ways out of paying on claims that they are disputing.So what they believe is the killer was sending a message. Now this is a nine-millimeter round. This is the shell casing, the silver part, the copper part is the actual bullet. And to write something on something this small, and I mean, John, picture how you would try to do that. Would you take a fine point sharpie? Would you try to scratch it in? It means someone went to a lot of trouble to try and create this message that would be left at the scene. Now he's missing the third word. So if this is the maxim he's trying to tell us about, is that bullet still in the magazine remaining unfired that left with his getaway? Is it on one of the other shell casings but it burned off as it was fired and ejected? We don't know that yet.",

So sometimes executives say, I'll have a detail at my house, but I'm not going to have any protection while I'm traveling, because they live under the false assumption that nobody understands where they are.But this is a public meeting, a publicly advertised meeting, location and time. Everyone knows that he will be there. It's a very simple equation. For someone stalking someone online and doing research to put together that this could be a good place, and notwithstanding the cameras, it's a very easy task to find them, and then to do whatever it is that you want to do with them.",

Clearly, they have, clearly, they have a list of clues that they're running on and are aware of the direction he traveled and the way he did it. My assumption is that he was there a day or so if not longer in advance conducting pre-attack surveillance. So it would be good time for NYPD to look at those cameras in that location. There could be a time where he wasn't wearing a mask on the day of the shooting. So I think there's some good clues there.

I think it's unusual that someone that well prepared and effective inadvertently dropped his cell phone at the scene. It sometimes takes a day or two to get into those phones. I'm wondering what messaging is on that cell phone. Is someone trying to explain themselves in a burner phone that might have one or two pages of information on it?

New reporting from \"The Washington Post\" cites former Fox News employees who say they witnessed it, saying they saw him \"drinking on the job or visibly drunk at work events.\" These revelations leading to Hegseth facing blunt questions from senators in closed-door meetings already according to a Trump transition source questions like -- are you an alcoholic? Are you a womanizer? Did you embezzle money? CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach for us. Quite the question to be facing when you're trying to lock in support for a Cabinet position.

He didn't want to waste the political capital. As of right now, Donald Trump believes there is still a pathway for Hegseth, and were told he's going to stand by him while that pathway exists. Now, as you mentioned, it is a rough starting point when you're meeting these senators for the first time and they are asking -- if you are an alcoholic, if you are a womanizer -- particularly after what we have seen is this drip, drip of news reports and allegations from his past that do involve these kinds of damning allegations when it comes to being drunk at work events or drinking too excessively.

There was a line that these senators weren't going to cross, and that he would have to expend all of his political capital on Matt Gaetz when there were several other picks who might be a little bit less controversial, but he would also still need to step in for. He decided that that was too heavy of a lift. Right now, what I'm being told is because of these behind-the-scenes conversations that these transition members are having, that the vice president-elect is having with these various senators they still believe that there is a pathway for Hegseth. Of course, all of this could change if there's more information that comes out, how this plays out.

I mean, mostly they're going to be meeting with people who are already open to many of the ideas they are floating. It is also, again, a blockbuster day on the Hill because of these ongoing meetings with people like Pete Hegseth. We saw yesterday, as Kristen was pointing out just a few minutes ago that these meetings on Capitol Hill were really sort of twofold. One, senators wanted answers about Hegseth's past and some of the questions that have arisen about his private actions. They also were trying to educate him and his team about how grueling this process is going to be. We are still likely weeks, if not months away from a final vote on someone like Pete Hegseth. And right now, you know, they are having conversations about just so you know, this is the kind of question that is going to come up in a confirmation hearing. One of the people I talked to yesterday, Kevin Cramer, who sat down with Hegseth after that meeting, said that he told Hegseth directly, I am one of the nicer members on this committee you are going to be facing really hard questions in a public setting, just sort of level setting and preparing Hegseth for what's to come -- John.",

And also, putting forth misleading advertising about deliveries. So, instead of using those Amazon branded vehicles that we've all become accustomed to seeing, Amazon essentially was using the Postal Service and UPS and the lawsuit found that there was a dramatic impact, as you would imagine, on delivery speeds, right, that in those two zip codes, they were excluded they were getting their deliveries, their Prime deliveries within two days, just 24 percent. When you compare that to the rest of DC, 75 percent of the deliveries in the rest of DC were arriving within two days. And here's the kicker, the Washington, DC attorney general's office says that the company was not upfront when customers complained about this, that Amazon \"concealed\" the exclusion and misled the consumers to believe it was a coincidence.
