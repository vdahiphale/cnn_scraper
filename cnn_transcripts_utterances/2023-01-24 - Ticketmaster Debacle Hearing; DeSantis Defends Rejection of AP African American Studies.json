We'll see you a little bit later in the show.This morning, a multiday severe weather threat is beginning as a cross-country storm is said to bring snow, possibly tornadoes, from New Mexico all the way to Maine. Our meteorologist Chad Myers is joining us now. Yikes, New Mexico to Maine. CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: All the way, even up into parts of Ontario, Poppy. So, yes, severe weather to the south, rain to the north and then there's that heavy, heavy snow that's already beginning at this hour into parts of west Texas. Heavy rain showers across the hill country. But the big threat today will be south of there, along the Gulf Coast. There is that swath of heavy snow. Winter storm warnings in effect right through here. And this is the area that will see potential for tornadoes. Those wintertime tornados. Right through this area again in the same areas. Not maybe as far north as we had a couple of tornadoes a couple of weeks ago, but this is going to be another storm that runs along the Gulf Coast, uses the Gulf of Mexico moisture and makes significant thunderstorms possible. Even the potential for a little bit of light snow into New York City. Yes, the first possible chance for snow in New York City is coming for this year. Now, it's going to be warming up from where we are now, all the way up -- back up into the 40s. But enjoy a flurry or two, Poppy. I know you had some up in Vermont when you went skiing this weekend.",

Just ten minutes. We can do it. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Just 10. Everyone can do this. Yes so researchers wanted to understand what kind of activity in mid- life, that's my age, might help. And so they took 4,500 individuals in the U.K. They strapped an activity monitor on to their thigh. And they looked at, what did they do during the day. How much did they sleep? When were they active? When were they sedentary? And they basically then gave them a cognitive test and assessed their memory and executive functioning. And they found that if you shifted away from light activity or sedentary activity or sleep to moderate or vigorous activity, even by six to nine minutes, you improved your cognition. Both your memory and what we call executive function, your ability to plan, think, make decisions. The converse was also true. If you shifted -- downshifted from moderate or vigorous activity towards more sleep, sedentary behavior or light activity by about 7 to 10 minutes, you lost about 1 to 2 percent of your cognitive ability. Now, Don, you asked about sleep. They did not find an impact with the amount of time that you slept. You would think if I sleep more, maybe I improve my cognition, but they did not assess sleep quality, which we know is really important.",
