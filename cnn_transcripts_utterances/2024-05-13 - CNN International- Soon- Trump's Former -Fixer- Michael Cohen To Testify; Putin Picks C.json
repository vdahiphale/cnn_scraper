But, I think that in the closing argument is where they're really going to explain it's not their problem that Michael Cohen has these foibles, that he is not trustworthy, that he is a liar. I mean, he has admitted and been convicted of lying. It's Donald Trump's problem. And they will have to deflect all of this unsavory characterassassination and put it back on Trump and say, you know who picked Michael Cohen? Donald Trump did. We didn't. The state of New York didn't. And in fact, Donald Trump's entire defenses, he was such a good lawyer. I paid the $130,000 for his lawyering skills, including bonuses and covering his taxes. That's their defense. So, they can't now separate themselves from the unsavory parts of Michael Cohen.",

They ran stories about his opponents, about Ted Cruz being all sorts of outrageous things that only American media could allege, and that it was Trump and Cohen that actually orchestrated all of that.So, they have laid the groundwork. And we know that Cohen has previously pled to being directed by Donald Trump and coordinating with Donald Trump to do those things. So, he is on record in a plea dialogue going back to 2018, saying under oath, which may or may not mean a lot with Michael Cohen, that it was Donald Trump who directed him and who coordinated with him to do it.

But, on the other side, Donald Trump has a much longer record of saying things on Twitter, saying things at rallies. One of the things he also tweeted to Cohen was, he is a fine man and he is not going to flip on me. If you didn't do anything wrong, you're not worried about people flipping on you in court.",

And one thing to know about Memorial Day in Israel is it is not only for fallen soldiers, but also for victims of terrorism. So, there is definitely added meeting, added significance to this Memorial Day.But, what we're also seeing today is the fissures in Israeli society that are really showing themselves on this Memorial Day. We have seen protests taking place at several of these ceremonies, at military ceremonies -- cemeteries across the country where members of Netanyahu's government have been speaking. There were dozens of people who appear to walk out in silent protest as the Israeli Prime Minister was speaking at Israel's national cemetery in Jerusalem. The Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, he faced protests from -- with people holding signs saying their blood is on your hands, as he was speaking at a military cemetery in Tel Aviv. And you even saw scuffles breaking out among hecklers, protesters, and those who were trying to silence them at protests at Itamar -- Itamar Ben-Gvir was speaking, for example, at another military cemetery across the country. And so, this is just really a symbol of this moment in time, this traditionally very somber holiday today being marked by protests, by scuffling and shouting matches between people with different points of view, certainly a moment of reflection in Israeli society, but also one, as you are seeing, people increasingly calling for action on this day.",

But, critics are now saying that it really doesn't answer the questions that they were obliged in this report to answer. And one of the excuses that the Secretary of State is giving is, there is an ongoing war. It's a very complex and dangerous situation. They can't have investigators on the ground. So, they can't effectively answer the questions with any kind of real precision.So, the farthest that they went is that it is reasonable to conclude, this report says, that Israel has indeed acted in a number of instances that are not in compliance with international law. The Secretary also saying that Israel has in place a number of measures that they are not always following in order to protect civilians, that Israel has to do more to follow their own guidelines, and that's something we've heard for months now that Israel is not protecting civilians well enough. I would also note that Secretary Blinken is saying clearly that they believe that more civilians have been killed than Hamas militants. We've talked about the death toll for months now since this war began. Secretary Blinken saying clearly that more Gazan civilians have been killed than Hamas militants. The health ministry there saying some 35,000 Gazans have been killed in the past seven months of this war. So, in addition to Senator Merkley, who you spoke with, we've heard from Senator Van Hollen of Maryland who is one of the bigger critics of Israel, who said that the report that came out on Friday doxxed the critical questions at hand and falls woefully short.

The flash flooding in mountainous Baghlan province in northern Afghanistan hit on Friday. Many men were at the mosque for prayers, while women and children stayed home. Their mud-brick dwellings engulfed with raging torrents of water. These four siblings, including two-year-old Arian (ph) were rescued.

This is the roof of the madrasa and the flood has swept everywhere, explains the villager. This man held me tightly, otherwise I was gone. For this little girl, there were no miracles that day. The flood took everything, she cries, shaking. My mother was swept away. In the central hospital of Baghlan province, the bodies of dozens of children have been brought here to prepare for burial.

So, we're anticipating opening statements could begin tomorrow, on Tuesday. The Senator is facing the jury with two co-defendants. The trio have all pleaded not guilty. This is for allegedly engaging in corruption to help the Egyptian and Qatari governments in exchange for some pretty hefty bribes, which are set to include cash, gold bars, even a luxury car. Joining me now from outside that courthouse, CNN National Correspondent Jason Carroll. There is so much interest in this case and specifically in these charges. Some pretty salacious details here. Walk us through those. JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. And he is facing more than a dozen charges, including bribery, extortion, fraud, obstruction of justice, and of course acting as a foreign agent. 16 felony counts in all, adding them all up. Prosecutors are alleging that Senator Menendez and his wife accepted bribes over a period of time in exchange for the Senator's influence with the government of Egypt and the government of Qatar. In addition to Senator Menendez and Nadine Menendez, two New Jersey associates, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are also indicted. And when it comes to what happened here, you look at these bribes. You look at what was found at his home during those search warrants, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash found in his home, stuffed into clothing and in other places. Gold bars found at his home as well. Prosecutors also alleging that Nadine Menendez accepted a Mercedes Benz as a bribe, accepted mortgage payments on her home as well. So, a lot going on here. Senator Menendez throughout all of this, as you know, Erica, has maintained his innocence, said this is the government overreaching, saying that whatever he did, he was doing for the benefit of the people.

But, the campaign is also planning on running a contest to small dollar donors, and having Julia Roberts, having George Clooney out there taping digital videos, videos for social media, to try to draw in some of those grassroots donations as well.But, it's clear that the Biden campaign has seen some type of winning formula when it comes to fundraising with these big events, especially when they feature former President Barack Obama. As you mentioned, that fundraiser with a trio of presidents, Biden, Obama, and also Bill Clinton, back in March raised about $26 million for the campaign in one night alone. They are hoping that this event in -- on the West Coast at some point in mid-June might also be able to bring them an additional a big haul as well. Now, President Biden spends part of the weekend out on the West Coast, doing fundraisers in the Bay Area in California as well as in Seattle. Those fundraisers, we're told, brought in about $10 million. That is a chunk of money that will go towards their May fundraising haul, as we're still waiting to hear how much Biden raised in the month of April. Now, just a few weeks ago, Trump's campaign told donors that he brought in about $76 million in April, the most that the former President would have raised. We're still waiting for those official reports. But, it does come at a time when Biden has enjoyed this cash advantage over Trump. Now, there is an expectation that at some point that could begin to narrow, now that Trump has secured the Republican nomination and is able to rally all of those donors around just him, whereas during the primaries, it was divided a bit more. So, we will see whether there will be any narrowing of that fundraising advantage when the campaign in the coming week is expected to release their fundraising numbers. But, this is an area where the Biden campaign has seen some positive news at a time when Biden has lagged Trump in many polls. And the campaign is hoping they can continue to raise this kind of money to fund the campaign, to fund those advertisements that they're putting on televisions and on digital, as they're really trying to make headway in this race heading into November.",

This week, he is actually going to be here in Washington for most of the week until Saturday and Sunday when he travels down to Georgia for a fundraiser, but also to speak to the commencement ceremony at Morehouse College, a historically black college and university. That will be closely watched, as there are some on campus who are frustrated that the President was invited due to his position when it comes to his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas.

It's also an opportunity, though, we're told, for Meghan to learn a little bit more about her Nigerian lineage.Let's bring in CNN's Stephanie Busari, who live in Lagos this hour. So, overall, how is the trip being perceived?",

What was once thought to be just random bursts of clicking noises made by the creatures turns out to be a communication system which has a fair amount of similarity to human language, according to scientists.Here is Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The clicking noises sperm whales make known as codas have long been known to scientists. But, after years of trying to understand what they mean, researchers now think those random sounds are deliberate. The clicks appear to make up a sort of alphabet, meaning the way sperm whales communicate is more similar to other animals and even humans than once thought.",

Their research suggests sperm whales speak with a certain structure, varying the rhythm and pace of their clicks, sometimes even adding an extra click at the end like a suffix. The next step, though, is to decipher what that structure means, a challenge that will require a closer look at social dynamics.",

And so, a big part of the larger Project CETI effort here is to actually get that behavioral data paired with the communication data in order to answer these deeper questions about what it is that the whales are saying.SOARES (voice-over): It's a project that requires a deep dive into the largest animal brains in the world. And even if we do one day understand what sperm whales are saying, should we try to talk back? Andreas is optimistic that the answers are within reach.",
