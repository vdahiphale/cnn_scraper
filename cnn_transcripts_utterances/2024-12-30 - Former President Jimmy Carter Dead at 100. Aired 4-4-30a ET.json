It is Monday, December the 30th, 9 a.m. here in London.It's 4 a.m. in Plains, Georgia, where reaction is pouring in following the death of the 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. He was 100 years old, living longer than any other U.S. president. The Carter Center says he was surrounded by family when he died on Sunday after being in a home -- in home hospice care rather for nearly two years. Jimmy Carter, known for his dignity and devotion to service, dedicated his life to fighting for human rights and brokering peace in many parts of the world. President Joe Biden has declared January the 9th as a national day of mourning, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship and pay homage to the late leader. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's because Jimmy Carter lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds. Just look at his life, his life's work.He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing and homeless -- for the homeless with his own hands. And his compassion and moral clarity lifted people up and changed lives and saved lives all over the globe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In his foreign policies, he pushed for nuclear nonproliferation, democratic values, and human rights. He cut off military supplies to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and dialed back support for other Latin American leaders in Nicaragua, Argentina and Brazil. One of his signature White House legacies was the Torrijos-Carter treaties that returned the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. He also calmed Mideast tensions, brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance, backed the Afghan mujahedeen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979, Islamic Revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow, spiked oil prices, and led to a humiliating failed raid, Operation Eagle Claw, in April 1980, to rescue Americans captured by the theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

He helped found a group of seasoned international diplomats known as the elders, whose works span the Mideast and far beyond. He helped the charity Habitat for Humanity, change lives, building affordable homes, often showing up to help with construction himself. In 2002, he was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. It was a path he'd picked, a post-presidency with meaning, and he followed it right up to his death. Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thank you for taking time out to speak to us, Leslie, but it's a huge moment, isn't it, for American history and something you'll be speaking to your, you know, your students that you speak to, but also you'll be writing to in your papers, because, you know, he no doubt has a place in history. LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. AND THE AMERICAS PROGRAM, CHATHAM HOUSE: Absolutely. I think for so many people that have studied U.S. domestic politics, America's role on the global stage and especially human rights, it's Jimmy Carter. You know, we think now of human rights and democracy promotion in a very complicated way. But America certainly being deeply involved in those efforts, whether it's, you know, using military force or using foreign assistance, not only was for the better, but Jimmy Carter was really the first American president that put human rights on the map at a time when nobody was thinking about human rights as being important for America's global role or for its foreign policy. And he really took a, you know, values-based presidency and morality-based. He wasn't known as being a, as we've heard so much in the last hours, as being a tremendous president. But those human rights came first, sometimes at the expense of his political support. And it was really that effort that informed his post-presidency work. And I think this is what people will continue to think of him for, not only his work creating the Carter Center and elections monitoring, democracy promotion, serving as an unofficial ambassador, mediating peace around the world, restoring democratic leadership in Haiti, working in Bosnia. But it really is championing those values, but not by advocating that America use military force, boots on the ground. None of that was part of Carter's ambition and certainly not part of his legacy. It was very much about making human rights central as informing conflict mediation. And again, prior to his presidency, they'd been seen as, you know, really at odds with each other, that human rights would get in the way of what America needed to do to deter the Soviet Union around the world and to be a strong, strong superpower.",

But, you know, on the one hand, he was a non interventionist, right?He didn't think America should be using military force to promote democracy. And that's certainly an idea that I think has now come back to the fore in America's foreign relations, certainly with President Trump. But he was values first and he was deeply disturbed by the polarization, by the division in the United States. He you know, as we know, he was very concerned to promote peace in the Middle East. The Camp David Accords were, you know, critical for his legacy, as was that peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. But if you look to the current moment, you know, America's in a one could argue a radically different position than it was during his presidency. It's very hard to map. But what we do know is that there is a deep struggle amongst those who wish to shape America's foreign policy going forward. And Carter's legacy, which is to say, you know, values must come first, that we must be a moral force for good, not with military force, but with the power of our diplomacy, our statecraft, our economic statecraft, that we must support democratic leaders. Those values, I think, are very much, as you've intimated, very much at risk in the current moment. And I think it's one that would have -- did trouble him and would have troubled him had he had he been alive to watch.",

But President Jimmy Carter wasn't afraid to take it on, inviting two of the world's fiercest enemies to the White House retreat at Camp David in 1978. Jimmy Carter had been derided for his administration's foreign policy failures, partly because he's considered to have lost a U.S. friendly Iran to the Ayatollahs. But the Camp David Accords were his geopolitical triumph. He managed to strike a deal between Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat.
