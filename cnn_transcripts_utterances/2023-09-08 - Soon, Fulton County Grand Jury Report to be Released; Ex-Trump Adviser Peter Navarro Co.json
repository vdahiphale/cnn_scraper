Now, in some ways, this was not a surprise.

Now, unsurprisingly, Peter Navarro is out there trying to spin what happened in court. Take a listen to what he had to say.

You saw the opening argument of John Crab (ph), the attorney for the prosecution. He didn't argue the case on contempt.

And majority don't think that Biden inspires confidence. They don't think he's helped the economy. They have obviously very significant concerns about his age. You're really good at kind of stepping back and giving the bigger picture, particularly when it comes to one poll.When you looked through these numbers, what stood out to you?",

Other things are going to come and go, be they on a domestic front or on a global scale. But that which ails the president most, according to that poll and every other poll -- and, by the way, that's of significance. The CNN poll is not an outlier. It's consistent with so much other data. What ails him the most can't be fixed, and it's the age issue.And if there are considerations, if there are concerns about his age, at 80, he's going to have to sell his ability to be 86 when he leaves and still in command. I don't know how he can get around that. So, I maintain he needs a competitive Democratic nomination process. The best thing for him is to have competition, get on a debate stage. And I don't just mean with RFK Jr., but including RFK Jr., but Gavin Newsom, let them all come and let him fight for it, because only then will he be able to convince that he really can go the distance.",

He said, this is about coughs and check engine lights. And what he meant is how close Americans are to the brink on bills. Like if you have a cough and you can't afford to go to the doctor, right, you're concerned, if you have a car and the check engine light is blinking and you feel like you don't have the $1,000 to just get it assessed, to get it fixed.It made me look at it in a different lens, that even though all of these economic numbers look good on the surface for the president, if the American people don't feel it, does it matter?",
