They say at this point they will be taken by ambulances of the Palestinian Red Crescent and they are at this time waiting for Israeli bulldozers to open the way.

They have to be planned in advance and throughout with the military forces. And of course, we need those security guarantees and the safe passage to the hospital. Yesterday, our team was on the ground for many hours because, you know, normally driving from Rafah to Al-Shifa would take 45 minutes. It took several hours yesterday because of the security concerns. In fact, the team only had an hour on the ground before they had to leave again. So detailed planning, detailed discussions with the military forces to do what we call deconfliction and ensure that safe passage. We expect to have a series of convoys over the coming days to bring patients down to two main hospitals in the south, the European hospital and NASA hospital. The big concern there is, of course, those hospitals are already overwhelmed. And now they're going to have, again, this very heavy patient burden because the remaining 291 patients, they have very complicated conditions. The 32 babies that were mentioned earlier, who are critically ill, well over 200 severely injured patients, including 29 patients with spinal injuries and burns and so on. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The President and administration officials have instead pushed for humanitarian pauses for the release of hostages held by Hamas, but also to get aid into Gaza. Now, the President went on to say that Israel should respect humanitarian law and protect innocent civilians.

It could also, the lava flow, simply bury the town. The geothermal power plant and the Blue Lagoon would be in harm's way. So what is being done now is to build some, not barriers, to prevent the lava, but barriers to redirect the lava because you really cannot stop a lava flow.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

If we look over there, way in the distance, you can see some steam that is coming up next to that mountain there. I actually hope that you can see it, but it is a pretty clear day. That is that very geothermal power plant that that gentleman was just talking about there. And he was saying that they are trying to not build a barrier, but something to try and redirect that lava flow.And I don't know if you were able to see just before he was speaking here on our live shot, there was a truck that went through there. That's because those crews are working 24-7. We were here until very late at night, last night, also reporting from this area. And I can tell you that throughout the night, there have been trucks going in and out as they are trying to build a trench or some sort of other way to redirect the lava, if in fact it flows towards that geothermal power plant. Again, very dicey situation on the ground here. The authorities have it under control, but they do say that it is an extremely dangerous situation just down the road, Kim.",

Many of them are housed in museums because of their historical significance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEAN PIERRE OSENAT, AUCTIONEER (through translator): And so people recognize this hat everywhere. When they see it in the battlefields, they knew Napoleon was there. And when he's in private, he always had it on his head or he had it in his hand, and sometimes he threw it on the ground. That was the image, the symbol of the emperor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
