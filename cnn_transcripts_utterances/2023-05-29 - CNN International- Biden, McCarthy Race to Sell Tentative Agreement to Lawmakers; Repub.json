A public holiday, a national public holiday has been declared in the country. So, people are pretty much just staying at home. The security forces have warned in no uncertain terms that if you have no business around Eagle Square, where the inauguration is taking place, that you should not be anywhere near it. And they have suggested they will use force if people come to that area and they're not supposed to be there without an invitation for example. And also, on social media there is a hashtag that is going on that is saying Tinubu is not my president. So, as you heard in that report, the elections polarized the country. And Tinubu's closest rivals are currently in court. So, there is a lot of tension around these inaugurations. It's the first time really where the streets are kind of very deserted, and people at home. There's no sense of any festivities or any kind of jubilation. It feels almost, some believe, like just a private party with the ruling APC party and their supporters.
