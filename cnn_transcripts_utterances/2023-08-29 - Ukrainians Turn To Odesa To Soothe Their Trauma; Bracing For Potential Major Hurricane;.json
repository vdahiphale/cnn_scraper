We begin with the disgraced head of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, now the focus of a criminal investigation with prosecutors looking into possible charges of sexual assault.At a six-hour long emergency meeting, Monday, of the regional bodies, which make up the federation, ended with a request for his immediate resignation. All this over his behavior at the Women's World Cup, including that kiss with the star player during the trophy ceremony. Luis Rubiales has insisted the kiss was spontaneous and mutual. But Jenni Hermoso, at no point did she say she gave consent. She called the move sexist. Regional soccer chiefs have issued a statement condemning his behavior as unacceptable and seriously damaging the image of Spanish football. Rubiales has already been suspended by FIFA for 90 days. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Madrid Monday, demanding Rubiales step down. They chanted, it's not a kiss, it is aggression. But Rubiales, with the unanimous backing of the Football Federation, is vowing to fight on. Meanwhile, there are concerns the lingering controversy will hurt Spain's bid to co-host the 2030 world cup. We have more now from Atika Shubert, reporting from Valencia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Euphoric celebration for a historic Women's World cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning, when Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation, planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso during the medal ceremony in Sydney. The kiss she later said she had not consented to. Facing domestic and international criticism, Rubiales was pressured to resign, but he defiantly refused He doubled down, saying the kiss was consensual, to the applause of men in the room. LUIS RUBIALES, PRESIDENT OF THE SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION (through translator): You think I have to resign? Well, I'm going to tell you something. I will not resign. SHUBERT (voice-over): Hermoso issued her own lengthy response, which said the kiss was not consensual at all. I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part, she wrote. Since then, FIFA, the world's governing football body, provisionally suspended Rubiales for 90 days, and the Spanish government has submitted a complaint to its sports tribunal, a step towards suspending him. What was first a national embarrassment now threatens international repercussions, but could well become a turning point for women athletes in Spain.",

Another name for it is sexual assault. And so, I'm not sure hecould've apologized his way out of it no matter what. But you're absolutely right, if he had immediately been contrite and said I am so sorry and Jenni Hermoso, she was able to say okay, that was terrible, but I accept your apology, which I don't know if she would've or not. That's her call. I think he was probably in deep, deep trouble the moment he did it, and he should've thought of that. But of course, why would he think of that? Because apparently, you know, he's done other things that have allegedly been bad, with the unfortunate scene right before with the Queen's daughter right there, as he's celebrating. But the problem is that he didn't do any of that, and he just made it worse and worse, because he thought he could get away with it.

But one wonders how many officials in countries around the world leaders, like Rubiales, are going, oh my gosh the world has just changed over the last eight or nine days.The lack of respect for women in the game, the lack of funding, the lack of any kind of support, when you think of so many nations that care so much about their men's football and their men's soccer teams, and just could not care less about their women's team. Now we're seeing more start to care. But the funding is nothing like the men's. And if they had -- if these nations had cared about women's football, when say the United States, Sweden, Norway, a few others, China, has started to care about women's football, obviously China is in a different category as a communist nation, but as those nations back in the 90s started to fund it, think of not only how empowering it is for girls and women, but also to have new fans and to sell more jerseys and to have more people playing the game. That's a business decision, even if you don't want to go with the altruistic way. And these are the mistakes that these men, and it is basically all men, have made now for 30 years. And so, all of this is encapsulated with that awful kiss, that awful sexual assault. And here we are talking about it. It is sad that the Spanish women, John, cannot just enjoy the wonderful fruits of victory and dance through the streets. But it's also so instructive, and frankly, so wonderful, as terrible as it is, it's also so great that we're having these conversations and that this reckoning is now occurring in the game of soccer.",

Prigozhin really showed everyone how it should be done, he adds. MARIA, MOSCOW (through chance): Wagner did a great job, says Maria, and they are heroes of our country.

And all of that, of course, greatly angering the beijing leadership with China's leader, Xi Jinping himself, increasingly talking about self reliance in key technologies to free china from the american chokehold. Because as he puts it, the U.S. is out to contain China's rise. So, Gina Raimondo, of course, has been trying to say that's not the case. The export controls out of national security concerns account for only 1 percent of America's export to China, so there's still a lot of room for growth, for cooperation. But that kind of argument may not be convincing to the Chinese counterparts, who don't see much difference between derisking, as American officials have been putting it, and decoupling. So that is really where this meeting comes in. But of course, the key here is now the two sides have agreed to strengthen their communication, to talk more. In addition to that platform, they also agreed to establish a working group to relay involving not only officials, but also the private sector to address and try to resolve trade and economic issues. But just back to the point about day two of the meetings, she is obviously trying to build upon some of these positive momentum. On Tuesday morning, she met with a Chinese culture and tourism minister, obviously trying to promote outbound travel from China to the U.S., and that used to be quite a booming industry before the pandemic. But now of course, with rising geopolitical tension and a dearth of nonstop flights, the number of Chinese tourists in the U.S., and by extension, their tourist dollars, only a fraction of pre-covid levels. So, Gina Raimondo, obviously, trying to change all that, John.",

Greece is one of the EU's main entry points for those fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 15,000 migrants have arrived in Greece this year. That doesn't compare to Italy, which is facing a similar but much worse situation, with hundreds, or tens of thousands, rather, migrants arriving there so far this year. Our CNN Barbie Nadeau has details reporting in from Rome.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's the height of the mediterranean summer, and this tiny island is overwhelmed with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees. More than 4000 people arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa  in hundreds of small boats over the weekend. Among them, pregnant women, babies, and unaccompanied minors. It's the highest number of arrivals in a weekend this island has ever seen. More than 113,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat this year. That's more than the total number that arrived in all of 2022. There may be more migrant and refugee boats at sea, but there are fewer ngos to rescue them. At the moment, the Italian government has sequestered three NGO ships for allegedly breaking a law set by Italy's right wing government under prime minister Giorgia Meloni that mandates how many rescues a charity ship can carry out. Each of the sequestered ships will be docked for 20 days, and be fined up to 10,000 Euro. 56 organizations have signed a petition against the government, accusing them of obstructing civilian search and rescue and warning that it will lead to more deaths. But the Italian government says without the rest of Europe helping, they cannot manage the influx. ADOLFO URSO, ITALIAN MINISTER OF ENTERPRISE (through translator): Italy can't be left alone facing this extraordinary phenomenon. Italy is the gateway to europe. Europe must intervene with us. NADEAU (voice-over): Maloney will lead crisis talks this week after the government reconvenes. On the agenda, ways to help people migrate illegally and ways to deport them faster.

But somehow, they are taking more than two years just to find solutions to the same bans that they're doing.At the same time, you have to look at the fact that when they see Sharia, this means all the other Muslim countries in the Middle East, the Asian countries in South and Central Asia, they're not Muslim enough? That's the reason they don't ban women from going to all those places? Or are you a different category Muslim? And if you are, where does that explain it? Like, what is it that you are following actually? So, for me, I personally think the Taliban are at war with the women of Afghanistan. They have always been.

It's picked up some speed. But I'll show you something that looks very interesting to me. And that is this northern quadrant of this particular system. It looks a little more symmetrical, not so much to the south. It's a little more disorganized. But I think once it pushes past this Yucatan Strait, we're going to see it really start to form until what we normally think of as a typical looking hurricane. So it moves out into the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Water temperatures here are about 30 to 35 degrees. These are the spaghetti models and they're telling us we're in pretty good agreement as to where we think this is going to make landfall. Now landfall is just one spot. We know that long before landfall occurs, which is when the eye moves across the shore, that we start to feel the effects of this. So up and down this West Coast, we have storm surge warnings, we've got hurricane watches, it's going to be a mess. And if you're viewing us along some of these beautiful coastal areas of western Florida, also northern Florida and into South Carolina, and into coastal Georgia, you could see tremendous rainfall, down trees, down power lines. But for Tampa, it's going to be the storm surge and further north. Now some of that storm surge -- storm surge is the deadliest most component to hurricanes but we'll keep you updated.

But their success on the field has quickly been overshadowed by a storm of controversy, often the consequences of which could have far reaching implications. It's a scandal that began when Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish Football Federation, grabbed the team striker Jenni Hermoso and kissed her on the lips. She says that she didn't consent to that kiss, adding there in that moment she felt vulnerable as the victim of an impulse driven sexist. On Monday, the Spanish Football Federation which has defended their president and threatened her most so with legal action met to discuss the situation. The Spanish government's higher Sports Council also met acknowledging that the scandal was harming Spain's joint bid to host the 2030 Men's World Cup tournament. The prosecutor's office in Spain is considering a crime of sexual aggression against Rubialis, and the case has even been discussed at the United Nations in New York. And as if this all wasn't enough, the mother of the 46-year-old Rubiales is hold up in a church on hunger strike. Let's head to the capital Madrid with a Spanish-based journalist.

They do not, however, have the power to actually sack him. So for now, he maintains his position there. I think this was an important step to show that the -- that not everyone in the Federation is supporting them and that the pressure is building on him to go. And in addition to that, we saw hundreds of people come out in the streets of Madrid. In this square that I'm at now, there are protesters out, a huge rally, basically saying it's time for an Rubiales to go and in support of Jenni Hermoso.

The problem is now whether or not there will be detrimental effects from this. There's been some discussion today about a request by some of his supporters from the Federation to UEFA, saying that Spain should be suspended from UEFA because of government interference.
