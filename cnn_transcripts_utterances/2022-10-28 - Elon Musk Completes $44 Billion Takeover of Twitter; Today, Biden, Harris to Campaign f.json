It's really no different than a sports team, with new ownership, bringing in new coaches, perhaps looking for some new players.I think the question is, is how much further is Musk going to cut? He has mentioned before, at least in some conversations, of having mass layoffs. That's something that may come a little bit clearer today. Although with an organization like Twitter, you simply can't fire everyone. You do need people to keep the ship going. I think it will be interesting though to see who he leans on in the future.

Vladimir Putin speaking in glowing terms about Beijing, saying that it was an unprecedented situation they were in, in terms of the closeness of their relationship. Both countries he said were committed, to paraphrase him, bringing trade relations to an even higher level.He also made it clear that he believed Taiwan was part of China and he criticized the United States for interfering with Taiwan. He was very disrespectful towards U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying why did they send this grandmother to Taiwan just to provoke the Chinese, a reference to Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan earlier this year. And so, Russia and China, you know, very much, at least as far as Moscow is concerned, on the same side when it comes to the division of the world, as it is at the moment, Alex.",

Sort of a double-whammy here, you think about this in two episodes. They first hit weather on the way to Paraguary then landed in Brazil. They had to divert. Then they waited there for about three hours, the passengers stayed on the airplane, and they took off again into this bad weather once more.And that's when you see this incredible video from inside of the cabin that lightning essentially lighting up the inside of the plane as if it was bright as day. The turbulence so intense, you can see bags there at some points actually go up to the ceiling of the plane because the turbulence, the bumps were so hard, really got a heck of a ride in this. You know, look at the damage afterwards, too, of the exterior of the plane. That's the nose cone of the plane. That's where the radar typically is. That's where the radome is. And the windshield there, you can see that, it cracked by this. There had to be some hale in this really intense thunderstorm. That is ran air turbine of the Airbus A320 that comes out when you lose electrical power on board. That's inside of the windshield. That's radome, once again, really, really incredible damage to this plane after it plowed through this thunderstorm. You have to wonder what the judgment call here was by the crew in the cockpit. Why did they decide to take off into a thunderstorm so bad? What was the pressure under them to do this? And why did they do this when passengers were so terrified? I mean, really a bad judgment call here, I say as a pilot, not a great call.",

MUNTEANWe've also heard from LATAM, the airline here, and they say that they will support the passengers in any way they can, they regret the incident and they are cooperating with this investigation. So, what will be interesting here is whether or not they really dig into what the pilots were thinking. There are some reports out there on the ground in Brazil, they may have just tried to avoid a bureaucratic mess or maybe they were trying to get out of the pilots timing out for their duty time, the regulations on that. So, we'll see. I mean, there are a lot of big questions here about why this crew would put these passengers in such an incredible situation and such danger.",
