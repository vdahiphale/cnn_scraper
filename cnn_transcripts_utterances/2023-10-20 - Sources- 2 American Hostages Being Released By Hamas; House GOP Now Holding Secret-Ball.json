The state of medical care, it is awful.JIM SCIUTTO, CNN MAX ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, even the worst hostage takers -- and let's put Hamas into that category -- see the risks of having an American die on their hands. Particularly, if it's not, say, from a strike, right? Given that the hostages are distributed around Gaza right now but dies in their hands in ill health. So they would see the benefit, again, to them, and let's look at it through that prism, of releasing them because they just have less value, right? We've seen some precedent for that. For instance, in Iran, when Americans held in Iran, had health issues, it made it more likely for them to be released. Oftentimes, still, for something in return. But that Iran knew they didn't want to have an American dying on their hands because they might face bigger consequences. It's not getting to their morality or their sense of altruism for that hostage but more a calculation that, wait a second, we may pay a heavy price for this if this American mother dies in our hands, in our possession.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the conference is really divided, whether or not you are a supporter of Jim Jordan or not on whether or not, whether he should keep going with this fight.Obviously, some of his closest allies had been warning last night that they would just continue with votes throughout the weekend. But you also had people warning that if you're trying to get votes, the way not to do it is to basically keep members in a pressure cooker and try and try to grind it out on the House floor. Like you mentioned, right now, behind closed doors, Troy Nehls told us that lawmakers are voting by secret ballot on whether or not Jim Jordan should continue with his bid. And that, at the beginning of the meeting, Nehls said that Jim Jordan said that this is a step that he wanted to take. But it's going to be really interesting what the numbers are on that secret ballot. We've already seen that, repeatedly, Jim Jordan continues to lose support on the floor. It was 20, then it was 22. Today it was 25. And the expectation was that number was only going to grow. You know, there was a very revealing moment yesterday when Jim Jordan had a meeting with more than a dozen holdouts and they essentially delivered the message to him that it's over, that there was nothing he was going to be able to do to change their minds. Obviously, that was reaffirmed on the floor today as those holdouts continued to vote against Jim Jordan. Where does the conference go, though, if Jim Jordan drops out of this race? I think that that question is so uncertain. Yesterday, they were entertaining potentially empowering Patrick McHenry temporarily. But as they were in a conference meeting very similar to the one that is happening behind us today, they essentially decided, as a conference, that that was not the step that they wanted to take. So it's so hard to imagine where this goes from here if the decision by the conference is that Jim Jordan needs to step aside.",

Reading between the lines, it sounds like the message he's sending is that Democrats remain willing and able to help Republicans find some kind of path forward. With the caveat, obviously, that they want to see Israel and Ukraine aid come to the floor. They also want to make sure the government doesn't shut down on November 17th when that deadline approaches. So I think the message from Democrats today is we're still here, we're still willing to work. But obviously, House Republicans have to bring that resolution to the floor. They are likely the ones who would have to start that process. And, like I said, yesterday, after a three-hour conference meeting that got very heated, it became clear that House Republicans weren't quite ready to take that step. Does that change today? I think that that's what we're going to be watching for.",

Very temporary until we elected a speaker so we could keep the lights on and we could keep working while electing a speaker. I don't see a big problem with that.

I'm from the business world. I served as revenue secretary. And we need someone who truly is an inclusionary leader and speaker. Meaning that all participants -- we only have a five-vote majority. All participants need to feel that their word matters, that their vote matters, that their position matters, not special privilege. But anything that they receive needs to be in the interest of the conference. And that can be done. I think I can bring that, particularly when it comes to legislation, when it comes to polls, when it comes to events, when it comes to fundraising, when it comes to communications. All of that should be much more inclusionary so people feel as if they have an authorship of the direction that we are going on behalf of her constituents. That's what a good speaker would do.
