We see collections that people in different cities around Russia are undertaking, sending supplies to the people of Kursk.So, he is handling it in that way. But I think, look, it is a big problem for him. It clearly shows that the operation is not going well. And as Ukraine conducts this ground operation, they are also attacking from the air. We've just heard from a security source in Ukraine, that they have conducted their biggest-ever attack since the war started on Russian airfields, four of them overnight.

I will speak to CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger, and that is coming up in 20 minutes from now. Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks are set to resume Thursday in Doha and a lot is riding on them. There has been some speculation that Iran might hold off on plans to attack Israel if a Gaza ceasefire is reached soon. But, some have cast serious doubt on that. Iran has vowed to retaliate for the assassination of Hamas' political leader in Tehran, an attack that it blames on Israel. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN, Hamas is taking a position of intentional ambiguity about appearing at the Doha talks. Representatives from Israel, Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. are all taking part. Nic Robertson joining us now from Tel Aviv with the details. Hi there, Nic. So, Hamas being very non-committal about the talks that are set for Thursday. What are you watching for?

I think there's been a lot of expectation in the region, particularly in trying to get these talks up and running tomorrow, that there would be a lot of U.S. pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to change his position, not to have these add-ons that Hamas talks about, although his office say they don't -- they haven't put any add- ons to President Biden's framework. And when we had the announcement yesterday that the United States was going to clear $20 billion worth of military equipment to Israel, not -- this is part of a long process and it's only part of that process, and it's only provisional. The timing of it because it's been a long process, does seem to indicate that the United States potentially trying to give Prime Minister Netanyahu something in return for what they may hope comes out at these talks.

But it's still Tropical Storm Ernesto and it is really bringing this incredible rainfall to eastern and southern sections of Puerto Rico as well as the British and U.S. Virgin Islands. The eye of the storm has just north of Puerto Rico, so it's going to start pulling away from the region. But unfortunately, this is a lopsided hurricane or tropical storm, meaning that the bulk of the precipitation is on its southeastern side. The western side, not a lot going on there and unfortunately, the landmass in the way of this lopsided storm is just the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. We are getting rainfall, heavy rainfall, one to two inch rainfall rate per hour over the same locations for an extended duration of time. That's why, the National Weather Service out of San Juan has issued this flash flood warning. Anywhere you see that shading of red, but I'm particularly concerned across the southern portion of Puerto Rico. Remember, mountainous terrain, will get some uplifts, some topographical lift from the mountains there, that could bring heavier rainfall rates and the potential for that flash flooding and mudslides across the island. So, we are going to keep a close eye on that, another three to four inches of rain possible going forward with this storm before it exits the area. And then where does it go from there? Well, it's going to take advantage of the warm Atlantic waters over the western Atlantic Ocean. And it could strengthen into a major hurricane status on its final approach to the island of Bermuda here, by early Saturday morning. What impact will it have on the U.S. East Coast? Well, aside from large waves and rip currents, no direct impacts. But this is going to be a major wave maker and then -- all island interests need to be focusing on where the storm will go if you're located in Bermuda, a popular tourist destination. Of course, with an eye potentially moving over land, that could bring some problems with winds, potentially exceeding 100 miles per hour by early this weekend. Amara?",

And I can't imagine that it is simply to have a bargaining chip, though it may be prove useful for that. Because at this point, Vladimir Putin has shown very little interest in having a negotiated end, didn't leave him with at least the 18 percent to 20 percent of the country he had already seized.And President Zelenskyy has shown no interest in any agreement that would involve him giving up any land at all. So, it's possible this is about bargaining. I think it's about a few other things. First, it's about taking the war to the Russian people who so far have been told, don't worry about this. I'll take care of it, Putin has said, it's not going to affect your life. I think, second, it is to sort of show up the incompetence of the Russian military after, of course, they had a very bad start in the war, but then have been coming back. And third, I think it's simply to show that the Ukrainians maintain the ability to surprise.

The second big risk I think is that it's so humiliates Putin that he is tempted to do what at various moments he has threatened to do in this war, though not in recent times, which is rollout tactical nuclear weapons or some other major weapons system. We are at most risk for Putin doing something like that when he perceives he is losing or humiliated.I think that third big risk is that Zelenskyy himself overreaches here and thins his own troops out too much and, of course, gives the Russians an opportunity to grab more land elsewhere.",

Now, a spokesman for Vance says to CNN in a statement, J.D. was not aware of the operational decisions regarding hiring, employee benefits, or other workplace policies, which were made after he departed AppHarvest's board. Like all early supporters, J.D. believed in AppHarvest's mission and wishes the company would have succeeded.",

The Consumer Price Index rose a modest 0.2 percent in July, in line with expectations. On an annual basis, inflation slowed to two 2.9 percent, the first time since March of 2021 that it has been below 3 percent. To dig deeper into the numbers, here is CNN's Matt Egan.OK, so sounds positive. What are the takeaways?",

      "sentences": "Amara, this is a major milestone on the cost of living front. As you mentioned, for the first time in more than three years, inflation is below 3 percent. That is good news and it is better than expected. 2.9 percent year-over-year; on a monthly basis, we saw prices up by 0.2 percent. That was right in line with expectations. It's really important to look at the trend and what we can see is that this metric has improved significantly.About two years ago, inflation was running at 9 percent. Remember, that's when we had $5 gasoline prices and price spikes on so many different categories. And thankfully, there's been a lot of improvement since then. You can see it on that chart. It's slowed out -- slowed down a little bit, the improvement, but it is still going in the right direction. And digging into this report, we actually see some price drops for some specific items, including gasoline, new cars, and used cars. One problem area remains the cost of shelter, which is the cost of rent and to buy, that remains something that's still going up at a significant rate, but it has improved. So I think when you put all this together, this is going to be yet more evidence for the Fed to start to lower interest rates at the next meeting in September. And Amara, probably at the meeting after that and the one after that, which is good news for main street (ph), right? It means lower mortgage rates and cheaper cost to get -- to pay off credit card debt and car loans and student debt. So, that could be more good news coming soon.",

And so, that's why we have seen a better mood in the markets. You see U.S. stock Futures pointing to a slightly higher open this morning. The mood has really improved from a week ago when traders were really kind of freaking out about the state of the economy. All these worries that maybe the Fed was waiting too long to cut interest rates and doing too much damage to the jobs market.And the latest numbers on the inflation front, both today and yesterday, where we got better than expected wholesale inflation numbers, all of this does point to interest rate cuts coming soon from the Fed and it really does keep alive hopes for a soft landing in the economy.

Now, you may remember she was stripped of her first individual Olympic medal after the Romanian gymnastics team challenged her final score in the women's artistic floor exercise. The medal was later awarded to Romania's Ana Barbosu. Now, it's been revealed that one of the three-member panel which ruled on the decision has a history of representing Romania in legal cases.Team USA says it will continue to appeal. Comcast and NBCUniversal have been the real U.S. winners of the Paris Olympic Games. The American media giant says their coverage drew an average of more than 30 million viewers across platforms. That is a whopping 82 percent jump in viewership compared to the Tokyo Games. NBC's streaming app, Peacock featured more than 3,200 live events over the course of the games, including generative AI daily recaps and a multi-view feature where viewers could watch several events at one time.
