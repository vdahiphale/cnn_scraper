Thanks in no small part to changes that Japan has made at the bureaucratic level to allow it to engage on a deeper level with the U.S. and allow things like, for instance, the export of weaponry developed in Japan, the export of military technology that will allow it to produce and sell military aid to other countries around the world.Officials say that that in particular has made a very big change to this relationship. And so, they're going to be announcing quite a few new items of deliverables on the military and defense front. But they're also expected to cover the waterfront of climate, space, artificial intelligence and technology across a host of partnerships that the two countries say are first of their kind. Here is how they said it in their words earlier today (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I would assert our alliance has never been stronger in our entire history. But today, I look forward to discussing how we can even deepen it more, including increasing defense and then technology and cooperation across the board, while we can continue to enhance and ensure Indo- Pacific remains seems a free, open, and prosperous region of the world with us standing together.

We are showing that to you and look what could be at risk if the president's Republican rival were to take the helm again. I think this is an interesting moment for President Biden too, because he does often pull on his foreign policy experience on the campaign trail and we saw this play out with NATO. He harkens back to his history and background and foreign policy to make his case on the campaign trail, and that is what we see in moments like this too.This is where he is most comfortable. This is where he gets to say, I've been working on this relationship, this coordination with a key ally in the Indo-Pacific region and this is what is at stake with all of the conflicts abroad, if we don't keep up these alliances. So for the campaign, if anything, the conventional is good here and they can use this as another example of the president showing that the U.S. can still lead, whereas they can cast doubt on whether that was the case when the former president (inaudible).",

(LAUGH) BASH: In an audio tape obtained by Politico. I am going to read this. I think the president is out there too much talking about bridges. He does two or three events a week and there he -- where he is cutting a ribbon on a bridge and here's a bridge, like I tell you, if you go into the grocery store, you go to the grocery store and you know, eggs and milk are expensive. The fact that there is a F-ing bridge is not (inaudible). Ron Klain was famously the person who would drive to work, specifically down certain streets so he could see what the gas prices were when he was working at the White House. He is I think understandably obsessed with those pocketbook issues. And the fact that he is so out there, vocally criticizing what the current campaign and the current White House are doing, what does that tell you? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, POLITICS &amp; POLICY COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG: Listen, I am sure he is probably privately telling them this as well. The Biden campaign, they have to figure out a way to go to these swing states and say to these voters, we delivered. We were able to get this big infrastructure deal done and look, there is a bridge.

Once they finally saw -- eventually, see that bridge in their community, they're going to say, OK, Democrats did this for me. But it is just so hard at this point in time for the president.

Now, to a potential change that could have enormous consequences on the 2024 presidential election, Republicans want to change the way the State of Nebraska awards its electoral votes, which could be an election deciding boost for Donald Trump. The state's Republican governor is now promising to call a special legislative session when he says there is sufficient support in the legislature to pass it.

So come November, that is certainly something that is going to be front and center in this campaign. But both presidential campaigns have been watching this very carefully. This is not new. For about 30 years or so, this has been done in Nebraska, but suddenly it is gaining fresh attention and here is why.Because of the closeness of this race and the sort of changing nature of the battlegrounds, if President Biden wins Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and nothing else, he would win the presidency with this electoral vote here in Omaha. If he does not, it could be a tied race that is sent to the House of Representatives. So that is the background to all of this here. And this basically was going without much attention last week until conservative activist Charlie Kirk started raising attention to this. He was right here in Omaha last night, urging Nebraskans to press this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
