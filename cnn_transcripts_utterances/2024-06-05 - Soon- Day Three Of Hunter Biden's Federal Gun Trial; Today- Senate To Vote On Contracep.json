      "sentences": "All right, just before 5It's day three of Hunter Biden's federal gun trial in Delaware. Court began yesterday with the jury hearing opening statements. Prosecutors and defense attorneys battling over the one fundamental issue, whether the president's son lied about being an addict when he purchased a gun in 2018. Prosecutor Derek Hines telling the jury, \"We would not be here today if he was just a drug addict. He crossed the line when he chose to buy a gun and lied during a federal background check. Addiction may not be a choice, but lying and buying a gun is a choice.\" Biden's central defense in the case that he did not consider himself an addict at the time of the purchase. Biden's defense attorney reminding the jury, \"What is common to all the three charges is the requirement that the prosecutors left off their slide. They have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law.\" During witness testimony prosecutors used Hunter's own words against him, playing several passages from the audiobook for his 2021 memoir.

What were your main takeaways from what you saw unfold there? And honestly, some of the most dramatic moments may have come outside the courtroom in a clash between Hunter Biden's wife and a former Trump aide. What have you learned? MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  Hey, Kasie. Good morning to you. It was pretty remarkable throughout the day to watch these proceedings unfold. Hunter Biden obviously in the defendant's seat. First lady Jill Biden just a few rows behind him in the pews, along with everybody else in that packed courtroom. I think both sides see a path to victory here and they were trying to spell that out for the jury in their opening statements. You just read a few key quotes there that sort of explain how the prosecutors think they can get to a conviction and the defense thinks that they may be able to sow enough reasonable doubt to avoid Hunter Biden getting a criminal record and possibly even going to prison. Look, one of the more gripping moments was the audiobook. You just read -- you just played one clip. I've got another clip that I want to play for you. The prosecutors used this clip to try to establish the timeline of Hunter's drug addiction. Remember, he is accused of buying a gun in 2018 while addicted to drugs, which would be a violation of the law. He wrote the book in 2019. So listen closely to where he describes the timeline of his addiction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But obviously, politics got into this as well when there was -- NBC News reported this confrontation between Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and a man named Garrett Zeigler. So she approached him, NBC reported, pointed her finger at him and said in a loud voice, \"You have no right to be here, Nazi piece of 's'.\" Zeigler then told NBC News, \"It's sad. I've been sitting here the whole time and haven't approached anyone. For the record, I am not a Nazi. I'm a believer in the U.S. Constitution.

Today, Senate Democrats are going to vote on legislation to protect access to contraception. The Senate is going to vote on it. The move comes as Republicans are struggling with messaging around abortion nearly two years after Roe versus Wade was overturned. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a dear colleague letter Democrats are putting the issue front and center. He writes this. \"As horrific as these state abortion bans are, they're just the tip of the iceberg.\" Adding, \"The scourage of Republicans' anti- reproductive rights agenda extends to contraception as well.\" Here's what Republicans are doing to try to get ahead of this. Axios reporting Senate Republicans are being instructed to \"clearly outline their support\" for policies that increase access to birth control.

I mean, yesterday, we told you about how Angel Reese said that she is actually comfortable with taking the bad guy role in her rivalry with Caitlin Clark. And last night an exchange with the refs got her an early exit from the Chicago Sky's loss to the New York Liberty. This happened late in the fourth quarter. Reese was called for her fifth personal foul and the rookie appeared to say something to referee Charles Watson and then quickly waved her hand. She was then called for two technical fouls and her first ejection as a pro. Afterwards, the lead official said that her techs were for disrespectfully addressing the official and then for waving her hand in dismissal. Her coach and teammates were still looking for answers.
