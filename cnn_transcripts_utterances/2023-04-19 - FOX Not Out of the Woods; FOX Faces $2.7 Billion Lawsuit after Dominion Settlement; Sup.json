Wade.Justice Samuel Alito extended his hold today on that Federal Appeals Court ruling that would impose restrictions on access to a widely prescribed abortion drug, mifepristone. The new deadline is Friday by midnight. That's what he said. This started now when a Federal District Judge in Texas revoked the FDA approval of mifepristone, which has been used by millions of women for more than 20 years. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, it stayed part of that Judge's ruling, but said that some restrictions could go into effect, including curtailing access to the drug by mail and shortening the pregnancy timeframe in which the drug could be taken. Justice Alito's stay put all of that, as I said on hold until midnight Friday. Joining us, longtime observer of the Supreme Court, NPR legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg.

So, I would assume they'll try to hammer it out and that we will get some sort of word either late tomorrow or sometime on Friday.You know, they are still the same options, and the most likely one, I think, is that they'll let the Fifth Circuit go ahead and formally have an expedited oral argument and issue a decision, because everything the Court did until now is preliminary. I mean, it may feel like it's permanent, because it curtailed most of what the FDA has allowed in the last seven years or so in terms of access, and it also curtailed the period of time in which women can have abortions using mifepristone, and that's the seven weeks instead of 10 weeks, which is what the FDA has approved. But it is still a preliminary decision, so once there is a final decision from the Fifth Circuit, then inevitably, I think, because I don't think the Fifth Circuit is going to change his mind a lot, inevitably, the Biden administration on behalf of the FDA, and the companies that make the branded generic mifepristone that's used across the country, they have a pending -- you know, they'll go back to the Supreme Court and say, hear our case now, and it could well be that the Court will do that or maybe it'll just leave in place what the Fifth Circuit does.

Last week, there was 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, who was shot in the head and arm after ringing the doorbell at the wrong address. The men accused of shooting Yarl, 84- year-old Andrew Lester, shown there, appeared in court today where he pleaded not guilty. And over the weekend, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis was shot and killed after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway while looking for a friend's house in rural upstate New York. According to the Washington County Sheriff, there was no interaction between the shooter and anyone in the car before shots were fired. And just yesterday, two teenage cheerleaders were shot in a Texas supermarket parking lot for what seems like another random accident. CNN's Ed Lavandera has that story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): That's Payton Washington, practicing her high-flying acrobatics cheer routines. Three times a week, Washington and three teammates of the Woodlands Elite Cheer Company carpool from Austin to the Houston area for team practices. That's what brought them to this grocery store parking lot in Elgin, Texas, just after midnight, Tuesday morning. One of the girls in the car, Heather Roth, emotionally recounted during a vigil at the cheer team's practice facility later Tuesday, how she opened the door to a car she thought was hers when she was shocked to see a man in the passenger seat.

And if it's a wiffle ball or bat, you can't use a gun. If it's a gun, you can use a gun. If it's a knife close to you, you can use a knife. That's traditional self defense.

Used to be you had to retreat, but then the castle doctrine said, it's your castle. It's your home. You can defend yourself at the doorstep. Then stand your ground took that same protection of castle doctrine out to the street that says, if you're on the street, not in your home -- if you're on the street, and you have a right to be there, you don't have to retreat. You don't have to make one move before defending yourself. And the thought is, the reason for stand-your- ground has been passed in many states is you might put yourself at greater risk by moving or by retreating, so you don't have to if you're allowed to be there.

There are implicit biases that exist in all of us and when they exist in a educational occurrence, or whether you're going to get a mortgage alone, it doesn't cause death.

No. But unfortunately, even today, when you look at the Harvard Implicit Bias Study which all of your viewers should take, we know that people are biased against particularly young black males.
