      "sentences": "But I want to talk about another case we've been watching for. It is commonly referred to as \"Trump Too Small.\" This is about a lawyer activist who wanted to trademark the phrase \"Trump Too Small.\" Now, this is a reference to a crude remark in a 2016 debate that was made about the size of now Former President Trump's hands. And this activist put this slogan on t-shirts and mugs, and he wanted to trademark it. But the federal trademark office has limits on your ability to trademark anything related to a notable living person.Now, he argued that this was a violation of his First Amendment right. But the Supreme Court has disagreed. They have rejected this. And during oral arguments, some of the justices pointed out the fact that nobody's stopping you from making your t-shirts or your mugs. And under some state laws, if you are the person doing this consistently, you even have some protections. Not exactly what you would get if you had trademark, but look, nobody's stopping you from making your merchandise. So, here, they rejected this claim. But this is one that a lot of folks have been watching.",

I think the real story that is going to start to emerge from today's decisions, probably from some we're getting tomorrow or next week is the Supreme Court is as conservative as we've seen in our lifetimes. But there's a lower court that's even more conservative. I mean, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, has issued a series of opinions in the mifepristone case, in the domestic violence gun case about administrative law that really have tried to push the Supreme Court even further to the right.What I read in this unanimous rejection in the mifepristone case today is the Supreme Court saying, slow down Fifth Circuit. You know, we're not going there. We're not ready to go there yet. We're not going to blow up decades of jurisprudence across dozens of fields just because you think we have the votes.",

They still have this Idaho emergency abortion case that we expect them to decide in the next two weeks. I think there are legitimate concerns that if Former President Trump is re-elected this fall, there's going to be more aggressive efforts at the federal level to enforce this old statute, the Comstock Act, in ways that would further limit access to abortions, even in states that have fairly permissive regimes.And so, I think, you know, today is a bit of a sort of half a step into the post Dobbs space, where the court's not going to let any old lawsuit come into the courts to challenge available procedures for abortions in other states, but where the court is also not going to be out of the business at all, where the court is going to have to figure out who are the right plaintiffs, what are the right cases, and how much are we really going to let individual states decide versus having uniform federal rules.",

There's going to be access to abortion in states that have tried to make it broadly available, where today's ruling is going to allow that to continue. You're not going to have a judge in Amarillo, Texas, shutting down nationwide access to mifepristone. But on the other side of the coin, the Idaho case is about access to abortion in states with restrictive abortion laws. And, you know, given the way that the court has acted in that case already, given the way the oral argument went, I think it's likely the court's going to uphold the Idaho law in that case. And so, I think we're going to see further pressure on individuals in states that have such restrictive regimes to travel to states that don't. That's, I think, the world we're going to live in, at least so long as this is left up to the states.",

And it's clear that this is sort of a cheerleading moment for Donald Trump.Yes, as you noted, there are some Republicans who were vocally criticizing him after the January 6th insurrection. Many of those Republicans are not doing so in the same way anymore. In fact, Donald Trump's sort of boasting in this meeting that most of those members aren't even around anymore. That, obviously, the people who have survived in the Republican Party are the people who are backing him. You know, he did talk about abortion. He did remind Republicans that they should not be afraid of the issue, that they should talk about how now this is up to states, which is always what the Republican Party wanted this issue to be decided by.",

Alvin Bragg's political persecution -- or prosecution, I should say, with Former President Donald Trump. Let's discuss that now with one of the committee members, Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell of California.Congressman, I guess I did want to ask you about Trump's visit up on Capitol Hill, but your response to this hearing on Alvin Bragg and obviously on the hush money case. There was an item in Politico this morning that said that Trump was so furious about his verdict that he called the house speaker and said, I want you to do something about this. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  Yes. The house speaker runs a law firm. They only have one client, but it's a pretty big firm, and they work every day on behalf of that client, Donald Trump. And that's at the cost of everything that your viewers probably care about, keeping their kids safe from gun violence and their schools, you know, making sure corporations aren't gouging you on your gas and your groceries, lowering your health care costs. None of that's being addressed. But we are going to bring in eventually a district attorney who presided over a local case and question that verdict. And at the same time, by the way, Jim, these guys were praising the verdict in Delaware, were a jury of Hunter Biden's peers found him guilty. And so, it's really about Donald Trump's choices, though, right? Donald Trump chose to live in Manhattan. He had a jury of his peers that -- a jury that he picked decided, you know, his fate. And that jury decided 34 times that he is guilty. So, that's 408 straight times that they said guilty. And now, they're going to seek, you know, to undermine what Donald Trump's neighbors had to say about his criminality.",

SWALWELLIn fact, we added a seat in the Senate and most of the candidates he endorsed last year, whether it was referenda in Ohio or the Kentucky governor's race or in Virginia, Democrats won.

And I should highlight this because this is one of the most modern ships the Russian navy, Vladimir Putin, has. And let me tell you a little bit about this. It can send hypersonic missiles. It has tested hypersonic missiles. Those fly at a speed of about 6,000 miles per hour. It's not believed that the U.S. has any weapon system that can counter those hypersonic missiles. Jim, you have a point of reference. I'm in Nevada, you're in Washington, D.C. You're only a little bit over a thousand miles away from where I am right now. So, while these are a peaceful visit, we are told they have left the nuclear warheads at home. The Cuban Ministry of Defense says the vehicles -- the vessels behind me are anything but peaceful. Vladimir Putin is sending a message. He's sending it very publicly. And they've been put not in a secret military port here in Cuba, but in one of the most visible places there is, right in front of our offices, which makes it very convenient.

Most Cubans receive remittances from those relatives. They follow U.S. music, U.S. baseball. There is an affinity, a much greater affinity with a country that is closer to them.
