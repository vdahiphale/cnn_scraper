He kept saying that we are going to commit to doing the right thing, but there were no clear cut answers to what that is, and it's very subjective.So, if Norfolk Southern thinks that they're doing the right thing, is that what the residents think is the right thing? I'm a homeowner as well, and I'm definitely very concerned about that as well, about our home value. But I'm mostly concerned about the safety because my family chose to move to East Palestine. My husband is from East Palestine, and we chose to move from a big city to come back to East Palestine to raise our family in small town America. We love it there. It's a great community, and we want to make East Palestine great again. At the hearing, Alan Shaw said that he wants East Palestine to have the greatest comeback in American history and that he is committed to making that happen. So, I just really hope that he stays true to his word and that the policymakers are able to hold him accountable, the EPA is able to hold him accountable and that we're able to make that happen.

But that doesn't mean that you should run for office as a bully and as a bigot targeting, you know, transgender kids and making them the punching bag for a whole political party. These are very fragile and vulnerable young people by all standards and estimations.And I just think it's a shock. I mean, there's so many things that are going on in our schools and with our kids that this is the issue you're going to pick on and this is the population you're going to pick on.

It's just about -- and I agree with Van, parents are now a lot more aware of what's going on in school.And one thing they're aware of is what's in the curriculum and why are the kids in my school not able to read, write and do arithmetic? And I think there are a lot of parents out there who think there are a lot of people involved in leadership of schools who care more about these cultural issues, that cultural agenda than they do about the core thing that you expect to sort school to do, which is to teach students. And so I think if I were advising a candidate on these matters, I would say I think talking about the bathrooms is fine, but you got to couple it with what do you want out of a school? And I want them to read, write, and be able to do math. That's what any parent wants. And so I think as long as you are touching on both, it can be a resonant topic in both the primary and in the general election frankly.",

And this was from the trust representatives. She's suing the trust, the land and the home are held in a trust. So she gets to the airport. She says at that point trust representative said you're locked out of the home, you are not invited there anymore. She says that her personal belongings were taken out of the home and then they misappropriated $40,000 cash of hers. Now she is asking for an excess of $30 million, which she says is the rental value of the rest of the time that she should be able to be in the home. The second lawsuit has to do with a nondisclosure agreement because Tiger Wood's side wants it litigated privately arbitration. She's saying no, it should be null and void.

JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYSTShe's asking for guidance from the court as to whether she could get out of this disclosure agreement. Now, just to be clear, there's a federal law signed by Biden last November, the Speak Out law, and it nullifies NDAs, nondisclosure agreements, which essentially say you cannot disclose the basis, the information, other facts predicated to relationships. However, it's only valid as it relates to sexual harassment or sexual assault. So, there's no indication at this point whether or not there was any of that, that would validate or invalidate, rather, the agreement. I think that would be the subject of further proceedings, perhaps before the court such that she could give information as to whether she actually -- that law applies to her.

There are not sufficient facts upon which we could say that it relates to that. And if it doesn't, then a court would have no reason to undo it. If it does, a court would.
