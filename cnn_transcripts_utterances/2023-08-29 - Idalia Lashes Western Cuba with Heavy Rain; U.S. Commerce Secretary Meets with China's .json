Idalia already bringing heavy rains and strong winds to Cuba too, complete coverage of the storm's path just ahead. Plus trade teamwork U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo meeting with top Chinese officials on Tuesday during her ongoing trip to Beijing China's Premier promising new efforts to boost trade cooperation the U.S. delegation saying it's not seeking a Chinese decoupling. We've got a live report just ahead. And garden gloom troubled Chinese property developer Country Garden set to report first half results on Wednesday. The firm already warning of a more than $7.5 billion loss, \"The Financial Times\" saying it's looking for a 40 day grace period to pay back debt maturing next week to stave off default. Chinese investors taking the news it seems in their stride on Tuesday. It helped along I think, in large part by Beijing's stock trading tax cut that we discussed on the show on Monday, Hong Kong's government also announcing a new task force today to \"Enhance stock market liquidity to officials looking to lift stocks out of their bear market slump. Bloomberg also reporting today that China's state banks may cut rates on mortgages and on deposits to help boost consumer and investor confidence the latter of course to push money out into the system. Meanwhile, some caution as you can imagine, ahead of the U.S. Open after the major averages managed a second straight day of gains on Monday Wall Street's first back to back gains this month in fact. Europe also as you can see there, green higher across the board and sitting near two week highs. We've got a busy show ahead as always. We do begin in Florida as frantic hurricane preparation begins. The Gulf Coast braces for life threatening storm surges and damaging winds as Hurricane Idalia heads the landfall north of the City of Tampa, warnings being issued of tropical storm gusts and flashes flood even before the hurricane reaches land. Mandatory evacuation orders are enforced in at least 10 different counties. And it's not just the United States that's preparing for the worst. More than 8000 people have been evacuated from coastal areas of Western Cuba too. And you can see some of those images from Monday in front of you. CNN's Patrick Oppmann is in the Capital City, Havana for us now. And Patrick I think you'll face as it all I can see the rain and the water behind you?",

So here in Cuba, people either go togovernment evacuation centers, which are a very bare bones because of the lack of resources in this country, or they go stay with family or friends. But what people will tell you again and again, is they don't want to evacuate because they're so afraid of losing their houses, many times a few possessions they have so they choose to ride it out. After all, you're on an island, you can only evacuate so far. And it's really for the western end of this island entire western section of this island from Havana all the way to the very end of Cuba is just getting drenched right now very powerful winds, very dangerous flooding conditions when you're talking about a mountainous region like the western part of Cuba that can lead to mudslides. We've already seen some trees come down and so many without power right now that means to do without communication. So you really want to storm like this comes along, you just have to hunker down and try to write out as best as you can.

So the first thing that, I just want to tell everybody in Florida is listen to your local officials. If they ask you to evacuate, please do so. And it doesn't mean you have to go hundreds of miles, it could just be 10 or 20 miles inland to get out of that main area. If you are asked to evacuate, definitely take your important documents with you so you have those.

And actually, we know that Toyota suppliers have been targeted by cyber-attacks before and it has caused a factory shut down in the past. Less good news, I would say is the fact that they're continuing to investigate the cause of this issue. This was a massive glitch. They're calling it a malfunction in the production order system. As I understand it, there's just made processing orders of new car parts incredibly difficult, or perhaps actually impossible, given how big shutdown was. And that matters, particularly in just in time manufacturing, the beauty of a car factory and I'm sure you've been to a fair few yourself, Julia is that the parts arrive within hours of going into a car. Car plants don't have huge inventories. They don't waste money on warehousing. And actually, we saw the fragility of this very efficient system, I think, with a shortage in semiconductors because they didn't have big inventories. We saw a huge impact on production there. Now I think there'll be hopes that they know exactly what did cause this doesn't happen again. Just to give you an idea of how big it was 14 factories closed today, multiple production lines, which are more than 13,000 vehicles a day that is how many cars and vans and other vehicles that Toyota produces in Japan it's around a third of their global production and as you said, this is the world's biggest carmaker.",

But it looks like he's going to have to be forced out. And for that to happen, it's going to take a lot of steps. Basically, the Council for sport, which is a government body, has now said that it has put in the information that is needed for a tribunal that would then investigate the allegations, look at the incident and have a ruling. And once the tribunal decides whether or not it's going to go ahead, then there is the possibility that he will be suspended. But all of this is going to take a lot of time there are a lot of hoops to jump through. So it doesn't look like he's going to be going anywhere, anytime soon. This is one of the reasons why there's been such increasing pressure on him from the Federation, from a criminal investigation that has now been opened by the prosecutor, by the players themselves who have said that they will not play unless he resigns, and of course from other people have put their support for the player Jenni Hermoso, and have condemned Rubiales' actions.",

It's convenient; it's a non-invasive form factor. And it prioritizes that combination of accuracy, medical grade scientific accuracy with comfort without any compromise. As you said, it's got all of these great sensors that can track and manage your body.

We started with sleep and sleep is critical because it's the daily habit that all of us do. And it has a really profound impact on your health. One good night can make a big difference. And because it measures continuously and overnight, we see your data. And we see your baseline so that we can more easily detect a deviation from that and give you a prediction about your health or about your well-being. Oura is amazing. It gives your body a voice.

And for you alone, we anonymized that data; we keep it secure and private.

And we make sure that it's available to you. Now should you wish to share that? And by the way, many of our customers do want to share their data in a way to get support along their health journey, maybe they had a particularly good night of sleep or a good day of activity, and they want some support for that. Or maybe they had a bad night or they're not feeling well, their temperatures elevated. They're on the way to maybe getting sick, getting that support is really important. Our approaches to it is to keep it really tight, instead of the typical, go to the gym and pound your chest and look how many reps I did or how fast I ran, which is how most wearables approach the social problem of sharing. We do it in a very tight circle, we think about who are your intimates, your close friends, your family who might want to know exactly how you're doing that day. And what we see this is fascinating, we see people changing their behaviors based on the data that they see. So for example, maybe someone's having a bad day and the partner, that person might go home early to help them out, or pick up the kids from school or whatever it is. And that kind of awareness of how your partners and friends are doing actually affects how you behave towards them, because you now have an awareness of their physiology. Are they doing well? Are they doing poorly? Did they sleep well? Did they exercise enough? And that's a really powerful connection, because, of course, we've all been through a giant health crisis.

And tell me how you went from therethen and recognizing that I think Europe is sort of an obvious place to start because what two-thirds of the room is in some of the cities are pitched? So it's perhaps an obvious place to start, particularly Paris, given the challenges there.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so zinc of roofs of Paris, but along with many other city materials, like asphalt or concrete, so all kinds of metals, absorb a tonof solar radiation and then radiate this heat back into the city. And this causes an enormous distortion in the city's temperature called the urban heat island effect. As you were saying, creating temperatures up to 10 degrees higher inside cities that in a rural areas. At the global scale, we know why all of those heat waves are happening, we know that the hotter climates are moving away from the equator and sliding into lands that used to be cooler and more tempered. So heat waves are really a new issue for France as it is for a lot of states in the U.S. And it seemed like a really good place to start, because those pose significant threats to the health and well-being of populations because the city is not ready for weathering such temperatures.",

But they'renow calling on architects and planners saying, well, there is only so much we can do on the health side, because the building fabric is the real lever.

We moved back to Paris in January of this year. And every week Roofscapes Studio is contacted by condominium associations, or people who just go on our website roofscapes.studio. And say, hello, we are suffering from extreme heat. What can we do? So as of today, we've started feasibility studies for about 30 buildings in the Paris area. And we'll move forward with a few of them over the next year including pilot project with public actors, etcetera. In terms of funding, we prioritize non-dilutive funding for now. We raised a bid from MIT from the city of Paris, and it's Bureau for innovation mostly, and the European Commission through its new European Bauhaus branch. And I think for us, we have currently raised enough to conduct our R&amp;D and deploy our first pilot projects in Paris. But we'll be looking for investment in 2024. I think before that, it's essential for us to prove that these solutions are technically possible, financially viable for homeowners but mostly environmentally beneficial for everyone.",
