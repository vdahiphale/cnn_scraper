      "sentences": "-- it's not about the affair with this woman, Karen McDougal; it's about the trail of money. And as you point out, that was hatched with AMI, the scheme prosecutors have been talking about. The initial two transactions were through AMI and then we reached a point, ahead of the Stormy Daniels situation, where AMI and David Pecker didn't want to pay anymore. And they punted it to Michael Cohen.So that's why you have this sort of byzantine structure to the case the prosecutors laid out. Where first they were explaining, here's the AMI (ph) scheme. That's not what we are (inaudible) for and then they were say that's how we led up to the transactions from Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels. And they are telling jurors, this was all part of the same conspiracy. JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF \"THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER\": Something Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, said in his closing arguments yesterday that seemed really inaccurate to me had to do with the fact that he was basically suggesting -- I don't even know why he brought up catch-and-kill, to be honest -- in his closing arguments, because he didn't need to -- he didn't need to. But he did and one of the things he said about it was, only 350,000 people subscribe to \"The National Enquirer\" at that time, you can't think that this actually was going to affect a presidential election. And that just struck me as so inaccurate because, A, \"The National Enquirer\", give the devil his due, \"The National Enquirer\" broke the story of John Edward's extramarital affair completely. I mean, and the child that he had with Rielle Hunter. So give them the credit for that, even if you don't like checkbook journalism, they did do that. And two, it wasn't just about what appeared in \"The National Enquirer\", it was about what then the -- especially conservative media ecosystem and Donald Trump and Trump campaign would do with those stories on social media and elsewhere.",

      "sentences": "I think the best rebuttal to what Todd Blanche was saying there in the closing statements is just the fact that the scheme existed. That there was this meeting in 2015 at Trump Tower with David Pecker and Donald Trump, and that Trump and the people around him felt that it would be a powerful platform to have all of that exposure on supermarket checkout lines.\"The Enquirer\" and its significance in the culture has waned significantly, even in the years since then. But at that time, it was still a platform with some meaning. And they went after me very, very hard in the course of this, before they signed their non-prosecution agreement and it was painful. They were people with muscle and they could be very, very vindictive when they went after people. So the promise to do that to Trump's enemies and the promise to scoop up and get rid of potentially damaging stories, that wasn't nothing. That might have had a material impact on the election. And prosecutors are saying regardless, it's also a matter of principle that the way \"The Enquirer\" became an apparatus for powerful people to suppress stories is something that the electorate should care about. And that's why you hear Steinglass in his closing arguments, not just talking about the particulars of this case, Jake, but also saying, this was about the hoodwinking of voters. We'll have to see whether jurors and eventually, whether the public agree with that.",

And I also want to turn to our senior political commentators, David Axelrod and Scott Jennings, who are joining us because obviously there's a political lens to everything that happens to a presumptive Republican nominee, certainly in this case. And David Axelrod, let start with you, because something that's different here that we've seen transpire in the last 24 hours is the Biden campaign wading into this, something that they had stayed away from previously, either not really commenting on it or having only campaign aides make remarks about it and press releases. They physically showed up outside the courthouse here yesterday with Robert De Niro and Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, two officers from -- who were there on January 6th and were beaten by rioters on that day. I just wonder, David, what do you make of the strategy of them getting involved now?",

It was a complete fiasco, but I think it is born out of something that is true about the Biden campaign. They are stuck in the mud, or stuck in quicksand, or whatever you -- however you want it and they are scrambling for something to get them out of it. In the month of June, or here at the end of May into June, really may be their last best chance.They've got a verdict coming in this case and they've got to debate at the end of the month. If these two things happen, let's just say Donald Trump is convicted and the debate goes however it goes. If on July 1st, Joe Biden is still a 38 percent or 39 percent and he is still losing in the swing states and he is still losing are roughly tied with Trump nationally, if you think there is a panic going on in the Democratic Party today, give it a month, and then the real panic will set in.

I always find it amusing that on -- in the same breath, he can accuse Biden of being senile and incompetent and then the mastermind of a national conspiracy against him. But I think that there is a sensitivity among -- there was a sensitivity in the White House about not lending credence to the idea that this was part of something political. And so, they've stayed away from it.I agree with Scott that there is a lot of uneasiness among Democrats right now and they may see this as an opportunity to shake things up. The verdict will depend on this. One of the things that interested me about the strategy though, and they are really leaning into Robert De Niro. He did an ad, he narrated and ad that they just released. He sent -- they sent out a letter -- an email from him today. He is -- their problem is with younger voters and I'm not sure that trotting out -- I have a -- I love Robert De Niro, but I'm not sure trotting out another octogenarian is necessarily going to solve their problem.

But I mean, if he is a convicted felon, obviously, they don't expect it to be a problem with Trump's base but they're not just going after his base in this election.They are going after independent moderate voters and some of them have said in polls that yes, it would change the nature of how they consider this race if it is a convicted felon on the ballot.",
