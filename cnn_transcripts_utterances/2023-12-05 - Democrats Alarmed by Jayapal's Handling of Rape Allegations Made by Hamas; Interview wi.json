Congressman, thank you for coming on. You told the \"New York Times\" that you have been internally raging over the silence from international organizations, over this violence. What was it, though, that made you conclude you needed this resolution, this declarative statement to be made by the House?REP. LOIS FRANKEL (D-FL):  Well, first, thank you for having me here today. Listen, I think it's -- I want to make this clear. Rape and sexual assault is not an acceptable weapon of war. And this needs to be said from every level of government. And it has to be sent -- said from every person on Earth because this is a political and cultural and legal issue. I really -- this was really timed with the hearing that was held at the U.N. yesterday, and something that we've been talking about in one of my subcommittees which is the Foreign Ops Appropriations Committee that deals with funding of Israel and other foreign issues. And, in fact, we've heard over the years, tales -- I shouldn't say tales, accusations and brutality of rape as a weapon of war. And now we hear about Hamas, but we've heard it about Ukraine, we've heard it about Afghanistan, Haiti. It's unacceptable wherever it is.",

So, why is it, do you think, so hard for some to confront the hateful and hurtful reality?",

And then of course, again, this now with Hamas and its atrocities. And, you know, I try not to have my actions here be dictated by inartful comments by other members. This is a much more serious issue than one member and it has to be said by all. Rape and sexual assault as a tool of war, as a weapon of war, is not acceptable. It needs to be criminalized in every country, in every territory, and it has to be prosecuted as a crime.I mean, if one of our soldiers, an American soldier, or even an Israeli soldier, used rape as a tool of war, they would be prosecuted in their own country. And it has to be, as I said, legally, politically, and culturally unacceptable. And I'd like to see everybody at that -- all these rallies around the world, I have no problem with people being sympathetic. And I'm sympathetic to the inhumanity and the need for humanitarian support both in Israel and in Gaza. But everybody should be saying, enough is enough. Sexual assault is not acceptable.",

And it typically doesn't cause huge problems except for very little kids and sometimes the elderly.And so, this season, we actually have vaccines or protection from both of those groups. But especially for infants, this antibody shots, well, it's not technically a vaccine. It's actually the antibodies being delivered to protect you against RSV, this has come out. It's called Beyfortus. It's 75 percent effective in preventing severe disease for babies, and it costs about $500 before insurance. And so, there's been a ton of excitement in the public health world that this could make a dent in RSV, which is a really bad infection.",

And so, there's a lot of uncertainty there.Then as the fall started in October, one of the makers said essentially that demand for the vaccine was higher than anticipated, and the CDC then said it should be prioritized for the most vulnerable babies and those under six months old.

Joseph Petito and Nichole Schmidt are suing Laundrie's parents and their attorney, claiming they purposefully withheld information about their daughter's death.CNN's Jean Casarez here with the latest on this. Jean, what's going on here? JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is the third amended complaint in this civil action. And this -- these are brand new allegations with more specific -- specificity that we've ever heard before. And let's look at the timeline right here because this, I think, is most important. First of all, on August 27th, we know it was a homicide. That's what the medical examiner ruled. That's what Brian Laundrie had written in his journal that was found after he committed suicide. So, it's August 27th that's believed that she died. And then on August 29th, that is when the allegation in this complaint states that Brian Laundrie called his parents from Wyoming or either on his way back, saying Gabby is gone. I need a lawyer. So, then it's alleged that the parents called the attorney, Steven Bertolino, on that date. And then on September 1st, Brian Laundrie arrives back home to Florida in the van, Gabby's van, but no Gabby. But then on September 2nd, this is very important, it is alleged in this complaint that the attorney for the Laundries called a firm in Laramie, Wyoming, even giving them a retainer. And previous to that, he had contacted the public defender's office, right? And they defend those who are charged with crimes in Wyoming in the specific county where her remains were found. But her remains, just as you say, John, were not found until two weeks later. And it was not because of anything the Laundries did. It's because of the campers that were in the area. Everyone was trying to find what happened to Gabby.",

But they also, through their attorney, sent a letter, we hope that Gabby can be found. We hope you are reunited. So, that is part of the allegation.But at the same time, John, law enforcement had to be asking the family of Brian Laundrie, do you know anything? What happened? Well, that can be the basis of lying to a law enforcement officer. That can be the basis of something that is extremely serious.",
