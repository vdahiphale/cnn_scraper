CNN was able to geolocate the video to a street in the northernmost section of Matamoros, located near an offramp from the bridge the group used to cross into Mexico from Texas. A timeline from Mexican officials indicated that about two hours after the group drove into Mexico, a car began following them.Now, it's unclear what happened after the group crossed the border. We know that they were supposed to be going to a medical appointment for one of the surviving victims, Latavia Washington McGee. McGee's friend, Cheryl Orange said she made the trip to Texas but she did not cross the border because she did not have the proper identification. According to Orange, the trip from Brownsville to the clinic was only supposed to take 15 minutes. On Friday Mexican officials announced the arrest of five men. It's unclear if the men are the same group the drug cartel believed to be responsible for the kidnappings, said they were going to hand-over to authorities later in the day, but officials released more information on how they took custody of the men. In a tweet, Mexican officials said in part, \"Due to the conditions in which five men were found in Matamoros along with a car and a letter, they were initially treated as victims of crime but this changed to suspects when they began to report their participation in the events of March 3rd.\" Here in South Carolina with the four victims lived, McGee told us that she is happy to be back home, she is with her family and that she is doing OK. The other survivor, Eric Williams, he was shot several times and is recovering in a hospital. The bodies of Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown had been turned over to authorities. And the Woodard family tells us that they hope to bring his body back to South Carolina on Wednesday. Carlos Suarez, CNN, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, the Ukraine said yesterday that the -- there are combat engagements, in their words, happening almost every single hour of the day.So, the fighting there is extremely fierce. The advantage that the Ukrainians have is that, look, they have held this city, this town for months and months successfully. And so, it is extremely well fortified, they call it a fortress. But beyond that, it is really like any other town or city in Eastern Ukraine. It does not hold any kind of outsized importance or strategic value. What it has taken on is a lot of symbolic value, which a Ukrainian commander in the eastern part of the country says, only grows every single day. Because the Ukrainians say that, look, if the Russians are to take this town, not only would it be, obviously, a symbolic blow for the Ukrainians but also, they believe that it would make it easier for them to launch more large-scale attacks further inside of the country. We also saw a new video from the head of the Wagner private military contractor purporting to show the Russians continuing to make slow but steady progress and actually moving toward the city's center. Yevgeny Prigozhin claims in this video that he's only 1.2 kilometers from the town administration building, which you can see in the video, it has smoke coming from it. He is calling on other Russian fighters to cover their flanks because he says that if they don't then the Ukrainians will launch a counterattack and surround the Wagner troops or during the bulk of the fighting there. Just as the Ukrainians right now, he claims, are surrounded in that city center. He also, in a separate video talked about the motivations of his Russian fighters. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER MERCENARY GROUP (through translator):  What is our goal? Why are we fighting? The goal is simple, to not disgrace Russian weapons, to not disgrace Russia. Not to bring Russia to the point where it, itself, collapses. Most likely this is the goal of the American, British intelligence services which work for the long haul and work to destroy Russia.

But for the Israeli government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they say that these reforms are sorely needed as a way to rebalance the branches of government.

They don't need any votes from the opposition to push this through. And this coming week, they plan a major legislative blitz that would help push these reforms even closer to becoming final.

However, that does not mean there still isn't a significant way to go.So, Annenberg Inclusion Initiative recently came out with a study and they saw that whereas people of color represented about eight percent of all nominees before Oscars So White, that is more than doubled to 17 percent, but that still means that 83 percent of Oscar nominees are white.
