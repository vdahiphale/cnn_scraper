Butfirst your headlines this hour Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Chinese Counterpart Xi Jinping have spoken for the first time since Russia's invasion. They exchanged views on the conflict with China reaffirming support for peace talks, and the country will also send a special envoy to Ukraine. ISIS-K leader who planned a suicide bombing at Kabul's Airport, which killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghan civilians, has been killed by the Taliban. Big trouble for one of the leading regional banks in the U.S., First Republic says depositors pulling money out of the bank at an alarming rate. And later this hour, the biggest football game of the year Manchester City take on Arsenal in a top of the table clash could decide who lifts the Premier League Title. Welcome to the second hour of \"Connect the World\"! I'm Lynda Kinkade. Good to have you with us. The continued violence in Sudan is having devastating consequences for its civilians caught in the crossfire. Even before the fighting broke out, nearly 1/3 of the population was already in need of humanitarian aid. Now the country is running out of food, fuel and other vital supplies. Crucially, more than a dozen hospitals are out of service, even as the need for medical attention soars. CNN's David McKenzie who has been following the developments and joins us now from Johannesburg good to have you with us, David! So this humanitarian crisis is growing worse by the day. The hospital system virtually collapsed. Most of the hospitals now closed. What more can you tell us?",

More than two thirds of the hospitals in Khartoum have been shut down. We spoke to a doctor, a senior doctor in the eastern part of the Capital Khartoum, she says they are getting a very large deluge of casualties at all times civilians with multiple gunshot wounds. And these are the kinds of situations they're describing that they can't even sterilize their instruments between the surgeries because so many people are coming in. And it's not just simple surgeries she said they're very complex, often hour long surgeries. There is 20 or so staff that is left there. She's working with work round the clock for more than 11 days now. And despite the cause of ceasefires and the statements about ceasefires, people still keep coming in and running low on almost every kind of supply, Lynda.",

Now Save the Children, some time ago said that, in fact, forces that didn't indicate which are blocking aid coming in to those hospitals. And that's very difficult because of the general chaos to resupply the surgeons that are doing their work. They've even had to deploy youth from the area to surround the hospital to protect it from the widespread looting that is happening in Khartoum to protect both the surgeons and those inside and from supplies from being stolen. Many of them are sleeping in that hospital to try and save people's lives. But as Dr. Al-Hassan (ph) told us, she said they're not even sleeping. It's more like they are fainting, and then kind of bringing themselves up to continue this difficult work.

And we have about 6000 more refugees, and then news is coming from here and there of groups of refugees crossing the border. Our impression is definitely that the situation not improving, we will see more refugees crossing in the coming few days. There are places where arrivals are continuous. So every day you see people crossing with whatever they can carry along. And they are all settling very close to the border, which is of course a concern for the safety of the refugees and also for the country itself. So we are going to replan, to do as fast as we can then you know, relocation, a little bit farther away from the border. But for the moment, you know what our operational figure remains 20,000.

Mr. Xi of course met with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month. And along the frontlines in Southern Ukraine a tense and uncertain waiting game is unfolding around Zaporizhzhia where Ukrainian forces say Russian troops are on the move and civilians are being evacuated from Russian held areas ahead of an expected counter offensive by Ukraine. But exactly when and where that might happen is still anybody's guess. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Change is in the air. But here in -- Russia is the same and its intensity and clumsiness of bombing. It's not clear if this tiny town is a launch pad for Ukraine's counter offensive, but Moscow pounds it just to be sure. A similar story here too on a riverbank near Kherson the reportedly Ukrainian forces may be crossing into occupied areas.

Now theWhite House says the mastermind of the 2021 bombing of Kabul Airport has been killed by the Taliban. Though he was not mentioned by name, it's widely believed the White House was referring to the Head of the so-called ISIS-K group, an affiliated organization active in Afghanistan. The attack left 13 American service members and more than 170 Afghans dead. Oren Liebermann has been following the reaction and joins us now from the Pentagon. So, Oren, the mastermind behind the Kabul attack that left these 13 U.S. servicemen dead, these 170 Afghans killed. He's now dead, killed by the Taliban. How is the Pentagon reacting?

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, we got a statement fairly late last night from the Defense Department which saysthat the United States had no role in this operation, or whatever happened there that led to the death of the senior ISIS-K leader. So that's telling in and of itself that there was no co-ordination or co-operation with the Taliban, at least according to the Defense Department, in what led to the death of this ISIS-K leader. Although the White House didn't say when this had happened, DOD saying this happened sometime in early April. What's unclear is how exactly the Taliban killed this senior ISIS-K leader; whether it was a targeted attack they were going after this leader or whether it was simply infighting between ISIS-K and the Taliban. Last month, it was General Erik Kurilla, the Commander of U.S. Central Command who said the ISIS-K has been carrying out more attacks throughout the region in which they are active, that is Afghanistan and some of the surrounding countries. But also, that their goal was to attack U.S. interests outside of Afghanistan, although ultimately it says they'd like to carry out an attack on the U.S. homeland. They are far from being able to do so and would more likely try to target U.S. interests abroad. Broadly speaking, that seeks to ISIS-Ks intent, but the White House saying this is one of several senior ISIS-K leaders who have been killed since the beginning of the year. Even those who are critical of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan have praised the death of this senior ISIS-K leader. For example, Representative Michael McCaul, the Republican Head of the House Foreign Relations Committee says that this is one terrorist dead and that itself is a good thing. But it doesn't absolve the Biden Administration from the responsibility of how the withdrawal from Afghanistan was handled, and the deaths of the 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghans in that suicide bombing and the closing days of the withdrawal. In fact, CNN also spoke with a father of one of the Marines who was killed in that attack, who had largely the same sentiment. It's good that the world got rid of a terrorist in this case. But again, what he wants to see is more accountability, more responsibility taken from not only the White House, but also the Pentagon and the State Department, Lynda.",

But there isn't much more to look at in terms of kinetic activity that the Biden Administration has carried out since the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Polio has been pretty much eradicated or entirely eradicated from Sudan, although it's resurgent in one or two other African countries. So, if that were to get out, that would be extremely bad news for the polio eradication programs and bad news, indeed, for anybody contracting it. The other two are less of an immediate worry, because particularly cholera is in any case endemic. And if it were to get a grip, it could do so on its own. But clearly if it got out of that laboratory and began infecting people that could accelerate a cholera outbreak.

Our Business Correspondent Rahel Solomon is tracking the story and joins us now live from New York, good to see Rahel. So, this is a new record low for first republic bank virtually in free-fall.",

And the beginning of what had become a bit of a banking crisis here in the U.S. and even beyond. So, the concern, of course, after this Monday, essentially is when the company reported earnings and we can show you the stock performance over the last 12 months or so you can see that before March, the stock price had been relatively stable and then of course, the follow up SVB. The concern here of course, beyond just the fact that deposits fell at a staggering rate, as you pointed out, is that first republic and SVB, the failed SVB have a very similar profile. A case in point they have very concentrated depositor base, and they have a lot of deposits on their books. SVB had a lot of deposits on its books that were beyond the insured level $250,000 for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And so, the concern is could first republic face a similar fate as SVB did? And so that is really the concern. I should say that as of March, the company First Republic had about two thirds of those uninsured deposits on its books. The company said this week, that level is actually closer to 27 percent. So, what do they do now, Lynda? While the company said it is trying to strengthen its balance sheet with different measures, we can show you here slashing headcount up to 25 percent, reducing executive compensation, condensing office space, cutting back on non-essential projects, all of these things. But will it be enough? Investors don't appear convinced as the stock continues to fall. There's some reporting that the bank is also looking for a rescue deal and that the U.S. government is not willing, at least not at this point to intervene. And as at least as it stands right now, it looks like there's more trouble ahead.",
