Here with me, we have Sara Fischer, Jessica Dean, Athena Jones, and Kylie Atwood. Great to have all of you here tonight.So, at first, what's about to happen in this $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox over election lies? It's set to begin just hours from now. Now, today, there was an abrupt and unexplained delay that spurred speculation of a possible settlement. And now, there's a tent that's gone up outside of the courthouse. We think that this could shield some of the high-profile witnesses like Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson who are expected to show up and have to take the stand. Sara Fischer has been covering this case. So, Sara, what is going to -- is this -- let me start with that. Is this going to happen tomorrow?",

They're not just looking for damages. They're looking to embarrass Fox. They're looking to make sure that Fox has to take account for what they put on their air. So that's one.And the number two is that Fox in this situation, if they were to try to get a settlement for this case, that would set a precedent for every single other defamation lawsuit that they face. So, this is a $1.6 billion suit. They're looking at a $2.7 billion suit for Smartmatic after this. Do they want to set the precedent that they're just going to settle and pay out all of these defamation lawsuits? I don't quite know, especially because it might not be that Dominion actually gets all $1.6 billion. A jury would have to be convinced that it is awarded -- it deserves to be aware of those damages. For Fox, it might be worth it to see this in front of a jury and see if they can get a lower down amount than what they would had to settle for.",

Do you do all pre-interviews with Trump?

But part of it also is that once the firing, the shooting begins, it becomes unclear who's shooting at whom and where the shots coming from, and there's a sort of pile on effect. But the bottom line is that the AG of Ohio said, look, they were justified. Each of them individually reached a conclusion that there was a threat and they were justified. There's going to be an internal review in the police department there in Akron, and they're going to have to account for all the bullets they fired.

He said that they would do it by the time of the first -- of the anniversary of Jayland Walker's death, which is in late June or so. So, maybe not tomorrow, but that's what we're looking for in the coming days out of that case.

And so, people might -- you know, we'll see how they respond.",
