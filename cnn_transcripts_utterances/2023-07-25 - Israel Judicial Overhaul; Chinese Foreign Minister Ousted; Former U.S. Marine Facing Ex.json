And the message, on the bottom, says this is a black day for Israeli democracy. Now these were all paid advertisements, paid for by a protest organization that represents high-tech CEOs. But it is incredibly notable that all of these newspapers just even accepted the advertisement to run on their front page on such a consequential newsday. Instead of the articles, instead of the photos, it's this black page. It represents, for these protesters, for the opposition, for many in the high- tech economic world here, for many former IDF chiefs of staff, represents how they feel about what happened yesterday in the Israeli parliament. Of course, the proponents of this law say that it was a necessary reform, say it's helping to bring balance back, that it's taking away some of the power from the supreme court and giving it to the hands of the democratically elected people. But what we've seen overnight is more protests erupting after this bill passed. We saw clashes on the highways and streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, dozens of protesters injured, more than 19 arrested, at least a dozen police officers injured as well. We saw police officers using things like water cannons, the skunk water that emits this really foul stench. They were mounted on horseback. They were using a decent amount of force as well. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did issue a statement, a televised one, last night, calling what happened an important, what he said, democratic step. a necessary democratic. step saying that it strengthens democracy. This is a lot of what he's been saying in the past. He blamed the opposition for not being able to compromise with the coalition government over the previous months. And he said his door is open for further compromise negotiations as they take on the next steps. Because, Eleni, keep in mind, that bill that passed yesterday, that tries to prevent the supreme court from being able to block government actions that the supreme court says are unreasonable, that's just one part. That's just, as one expert said on CNN earlier, that's just the appetizer to what the Israeli government is planning. The big question is, what happens next in the legal situation? There are petitions in the front of the supreme court. They have not yet issued an injunction but we do expect to hear from them in some way, potentially today or definitely in the coming days.

So that could set up, really, a crisis here if the supreme court strikes it down, if somehow the Israeli government says that's not something that they will accept. Also something to keep on mind is what is happening today in the further fallout. That's the economic fallout. We just heard from Morgan Stanley that they are moving Israel's sovereign credit to a dislike stance.

He was having a meeting with the leaders of Sri Lanka, Vietnam as well as Russia. And then, after that prolonged absence, that was finally recognized today. Let's back up just a few hours. It was this afternoon, in Beijing, during the regular ministry of foreign affairs' news conference when a reporter asked about Qin Gang's whereabouts. The response, then, the exact phrase, was, \"no information to provide,\" adding that, \"China's diplomatic activities are being carried out as usual.\" Well, just a few hours ago, we received an alert that Qin Gang would no longer be serving as foreign minister and instead replaced by Wang Yi, who actually held the job before. Qin Gang has had a long relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He has been a very vocal and very visible force on the Chinese political platform. He is the one who made bold statements, rebukes, if you will, after the shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon. He was instrumental in the meetings with Antony Blinken, when the secretary of state of the U.S. went to China. But then recently, he has not been seen in the public eye. In fact, when such high-ranking American leaders, such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, as well as John Kerry, made visits to China, he was not seen.

People are just starting to come in again with temperatures hitting over 110 degrees Fahrenheit and expected to rise even further. Tomorrow, we expect conditions to improve.

One scientist said it could be that this will be a coolsummer in the future if we don't stop burning fossil fuels, a harbinger of perhaps what is to come and a warning. JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  Eleni, exactly that. This is a report by something called the World Weather Attribution initiative. Basically, a group of scientists and climate scientists around the world, who want to respond to events that we are seeing, the kind of weather events that we are seeing. And the find out the root causes. And in their report, there is no question, if there was any doubt, that human behavior has had a great deal of influence on what's happening, especially human-induced climate change. The amount of hydrocarbons that are being consumed and produced and created, effective greenhouse gases. So in any case, the report says that, if things stay the same, if they stay right where they are now, you can expect to see these kinds of periods of very high heat and the kinds of things that we've seen in the last few weeks -- you can expect to see them once every 15 years in the United States, in North America, once every 10 years in Europe and once every five years in China as we go forward. But the thing is that things are not staying where they are. We are now at 1.2 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels. And every year it goes up slightly. This is the global temperature. And if it hits 2 degrees above the pre-industrial levels, that means that - - at least the scientists predict that will result in something like these kinds of events happening every 2-5 years. So it's a rather dire report, without a whole lot of thought about what to do about it except bring down the level of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.",

And we are seeing already this year the kind of deaths and the kind of rate of deaths around Europe that we saw last year. So the solutions are there but they are minor ones, things like cooling centers and urban planning to make things, for instance, to use reflective materials that are maybe white in color instead of darker colors, which absorb the heat, those kinds of things.
