It comes nearly two days after the committee expected to release it all because of typographical errors and printing issues.But it is nearly 900 pages with a comprehensive narrative of what occurred before, during, and immediately after January 6th. Most importantly here, it also lays out 11 specific recommendations from the committee about how various agencies and even Congress can move forward. And key among those recommendations is the committee is pointing to a section of the Constitution, the 14th amendment section three that clearly states that anyone who is engaged in an insurrection can be disqualified from holding office. The committee says that that constitutional provision should be enforced, and while they don't say it directly, the takeaway here is that they believe that Donald Trump should be barred from holding office again, especially because he has now announced his plan to run in 2024. The committee separately is also pushing for passage of the Presidential Election Reform Act. That would make clear that vice presidents do not have the power to overturn elections, of course, as Trump pressured Pence to do. And the committee is also recommending that federal intelligence and security agencies really take a much closer look at the dangers of violent extremism, especially since members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were at the forefront of the Capitol attack. Plus, there's a host of new details in this 800-plus page report, including about how John Eastman first contacted Donald Trump at the White House on December 23rd, 2020, almost exactly two years ago, to fill Trump in on his plan to get Pence to overturn the election. Of course, Pence refused to do that, and also how a little-known attorney named Kenneth Chesebro allegedly came up with that plot to appoint fake electors in battleground states to try to claim that Trump had actually won in those states. And crucially here, that fake elector plot is exactly what is now being investigated by state prosecutors, including in Georgia. Also, federal prosecutors from the special counsel's office. And those prosecutors from the special counsel's office they have even served subpoenas to election officials in several battleground states as part of its ramped-up investigation. So, the committee wrapping up its report, but still potentially a long way to go on the criminal side. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.",

FOSTER:  The final report from the House committee investigating January 6th concludes that Donald Trump or anyone inciting an insurrection should be disqualified from public office. The panel released its final report late on Thursday. It outlines a coordinated effort by Trump and his allies to pressure state election officials submit fake -- fake electors to Congress and overturn the 2020 vote. It also says the former President pedaled false claims that the election was rigged to raise more than $250 million. Let's bring in Richard Johnson.

But you are right that the next step really whether or not there are criminal prosecution steps to criminally prosecute Trump are taken, that is trickier and that is going to be more politically fraught for the Justice Department.

It's trying to unwind from years of its zero COVID policy and now concern is rising over the true toll, the true scale of COVID- 19 infection across the country. Because official figures in China are unreliable for a number of reasons.One of them is that China is carrying out less testing as before as it takes this U-turn of its zero COVID strategy. But also, it recently narrowed a definition of what constitutes a COVID related death. You know, for this month so far, China has officially reported only eight COVID related deaths. That's it. It's a remarkably low number, especially given the mounting evidence of surging cases and surging deaths across the country. In Beijing, you have scenes like this. The hospitals are being overwhelmed with patients, but also you have our team in Beijing has filmed evidence of an of a cramped and very crowded crematorium there. They witnessed those billowing plumes of smoke, just billowing nonstop over the furnaces. They also filmed and witnessed piles upon piles of yellow body bags in metal containers there. Hospitals in Beijing are overwhelmed. There are reports that medical professionals from across the country are now going to Beijing to help out.

The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is now calling on China and other countries to provide information about COVID-19 outbreaks. He says he has a number of concerns, economic concerns, public health concerns, but also deeply concerned about the possibility of a new variant emerging. This is what America's top diplomat said. He said this, quote, \"anytime the virus is spreading or moving around, there is a possibility that a new variant develops. That variant spreads even further, and it comes and hits us or other countries around the world.\" Unquote. Now Secretary Blinken, he also spoke to the foreign minister of China, Wang Yi, over the phone about the COVID-19 outbreak in China, as well as other issues.
