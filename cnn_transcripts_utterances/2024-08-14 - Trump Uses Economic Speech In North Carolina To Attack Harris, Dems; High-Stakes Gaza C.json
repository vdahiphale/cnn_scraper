Is there any hope for a breakthrough without the participation of Hamas and as the threat of an Iranian attack on Israel still hangs very much over the region?Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv and you're in the Situation Room. We begin with the presidential race as the battle for North Carolina is heating up tonight, Donald Trump speaking at a rally just a little while ago in Asheville two days before Kamala Harris campaigns in the state. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is joining us live from Asheville right now. Jeff, what has Trump been saying?",

Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe? Kamala has declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority.

He hasn't been able to do that. He's been scrambling a bit in trying to find his footing against Vice President Harris, and we see that in recent polls just out this week, she's gaining a lot of momentum in those key swing states. I've also -- you know, she appears to be having an effect where the Democratic base is coming back to her, which was an issue that President Biden had. And I was just talking to some black organizers on the ground in states like Minnesota and Michigan, and they were saying that the base is much more enthusiastic with her. There's still work that she needs to do, which is why you're seeing her make a lot of stops in swing states, including going to North Carolina later this week, ahead of the convention, because she's still trying to make sure that she's able to get all of those Democratic voters, that base, back to her, because President Biden was really struggling with them.",

We've been asking the Ukrainians, quite frankly, to fight this war with one arm tied behind their back. And then, you know when you see so much of the Russian projection of power, either from these air bases or from missile sites coming from inside Russia, and then saying that somehow the Ukrainians cannot attack those replacements. I just don't think that makes any sense. So I think what we've seen is the Ukrainians making this move. I think they fought in accordance with international law, war, as you have heard, trying to form a deal to have an exchange of the prisoners of war. I think they have only attacked these air bases with missiles, not civilian areas, as I understand those. They've been done with ground troops.

He was convicted on gun charges in Delaware back in June, and in that trial, he was represented by Abby Lowell, but going forward, they actually have a new lead attorney for this upcoming trial. They brought on LA based attorney Mark Geragos.Now one of the reasons Lowell is stepping aside is because he spread pretty thin with all the other litigation that Hunter Biden has brought against some of his detractors, part of his new, more aggressive strategy that takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money, something that Hunter Biden doesn't have much of. So as they go into this trial, it's important to report that they actually tried to resolve this with a plea deal. We learned that there were talks between the special Counsel's Office and Hunter Biden's lawyers about trying to negotiate a plea to avoid the second trial. That is especially significant because all of these legal issues were originally supposed to be resolved with a plea deal that, of course, fell apart spectacularly when it was supposed to be signed off on by a judge, resulting in the president's son facing these two trials. But as of now, our source is telling us they do expect this case will go to trial in early September. But another question lingering out there Wolf is whether the President will pardon his son. Now, he has said that he will not pardon him. He will not commute his sentence, but he said that before he decided to step aside and not run for re-election and a lot of questions about whether President Biden would really let his son go to federal prison, likely, especially when the two cases that he has faced, most experts say are pretty unusual, but at this point, he's on the record saying he won't do it. So far, my sources say there's been no final decision, and really, only the President knows what he'll do there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Wolf, good to be with you. The legal strategy is to limit their monetary liability. When you get a case taken to an arbitrator, you have a person who's dispassionate, who just makes his decision predicated upon whatever the law would be. Arbitrations are favored because they're quick. They're generally final, and you have the matter that goes forward relatively quickly in a court of law.I think what Disney is trying to do is to avoid a jury. And getting a jury, yes, they may be asking for $50,000 in compensatory damage, in English, it means perhaps they're out-of-pocket losses, but punitive damages, which are designed to punish for reckless and irresponsible behavior, could be in the millions. And so that's what the reality is. However, I think what it comes down to also is an oppressive provision which in a contract that could not have been foreseen. What do I mean? You cannot, therefore, by having something as unconscionable as this, and in English, that means it's just so oppressive. You have something in an actual by the way, you've signed before streaming services, it's a trial period. But you know what? You can't sue us. It needs to go to arbitration first. I don't even think that's enforceable. They will go to court to make that determination. Ultimately, I think this goes in front of a jury if it goes that far. But what I really think Wolf is that this will settle and settle for big numbers with regard to the negligence of providing his wife right with nuts and other food that she couldn't eat and getting assurances that it wasn't in there. So that's what it's all about, limiting monetary liability that dog is not going to hunt.",

This matter being whether or not Disney has a legal basis to provide for arbitration instead of a court proceeding. And again, we signed lots of contracts every day, but someone Wolf has to be put on notice of what they're signing, the essence of what they're signing, by the way, the husband signed, it should that be imputed to the wife who's now dead? So those are legal arguments that will ultimately be made. But another thing that's happening behind the scenes, you bet, is because of the bad publicity to Disney and people who are feeling at home, are you kidding that I think this will settle relatively quickly for high numbers? We may not know those numbers because I'm sure it would be subjected to a confidentiality agreement. But if I'm visiting, I'm keeping this way out of court.I think this argument is beyond the pale. Attorneys make arguments every day. Those arguments are creative, but to take advantage of someone like this by saying it's an arbitration provision, you can't be in court, I think that's a bit much.",

Quote, \"Throughout their time in office, Democratic women governors have made history, changed the conversation surrounding women in executive roles and gotten big things done for the good people of their states. They've shattered marble ceilings and demonstrated excellent leadership. Their voices are essential.\" Now, as I said, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, she has spoken up recently about women's issues.
