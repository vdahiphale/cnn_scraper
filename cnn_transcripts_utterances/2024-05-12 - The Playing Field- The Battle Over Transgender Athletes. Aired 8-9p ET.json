LINDA BLADE, FOUNDER, NCAA TRACK AND FIELD ALL-AMERICAN: In 2015, the surgical requirement was thrown out by the International Olympic Committee, the IOC, and all the male athlete would have to do is self- declare as a woman and spend one year with testosterone levels lower two and maintain at or below 10 nanomoles per liter. Female athletes' right to fair and safe sport have been disregarded by the IOC. This mindset just has to change.

ZELCH: I see the joy on her face when she gets to play. For the last five years there have been very few moments when she's just been able to be a kid. It's so rare. Let's go. Let's go. We got to bat. We got to bat. Here we go, Ember. You got it. The fact that she can just fail and mess up, and get back up there and try again. That is one of those valuable things about sports. One of her favorite moments and with her team this year was a game that they lost actually. They were down by a lot and they rallied. You can see they just gelled as a team. Everyone was focused and everyone was doing what they needed to do. Good job, Ember. And so that's been my favorite game. Can we do a team picture real quick? Smile. E. ZELCH: In the fall, I am leaving Ohio for college. I am actually foregoing a scholarship to any Ohio school because it's not safe for me to continue to stay in Ohio.
