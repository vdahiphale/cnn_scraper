      "sentences": "Well, while I was watching it, and my one big takeaway was this is probably if Kamala Harris's campaign could have designed the takeaways from the Madison Square Garden rally for Trump, this might be some version that they would have designed, because their entire mission in these last eight days is to draw a sharp contrast in the minds of American voters as possible, to put the choice of these two candidates, their visions, how they present their agendas to the country in as much stark relief as possible. And this fed into that.I also was thinking earlier in the day, Donald Trump's campaign put out a two-minute ad, they were going to -- they ran it in football games and NFL game, Sara. And it was -- I watched this ad yesterday morning, and I sent it around to our team, and I said, I think this is the most compelling ad of the cycle from the Trump campaign. It was the most sort of positive, most focused on the economy on some issues that his advisers think worked really well for him. It was really succinct. And it was the opposite of the racism, misogyny, the nastiness that you see as sort of staples of Trump's rallies on the campaign trail. And yet, within hours, it was back to this. So I just think that this puts clear, front and center for the American people, especially those small slice of voters who haven't decided yet, what their choices before this election. SIDNER:  It certainly does. All right, so there is new CNN polling out this morning. And some of it finds that Americans don't think Trump will concede if he loses, when you look at the numbers. That is a huge number of people, 69 percent saying they don't think he will concede, and they don't trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decision on legal challenges related to the 2020 election.

And I think it's notable that it happened in New York, in New York city Madison Square Garden. This is the place that was Trump's home for so long. This is, Trump Towers this is right down the street. It's also a place that has consistently rejected him in the last two presidential cycles.So for him to at the moment where the candidates are going around, their barnstorming, they're hitting the ground running, where they're supposed to be making these messages that are bringing people into the party, showing that we're inclusive, our side is the winning side. Instead, what he does is he goes in, and he doubles down on what he is most comfortable with -- the bigotry, the racism, the misogyny, the xenophobia, all of these things that have essentially made him who he is. And the other thing that's really important here is as we see this playing out, two things to remember. One, Donald Trump, a lot of people have been saying, well, they were just joking. Donald Trump has been very upfront about not joking about many of these issues. So the idea that, for example, that Puerto Rico would be a garbage dump ha- ha, that's a joke. Actually, we saw that play out at the tail end of hurricane Maria when Puerto Rico was left in the dark for months. And so we see these things over and over again. But the other point is, as we come down to the end of the day, as we come down to the end of the race, Donald Trump is looking around and saying, I haven't been penalized yet for these kinds of remarks. In fact, we're in a statistical dead tie. So if anything, what he is telling us is that I'm going to lean into the message that I think is a winning message, that I think represents both the America that I want to see, but also the America that Americans want to see. And that is one that is deeply, deeply racist, misogynistic, sexist, and xenophobic.",

And when they're circulating these messages that are hurtful and potentially detrimental to persuadable voters, to voters that really both campaigns need, because as you and David Chalian and everyone has noted, this is coming down to the wire.

We saw it with Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. And we also saw it with Joe Biden in a moment where Americans were deeply fed up and very scared about democracy in 2020. So we need to see that. We also need to see, I think, a little bit of what we saw from her rally in Texas and Houston the other day, which is we need to see her make very strong points on those areas that Americans are deeply concerned about, the economy, women's rights, reproductive choice, abortion, right, these things that people I have said over and over again, this is where I am suffering. Are you listening? Do you hear me? And so we need to hear that and less about Donald Trump, because we know what Donald Trump is. Donald Trump has done the work on that already. And so I think what we will see is a doubling down on this kind of outlook, this kind of positive outlook, this vision for America that is very much rooted in saying, I am the outsider. I can do something different. I can bring something to America that no one else has been able to bring thus far.",

School funding is a big issue here in Pennsylvania for young people, and whether or not they have equitable access to resources. Gun violence is a huge concern or community safety is an issue that young people in Philadelphia care very much about. So, it really depends.
