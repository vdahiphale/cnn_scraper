They were just seen leaving for the day, and we are standing by to find out if they voted on whether to hand up an indictment for Donald Trump.Sources telling CNN that the former president and his advisers are right now preparing for a potential indictment. CNN's Paula Reid is joining us now on that. Paula, what are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "So we know that the grand jury that has been hearing evidence in the Special Counsel's investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, they have been seen leaving the building. But one important person stayed behind and that is the grand jury foreperson.Brianna, that is significant because that is the only member of the grand jury that is needed to return an indictment. Now, at this point it's unclear if they have voted to indict the former president or anyone else in this investigation. One of the reasons we're watching their movement so closely today is because of what we've seen over the past two weeks. We know the former president has received a target letter informing him that he is indeed a target in this investigation. He received an invitation to appear before the grand jury, which he declined. And Brianna, that is usually something that comes at the very end of an investigation. And also another sign that an indictment was imminent, his defense attorneys met with Jack Smith and his team last week. Sources tell CNN they did not think that they would be able to successfully change the trajectory of this investigation, but they hoped that they might be able to delay it. Now, this is the first time we've seen the grand jury back meeting today at work. But again, at this point, we don't know if they have returned an indictment. Typically, the way this works is that they would bring this indictment to a magistrate judge in a sealed proceeding. It's unclear, though, if this is going to go according to the usual script, because, of course, this would be, once again, a historic case. So they may deal with it slightly differently, but usually, this would be returned before a magistrate judge in a sealed hearing and the indictment would remain sealed until an arrest. But it's unclear, given the historic and the national significance of a possible indictment, if this could be handled slightly differently, if we could see potentially documents shortly after any indictment is returned. But, Brianna, we have our wonderful team of reporters at the courthouse watching every possible angle of this right now, and we'll come back to you if we hear that an indictment has indeed been returned.",

We're learning that the Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has issued subpoenas to a former state lawmaker as well as an independent journalist. This is a strong signal that she does intend to seek indictments in her criminal probe of Trump, because those witnesses relate to efforts to put a fake slate of electors in Georgia to overturn the results of the election there.CNN's Sara Murray joins me now. So these newest subpoenas point, it seems, to her focus on this attempt to seat fake electors there. Biden won the state, an attempt to seat electors that would have shown Trump falsely won the state.",

Joining me now, former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. And here we are, the former president possibly on the cusp of not one, but two additional indictments or perhaps multiple one here in Washington, D.C., and then the ongoing case in Georgia. If the Special Counsel, if this grand jury has decided to indict the former president specifically for events on January 6th also an effort nationally to overturn the election, can you place this into some context for us more serious than the other indictments, but also historically, have we ever seen anything like this legally?",

Up until the Mar-A-Lago case, we did not have an indictment of any sitting or former president. That was the first ever indictment, federal indictment, I would say, of a former president. Obviously, he has two already.But here, you have someone being indicted, and here it's not just someone, it's not just some oath keeper, it is the former president of the United States being indicted for a scheme to prevent the peaceful transfer of power in the United States. It is incredibly serious, because one thing that's been a hallmark of the United States since President Washington stepped down is that we have a peaceful transfer of power in this country and so it's certainly serious. I mean, I could break it down in a legal sense of whether it's serious or not, but it's unprecedented. It's far-reaching. It is the first and only indictment of its kind, if it comes out.",

But based on what you know, can you describe the standard, right, to prove this, you're - if you've convinced a jury, a grand jury, to indict him, that's one thing. You now have to convince a jury of 12 to convict a former president here. What would you need to see to meet that standard?",

In trial, it's beyond a reasonable doubt. And the Justice Department policy is not to seek an indictment unless you're confident that you can prove your case beyond a reasonable doubt when it gets into the courtroom. And so what are we looking for here? What would Jack Smith be looking for in his investigation? He's looking to disprove arguments that Trump has that he legitimately knew that he legitimately thought that the election was stolen from him.In other words, he wasn't trying to defraud everyone by selling that big lie. In fact, he really thought, genuinely thought the lie was true. He's trying to subpoena witnesses who are close to Trump, whether as we've heard Jared Kushner, we've heard Mike Pence, others that have been subpoenaed for that. Also trying to deal with these, I would say, advice of counsel defenses from - essentially advice he's getting from dishonest or crooked lawyers, people like Giuliani or Eastman who have very, often very questionable, unethical legal theories. What did he really believe about that? What else was he told by legitimate, honest lawyers about what his legal options were? I think that's going to be (inaudible) focus of what he's looking for.",

In court, it was said 2,500 pages of discovery.There were two hard drives, six discs that will get in the hands of the defense. And as we heard the prosecutor say out in the press conference that New York has a very, very broad discovery requirement from the prosecution to the defense. We also heard what those 2,500 pages incurred. My colleague, Brynn Gingras, told me that it's photos and autopsy photos and lots of paperwork, lots of reports. Also, from the New York medical examiner's office, the autopsy reports, photos of the crime scene, crime scene processing photos, so much for a 13-year investigation to be handed now over to the defense.

      "sentences": "Potentially it could be. I think there can be a number of reasons. If we look back at what Ukraine has targeted in terms of drone targets in Moscow, it went for the Kremlin in the beginning. And it seems pretty clear the Kremlin put up some kind of electronic defenses.We've also seen them try to target airfields, airports, military, civilian airfields around Moscow because a couple of times over the past month or so, those airfields have had to shut down their airspace, but no reported impacts on the airfield that we're aware of, so were there defensive measures put in place by the Russians there. This area that they've hit, yes, it does have some government employees, but they don't seem to have a particularly important function. As best we know, one of the departments there is a sort of a weights and measures department. Another that checks measurements, another one has a technical library. Another one may have something to do with electronics and drones, but not clear. But it certainly doesn't seem as if there's any sort of high value military or potentially commercial target there. So what it may be is, is just this - this is a very smart, fancy commercial neighborhood that went up maybe a decade or so ago and for this reason. And I think another thing about it here, you think about Ukrainians connecting a message to Russians, this set of buildings is right next to a major route into the center of Moscow from the suburbs of Moscow. So a lot of people are going to see it. So I think there's a lot of reasons here.",

And I wonder, given Nic's point just then, a highly visible target on a highly visible road into Moscow where lots of folks are going to see this and say, hey, wait a second, Ukrainians can strike here, what does that mean for me.

And also, I think what we also need to point out, it is also sort of a symbol of the power of Russia, the financial power, but also the power that it has in things like hydrocarbons and business as well.So certainly this is right a strike at the heart of the economic center of Russia. So I do think that in that respect, it is something that has an impact on the Russian population. But one of the things we also kept - we have to keep in mind, Jim, is that the Russian leadership does not want Russians, particularly in Moscow, to be talking about the war, to be thinking very much about the war, and especially not to be thinking that the war is going very difficult. Of course, one of the things that we've heard from the Kremlin over the past, really, over a year since the war started, is that everything is going according to plan. Well, certainly drones hitting the financial center in Moscow is definitely not something that appears to be part of that plan. And I think one of the things that we've also seen in some of the videos that have come out of those strikes is that those drones don't appear to be very big, but they do appear to pack a punch. In fact, I want us to look really quickly at some video that came out of one of those impacts. Let's have a look at that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the explosion was about the same. And, of course, those unleashed terror as well. And that's where you get back to the message that the Ukrainian president was sending to the Russians that the war has now come to them.And that certainly seems to be something that may be dawning now among many Russians, that first of all, these drone attacks are happening and, second of all, they seem pretty hard to stop by the Russian leadership.
