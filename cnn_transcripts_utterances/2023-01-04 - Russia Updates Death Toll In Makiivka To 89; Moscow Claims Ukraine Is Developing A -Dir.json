Moscow is yet to make any public comment on the strikes, but has revised upwards, their official death toll from an earlier, Ukrainian missile strike on a Russian base in the Donetsk region. The Kremlin now says 89 soldiers were killed, the deadliest strike on Russian troops publicly confirmed by Moscow since the war began. And Russian defense officials say Ukrainian forces were able to target the site by tracing cell phone calls by new recruits. The Ukrainians put the Russian death toll in the hundreds. And Ukraine's military has released images claiming to be a strike on an ammunition warehouse in the Luhansk region. The head of the regional military says they watched for weeks as the Russians brought in weapons and vehicles until, bam, there's no more enemy warehouse. And bam, there's no more hockey arena in Donetsk. It was destroyed by a Russian missile while French television correspondent was reporting live. He was left shaken but unharmed. Meantime, Ukraine's president continued with his seemingly neverly -- never ending efforts to try to rally global support speaking with leaders of Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and the U.K. on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is precisely the time when together with partners, we have to strengthen our defenses.

So there are certain things that could be done.I mean, for example, there could be some blockades attempted of Iranian movements, but those blockades would only really be effective in the Persian Gulf. A lot of the equipment that Iran is shipping to Russia is being shipped overland through the Caucasus region, Azerbaijan and those places into Russia. So, it's going to be very difficult for the West to actually intercept those kinds of shipments. That, you know, presents a great deal of difficulty. The other thing that could be done, though, is once these drones become operational, is to work to jam their command and control networks so that they actually don't -- aren't able to fire these drones in a way that they are intended to. In other words, what you would do is you would jam the signals to prevent the drones from actually striking a target. That would be something that would require a great deal of effort, but it can certainly be done.",

And one of the key issues here, John, is that the very fact that the Russian military is not taking the kinds of care that they need to take in order to protect their soldiers.But what that really means is that they don't care about the lives of their soldiers. And that makes a real difference in terms of the ability to employ those forces, as well as the ability to actually take those forces, increase their morale and make them ineffective fighting force. The Russian recipe here is one of a very ineffective fighting force, and it contrasts sharply with that of the Ukrainians. VAUSE: We also know there's been this mobilized -- mobilization rather of the Russian military over the last 10 something years, they spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this. What were also seeing is that the reporting on the military and Russia's military, Newsweek notes this, experts have long been impressed with Russian doctrine, which emphasizes all aspects of war-fighting, including information and economic warfare, manipulation of opponents, politics and hybrid warfare. Much of that doctrine comes from the current chief of the Russian Armed Forces. But the war in Ukraine looks a lot more like the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and then some kind of complicated their war effort. Does that change the calculation here if Putin does decide to dig in for this war of attrition? Is there an argument here for using overwhelming force against him and go for a victory by the Ukrainians?",

If they had implemented the components of that doctrine, we'd probably be looking at something very different on the ground in Ukraine, it doesn't mean that the Russians would necessarily win out right. But it was certainly posture them in a much better way than they are currently postured.And it really shows that if the Russians are going to dig in and you know, move in in that general attrition direction, it's going to be a long slog for them. But it is also possible for the Ukrainians to overcome that and really get around this idea of a war of attrition by moving quickly using HIMARS and other systems like it in a way to actually end this conflict on a perhaps more favorable basis than would otherwise be the case.",

After a midterm election in which swing voters clearly showed concern about the Republican commitment to democracy, you would think that a rational party would be looking for ways to marginalize and lower the profile of someone Jim Jordan, who is you know, such a lightning rod at the center of this and yet, what did we see? We saw, not only did we see the right elevating him as their alternative to McCarthy, we saw McCarthy bringing him in as his principal character witness. And again, I think that just goes to show what we're going to see over the next few years, which is no real discipline or constraint on the most militant and extreme members of the caucus further risking, further stamping the House GOP and the GOP itself as the party of Trump after an election in which that identification, clearly, you know, they clearly paid a cost for that identification.",

I mean, this is pretty much what happened to John Boehner and Paul Ryan, it is the reality that you have a portion of the Republican coalition, not only the caucus, the coalition that views itself as fundamentally in conflict with so many of the trends in modern America, they are not looking to govern, they are simply looking to gum up the works.

Under a decades-old agreement, only Muslims are allowed to pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Other faiths are allowed to visit at certain times. But while Ben- Gvir's trip is infuriating to many Muslims, it does not come as a surprise. He has a history of inciting violence against Arabs and says the holy site should be open to everyone. Palestinian officials have called the visit a serious threat, accusing Ben-Gvir of trying to turn the site into a Jewish temple. The military group Hamas says the visit is pouring fuel over fire. And here's the U.S. reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The United States stands firmly for preservation of the historic status quo, with respect to the holy sites in Jerusalem. We oppose any unilateral actions that undercut the historic status quo. They are unacceptable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In all, about 200 refugees fled their camps in Bangladesh in late November in search of a better life. More than 2,000 did not survive. CNN's Paula Hancocks has our report. And a warning: the images you're about to see are disturbing, and some are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Despair and misery, etched on every single face. One by one, they collapse. Emaciated bodies clutching small children, others motionless, seemingly unconscious on an Indonesian beach. They are the Rohingya refugees left to drift on the boat on the open sea, forgotten and ignored. A human tragedy that keeps repeating itself. Hatma Nessa (ph) and her five-year-old daughter, Uma Salima (ph), were among the 174 to reach Aceh (ph) province. After one month surviving on just three days' supply of food and water, she is almost unrecognizable.",

Hatma Nessa (ph) remembers watching a baby girl die after drinking salt water. She says the boat driver jumped overboard in desperation from thirst and hunger, and died, leaving his desperate human cargo to drift helplessly, hoping for rescue.

Just survival. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): In Bangladesh, our life was difficult. We were banned from going out to look for work. The children could not go to school.

Right now, there's that area of high pressure and control popping in a southerly wind which is helping, which is keeping most of our moisture as rain. So snowfall levels are down, as well. Big difference there in the type of precip that's coming down. Now that next cold front, you might think it's going to do us a big favor in cooling us down, but not so much. Kind of a tease, really. But you will notice a difference. Look at Milan, 12 degrees. On Thursday, your average is six degrees. We're dropping down on Friday and Saturday back down to nine degrees. We're still without three degrees without normal. Here's something, not Moscow. This is rather impressive. It's getting cold, very cold as this next system moves in.
