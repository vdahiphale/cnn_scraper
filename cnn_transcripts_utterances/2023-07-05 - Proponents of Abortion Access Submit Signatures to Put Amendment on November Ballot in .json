They need about 413,000 signatures to get the question on the November ballot of abortion rights being enshrined into the State Constitution. And organizers say that they have 700,000 signatures. Of course, those will all have to be verified. But, organizers of this November effort are confident. Here's what they said this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that a majority, an overwhelming majority of Ohioans support this basic human right. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZELENY: So you may be wondering why there would be an August special election for a November ballot question. That is exactly what makes Ohio absolutely unique here. A year after the Dobbs decision, Ohio Republican lawmakers, a few months ago, passed a law saying that there must be an August special election that would seek to change the threshold for what it takes to change the state's constitution. For more than a century it has been 50 percent-plus-one to change the state's constitution. They are seeking to increase that to 60 percent of the vote in November. So a little confusing, Dana, and that is what some organizers say is the point here of these Republican lawmakers trying to stop what they believe is the will of the people here. So an August special election to set the threshold for the November ballot question. And 60 percent of the November ballot, that would be higher marker than Kansas which last summer, of course, passed abortion rights by 59 percent and Michigan passed it by 57 percent. So, that is why Ohio will be front and center in this abortion debate this summer.",

Here to discuss is a co-sponsor of that bill, Representative Ro Khanna of California.Thank you so much for joining me. Today, I want to ask about this term limit legislation because, if enacted, it would apply to future justices, not those currently on the bench. Knowing exactly when a Supreme Court seat will become vacant, doesn't that make the nominating process even more heated and political? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Dana, actually it would do the opposite because we wouldn't have the high stakes on each of the nomination. Every president would get two appointments every two years, justices would be there for 18 years. And Dana, 49 out of 50 states in this country have either term limits on their Supreme Court or age limits. So it's consistent with our political culture.",
