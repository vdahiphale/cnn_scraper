But he's banking on his past approach of pursuing peace with Israel's Arab neighbors first hoping that will lead to a workable peace with the Palestinians. His comments come in an exclusive interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. As tensions between Israel and the Palestinians are running high right now.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to the region to try to bring down the temperature. And joining me now from Jerusalem. Yaakov Katz is the editor-in-chief of the Jerusalem Post. And from London, Daniel Levy is the president of the U.S./Middle East project. Welcome to you both. So, in CNN's exclusive interview with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, did you get any sense from what he said and indeed, his actions so far that Mr. Netanyahu is willing to deescalate violence in the region or commit to a two-state solution as the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for during his visit to the Middle East. Daniel Levy, to you first. DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S./MIDDLE EAST PROJECT: De-escalation. Absolutely. His problem on de-escalation is primarily his own coalition. But then we have to understand what does de-escalation mean. That means a return to calm for Jewish-Israelis, a return to permanent occupation, no freedom, no rights, no dignity, no political horizon for the future for Palestinians. So, it's not such an attractive proposition on that side. Of course, being able to continue occupation with no cost is great for Israel. On two states, Netanyahu was quite clear. He wouldn't endorse the term. Netanyahu gave us a vision of -- actually a Bantustan. Unfortunately, what we heard from Netanyahu is a commitment to apartheid as has been noted by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International as the regime that predominates in the areas controlled by Israel. So those were the contrast in what he offered us.",

YAAKOV KATZ, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE JERUSALEM POSTSo that violence, unfortunately, will continue. But I would say that the ball is on the side of the court of the Palestinians to stop that terrorism. But I think that I wouldn't expect Netanyahu with the current makeup and character of his coalition to be making any big moves. That would be of the size that Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State would have wanted to see. Right. He is not going to endorse the two-state solution, that's not possible today in the political environment here in Israel and with the makeup of his coalition. And let's also be honest, for a moment after about three decades of Israel trying together with the Palestinians to reach a resolution, starting with the Oslo Accords in the 90s until we are today in 2023. This hasn't worked and we can point fingers at who's to blame, but maybe it is time for a new out of the box approach that hasn't been tried yet.",

Unfortunately, that's what we've been seeing in recent weeks here in Israel. I think that, of course, Israel would want there not to be violence, right?I think that if there weren't terrorist attacks on the other side, it would be a bigger question for Israel. OK, now that there is no terror, there's no celebration of deaths and murders of Israelis, there's no salaries that are being paid to these Palestinian territories. These two Palestinians who carried out these attacks Friday night and Saturday morning, their families are now going to get paid a stipend from Palestinian authority President Mahmoud Abbas, for the rest of their lives, essentially. Because they, one case, murdered seven Israelis, in another case, tried to murder Israelis. So, that is a culture of violence, a celebration of death. And as long as that continues, this prospect or this vision that somehow all Israel has to do is end the -- the so-called occupation, that will end this conflict. That's a pipedream.",

Everyone thought this was the beginning of a new era. We're 30 years later, and we're still embroiled in this conflict. I think that what Netanyahu did and what he spoke about in the CNN interview with Jake Tapper, is that what we have to try is a new model, right?We've tried for years sitting down, concessions, we'll release prisoners, we'll pull out of this city, we'll pull out of that city, we'll do security coordination.

Bringing them to the table, show the Palestinians that there's a different model, that normalization can reap benefits for both countries as we're seeing right now. Look at the amazing ties that Israel has with these Gulf States. They are a model for how peace can exist also here in this land between two people that have been stuck in conflict for so long. And I would wish that both of us, both the Israelis and the Palestinians will be able to look at the model of this new Abraham Accords era and reality, and apply that to the conflict that we have here.",

But well, that also seems to be changing and expanding all the time as well. First, it was the HIMARS systems, then it was the missile defense systems, and most recently, it was tanks. And so now that Ukraine has those or at least commitments to have all of those, the foreign minister says that the priority of his diplomats in western capitals is to lobby for, as you said, fighter jets and also long-range missiles that can strike targets up to 300 kilometers away.That kind of a range though would allow the Ukrainians to easily strike targets inside of Russian territory, not Russian-held territory in Ukraine, but Russia itself. And of course, one of the chief concerns with sending any weapons systems from the West is that they could inflame or escalate the conflict. Though the Ukrainians continue to insist that look, these would merely be for defense and for deterrence. And it's not just fighter jets, it's not just missile systems, they are also trying to get more of the weapons that they've already gotten from Western allies. For instance, France, just committed to sending more of its howitzer artillery systems to Ukraine. France is also one of 12 countries that have committed to sending tanks which is pretty incredible, Rosemary, when you consider that it was just three weeks ago today, that Poland became the very first country to actually agree to send tanks to Ukraine. Here's what the foreign minister said about the numbers on the way to his country so far. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMYTRO KULEBA, UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): I can note that in the first wave of contributions, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will receive between 120 and 140 Western model tanks. This is not a low number. But we continue to work on both expanding the membership of the tank coalition and increasing the contributions of those already pledged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
