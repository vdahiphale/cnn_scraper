The other person that we need to talk about, though, is the personal live in assistant to Matthew Perry because he also has already entered a guilty plea. But they're saying that he injected, Kenneth Iwamasa. He was - he was injecting Perry with this ketamine even including on the day that Matthew Perry died. So, that's just taking a look at a broad range of how these people all go together. Another person who was getting the drugs, they allege, from the ketamine queen.

Look at Biden versus Trump, women and men. What we see is the gender gap is working in Donald Trump's advantage. He holds a nine-point advantage among men against Joe Biden, and Joe Biden only held a four point advantage among women. But take a look now. Look at how the race has changed. Instead of having a four-point advantage among women as Biden did, look at Harris' advantage. It leaps up to 11 points. In fact, men haven't changed their voting patterns at all. At least in the national polls. A nine point advantage for Donald Trump versus Joe Biden. A nine point advantage against Kamala Harris. What has occurred is women voters are flocking to the Democratic ticket. Look at that. Look at that. Four points versus 11 points. That is the reason that Kamala Harris has turned this race around.",
