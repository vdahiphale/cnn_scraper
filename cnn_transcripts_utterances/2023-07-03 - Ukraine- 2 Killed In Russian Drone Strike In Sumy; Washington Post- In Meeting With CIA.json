I'm Abby Phillip, in for Jake Tapper. We start with our world leader. Multiple Russian attack drones hit apartment buildings and an administrative center in Ukraine's northeast city of Sumy. And so far, officials say two people were killed, and 19 were hurt including a 5-year-old. As Ukraine presses on with its slow by steady counteroffensive, Ukraine's deputy defense minister claims that they've clawed back around 14 square miles of territory from Russia in the last week. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed Russian leader Vladimir Putin, insisting he's, quote, weak after the short-lived mutiny by the private Wagner army last week. We'll show you more of that interview in just a few moments. But, first, we'll bring you close to the front lines where CNN's Ben Wedeman is in the eastern part of the country. So, Ben, can you put those 14 square miles that Ukraine claims that it gained into some perspective here?",

That's a pretty modest gain for an entire week of fighting.But you have to keep in mind that the Russians were prepared for this counteroffensive. We've been talking about it, the Ukrainians have been talking about it, observers and analysts have been talking about it for months. And today, we heard from the spokesman for Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine speaking on national TV that according to him the Russians have deployed along the eastern front 180,000 troops. That's more than twice the size of the entire British army. And around Bakhmut alone, in the city and around it, 50,000 troops, and they've been moving up armor and lots of ammunition, and you know, we've been speaking even to Russian prisoners of war. It's somewhat confusing because their account and many of them are convicts and whatnot, they say that morale is poor, supplies are poor, there isn't much food, they don't have a lot of medicine, their commanders are incompetent, but it appears that the Russians have thrown so many people into this fight that perhaps quantity is overcoming quality. Now, it's early days. We're now into the fourth week of this offensive. The Ukrainians still really haven't thrown the bulk of their forces into the fight. They will tell you they're still probing to find those weak points in the front line. So it's early days, but certainly so far the going has been difficult for the Ukrainians -- Abby.",

Now that is significant. That means they're looking at this year as a year that could potentially start conversations that would end this war. We should note, however, the timing surrounding this visit, Abby. It happened before Wagner's chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's attempted insurrection. And according to a U.S. official, that attempted insurrection was not a part of their conversation.

They rolled out some pretty clear details, sharing with them how to actually do that.

Now, what is true and the reason the president is saying that is that Crimea is Ukrainian territory. So frankly, it would have been more newsworthy had you said no problem, the Russians can keep it. But you know, given what's happening inside Russia and given the gains that Ukrainians are making, slow though they may be, President Zelenskyy's hand is strengthened.

If you're that conscript sitting in eastern Ukraine, you're saying to yourself I have no idea what's happening at home. Prigozhin, who I may or may not respect, is telling me that this war was badly conceived, strategically a catastrophe.

So I think we should give the Ukrainians what it is that they are asking for. We shouldn't second guess them. And I think that compared to a year ago, the notion that Vladimir Putin -- that our fear that escalation may be responded to by Vladimir Putin, by more escalation, first of all, he's lost the ability to escalate because he's lost so much of his military.

Well, as you said, that was in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting, in Governor DeSantis' home state of Florida. That is something left out of that. But that is why it is getting widely condemned, not necessarily because of the anti-trans legislation, a separate conversation, of course. Some of the reaction has been pretty quick. The Trump campaign jumped on this very quickly, as they often do with Governor DeSantis going back and forth. Let's look at a comment over the weekend that a Trump campaign spokesman made. He said the DeSantis shows, quote, a desperate campaign in its last throes of relevancy. That's from a Trump campaign spokesman. Perhaps even more to the point and a broader conversation here is a reaction from the Log Cabin Republicans. Of course, that is a Republican group, a conservative group made up largely of gay Americans, gay and lesbian Americans. This is what they said talking about just the political stupidity of this. They said: Conservatives understand that we need to protect our kids, preserve women's sports, safeguard women's spaces, and strengthen parental rights. For Ron DeSantis' extreme rhetoric has just ventured into homophobic territory. They go on to say it may be a short-term gain to try to win over some conservative voters, perhaps evangelical voters, even that's an open question. But a long-term challenge because they, of course, need moderates and independents to win the White House. So that's why this is viewed as a -- a short-term gay and perhaps long-term problem.

In that particular part of our conversation, we were talking about Donald Trump because he -- we remember last week I believe it was spoke to a conservative group here and for the first time said that the federal government has a vital role in dealing with abortion which was a big push to get him to do that. Because he is in the camp inside the GOP that the more you talk about this, the more you lean into conservative positions on abortion, the more it will hurt you and, in his case, since he's a frontrunner, hopes to be the nominee, will hurt him in a general election. And you have people like the head of the Susan B. Anthony group and others, Mike Pence on the campaign trail, who say no, no, no, the reason why Republicans did poorly in the midterms post-Dobbs is because we didn't lean into it enough, and we were running away, had our head in the sand.TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  I find is so interesting because we know Trump is being pressured, there are allies in the Republican Party not just in these groups, the anti-abortion groups, but there are other Republicans who want him to support the 15-week ban, and it's clear he's like, I'm not listening to anybody. I've got my eyes on the prize. I think we know that Donald Trump more than anyone else kind of knows how to play the game, and he's like right so -- so far he's not willing to tie himself to a specific timeline for a federal abortion ban no matter what other Republicans would like to see him say.",
