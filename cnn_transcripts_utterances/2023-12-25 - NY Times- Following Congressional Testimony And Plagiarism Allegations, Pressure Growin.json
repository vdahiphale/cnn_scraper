And, Polo, what more can you tell us about this meeting between faculty and then the members of this Harvard corporation?",

      "sentences": "So, Jessica, you remember that in early December, Harvard issued a statement fully supporting University President Claudine Gay in the face of these calls for resignation that you just mentioned. But now this \"New York Times\" reporting revealing that there is certainly at least further pressure on board members about Gay's fate.According to this \"New York Times\" article, two members of the school's governing board, the so-called Harvard Corporation, they met privately at a Cambridge restaurant with current and former faculty members. They, \"Faced a grilling,\" according to the report. So, at that Tuesday dinner, board members, Tracy Palandjian and Paul Finnegan were reportedly told that they had to do more to face the controversy that's looming over Harvard. \"The Times\" quotes Jeff Flier, who's actually the former Harvard med school dean, is saying, \"You need to be more out front of this. If people are saying the university is making mistakes, they are talking about you.\" I should note that my colleague, Nikki Brown, has been able to actually confirm that quote directly with Flier. But also, \"The Times\" also reporting that Palandjian shared with the group that replacing Gay might not be enough to get the Ivy League school back on course. What she called generational change, as she described it, would be needed, according to this article. Now, the publication is also quoting a Harvard spokesman describing the dinner as constructive and productive conversation about the importance of academic freedom, civil discourse and intellectual diversity. And the spokesman adding that the discussion about the so- called generational change occurred in that context. So, that's certainly important here. Now, Finnegan confirms a meeting did happen to CNN but referred us to other people that he says participated in that meeting. So, we're in the process of those reach outs. Additionally, CNN has reached out directly to a Harvard spokesperson as well as Palandjian for comment. But remember, Jessica, this all comes as donors of the Ivy League school either have severed ties or have threatened to do so until the university ensures that Jewish students feel safe. And then on top of that, you mentioned the plagiarism controversy in your lead, Jessica, that is still swirling around Gay, who still enjoys support from various institutions at Harvard. So, it's certainly not the end of this, and after the holiday break, it is absolutely going to be one to watch.",
