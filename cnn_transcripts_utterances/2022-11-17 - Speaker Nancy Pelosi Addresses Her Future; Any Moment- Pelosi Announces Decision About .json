In just moments, Nancy Pelosi unveils her next move as Republicans secure control of the House.Plus, the new world of divided government. House Republicans claim a mandate to investigate Hunter Biden. And we have new CNN reporting on the Biden White House strategy to blunt new Republican investigations. And history in Los Angeles. Karen Bass will become the city's first woman mayor. She takes over a city exhausted by crime and overwhelmed with homelessness. Up first for us though, a crossroads choice for Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party. She now knows she must give the speaker's gavel to Republicans come January. So, does she step aside? Or does she ask Democrats to keep her on as leader in the new minority? We will get the answer any moment now. Speaker Pelosi will come to the House floor to reveal her decision. We know President Biden wants her to stay. We know many younger Democrats want new leaders. And we know Pelosi took two speeches home last night. One asking to stay as the Democratic leader. One saying, she is prepared now to step aside. Her place in history, you see her walking into the House right now. Her place in history is secure already. Let's listen. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The House will be in order. The House will be in order. The prayer will be offered by our Chaplain Kibben.",

We request that you bestow upon us the joy of your presence among us. That when we look upon the faces of those who labor in these halls, known and unknown, elected or employed, we may see your image.We pray for the health and welfare of this illustrious body. That as the scenery changes, and the actors move on, around or off the stage, you will uphold each one. Guide them in the roles you have called them to fulfill and grant them wisdom to discern the way you would have them go. Lord may our prayers serve as an intercession for those who do not have enough courage or strength to speak their own needs. For those who haven't enough faith to trust what lies ahead. And for those who do not know how to receive the mercy you offer us. Then accept our offerings of Thanksgiving to you for the bounty you lay before us, the gift to labor to serve and contribute our energies wherever you call us. But especially here in this our nation's capital. May our words be good and pleasing to you as we pray them in your most holy name. Amen. Thank you.",

Because in order to become elected Democratic leader, you simply only need to have a majority of your caucus support. And there is no doubt that she would have, be able to lock down that amount of support.It is different than becoming speaker of the House when you have a majority of the full House, which means you have to keep most of your caucus in line, especially particularly in the narrow majority that Republicans are going to likely have in the next Congress. That's why Kevin McCarthy has his math issue as he runs into, trying to get the majority of the House to give him the speakership in January, but to get the majority of the Democratic caucus, if they have 208 or 209 seats, or maybe a few less, few more. That could getting half of that should not be an issue for Nancy Pelosi, but there will be some pushback within the ranks there. John?",

This is a big moment anyway, because of the big transition here in Washington. But it's also a big moment because Nancy Pelosi will be in the history books, regardless of what she says right here. The first woman elected as a party leader in Congress. The first woman elected speaker of the House. Then back into the minority, and then back as speaker that she's presiding. Is that a clue that she wants to be up in the rostrum one more time with the gavel?",

But again, that doesn't necessarily tell you whether that means she's exiting gracefully, or she is going to stay in fight. She's kind of indicated a little bit of each in the last weeks.But as you said, you know, she is the first woman speaker, no one will take that title away from her that place in history. And she has really presided over some very remarkable moments, you know, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, two impeachments happened under her watch. You know, lots of legislative accomplishments for Democratic presidents that maybe would not have been able to get done if she hadn't been the speaker and she's had a bigger majority than it looks like Kevin McCarthy is going to probably have if he's the leader next year. But you know, some pretty tight squeezes on some of that legislation and that's going to be part of her legacy as well.",

And it's, you know, she's already in the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls. So, you're talking about the history book, that's already written. So, I think this moment really is very powerful. Whatever it looks like, this moment is going to be, I mean, her leading the prayer to me is a significant moment. She's always put her faith at the forefront, even when her detractors were kind of saying that's not something Democrats would do. I think she's always been a counterbalance to the strongest talking points from the Republican side.",

Many of you probably disgusted with politics, maybe some of you love the speaker, maybe some of you are Republicans who don't like the speaker. She loves the institution. That's why the insurrection day was so painful to her. And not just because of his attack on the government, an attack on democracy, but there was attack on the shrine of American democracy, a place if you go to visit her up there, she just - she knows every inch of the building, and she loves it.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: She really does. She is very much, as you said, someone who protects the institution, so much so that some Democrats were actually not very happy when she took a very long time to even reach the point of saying that they should impeach the former president. She was long resisting that until they finally reach even the first one. So, and that's partly because of the fact that she takes moments like that very seriously. She also, you know, one thing that I was texting with some members this morning, some of the House Democrats, and even now, even though a lot of them seem to want to see the next generation come forward, they still say that if she were to stick around, you know, that they would understand and that she would definitely probably have the votes to stick around.

You can certainly understand that, in the last two years with a very modest House, Democratic majority. Speaker Pelosi has managed, even though progressives wanted more, and maybe centrist Democrats didn't like this piece. She has managed to get through significant portions of the Biden agenda, because she is so well organized and so well disciplined.",

      "sentences": "Yes. No question about it. And that is the one thing that this is - why she has been such an effective speaker, regardless of what you look at the outcome. Of course, Republicans will say, they will criticize her legacy, criticize what she's pushed through. But she's been affected because she's been able to maintain unity and discipline in what has been incredibly, it was incredibly difficult to do.Regardless of the caucus that you lead, Republicans, Democrats, House in the Senate, it is very hard to achieve unity, which is the moderate wing of your party, the progressive wing of your party are going at each other to have much different opinions about what to do, are concerned about their own political futures. Members from the swing districts trying to save their political hides, concerned about the direction that people on the left are going. She has been able to keep the caucuses, keep caucus together through much over time. This past Congress has been a real challenge for that. They had a difficult time trying to get the build back better bill through for instance, but they did pass that version of that in the House, they didn't pass in the Senate, they ended up passing the Inflation Reduction Act, which is also a significant achievement in and of itself. But that has been the one reason why so many Democrats including Joe Biden, today, Jerry Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman told me the same thing today that they want her to stay. It's hard to imagine a Democratic caucus without her, but that's also the reason why a lot of Democrats want something new. Some of the younger ones want a new fresh leadership for different approach than the Pelosi is handling things. So, that has been a first focus, sorts of some tension within the caucus. But you can't dispute the way she has been able to keep her troops in line through very difficult circumstances, from narrow majorities, to being in the minority, to significant majorities being able to do all that maintaining some unity, both sides acknowledge that that is quite a feat.",

When it comes to being a lawmaker in Congress, you can be a powerhouse legislator, meaning you understand the rules, can you maneuver, you can be a powerhouse fundraiser, or you can be a little bit of a show horse.

(Crosstalk), she is extraordinarily controlled, discipline is definitely the word.Nothing ever happens in Nancy Pelosi's world without her wanting it to and designing it to happen that way.

They haven't known what that midterm result was going to be. And it ended up being a stronger showing for them. And so, you know, there is a sense that if Nancy Pelosi wanted to stay, she could stay. But at the same time, there's a lot of generational thirst for change. And you know, there could be other people that step up to the plate. Hakeem Jeffries, I'm told is likely to run for the top spot if Nancy Pelosi doesn't. I talked to a member just now who said, Hakeem is prepared for the moment, should it come.
