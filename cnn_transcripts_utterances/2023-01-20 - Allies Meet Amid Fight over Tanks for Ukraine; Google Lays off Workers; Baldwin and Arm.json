And that is because the U.S. and Germany have been in this kind of standoff over whether to provide these heavy western tanks to Ukraine.Now, Germany has a number of Leopard 2 tanks, that is their version of the heavy western tanks that they have that many European countries also have and also have in their inventory. But Germany has said that they are not willing at this moment to provide those tanks to Ukraine unless the United States also provides its own version of its tanks to Ukraine as well because Germany does not want to be seen as being out of lockstep with the United States on this. So it has created a lot of tension with the United States because the U.S. is not prepared at this moment to send its Abrams tanks to Ukraine because they say they are just too costly to maintain and it doesn't make sense for the Ukrainians right now to actually receive them and operate them. It would require a lot of training as well. So the U.S., right now, is trying to pressure the Germans to go ahead and send their Leopard tanks to Ukraine. And key, importantly, allow European countries who have those Leopard tanks as well to send them to Ukraine because right now the U.S. says it is not prepared to send their tanks, but Ukraine could really use additional tanks as we heard President Zelenskyy say earlier today.",

Ukraine's war general says they need about 300. Realistically, we're talking about maybe just several dozen tanks at best for now.

Now, Russia, of course, they have been kind of on the defensive in certain areas of Ukraine, including in the Donbas, with the exception, of course, of Bakhmut, where a lot of heavy fighting has been happening. But what the U.S. seems to believe now is that Russia is, in fact, preparing for a potential major offensive and they want President Zelenskyy, of course, to be ready for that and to have all of the information that he needs, including, of course, key intelligence to be able to position troops and be able to fight that back. Now, it remains to be seen whether or not Russia is going to be doing another major mobilization. That is something Ukrainians have also been warning about. Right now the U.S. seems to be a little bit more reluctant about whether that can actually happen. But the bottom line here is that the U.S. and the Ukrainians are sounding the alarm about a potential major Russian attack here.",

Ukraine, at the time, said that their intelligence didn't match that. Clearly they are taking what they hear from Burns this time around very seriously.Natasha Bertrand and Clarissa Ward, thank you. Well, President Biden finally speaking out about his classified documents controversy, pleading for full cooperation, but mostly downplaying the investigation. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is at the White House. Jeremy, this is really the most expansive the president has been. What did he say? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. And the president here in saying that he has no regrets about this situation, he's talking specifically about having no regrets about disclosing -- not disclosing this -- that these classified documents were found before the midterm elections. We know, of course, that the documents were found at the Penn Biden Center on November 2nd, days before those midterm elections. And, ultimately, none of this was revealed until it was first reported just about ten days ago by news reports which the White House then went ahead and confirmed. The president here also reiterating a series of key White House talking points about this situation. Listen real quick to what he said yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You talk to people close to the situation here and they say that they also have no regrets about not disclosing this at all until it emerged in public reports. Ultimately they feel that cooperating quietly with the Department of Justice was the right strategy, even if it might have resulted in somewhat of a PR nightmare for them in that first week.What you also hear from the president there is stressing this cooperation with the Department of Justice. That's very intentional. The White House wants to be clear that they are taking a very different tack to former President Trump. And that's because they're trying to diminish the comparisons and increase the contrast between how President Biden and his classified documents issue arose and became a DOJ investigation, and how the situation went down with former President Trump. What we didn't hear from President Biden, though, was another part of the White House strategy, and that is one that we've seen in recent days, which is increasingly attacking House Republicans and drawing that distinction between what House Republicans, how they are proceeding with their investigation into this, versus the Department of Justice.

I mean adding hundreds of thousands of jobs in tech, millions of jobs in tech over the past three years or so. So, you're starting to see them take that back a little bit, 5 percent, 10 percent moves at a lot of these different companies.We've heard from the SalesForce. The SalesForce CEO, you know, he said, look, we were - we were just hiring like crazy. We couldn't continue to hire like that. That's what they were doing there. And he actually apologized for hiring too many people. Amazon, Coinbase, Google now, Microsoft, you've got some 37,000 tech layoffs just this month alone. And, you know, tech analysts say you could see this continue for the next few months here. The tech industry seeing layoffs way above where they were a year ago. But the context here, overall the job market is pretty tight. Outside of tech and in some cases media, you still have companies that are not laying off very much and, in fact, are hungry to find and retain talent.

A lot is going to play out between now and June when that deadline is expected. But one thing we should keep an eye on is, do those moderates stand strong? Do those Republicans who come from districts that even Biden might have won, do they feel like the White House is overplaying their hand? So far that's the case. The reason that the White House cares so much about those moderate Republicans is there is an ability in the House of Representatives, if you got every single Democrat and a handful of Republicans to sign on to what is known as a discharge petition, you can force a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, even if the House speaker doesn't agree with the legislation you want to put on the floor. So, the White House keeping a very close eye on some of those moderate Republicans, wondering if there might be a way forward in that direction, but so far no sign of Republicans breaking from their leadership.

I think it's ill-informed. And I think it sets a very dangerous precedent. You know, it's very tragic, sad, unfortunate and heartbreaking that this had to occur, Bianna. But the fact that you're going to criminalize this is very problematic. You're an actor and you have to consider the context in which anything occurred before you're charging a crime. You're on a set. There are a lot of moving parts. You're on a team. You have the ability, as an actor, and you should be reasonably relying upon other members of the team to do their job. And so with that context in mind, if you're an actor and someone says cold gun, to which you understand that to mean that it's certainly a prop that would not hurt anyone and you point it in someone's direction, now a prosecutor is going to charge you with a crime? I just don't -- look, I don't want to prejudge before we have a jury impaneled and arguments made, but I think this is a significantly difficult prosecution that probably should not have been brought in the first instance.",

It shouldn't be before the jury because, again, people work cooperatively as a team.In the context of a movie set, in the context of a prop, in the context of you being handed a gun that should have been checked multiple times before it even came to your attention, should you not be able and should you not reasonably rely upon your team to ensure that the gun is not loaded, particularly when someone is yelling cold gun. Should you then have to, as an actor, be put in a position of an expert to check the rounds yourself before you perform? And then we could get to the other thing you mentioned, John, with regard to what is the standard practice. Now, let's just say in response to your question that other people come and then say, yes, you do check the gun. You know, there are certain types of things in society that occur. Certainly, unfortunately, accidents happen every day. But when you look at, you know, the nature of things, you have a civil court, and civil court addresses issues of negligence all the time. And you get monetary damages and there are improvements in industries as a result of tragic things that occur. So I think from a civil perspective, there could be a lot of liability. But you're going to criminalize that? So even if someone did say of the ten actors I would call, did you check a gun and seven say do and three say no, that doesn't change the fact that you should not be criminally charged or held accountable when you're performing, you're in costume, you're in makeup, et cetera. I just feel very strongly that I think the D.A. overreached here and this is not a case in my view that's suitable to be prosecuted and should be in civil court as tragic as this whole event happens to be.",

And certainly when you're carrying, or having a weapon, or pointing a weapon, everyone would have a duty to, you know, potentially use it appropriately and properly. But if the industry standard is that we're relying upon other people to do that for you, should we be criminalizing the last person who has it and who discharges - you know, discharges what they think to be an empty weapon? It just shouldn't happen.So, it's a very powerful statement, I think, that was made there and we'll see that play out in court in the way that protects and defends Alec Baldwin.",
