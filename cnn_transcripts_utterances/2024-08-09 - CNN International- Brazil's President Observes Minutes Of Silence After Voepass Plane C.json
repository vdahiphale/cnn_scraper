Disturbing video shows the aircraft falling from the sky. Brazil's Civil Defense said it crashed into multiple houses and a residential area outside of Sao Paulo. Several bystanders captured the aftermath in videos that are now on social media. The Voepass plane left Cascaval and was en route to Sao Paulo when it lost signal a few hours ago. Isa Soares joins us now and has been reporting on this for the last hour. Isa, I think the first thing we have to say is, just terrifying experience for those on board, for the people that witnessed this. The people that are now watching this, and of course the families of those that were on board this flight.",

Bear in mind, we are talking about 62 people, 62 lives, 58 passengers, and four crew members.Let me tell you what we are learning this hour. This is a Voepass flight ATR Plane 72, traveling from Cascaval in the state of Parana to Guarulhos. That's just about an hour -- and I think we have a map -- an hour-and-a-half flight from one state to the other. This is something that would be done daily. This is an internal flight. What we then learned is that -- and we do not know the reason, we won't know, of course, until we have that black box, Julia, is that plane suddenly dropped out of the sky and then I don't mean to use that word lightly and I use it, of course, knowing that 62 people have lost their lives. But if we look at that footage that we were just showing you, we know that the plane dropped dramatically in the last few moments. It was cruising at 17,000 feet, dropped to 250 feet in 10 seconds, climbed another 400 feet in about eight seconds. Eight seconds later, it lost just under 2,000 feet descending rapidly as you saw, roughly 7,000 feet in just one minute. And where it descended in the city of Vinhedo is a residential area, as you can see from that footage, Julia, and it fell almost pancaked in someone's backyard. You can see pools, you can see a garden. And what I've been hearing from analysts and I know you'll talk about this with your guests, if there is no way to have come out of it, no survivors. Unfortunately, we heard that from President Lula, who in the last two hours or so asked for a moment of silence as that news was breaking. An investigation will be started. We know the Brazilian Air Force has sent a team to the ground to investigate, but there is so much we, as of yet, do not know. Important of course, we are getting information on the ground from our teams as to not just how quickly this happened, but the question is over the air quality, the weather, did that play a part? At this moment, just important to note that luckily, Julia, no one died, no one on the ground there in the residential area died and it is incredible to think that given these images right now on our air of how that plane fell. It is an ATR 72 plane. I've heard it from analysts, I am sure you will hear it, too, that it has a bit of a checkered past, but I would imagine this would have been one of many daily flights it would have been doing, domestic flights. So there is a lot we do not know, but we are hoping to get more information from Brazilian authorities this hour, Julia. But a tragic horrendous day for those families in Brazil.",

Sao Paulo, one of the biggest airports of course of Brazil and just to see that and there is the aerial image, the fact that luckily, luckily, Julia, that no one has died is such -- it is important news, very good news of course, but there is a lot we do not know in terms of the operations on the ground, what is happening. We don't know if there was a mayday call. We do not know if this had to do with the weather, if it was a de-icing system. What I keep hearing is potentially, aerodynamic stall. I will let the experts talk about that, but at this moment, President Lula asking for a minute of silence as Brazil, of course, deals with this horrendous loss of life, 62 people on board, 58 passengers and four crew members.

      "sentences": "Yes, it is really difficult to talk about the technical aspects of this at this point, of course with the loss of life. And I am hesitant to do that, but I think it is important that we kind of say what we think might be going on here.So it appears to me that some icing had built up. They had been in flying through a hundred percent humidity, which creates droplets of ice or droplets of water that become ice and that can get built up on that wing and become very heavy. And so as that happens, flying through that, at 14,000 feet, it was subzero weather and that can create a lot of weight on the aircraft and it appears that that maybe a contributing cause to this. And at that point that it builds up and you can see based on the fact that the aircraft went down and then tried to climb back up again, the up climb could have been from the ice breaking off. It could have been from a pilot's reaction, we simply don't know. But the point is that at that point it becomes a very difficult thing at that particular altitude to recover from because the aircraft simply doesn't have enough air going over the top of the wings, or its too heavy to keep continuing to fly. And so the only way out of that is to nose the aircraft down or to roll the aircraft a little bit to try to get some airspeed over the top of the wings. But once they get to that lower altitude, it is really nothing that pilots could have done at that point. Once they flew into that ice and had that ice happen, if the de-icing system didn't work or if the anti-system wasn't on, those two things can cause that ice to build up but it is a tragic, tragic situation. And again, I feel for these families that have lost so much.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you learn from an awful tragedy like this, as you say, and ensure we prevent anything like it in the future.David Soucie, sir, thank you so much for your help. Let's bring in Richard Quest now. Richard, awful tragedy. At least 62 people's families now in mourning. What do you make of what you've seen in terms of the video and what may have gone wrong from your understanding? RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\": Let's break this down into three or four areas, you have -- working backwards if you will. You have the crash itself and what you can see from that. And the way in which the plane goes into this flat spin. Literally, the plane has no forward momentum. It comes to an absolute halt. So, that's -- and falls out of the sky. It might go up 400 feet as it is descending, but that could either be because of pilot inputs or more likely because there was some lift from the aircraft that's from the speed. But now let's go back to the cause, the approximate cause and we don't know. All we know is that for some reason, engine failure, improper pilot inputs, icing over the wings, failure of the de-icing equipment, structural. I can reel of a million of them. But this picture shows that at that point, the plane lost any form of forward motion and as we've talked before, to those who are not familiar planes fly because air goes over the wing. The air going over the wing takes longer up the top and the bottom and it creates lift. So, it comes this way, and it creates lift that way. But the moment the plane stops forward and the airflow is disrupted and the plane falls out of the sky. The number of reasons -- you know, at one level, Julia, the number of reasons are not that many because such a catastrophic failure, but they are so fundamental to what took place here that you are looking at either structural failure or you're looking at total power loss, or you're looking at improper inputs from the pilot. Those are the sort of range of things you're looking at, because the flying conditions were not that bad. Yes, there was some ice, there were some cold air temperatures, but this is a well-known, well-experienced airport in a sense and that plane fell off the sky.",

Thank you.Now, as investigators try to determine the cause of the crash, they will also want to know if weather, as Richard was saying there, played a role. Let's get straight to Chad Myers. Chad, your observations on this. We've heard a little bit about rainfall, some ice on the wings perhaps. Your wisdom, please?",

      "speaker": "CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST",
      "sentences": "If you read David Soucie's book and I have, more than once, you will know that not one thing will technically bring a plane down. It is a series of things that go wrong.We don't know what the first thing that went wrong was to get this plane from going 290 miles per hour to only 50 miles per hour forward speed and as Richard clearly talked about, you need that forward speed to get the plane to stay in the air. That is why they don't fly when they are just taking off at 50 miles per hour, you have to get almost to the end of the runway at 125 or so to get that forward speed over the top of the wing to get the lift. So why? Well, the answer is, we simply don't know what happened in that 30 seconds that Richard was talking about, it is the critical, critical thing. Looking at the weather, there was rain in the area, but the temperature was 12 Celsius. It wasn't below freezing, so there wasn't icing on the ground and we don't really care what was happening on the ground because that is not where the event occurred. The event occurred between fifteen and seventeen thousand feet in the sky and looking at some of what we call the soundings, the weather balloon soundings, and even the virtual soundings that computer models can show. There was a possibility that the temperature could have been around three degrees C below zero with a relative humidity of 100 percent. When that happens, you can get something called rime ice or pellet ice. You can get the ice to form on the wing itself or even on the front of the plane if there is enough of it coming in. So yes, the plane can get heavy, but it is that lift, it is the stall of the wing and stuff. We don't mean stall like the engine on your car when we turn it off and its stalls, that's not the stall we are talking about. The engines were running. We could hear them running in that video, the audio from it clearly showed those engines were still running. What happened between those 30 seconds, between when the plane was doing 290 compared when it was doing a forward speed of 50? We simply don't know. So, there is only speculation of what caused that to happen. Even if you turn the engines off, you're not going to go from 290 to 50. That is simply not going to happen. It's going to coast for a while. It can slow down. yes, but it is not going to go to that extreme. So something catastrophic happened in the sky likely here in the cloud cover you're seeing here, this is where the plane took off and this is where it was going to land and that is only about an hour-and-a-half, an hour-45-minute flight and only somewhere around seventeen or eighteen thousand feet high. So we were not even seeing thunderstorms. We were seeing rain, strata form clouds and rain, but that rain, if that fuselage, if the wings were five degrees below zero and all of a sudden it flew into a relative humidity, hundred percent, even if it was at or above zero, that ice could form quite quickly. I talked to a pilot flying from Phoenix to Idaho. He was flying around Salt Lake City, cold airplane, very, very cold, probably five degrees below zero for the outside of the skin of the plane, flew into an updraft of a thunderstorm. All of a sudden, he couldn't see out the window, the ice formed that quickly because there was liquid water in the cumulonimbus cloud going up, even though the temperatures around it were minus five. But the ice stuck to that plane and it was a terrifying 45 minutes where he couldn't see out of the windshield before the ice finally went away and he could see where he was going and I mean, that is IFR to its limit when you literally can't see anything. So all of the things Richard talked about, David Soucie talked about, read his book if you want to know a lot more about aircraft and how they stay in the sky and why they don't. David is a genius when it comes to that stuff.",

We knew like -- Ukraine, knew, an analytical community, military community, they knew that there hasn't been any reserves for Russia. I mean, the reserves very scarce and less prepared and less equipped and so on. So essentially, any surprise move was really creating them huge troubles because for a couple of days, Ukraine already occupied an area which has more than original counteroffensive, which was happening in 2023.

It also shows the plane was denied operation for air taxi. It's unclear when or why that determination was made. Aviation analyst Peter Goelz is a former Managing Director for the National Transportation Safety Board, and he joins us now. So good to have you with us.First, let's talk about the black box. What will they be looking for, informationally, from the black box, and how long will it take to get it?",

They will go back and look at all of the maintenance that was done recently, over the past year, over the life of the plane. Was there a reason why it was denied the air taxi? Was that reason corrected? So it's premature to say that that was contributing cause here, but the investigators are so thorough, they will go through every piece of paper connected to this aircraft.",

And it was falling from the sky, from the wreckage that we see on the ground, it appeared to pancake into the ground at a horrendous speed. We just don't know what caused that.It could be ice, it could be human error. There was an accident in Nepal a year ago with a similar type of aircraft where the pilots inadvertently feathered their propellers, which meant that their engines were not producing power, and the plane stalled and crash. That's why the black boxes are so critical. So we'll -- the authorities will find out in a very short period of time what happened.",

So just a reminder the total loss of life now believed to be on that plane crash as a result of that plane crash in Brazil, 61 not 62.

And he's actually quite a likable character, and he does fundamentally believe, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that the election was stolen. And he's willing to keep fighting the fight.O'SULLIVAN: Yes. Look, I mean, that's thing, Julia, right, is a lot of folks, especially here in the United States, will know of Mike Lindell. He's known as the My Pillow guy. His commercials pop up all over the place. And, you know, he's quite affable and quite funny at times, but he has gone down this rabbit hole, right, of misinformation himself. He is a -- he's buddies with Trump. He's a Trump ally. But, Mike, unlike maybe somebody, you might have in your family, Julia, or someone I might have in my family, or my set of friends who believe these conspiracy theories. Mike has the means to do something about it. And what he's been it is spreading them. He has set up his own social media platform, his own video streaming service, of course, because a lot of the election conspiracy theorists got kicked off the major big tech platforms after January 6 and 2021. So, look, he's done all of this, and not to mention he's using his Pillows, and Pillow promotion codes is giving them to other MAGA world influencers so they can help support themselves to spread more conspiracy theories. Of course, it all sounds a bit absurd and it would be laughable, except this is really serious stuff, and we've been traveling the country, and I want to show you a clip from one event we went to just a few months back.
