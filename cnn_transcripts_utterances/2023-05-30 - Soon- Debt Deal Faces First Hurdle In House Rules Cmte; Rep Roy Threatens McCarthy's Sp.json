      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. A very busy news day. Thank you for your time. Can the House speaker keep his members in line? The debt deal meets its first test today in the House Rules Committee, where hardline conservatives deeply unhappy with the agreement have a chance to kill it.Plus, drones deep behind enemy lines. And attack in Moscow brings the Ukraine more directly into the heart of Russia's capital, as Vladimir Putin keeps up with relentless aerial assault on Kyiv. And Ron DeSantis makes his first big road trip as an official presidential candidate. Three cities in 12 early voting states just this week, beginning tonight as DeSantis courting evangelicals in Iowa. But up first for us, the deal to pull the United States back from a debt cliff meets its first big roadblock today. At 3 pm, House Rules Committee convenes it is TBD whether the unhappy conservatives on that panel will have enough votes to try to kill the Biden, McCarthy debt pack at its first legislative stop. Hardliners say the deal that gave speaker McCarthy the gavel back in January, included a promise that any legislation needed all nine Republican Rules Committee votes to make it to the full House. McCarthy allies say, they don't remember it that way. This Washington wrinkle puts the must pass deal in some considerable early peril. The hardliners say that compromise doesn't cut enough spending. But listen to Speaker McCarthy this morning. He says he got the better of the president and the Republicans should vote yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We're actually going to spend less money this year than we spent last year. Read the Wall Street Journal, they say it's a very good bill. This is the biggest cut in American history that we vote for. I'm not quite sure what else they want to go. I think we got to look at where the victories are. We don't spend another 4 trillion. We allow them to keep going forward to January. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Melanie, the speaker says Republicans should vote for it, but he's got some trouble on his hands.MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER.: Yes, that's right. There's a lot of outrage on the right here over this deal. They feel like, he essentially gave up too much in these negotiations. And the House Freedom Caucus is actually holding a press conference right now to rally opposition against this bill. But John, the two big questions right now are, do they have the votes to be able to block this from even coming to the floor or passing on the floor? And is Kevin McCarthy's speakership safe? Now, on the first question, it does not appear that they do have the power to block this. The bill does have to go through the House Rules Committee later today before it can get a floor vote and there are three hardline conservatives on that panel. That was part of the deal that Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker. But two of them, Ralph Norman and Chip Roy are signaling they will vote against the rule. But one of them Thomas Massie, we are learning is expected to support the rule, which means it will be able to advance and get on to the floor. But on that second question, John, whether Kevin McCarthy's speakership is safe, that is a lot less clear. The House Freedom Caucus did have a call last night where they talked about their strategy moving forward and how they're going to approach this. And while a lot of them are against the idea of using a tool known as the motion to vacate, which would essentially force a floor vote on housing Kevin McCarthy, it only takes one member to be able to force that vote. And Congressman Chip Roy is especially angry. He told Glenn Beck in an interview on the radio moments ago that this deal is a betrayal of the power sharing agreement that we put in place among House Republicans. And he also said, if we can't kill this bill, then we're going to have to regroup and figure out the whole leadership arrangement again. So, a clearest part clear, clear threat there, John, and potentially his speakership at risk.",

Kevin McCarthy had to negotiate with them to become speaker. And now Chip Roy right there threatening that if this debt deal, the speaker cut with the Biden White House. If it is passed, he's threatening to revisit the speaker's hold on the gavel.With me in studio to share the reporting and their insights, CNN's Dana Bash, CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson, and Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press. So, there you have it right there. Number one, McCarthy appears to have the votes at the moment to get it out of the rules committee. The question is, as he sits in the speaker's office, what calculation is going through his mind? Does he also thinking and survive a challenge to his leadership? Or does he have to yet again, accommodate the right and stop his own deal?",

It's just that maybe they haven't been as vocal this morning as they have been in the past with his the left flank.And what we're talking about here is a true compromise in the sense that there are if all goes as planned from the perspective of the White House and the House speaker, there will be no votes on the left and there will be no votes on the right. And they are going to need the majorities to be gotten basically in the middle by Democrats and Republicans. The Chip Roy's of the world are furious. Obviously, you just heard him say that. I spoke to a senior Republican House member this morning, who said that the feeling among the House leadership is that there are not enough people who want to \"emasculate their leaders,\" both the president and the speaker in order to take this down. We'll see if that holds.",

What makes this more interesting is just because speaker McCarthy, House Republicans adopted the rule. One person, Chip Roy sounds like he's going to be him. Yes. He can change his mind. But he comes to the -- let's say they pass this, he comes to the floor at the end of the week, says I want to vacate the chair.Is Kevin McCarthy, like John Boehner, like Paul Ryan to fail, you know, essentially going to lose his job different circumstances, but because of flack on the right? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Listen, I mean, this was always the fear. I mean, we all covered the 15 rounds, and finally made the speakership and sort of the underlying story was, you know, how tenuous his grasp on the speakership was. And with this happening, you see, Chip Roy's very strong words. He said, you know, the Republican conference has been torn asunder, not one Republican should vote for this deal he said. So, he does look as he's at least setting himself up to be somebody who would try to get the speaker out of there. Can he bring others along? I mean, he certainly seemed to be having a call to arms there for other Republicans to vote no on this deal and say, you know, there's a reason why Democrats are happy with this deal. And so, we'll see. I mean, this was always going to be a perilous time for Kevin McCarthy that we see it right out.",

And which is why you hear Congressman Chip Roy bringing all of the outside opposition, whether it's conservative outside spending groups, whether it's what the former president said before this deal was finalized, whether it's a Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, trying to drum up opposition against this deal. And you do see how Speaker McCarthy at least has to go on a really aggressive public relations messaging offensive. You hear him saying over and over since this deal was announced that Democrats got no wins in this deal, which isn't quite accurate. But that is what he and his lieutenants have to say, to try to convince, I mean you're -- he wouldn't (Ph) probably never going to get a Chip Roy on any sort of deal. I think we're kind of missing that point.But those people who are kind of teetering on the edge of a, yes or no, in the Republican Congress, he really does have to work overdrive to convince them that this is the best deal that you can get with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president.

And again, in a normal world, Kevin McCarthy can lose the Freedom Caucus, 40 votes there, because the new Democrats, the centrist Democrats have said therefore, so the math there works, everybody goes away, nobody is happy, but you move on. The question is about his leadership challenge.But to that point to the deal, who won? Democrats are not gleeful that Democrats -- Chip Roy says they're gleeful, they're not gleeful, progressives are not happy either. But if you look at the projected baseline of federal spending was at $757 billion. The Republicans, the House Republican bill demanded it dropped to $689 billion, the compromise is $704 billion. So, as a true Washington compromise, spending is going to go down less than it was going to be. Republicans say, McCarthy says, we only have the House. We have a Democratic president, Democratic senate. That's a good deal for us. The Wall Street Journal editorial board agrees. The lesson is that political unity pays, assuming the deal passes Congress, it will defy the democratic narrative that Republicans can't govern. Mr. McCarthy's troops are proving they can, and conservatives would be foolish to abandon the victories in this deal. But this is again the upside-down world we live in. That's the Republican establishment. The 40 members you just saw there. I don't know if they all showed up. But the 40 member House Freedom Caucus, the Republican establishment says, jump.

I was texting with another moderate House member this morning who said something interesting about kind of the messaging, we've all been talking about how the public messaging up until the point of the deal from Kevin McCarthy was pretty solid.And up in some ways he had outsmarted the Biden White House, that certainly was coming from some Democrats I was talking to. But this member said perhaps his internal messaging to his members was it didn't lay the groundwork enough for the fact that he would have to make a deal that looks a lot like this. Would it have made a difference? Who knows what the competence that he has. But I thought that was an interesting note.",

He's going to be courting evangelicals here in Iowa and across the country who potentially have cooled on former President Donald Trump. They see that as potentially an in for them, a place where they can really create a foothold, both here and again across the country. So that's where he will do that tonight. He'll then continue on through Iowa with several stops tomorrow before going to New Hampshire and South Carolina. But what is interesting, John, is that he ends the week on Saturday, right back here where it all began in Iowa.

But I do think it's interesting how he's starting to make some policy differentials with him as well. We saw a lot of criticism from over the weekend on the First Step Act, which is that bipartisan criminal justice reform law that President Trump signed into law, one of the big bipartisan accomplishments of his presidency. Ron DeSantis called it a jailbreak bill. So that is a really interesting policy differential between the two and I think you'll see more of that as we go on.",
