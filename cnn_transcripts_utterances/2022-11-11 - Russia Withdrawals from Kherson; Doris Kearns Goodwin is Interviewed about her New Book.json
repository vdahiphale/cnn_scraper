I was speaking with a 15-year-old girl there who told me, in the last few days, she had been kidnapped by the Russians. They'd put a hood over her head. They'd taken her away to a house. They threatened her. They wanted to know where the Ukrainian troops were. And she said, I was just afraid that these guys were going to rape me. I spoke to an old woman who was in - who was in tears, tears, at the side of the street, partly in relief, but she was reliving moments of her experience under the Russian occupation there. She told me that they pulled me from my car and threatened to kill me, threatened to bash my brains out. This is an old lady. An old lady. Must have been maybe in her - in her 80s. A pensioner. They threatened to do that her. We saw people hugging in the streets. Seeing friends and relatives that they hadn't seen for so long. There's a sort of a quiet euphoria, the freedom, but it's come all of a sudden. And it's come all of a sudden because the Russians have retreated quickly. And more Ukrainian troops are moving further towards liberating the town of Kherson. And we're told by Ukrainian officials that they are close.

GOODWIN: You know, there's certain times in history when you think about something larger than yourselves. FDR talked about that. During the midterms, in 1942, people were really upset about having only one cup of coffee a day. That's all they were allowed because the coffee beans had to go somewhere else. They only had five gallons of gasoline. But he said, at some point they're going to understand that they have to sacrifice for the home front, for the war front. I think that's what happened here. People understood, there's something wrong about people who don't accept the loss in an election. They were who - on the ballot, those election deniers, and that's who Trump put on the ballot. That was the litmus test for them to be there. They know it's wrong for your kid not to accept a loss. They know it's wrong if you say, as President Trump did, I will win. If I win, it's up to me. But if I lose, it's somebody else's fault. There's fundamental human qualities that I think struck a chord in all those people who came out.

They didn't know how the story would end. They didn't know that the Civil War would end with the union restored and emancipation secured. They didn't know that depression would come to an end with the mobilization of war. They didn't know the allies would win World War II. So they lived with the anxiety we're coming through now. But we came through each one of those times with greater strength. And I think there may have been a moment, what we saw in the midterms, were people were voting what they knew was wrong, what they knew was right. And there's still a lot more that has to happen. There's gerrymandering. There's too much money in politics. There's the division that's still there. But, finally, people got to vote last night. I thought after January 6th, that line in the sand would be drawn. And it wasn't. I still can't believe that. As an historian, I thought people will say, this was the moment when the chaos ended. And then I thought it would be last summer when the hearings were so powerful. But this was the first time people could vote on what they saw happening with these election deniers and making a central point in this whole election that people who supported the lie should be the people who were voted in, regardless of their experience or anything else, they were put on the ballot, and people said no.",

When Clinton lost that huge election in 1994, he then was able to make some compromises with Gingrich. Welfare reform took place. He wins that 1996 election. And then he comes back into power. And then they go too far and they impeach him.In 1998, he's one of those people that defies predictions that the Democrats win the House. And they win seats in one of those off-seat years. So, it depends on how extreme the Republicans go. What they're going to do. Are they going to hold a whole bunch of impeachment things. And they going to try and make some compromises on things, as well as what President Biden, who says he's willing to do these things, as long as it's not Medicare, Social Security and certain things that he's drawn a line in the sand on.",

Those are that really distinctive, really critical part of the space shuttle that would form the underbelly of the space shuttle. And those heat shield tiles would protect it from the high temperatures on re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Of course, this Challenger mission never even made it that far.It was discovered actually back in May by a team led by Mike Barnett. They were putting together a film for The History Channel. They weren't quite sure what it was. They thought they knew what it was. They brought it to a former NASA astronaut. He thought it was Challenger. They then brought it to NASA. And NASA confirmed it in August. So now, you know, Kaitlan, the big question is, you know, what is NASA going to do with this. Right now it's just, you know, on the bottom of the ocean floor off the coast of Florida. So, this, by law, remains the property of the U.S. government, but NASA says they're still trying to figure out a way -- what to do with it to honor the legacy of Challenger and the seven astronauts that died on that fateful day back in 1986.",
