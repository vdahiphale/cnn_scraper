You know, and so you know, that's something that's another thing that the Ukrainians are having to contend with, Jake.[17:05:18] JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: All right, Matthew Chance, thank you so much. Fascinating interview. Now to Russia, clear signs that Putin's economy is struggling under the squeeze of sanctions from the west as the west hopes economic pain will ultimately push Putin and push Russians to question their leaders so called special military operation in Ukraine. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow right now, where the typically bright holiday season is noticeably dimmer this year. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): As Moscow lights up for the holiday season, the festive mood is dampened by a dose of melancholy, as there seems no end in sight to what the Kremlin calls its special military operation in Ukraine. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I think the operation is not going too well to put it mildly, because there are many losses on our side. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I don't know what the goal of the operation is, but it's not reaching it. PLEITGEN (voice-over): After Russian forces were forced to retreat from large parts of north eastern and southern Ukraine, many here don't even want to talk about what's happening on the battlefield. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): To this question, I don't know what to say. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is a provocative question, I don't want to answer it. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Even after the Kremlin ordered a partial mobilization drafting around 300,000 Russians between September and early November, gains have been hard to come by for Moscow's forces in Ukraine. Still, many Russians say they trust their leadership's decision making. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): As far as the military operation goes, I can only say one thing, that it is underway. And that I should not comment on because we all support our president of the Russian Federation. PLEITGEN (voice-over): And Russian President Vladimir Putin is asking for more support and patience, promising things will turn around. PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA: We as all of you here rightfully said, we must achieve our goals and we will achieve them in the end. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But increasing numbers of boarded up shops show Russia's economy is running out of steam as sanctions bite and some goods are becoming scarce. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Of course many things we've grown used to buying have disappeared, but life goes on. We have to adjust somehow. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Economic experts Sergey Zhavoronkov tells me he fears the economic woes could lead to wider discontent. SERGEY ZHAVORONKOV, SENIOR RESEARCHER, GAIDAR INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC POLICY (through translator): It is a known effect, a short victorious war may provoke enthusiasm. But if the war last endlessly, does not lead to the desired outcome, comes disappointment. PLEITGEN (voice-over): For now, the lights remain bright in Moscow, even as the dark clouds of economic uncertainty loom over the Russian capital. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

So I think this is just doubling down on some of the concerns that voters have about Herschel Walker.If you look at the data, Republicans are pretty much in lockstep behind him. His problem is with Independent voters, right? In our poll, Warnock is getting 61 percent of Independent voters to Walker's 36 percent. That is not where you want to be going into Tuesday.

Do you think this race is slipped away?SCOTT JENNINGS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: I think Herschel has an uphill battle. I mean, he obviously got fewer votes on Election Day. And the point you made about Independent voters, obviously, this was the great story of the midterm overall for Republicans, Independent voters siding with Democrats despite their misgivings about Biden in his policies, that probably hasn't changed over the last four weeks. How you would beat that is if you could somehow dramatically enhance Republican turnout, which is why it's good that Governor Brian Kemp is out with a shoulder to the wheel for Walker, and he's alone his operation to the turnout effort there for Republicans. So, that's what you have to hope for. This Independent number to me, is the most troubling issue for the party right now overall. And that you've got a Democratic party that's, you know, not all that popular, why can't you attract people who are unhappy with them? And you know, this playing out again in Georgia.",

And Herschel Walker's candidacy has been problematic.MARIANNA SOTOMAYOR, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, that's right. And what Democrats are trying to focus on, like to your point, they really are trying to drive home. Look at the differences, they couldn't be starker. And, to your point about the midterms, I mean, Democrats are feeling pretty good after their own surprise. They thought that they were going to do so much worse, not just in the Senate, but definitely on the House, they thought they were going to get more or less obliterated there. So the fact that I've been talking to a number of House Democrats in particular, they say, you know, a lot of these attackers that Republicans have been really launching of saying, oh, my gosh, just Democrats, just like Nancy Pelosi, and just like Joe Biden, there is an incumbency factor that helps that these people who have been there and, you know, talk to a lot of their constituents, constituents are able to say, all right, I know this person is very progressive or liberal, but they're not just like, you know, the far right candidate or the far left candidate.

He's lost his reelection bid as well. I think the one thing on Georgia is they picked Herschel Walker thinking that black folks would vote for Herschel Walker because he was black. But black voters are smarter than that, and they vote for candidates that actually know how to have comprehensive sentences, understand policy, and don't have some of the compromising issues that Herschel Walker's campaign has really surfaced about him and also maybe somebody who actually has residency in the state that they're running in. And I think Donald Trump, you know, he isn't going into Georgia because he doesn't have that special effect in that state. He lost the state in 2020.

Well, we're going to find out tomorrow when the team takes on the Netherlands in the first knockout match of the tournament in Doha Qatar. Joining us down to this guess whether the U.S. can pull it off is ESPN Sports Commentator Patrick McEnroe.Patrick, great to see you. The Netherlands, for viewers who are not familiar with World Cup soccer, Netherlands is considered one of the top teams in the world. But as the head coach of the U.S. Men's National Team put it today, the knockout stage must be played strategically. Explain to us what that means.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that, you know, as you said, The Netherlands has a great history, they've been to three World Cup finals, but they've never won one. And if you said to me, Jake, at the beginning of the tournament, who's the stronger team, England or the Netherlands, I would have said England. And the U.S. outplayed them, it was a draw.But the U.S. team, you know, for many years Jake, they had a lot of will in their game. You know, we've been this far before in the World Cup. We've actually been even one round further to the quarterfinals years ago. But now when I watch this team -- and I'm no soccer expert, but I'm a huge fan of the game having traveled the world playing tennis --I see that they have not only the will but they have tremendous skill, soccer skill. Even the coach from Iran, who's Portuguese said, this U.S. team has gone from being a soccer team to being a football team. Meaning, they know how to play the game. So I think they go in against the Netherlands definitely as the underdog and the Netherlands despite winning their group, Jake, I don't think they look that great. They didn't look dominant. This is a team that I think is ripe for an upset. And I think this young U.S. team, one of the youngest teams in the tournament is ready to do that. The question is, Christian Pulisic, who's our star player who scored the goal against Iran, sacrificed his body in doing so, how much will he be able to give the U.S. team tomorrow? They say he's ready to go. He's going to play. But he got a really bad hit there in the pelvic area. My suspicion, Jake, is that he'll be able to play maybe half the game. Is that enough to get a gold for the U.S.? And then can we hang on if we do get the lead? Because I don't think we can last as long as this Dutch team who has a lot of experience, some great young players themselves, and much more experienced in these big time matches.",

Trust me when I tell you this before the game because it's just, you know, he got hit real hard in the pelvic area.So if he can give you 45, maybe 60 minutes. And here's who I think could be the key guy, Jake. Gio Reyna, who's 20 years of age who's only played nine minutes in this tournament, and before this tournament started this World Cup event, he was rated the third best under 23-year-old player in the world, OK, coming into this World Cup. It's a little peculiar why he hasn't played that much. Of course, we have a great midfield. We have great players in the midfield. We don't have that great striker that some of the big countries has, they have, but maybe it's Gio Reyna gets his opportunity because of the Pulisic injury. And who knows? Maybe he's the guy. I'm telling you right now, Jake. I'm feeling it. You see, I've got the trophies behind me to try to inspire the team. One nil for the U.S. We move on and wouldn't you love to see the U.S. against Argentina in the quarterfinals and Lionel Messi, that would be something.",

Why? Because take a look at this long-term trend. Favorite sport to watch, soccer. 2022, it's 8 percent. Now that might not seem like a large figure. But look where it was back in 1900 and '92.
