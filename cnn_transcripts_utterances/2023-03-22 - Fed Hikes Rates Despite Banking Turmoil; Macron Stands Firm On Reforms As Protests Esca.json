That's a loss of 531 points for the day. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: The Federal Reserve hikes interest rates for a ninth straight meeting, but Jay Powell says the banking crisis could complicate the path forward. President Macron breaks his silence after a week of protests against his pension reforms. And the UN urges Uganda's President not to sign a new bill criminalizing gay people. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, March 22nd. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, a very good evening. Great to have you with us today. Tonight, the Federal Reserve says the banking crisis is likely weighing on the economy and suggests its rate hikes may be near an end. The Fed raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, that brings it to just under five percent. More notably, it dropped the phrase \"ongoing increases may be appropriate\" from its statement. Now the bank says some additional policy firming may be appropriate. At his news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell explained the change. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It shows most ofthe Fed's Monetary Policy Committee thinks that rates will peak at just over five percent. If you still think that it could go higher, Richard Quest is in Tokyo on assignment. He joins us now live. Richard, markets are not doing so well after Jerome Powell's statement. What was it that, you know, is scaring investors at this point? I think the 25 basis point rate hike was largely anticipated. There was hope, there would be a pause, but there is something that he said that perhaps could be spooking the markets. RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL HOST, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\":   Yes, what he has basically said is -- and you heard him just then is that the banking crisis itself will slow the economy. Banks will be harder -- it will be harder to borrow money, lending criteria will be tightened, so banks will not be so willing to lend, that will slow down the economy, that will slow down inflation. He is not taking his eye off the inflation ball. What he is saying basically, to paraphrase is there is more than one way to skin a cat. And whilst the Fed was quite happy to do it with rising interest rates, now that work is being done or will be done or potentially will be done by the banking crisis itself. Where he's left himself wiggle room is if for whatever reason the banking crisis subsides quickly, and things don't tighten, then I'm going to read my -- then he says, \"some additional policy firming may be appropriate.\" So Eleni, you know, the long and short of it is the economy is going to slow down, whether by bank action or Fed action, the slowdown is going to continue, and that is what the market doesn't like. There is going to be no cuts in interest rates. There is going to be no easing. There is going to be no pivoting. Inflation still remains the number one goal.",

So I guess that is countering what they needed to have done on the interest rate hike in France, and that sort of becomes interesting in terms of their projections, because, frankly, we are still sitting with major uncertainty.

You're right, the monetary transmission mechanism is through the banks and through blending, and through higher interest rates. That's how monetary policy works. But if somebody else is going to do the dirty work for you; now, they don't want a mega banking crisis. That's certainly the case. So he is very much aware of that. I was surprised, there wasn't more or something in the statement, offering liquidity promises. The ECB did that last week, making it clear that all you can eat is still on the table, but I guess the banks know that. They don't want a banking crisis, but they have got a situation where a slowdown is probably inevitable and they are going to ride it and take it. I think this idea of the dot-plot, I will take the dot plot with a pinch of salt, because, you know, the one thing he also said in his statement, the FOMC said in the statement is that they are going to be -- the monetary policy will be very aware of risks. Now, what that means is if the whole thing turns turtle, and things get bad very quickly, with banking, they will move in the opposite direction, but nobody is expecting that at the moment.",

So I don't see that happening in law. Now, the Fed can go beyond the law and just look more closely at banks of that size, even though they are still below the 250 threshold. If I had my druthers, it's clear to me, and it was clear at the time that 50 was too low. A threshold 250 was too high, a threshold that leaves a pretty wide range.

The originalproposal was for a 40 percent tax, but that's faced major pushback from the industry. Officials say fish farmers should share more of their profits, since the waters they use belong to everyone. Fish farmers say the tax is bad for business and will lead to job cuts as well as higher prices. Reports say Norway's parliament could decide on the tax this month. We have Ivan Vindheim, the CEO of Mowi, which is the world's largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon. He joins us now from Norway. Sir, good to have you with us. I want to talk about this 40 percent tax that you could be facing. What does that mean for your business and what does that mean for the industry in Norway?",

There is no private industry in Norway that pays the kind of taxes as we do. So we really contribute to the society. We pay for the common areas we use. And frankly speaking, we are in favor of taxes, but they must be balanced. So when you exceed 50 percent, then you come into trouble. And I think most people would agree to this reasoning. So that's our take here. So, of course, it will continue to contribute, but we also need some money left to continue to invest with.",

So, if thisbecomes the result, then the development just move abroad from Norway and carry on in other countries. But having said that, I don't think this is the end game. I think when the politicians see the consequences, the negative consequences of this proposal, then they will change it and reach to some kind of equilibrium.
