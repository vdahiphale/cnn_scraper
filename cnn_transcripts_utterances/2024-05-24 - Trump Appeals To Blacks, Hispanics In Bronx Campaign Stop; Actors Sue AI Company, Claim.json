All sorts of things related to gun control. All these core issues. And what they say -- and you see this in a new ad they have out this morning that's narrated by Rober DeNiro -- they feel like they can put this to Donald Trump and say how do you answer for your positions on these things? And really, what the Biden campaign tells me is that they feel like there's not any kind of answer that Donald Trump can give to these questions that the American voters are going to agree with. We'll see if that's true. We've got, obviously, a month leading up to this for this to all keep going on and I'm sure we'll have more from both the campaigns of what they are expecting into it.",

It was brief. He didn't stay for the seated portion of the dinner, but he had met with the Kenyan leader earlier in the day at Blair House where an official described their conversations as \"productive.\"But, John, this was a glamorous night here at the White House. The White House rolled out the red carpet for hundreds of guests to honor the Kenyan leader. Of course, a state dinner is one of the highest diplomatic tools that the White House can employ to honor a top U.S. ally. And that's exactly what they were doing last night in this transparent pavilion on the south lawn that, according to the first lady's office, was adorned with over 1,000 candles. Now, the guests enjoyed a three-course dinner and entertainment headlined by Brad Paisley, as well as the Howard Gospel Choir, both to honor the Kenyan president's interest in both country music and gospel music. And it was also a way to end what has been a pretty momentous state visit. This was the first state visit of an African leader since 2008. And over the course of the day and the visit, the president -- the two presidents had much to discuss. A broad range of issues going from economic cooperation to the importance of democracy, as well as the spiraling situation in Haiti where Kenya has helped -- or is trying to help with -- manage that situation. And so, this was a moment, really -- you're seeing there the president giving his toast -- to mark their 60-year relationship after a day of meetings. And so, from now, the president says that he's all in on Africa. He says he'll visit Africa at some point, suggesting that he would win a second term.

Tonight, the community will come together to remember and honor their lives during a candlelight vigil.Their families have agreed to a $2 million settlement with the city, but they are still fighting for any kind of accountability and announced a new $500 million lawsuit against the school district and nearly 100 police officers. Joining me now is Texas State Sen. Roland Gutierrez. I really appreciate your time. Tonight, I know that you're going to be with the families of the 19 students and two teachers who were massacred two years ago for this candlelight vigil. How do you comfort these families who are still looking for accountability -- I mean, two years later? ROLAND GUTIERREZ, (D) TEXAS STATE SENATE (via Webex by Cisco):  Uh, yeah, Amara. It doesn't really get -- thank you for your time, by the way. It doesn't get easier for these families. You would think that time heals all wounds but as I talk to my friends in Uvalde, they -- it just doesn't get easier. You have to understand loss and understand that this is different. It's not like you're losing your parent. You've lost your child -- 19 of them -- in such a tragic way. Every holiday is a remembrance. Every holiday that a kid loves is a remembrance. And certainly, these anniversaries are harder and harder. I had a parent yesterday say can you send us some help because we want to get out of Uvalde for the day? And so, that was one of the children that had survived the tragedy. So we also have to remember those children that witnessed all of that horror and torture for 77 minutes.",
