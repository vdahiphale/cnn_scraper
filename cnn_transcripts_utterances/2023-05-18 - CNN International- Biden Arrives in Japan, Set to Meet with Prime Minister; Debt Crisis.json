These 16 records that the special counsel wants to obtain reveal communication, some from top Trump advisers, explaining the how, why and when you would declassify certain documents.Now that's significant because the special counsel is looking at several crimes, including possibly mishandling classified information. And if the special counsel could use those records to establish that Trump was on notice about the process of how you declassify materials and the fact that it applied to him. That could help inform prosecutors as they decide whether they want to bring a case. Now the former president's lawyers have given various explanations for how and why he brought the classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago. The former president has suggested that he automatically was able to declassify these documents. He's also said that he has a standing order to declassify them. And the lawyers though have argued that part of this was about the process being flawed, and things were inadvertently packed up at the end of the administration. So, these records will help clarify the extent to which Trump was aware of how you declassify items. Now, the special counsel may have to wait to get their hands on these documents because the former president's legal team, they may file a legal challenge. They've not been successful in preventing prosecutors from getting much of the evidence, but they have tried to obtain, I'm told by a source familiar of their thinking, that they may still file a challenge because they want to try to protect constitutional and presidential privileges.

So, instead of voting on the resolution itself, the House voted on Wednesday along party lines to instead refer the resolution to the House Ethics Committee. Seven Democrats did vote present, most of them are on the House Ethics Committee. And George Santos himself, we should point out, did vote in favor of this referral.
