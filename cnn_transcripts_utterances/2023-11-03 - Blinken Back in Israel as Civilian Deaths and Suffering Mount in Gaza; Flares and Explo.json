The secretary of state did not commit to any kind of specifics other than saying that they would be making concrete requests of the Israeli government to show restraint in the military offensive there inside of Gaza.As you mentioned here off the top, the Israeli response has been quite controversial around the world, as you've seen the toll that it has taken on civilians there inside of Gaza. There's also a great deal of concern for the 242 hostages that are there as well on the ground, and who presumably could very well be in danger of all of this. So, that is why today's visit by the secretary of state extremely crucial. The secretary of state is expected to meet with reporters in about an hour, so perhaps we learn more details about how these meetings went this morning. But the secretary of state met for about an hour with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and as you mentioned is wrapping up a meeting at this point with the Israeli war cabinet. But, Erica and Phil, also a crucial day because later today, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon is expected to make his first remarks since the October 7th attacks, so this is very crucial, exactly what kind of message the Hezbollah leader is going to take because the U.S. is also very concerned that this is a conflict that could widen. And Hezbollah has much more military capability than Hamas. So, this could be a very -- you know, unfold into a very -- a much more treacherous situation than it already is.",

All of this as the Israeli military announced yesterday it was surrounding Gaza city from, quote, several directions.CNN Military Analyst, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton is with us now. So, we have those videos, we saw some of this happening live on the air last night. Walk us through what you're seeing over the last 24 hours and what it tells you, Colonel, about Israel's strategy at this point. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Erica, good morning. There are a lot of things going on here, obviously. So just to orient everybody, this is Israel, this is Gaza right here. The very fact that we have all of these different areas here in the northern part of Gaza, this is where we saw all those videos, especially around the town of Beit Hanoun, which is in Northeastern Gaza. This is the area of main concentration that the Israelis were working on in this particular moment in time, and then they're moving south into Gaza City. So, this is where they'll be going, and this is where that grand encirclement is taking place right here. So, that's where that is. And so you have all these troops that have come in from the north around Beit Hanoun. They've come in also around Jabalya, and then they're moving into Gaza City. And they're doing this in several different directions where you can see that they're actually using all of this territory not only to maneuver but they're also coming in, in a way that it will allow them to stop, gain, hold territory, then move forward into different areas. So, that's the kind of thing that we're seeing, and this is the kind of movement that we can expect the Israelis to do as they try to gain as much territory as possible before there's any type of diplomatic pause.",

You see the bulldozers working right in front of the infantry troops and you see them blowing up all these different areas.What it tells me, is intense combat in very narrow areas.

We understand it. We want their immediate release. And, finally, I want to say something with respect to the humanitarian and the international law-abiding by the state of Israel. So, this is a leaflet, which we are sending over, 1,000,200 leaflets, to the citizens of Gaza. We've carried out 6 million text messages and 4 million phone calls to the citizens of Gaza. According to the rules of international law where we alert the citizens in advance, including before the Jabalya attack, please move out, because as we have the right to self-defense, we want you to go out of the premises from where missiles and guns and bombs and mortars are shelled at our people, and from where the horrendous atrocious attacks went out. So, you move out so we can go in, according to international law, and defend our people. 6 million text messages and 4 million phone calls, and 1.2 million pamphlets, and phone calls in addition to all of that speaks for itself as we protect the civilians moving out to a safe zone, giving them the right to necessary humanitarian aid and enabling ourselves to defend ourselves.

At the same time, as you've just made clear, how Israel does this matters and it is very important that when it comes to the protection of civilians who are caught in the crossfire of Hamas' making, that everything be done to protect them and bring assistance to those who so desperately need it who were not in any way responsible for what happened on October 7th. So, we're working on all of that together but we have a shared determination, and that determination will not wane. We also are thinking every single moment about our hostages, so many Israelis, Americans, other nationals.

How much do you think Israel at this point is actually weighing what comes after? KURTZER:  Well, today, I think there's probably little attention being paid to that, but they ought to be paying attention to it. Because, at some point, the guns will fall silent, and then people will focus on the reconstruction of Gaza, but that will only get us back to a status quo ante at a very high price. And we will be fated to run into a problem again in a couple of years. There have been several very significant wars since 2006. The last time, there was an Israel- Hezbollah War. So, you know, it's shortsighted to think that even if you can deal Hamas a significant blow that that solves the problem. And it's quite extraordinary that while this war in Gaza is going on, there are some ministers in Israel that are punishing the Palestinian authority in the West Bank by withholding funding. So, I think there has to be some consideration in Israel given to what happens on the day after, and that means empowering the Palestinian authority even as it weakens Hamas.",
