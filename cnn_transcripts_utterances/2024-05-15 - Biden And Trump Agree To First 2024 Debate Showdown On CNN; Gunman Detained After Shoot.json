The next moves by the defense could go a long way toward deciding if jurors believe the longtime Trump fixer's incriminating testimony against his former boss.

Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in The Situation Room. Our top story tonight, the deal is now done. And the date is set for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to go head to head on the debate stage here on CNN, a first in their historic rematch.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): With those words today, President Biden formally challenged and Donald Trump quickly accepted two presidential debates with their first face- to-face encounter now set for late next month on CNN. The June 27th showdown followed by a second one on September 10th on ABC would become the earliest presidential debates in memory, a sign that both rivals are eager to appear side by side to gain advantage in their historic rematch.

And they wanted to get before a large swath of Americans before that process begins, to give them the information they need in their decision- making.But I also think, as Jeff just noted, Wolf, both of these guys see incentive in getting to a debate stage soon. The Biden campaign has for months said that they believe a lot of the voters that they're trying to reach are dialed out and not fully realizing that the Trump versus Biden matchup is on and that by getting on the debate stage with the former president, that will be literally put before the eyes of those Americans they're reaching. And on the Trump side, Trump has been saying for months he is so eager to debate Biden because he firmly believes, as does his team, that this matchup benefits him, that he shows more energy, that he can dominate a debate stage in a way that they don't think Joe Biden can, and they are eager to have that side by side comparison as well.

They have always wanted a number of debates. So, now they are saying that two is not enough. They want more four debates.But there is also another part of this, which is that Donald Trump has really made debating Biden a key part of his campaign, as you saw Jeff mentioning the fact that Donald Trump often brings an extra podium up to the stage to mock Biden, to mock the fact that Biden had not agreed to any debates. He also gave out talking points to surrogates insisting that they say on television that Donald Trump was ready to debate at any time and any place. Today, Joe Biden took control of the narrative. They announced that he was willing to debate and they accepted the debate, putting Donald Trump really on the defensive. And that was a change of pace. So, now you're seeing Donald Trump trying to take back some of that narrative when it comes to those debates by saying he'll do a third debate.",

Alencia, is President Biden agreeing to this early debate and admission that he does believe these current polls that show he's losing this race in several key battleground states? ALENCIA JOHNSON, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, BIDEN 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, I don't think it's an admission, but I do think it's an acknowledgement that there are voters who want to hear directly from him on issues that they care about around the economy, around immigration, around abortion, around what's happening with the Israel Hamas war. And so the debate is the opportunity to get in front of those voters very early on and making, as the other guests were saying, making voters start paying attention a lot sooner than they usually do. Look, I'm a presidential campaign vet. A lot of times voters don't start paying attention until the end of the summer. But this election is unlike any other that any of us on this panel have ever seen. And so the earlier that they can get in front of voters, the better Biden is in a position to go into the summer strong. Doing the on the ground work that this campaign has been bolstering for the past year. Yes, that's important as well. Alyssa Farrah Griffin is with us.

But that has been the strategy here, and that's because Michael Cohen is a key witness for the prosecution. He is their last witness that will be testifying. So, we expect the cross-examination to go all day tomorrow. Then the prosecutors will have a chance to do what's known as redirect, and that is to ask Cohen additional questions. So, that could happen on Monday. And then from there, the prosecution is expected to rest their case. The question will be, does Donald Trump's team put on a witness? They have considered calling an expert witness, but have said that it will depend a lot on the judge's rulings tomorrow at the end of the court day. So, it could be that they call this expert or they don't. And then the question is, does Donald Trump take the stand and testify in his own defense? His lawyer said that has not been determined yet.
