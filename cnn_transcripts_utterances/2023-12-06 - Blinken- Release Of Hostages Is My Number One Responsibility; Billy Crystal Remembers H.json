So, what we're seeing is areas clearly designated by Israel that are safe areas, where there's not going to be firing or the military. We've seen efforts to make sure that people know that they need to move and not in -- not the entire city, but just discrete neighborhoods. So, that's positive. On the other hand, there's more that has to happen that needs to be done, making sure that people have safe corridors, in order to get from areas that could be in danger, to places where there'll be safe, making sure that those areas, where they're going to have the proper resources, have the food, have the water, have the medicine, to care for them, while they're in those areas.

And that's something that is not entirely new. But it's sort of come out from beneath the rock, since October 7th. And by the way, I'm also deeply disturbed about the same kind of hatred, and vitriol, being directed against Muslim Americans, Arab Americans. We see this in all different directions.
