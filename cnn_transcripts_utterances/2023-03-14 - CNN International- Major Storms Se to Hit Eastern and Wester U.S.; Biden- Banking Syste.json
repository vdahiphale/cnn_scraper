They've seen some of that as well, tied to the Federal Reserve's credit lending facility. So, some positive signs going forward on that front. The other obviously is messaging. The president making very clear that he wanted to reassure individuals, reassure small businesses trying to make clear what his regulators and finance officials are saying, that the market on the whole is stable and well-capitalized.

Obviously, here In the U.K. we did actually have a branch of the Silicon Valley Bank which HSBC of course bought for one pound. And so there was fallout there in the banking sector -- we saw some pullouts. Asia there we did see continued contagion particularly in Japan wherethey are the biggest holdings of U.S. treasuries actually, they are the biggest holder of U.S. outside the U.S. -- taking over from China as the top there. So, there's some scrutiny of the bank's balance sheets there as well. Some of the biggest banks saw some pretty heavy losses in Japan. U.S. futures though look pretty steady as well. They're coming up a little bit. I think there is a sense that perhaps those words and that quick action from the Biden administration has sort of put out that initial fire.

Why they were allowed to amass that huge interest rate hedge at the same time was having more than 90 percent of their deposits above that FDIC cap of $250,000. At the point of which they said that they were going to insure deposits. Obviously they have now come out and said they're going to insure all deposits essentially. Sending a message to the entire system.So that obviously invites scrutiny as well. What's the point of having a cap if you're just going to ensure everything. So, they're going to take a look at regulation. They're going to take a look at how this particular bank was supervised.

But environmental groups plan to fight it in court arguing that President Biden has broken his promises on attacking climate change. CNN's Rene Marsh reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RENE MARSH, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: On Monday the Biden administration approved a major oil project led by Conoco-Phillips. It's located on remote land in northwest Alaska and the federal government owns the land. The site holds up to 600 million barrels of oil but it would take years before it gets to market. Mainly because the infrastructure for the project has not yet been constructed. Now the administration estimates that drilling here would release the same amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases as 2 million gas powered cars. This project has really divided Alaska natives. Some see it as victory because of the revenue it will bring to the state. Others, especially those who are closest to the site call it an environmental disaster in the making. Calling the project a carbon bomb that will exacerbate global warming and have a negative health impact on the surrounding communities. But beyond Alaska, climate activists including young Gen Zers who took to social media in an aggressive campaign to urge the president to block the project, they are using words like betrayal. And at the same time that the administration has come out to approve this project, they are also offering an olive branch to climate activists. The Biden administration also on Monday announced sweeping new protections for federal land and waters in Alaska making the entire U.S. Arctic Ocean off-limits to future oil and gas leasing. In all the administration says it will protect up to 16 million acres from future fossil fuel leasing. Of course this is all happening as the Arctic is warming faster than any other place on the planet. Rene Marsh, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "so, two very poignant cases. The first centers around the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children. So, Ukraine says that hundreds of children, some 345 children have gone missing and they fear that many of those children have been forcibly deported to Russia. Put with other families, put into reeducation camps, used in propaganda videos. And the thing is Moscow doesn't really make a secret of this at all. They very openly use these children, their narrative, the Kremlin's narrative is that these children were saved from conflict, saved from Ukraine. We've even seen events with President Putin standing alongside these Ukrainian children believed to be abducted.So, this is going to be an extremely important case for Ukrainians to see. The second case is around civilian infrastructure and we've seen plenty of that, right. These massive missile attacks that hit critical infrastructure from water supplies to electricity grids that make normal life, daily life, extremely difficult in cities like Kyiv that are not necessarily on the frontlines of course. So, you have the chief prosecutor in Ukraine last month working on collecting evidence around these two cases. The first step in this process is that he's going to present that evidence to a pretrial panel of judges and then those judges will say, yes you have enough evidence for us to proceed and to issue potentially the search warrants or, no, we need you to go back and collect more information. So that's going to be the first step.",
