And it is not really the kind of thing that if you passed him on the street yesterday or if you were in that Starbucks where he bought a bottle of water and two power bars that you would say, wow, I recognize that guy. But if you work with him, if he's a cousin of yours, if he's your friend, you're going to recognize him. And that's what police are counting for here.",

And that is considered by detectives to possibly be a variation of what some critics called the three D's of the insurance business, deny, delay and defend, which is tactics that insurance companies, health insurance companies and other insurance companies use when they don't want to pay a claim. So that may tell us that this killer had something out for a health provider, maybe UnitedHealth, maybe all health providers or insurance companies.But he was trying to send a message because, you know, if you're going to be writing on a bullet and, you know, that's not a lot of space to be writing on. He went to a lot of trouble to do that. And that means he's trying to tell us something.",

We also have this new evidence, we believe, of this smudged fingerprint found on the water bottle.Of course, there are questions about fingerprints that are in databases, DNA possibly. What could investigators get from that? MILLER: Well, the smudge print could give them a partial, but they have to have something to compare it to. They have a print off the phone that they found, but they're not entirely certain that that phone belonged to the gunman. But of course, if they get a suspect and that suspect's prints match what they found on the phone, that will certainly get them a lot further towards that conclusion. You know, we learn a lot looking at these clues. If you go back to those pictures, you know, if you see him before the murder or during the murder, he is wearing that same, appearing to have that same coat with a gray backpack. But if you look at him here in the hotel, you see the strap on his shoulder. He's got a black backpack. Now, in the earlier photos where he has the gray backpack, police are able to track him on that e-bike going into Central Park. They catch him coming out of Central Park on another camera. There's the gray backpack. And that backpack is gone at that point. So it appears he goes into the park on a bike wearing that backpack you're looking at right now. He comes out of the park with no backpack. It suggests strongly that he discarded that backpack in the park. Now, yesterday, they got a mobile field force, scores of cops. They did a grid search through the entire park. They opened every garbage can, looked at every dumpster and didn't recover that. So someone in Central Park may have picked up a backpack and we don't know what was inside if anything. That could be another clue in this case.",

Zelenskyy's top advisor, Andrew Yermak, and the deputy defense minister more wanted to start to build rapport, build a connection with Waltz and Vance. I'm told that they discussed more of their assessment of where things stand in the war. And they just wanted to form those relationships as we are looking at the start of this administration. This meeting lasted more than an hour.It was here in Washington, D.C. And the two were able to present to the Trump administration officials where they see the battlefield standing right now and where they expect it to stand on January 20, when Trump takes office. I'm told that the Ukrainians felt pleased with how the meeting went. They walked away thinking that they had accomplished their goals of presenting this assessment -- this objective assessment as they saw it, as well as getting to form those relationships. And I'm told that Waltz and Vance were in more of a listening mode in this conversation. Now, Alex, it's notable that they did not meet with the pick for Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg. However, Kellogg has traveled to Ukraine. He has met Yermak before. So there wasn't a need for this sort of introductory meeting yesterday with Kellogg. They more wanted to talk to these other top Trump incoming officials, Vance and Waltz.",

      "sentences": "Sure, Brianna, but for context, let's start with the charts. Now, we know last year, 2023, was a doozy. Record highest temperatures going back to the 40s just on this chart, but even sooner than that.But look at 2023, that dot in the upper right corner there, nearly off the charts. Now, scientists knew it was going to be above average because of global warming, because of sort of planet cooking pollution in the atmosphere, and because it was an El Nino year, a natural warming variability. But that jump was too high to account for both of those. So the new science now out today suggests it may be clouds. It may be the loss of Earth's albedo effect. That is the reflection of sunlight back into space. If you put a same size snowball, two snowballs together, you roll one in dirt, the dirty one will melt faster because it absorbs more of that sunlight. That is happening to Earth. As the poles melt, as glaciers melt, as winter ice goes away, the Earth is now absorbing a lot more energy there. But the clouds, clouds are a natural sunscreen, and the low-level, bright low-level clouds seem to be disappearing in the last 10 years. And as a result, the planet warming up faster than science even predicted.",

New research suggesting a link between lead in gasoline and mental health disorders. They found that exposure to car exhaust, which contained lead up through the 1990s, caused more than 150 million excess diagnoses, including anxiety, depression and ADHD.CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell joins us now with more. So Meg, this is quite disturbing. Obviously, leaded gasoline, very common for decades. What more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this was a study that looked at the potential impacts using essentially modeling of what's known about blood lead levels of people throughout the last 75 years and what's known about the connections between those lead levels and mental health disorders. We know that there's connections between lead and lower IQ and things like that. So lead was added to gasoline in the United States between 1923 and 1996 when it was banned.And it began being phased out even before that, as we realized some of the health issues around this. And so this study looked at those levels of lead in people's blood over the years. And what they find by this modeling is that there are an estimated 151 million additional mental health disorders that were because of childhood exposure to lead in gasoline exhaust. And this, as you noted, things like anxiety and depression, ADHD, but also milder things that could have had impacts as well. That just kind of makes life a little bit harder to live, making you more neurotic, less able to focus on tasks and things like that. And because of the lead levels associated with gasoline being the highest really around the 60s and the 70s, they say the generation that would be most affected by this is those people born between 1965 and 1980 or essentially generation X. And so this is a troubling finding. And of course, it's very backwards looking, but they say what it shows is that perhaps the impacts of lead were even smaller than we had even realized up to this point.",

There are in water pipes, those supposed to be taken out of those in 1986.But if you live in a house that's older than that, you could have lead pipes. There are paints in older homes. As of 1978, that was supposed to change. But of course, we know in older homes, you can still have lead paint, contaminated soil, food sources. So that's why pediatricians recommend that kids get tested for their blood levels at age one and two, so that you can try to mitigate these things if they are in your environment.",
