Gerald Groff sued the U.S. Postal Service and accused it of religious discrimination. He says his boss wanted him to pick up Sunday shifts because of a new contract to deliver Amazon packages. But he pushed back because it's the day of observance, the Sabbath Day of worship -- rest and worship. Groff says that he faced increasing discipline and quit his job. During arguments yesterday, the justices seemed to be sympathetic to the ex-postal worker. Let's check in now with CNN's Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic. Joan, good morning to you.

And so that's a very real question.And Elena -- Justice Elena Kagan said, well, isn't this more of a policy issue that should go to Congress rather than the courts?

And when we got there, these objects were already out there, or they followed us, but we were detecting similar objects. However, from the video that you just played, that was during one of our air to air exercises. And an aircrew from my squadron was returning back to the ship after essentially conducting their training and they detected these objects east of the ship as we were already about 400 miles off the coast of Florida. And these objects were maneuvering and behaving in a way that isn't familiar to us. As jet pilots, we wouldn't expect a helicopter to be forming at these altitudes. We wouldn't expect them to be able to flip up vertically and change directions in an instant. And we wouldn't expect them to have the fuel to be able to hang out in that operation area. And so, as you can hear from the air crew, this was clearly an anomalous event. They had no idea what they were looking at.
