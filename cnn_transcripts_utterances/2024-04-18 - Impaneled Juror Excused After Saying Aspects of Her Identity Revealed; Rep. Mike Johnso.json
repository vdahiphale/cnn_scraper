We know that this juror called the court and essentially said that she was worried about if she could be impartial. She was worried about if she was fit to serve. So, she came in this morning. She talked to the judge and essentially this is what she says. And I want to make sure I get it. She says that she was excused after she told the judge that, quote, aspects of her identity have already been out there in the public. Yesterday, alone she said she had friends colleagues and family push things to her phone questioning if she was the juror. She went on to say that she felt intimidated and she wasn't sure that she would be able to serve fairly. But, look, this is an overall problem and we are likely to see this happen again and again with some of these jurors and that is why they are trying now to take out some of those identifying factors. This is going to be a very high-profile case with a very polarizing figure. It is something that both sides are concerned about being able to actually keep that jury pool. And it's likely when you see Judge Merchan saying, okay, we want around six alternates. We had originally heard just six alternates. There's a chance he's going to want more alternates because as this case goes on we might see more of this.",

That's a very scary proposition.We knew that social media posts were already a part of this, and we were able to identify through defense counsel and call them to task. But now you've got this ongoing problem, this tension between what the medias and the interests of the public in trying to cover this case, a historic nature, and also what the jurors are going to be feeling. And then you also have social media posts on Truth Social. Just last night, Donald Trump posting a quote that he attributed to Jesse Watters from Fox News.

He said, they are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the judge in order to get on the Trump jury. There is absolutely no evidence of this, that there's any liberal activists that has been caught.Now, obviously, as we have seen this process unfold, there have been things that have come out, which is part of the jury selection process of people saying, maybe I can't be fair, or old social media posts. The judge has ruled on that in various cases of these jurors. Did you post in 2020 something about the election? What news accounts? What have you reposted on social media? The judge, in some cases, has dismissed these jurors. In other cases, he said, I don't really think that this is going to impact their ability to be impartial. That is all part of the process. But, again, here you have Donald Trump muddying the waters. He has tried time and time again to make this case seem as though it is political, that it is all about election interference. And this is just another way to do this, by essentially telling his millions of followers that the jury pool, without even having a full-seated jury, is already biased against him.",

He said, no, that there shouldn't be a gag order at all.Part of his argument continues to be, well, if they are saying things about me, why can't I say things about them? So, it doesn't seem like he's going to stop anytime soon. I will also tell you though, what's interesting to me about all of this involving the gag order is that we know from his last trial, his civil fraud trial, that when he violated that gag order and was fined, he started working with his attorneys essentially on how to get all the way up to the line without crossing it. Even some of the social media posts were being vetted by his attorneys. Now, whether or not they looked over this, I do not know. I mean, sent pretty late at night. So, unclear whether or not he had any approval for this, but they were trying to figure out ways for him to get all the way there. I mean, remember Donald Trump doesn't want to spend any money, right? And that's all about a fine. So, he doesn't want to spend the thousands of dollars he might get fined on this. So, that's what they were trying to do. But, again, the judge is going to decide whether or not he actually crossed that line.",

I think as we continue to move forward, not being negative, just being reasonable, you're going to hit speed bumps, you're going to hit issues. That's part of the process, right, just like we in everyday life hit speed bumps.And so the fact that there's a juror who would express concern is problematic, that juror being excused. Now you have six. We'll see what develops today with respect to the jury that's selected, with regard to those who say they cannot serve, and we know the judge has been very overinclusive, saying, listen, if you self- identify as being biased, I'm going to just remove you. But then, of course, we also know, Jim, that they're down to, that is the parties, the prosecution and the defense for peremptory challenges. What does that mean in English? It means that they can only either party strike four more people. So, if you go through the panel and you don't have the ability to strike people for cause and people don't identify as being biased, you're going to have a jury and it may very well be running on the very same timeframe as it was running before. So, yes, a hiccup to be clear, something that is not ideal, but you have to protect the safety, security of the jury. That's what the judge is doing. That's what the juror is doing.

Something will go amiss at work. Someone will get ill.And that leads to the question, Jim, of alternates. And that's why you have alternate jurors, right? Not that we have a jury pool yet, of course. But that's why the judge wants at least six so that if something comes up, whether it's an identity breach, whether it's some other intimidation concern, whether it's some unexpected event that happens in a juror's life, you don't have to redo the trial. You can just substitute an alternate such that the matter can move forward, Mr. Trump can get a fair trial, and the ultimate jury can reach a determination beyond a reasonable doubt.",

How else are you going to conduct a trial if you don't have consequences? People need consequences to incentivize good behavior. Otherwise it leads to bad behavior.And so maybe it's a few hours, maybe it's a half a day.

He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is a member of the House Freedom Caucus. Congressman, thank you very much for being here. First, let's just get your reaction to what the speaker is doing with this foreign aid package, splitting it up into different bills. Are you on board with that? What do you think? REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH):  Look, I love the idea of single-subject bills subject to amendment. The idea that we get a granular vote on Ukraine, a granular vote on Israel, and a granular vote on the Pacific package is important, and especially if they're subject to relevant germane amendments. But when you put them together at the end, it's essentially the Senate bill that we already said we're against. And let me just read you. This is a tweet that Mike Johnson, as speaker of the House, put out just in January. He said, my position is clear. Any bill that does not solve the problem and secure the border is not acceptable to the House. So, what's missing is a border security bill. They've got a fourth bill and even a fifth bill that's supposedly defending America or securing the border, but it's not going to be part of what is known as a MERV (ph) that merges these bills together and forces the Senate to take action. They didn't accidentally do these things to our border. They did them. They campaigned on them. They delivered them. They've had the same disastrous results that we told them they would.

Now, they've been heroic and inspiring in holding this to a draw, but instead of being able to negotiate a peace, which they started to do, the Biden administration stopped them from doing that, and it said we're going to do as much as it takes as long as it takes.
