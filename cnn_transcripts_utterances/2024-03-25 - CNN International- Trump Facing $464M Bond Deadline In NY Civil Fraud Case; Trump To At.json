And the reason that it's not starting today, as was scheduled, is because Donald Trump's team won a lot of records from the federal investigation that predated the investigation into his falsifying business records in Manhattan, and he got those records recently. Because he got those records recently, his team was able to raise their hand and say, Judge, we need time to look through these. The Manhattan DA's Office has said very few of those 100,000 or more records are relevant. There is only a couple hundred that actually will pertain to your case here. And so, we should get to trial as quickly as possible. The judge wants to talk about that in court today. And so, we will seeif an April trial is possible, or if something like what Donald Trump's team is proposing, something as far out as 90 days, maybe June, if that will be the case in that Manhattan criminal case against Donald Trump. So, trial date, trial date, trial date, that's what we're watching for there.",

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, the dueling threats, both in the same city on the same day, really underscore some of Donald Trump's longest-held fears, which is, one, a potential criminal conviction, and then the other is not having as much cash as he claims that he has. Now, this New York Attorney General's civil fraud case, what Katelyn just walked us through, is something that is personally very concerning for Donald Trump. And we heard him really air some of those grievances last night when he railed against Fox News' coverage of this entire case.I'm going to read for you some of what he said. He said, quote, \"Don't Like the way Fox News is reporting the Letitia James Election Interference Scam. They don't want to discuss how ridiculous the Corrupt Judge's fine of 450 Million Dollars is. It should be $ZERO.\" Now, the post went on to say \"THESE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT MADE AMERICA GREAT, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DESTROYING AMERICA.\" So, Amara, a lot of the rhetoric we have heard from Donald Trump and his team throughout this process. He is claiming it as political. He is claiming it as interference. This is the type of rhetoric he has used time and again with all of his indictments and charges that he has faced to really galvanize the Republican base behind them. But, look, part of the reason that this is so personal for Donald Trump is because he is a businessman. He was a businessman before he became a politician. And this is something that strikes to the core of who he is. The other part of it is that he has successfully, for several years, really tangled with legal issues regarding his real estate empire, but he has been able to avoid this bond scenario that we're seeing play out today. And the other part, again, is the public perception of him not having enough liquid cash to really post the bond himself. And as, for the criminal case, the New York hush money case that he is going to be attending a trial for today, that's also a concern. I mean, it's one of four criminal indictments Donald Trump has often lamented, both publicly and in private, that he does not want to be indicted, that despite what his team is doing and successfully, I should say, with fundraising, and really energizing Republicans to come to his aid, missed all his legal troubles, it's still something he does not want. He does not want to be indicted and he does not want to be going to trial. Now, the other part of this criminal case as well, this New York hush money case, is that it's actually one of the cases that Donald Trump's team feels the most confident about. They think it's the least damaging publicly despite, of course, some of the more mortifying details that come with him, paying allegedly hush money to a former adult film star. Amara.",

So, let's start off with what we're about to expect to happen today in this Manhattan courtroom. It was supposed to be Trump's first criminal trial beginning today, but instead, there is this critical pre-trial hearing that's taking place.

      "sentences": "So, Amara, good morning to you. So, I think the defense, that is Donald Trump's team, is going to argue really notions of due process and fairness. What does that mean? Due process certainly has to do with notice and the right to be heard. And in preparing for any criminal trial, what you want is discovery. You want any and all documents that may tend, right, to have some relevance in the case, relevance meaning making any fact a little bit more or a little less likely. And in that regard, when you're missing significant discovery,thousands of pages in this instance having to do with Michael Cohen, Amara, his fixer, remember, Michael Cohen pled guilty himself in 2018 in connection with a scheme with Mr. Trump. Right? Mr. Trump not prosecuted by the federal government. The feds took a pass on that. They prosecuted Cohen instead. But, there is a lot of information that Cohen passed on to the federal government that his defense lawyers Donald Trump's want. They want evaluate it. They think it goes to the credibility of Michael Cohen. They think it goes to the core of the case. And so, I think the lawyers are going to be arguing, listen, to the extent that we got this information late, allow us to evaluate it, allow us to review it, allow us to see how it impairs this case, and we need a delay for that. They will also, Amara, be arguing based upon the lateness upon which the discovery was produced to them for it to be a fundamental issue of fairness and for the case to be dismissed. I do not anticipate that the judge will dismiss that nor should the judge dismiss it. I do anticipate that the judge will give the defense team some time that it needs to evaluate the document and see how probative, how relevant, how important it is to their case, and then to come back and be prepared to try the case. So, I would expect a delay, not a dismissal.",

So, we're talking about $500 million. As we understand it, there were I think 30 bonding companies that, said, no, we're not going to secure his bond for him or underwrite this. So, what's happening behind the scenes in terms of Trump trying to come up with the money, as you might anticipate?

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, I think already the attorney general has attempted to be fair by allowing for a 30-day grace period before she would move forward in an effort, right, to collect on the judgment. Remember that the judgment could have been owing and due to this point, but she has held off for 30 days. What you might see is the attorney general give the grace to hold off yet again, what am I speaking about? Remember that an appellate court has been consulted, right, not consulted, but certainly they have applied, that is the Trump team, to an appellate court and said, listen, can you do a couple of things for us? Number one, can you reduce the nature of the bond that we owe or stay it in some way, that is delay it?And I think that what will happen is, is that the attorney general could very well say, listen, I'm not going to move forward. I laid the groundwork. But, until that appellate court decides, I think any day now, perhaps not today, but potentially this week, maybe next week, we'll hear from an appellate court. And I think that that would indicate that the attorney general is being beyond fair. Certainly, we know she has already laid the groundwork to collect by filing judgments in various jurisdictions, Westchester, New York. But, I think that the prudent course of action may be, yes, he has gotten 30 days. Let's give an additional bit of time. Let's let the appellate court weigh in, and that would go and demonstrate, look, she is not being vindictive. She is simply exercising her rights under the law. But, we'll be guided by what the appellate court has to say with respect to the reduction of the judgment, if any, with respect to lessening the amount of the bond, if any, and with regard to what they say, that is the appellate court, should happen moving forward. So, you could see that. If you don't see that, then what you'll see is certainly the attorney general moving and looking to seize assets as soon as possible, and that would include banking accounts, because those are liquid funds. And then, you move on to properties, which takes some time. There are certain notice provisions etc. And after you produce those notice provisions, then you can go right in and liquidate the actual property assets, converting them into cash and satisfying the judgment.",

So, as the Kremlin defends its intelligence services, four suspects in the deadly Moscow concert hall have been charged, the attack, have been charged with committing a terrorist act. Each had a number of visible injuries as they went before a judge. And a Russian spokesperson would not comment when asked by CNN if these men had been tortured. The death toll from Friday's attack now stands at 137. Inside what's left on the venue, crews are searching debris from the devastating fire which the gunmen are accused of setting. Robots and dogs are also being used in the search in case there are more bodies buried underneath all that rubble. CNN's Matthew Chance is on the ground near Moscow. He is joining us now live. Hi there, Matthew. I can see just a huge, long line of flowers that have been placed at this memorial where you are. Can we first focus on what took place in court this morning? I mean, it was really, I guess, notable to see the pictures of the accused attackers and the injuries that they sustained. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, the Russian investigation has been moving pretty quickly in the sense that they say they've arrested so far 11 people in connection with the killing of more than 130 people here at the Crocus City Hall outside of Moscow. The four suspected attackers appeared in a Moscow court earlier today. And as you mentioned, they look battered. They look bruised. One of them appeared to have lost an eye. Another one had what appeared to be the remains of a plastic bag still tied around his neck. The third one was in a wheelchair. And in the lead up to that, there have been lots of videos that have been leaked about the -- showing the brutal interrogation of these individuals, as they were sort of questioned, etc., by the Russian security services. I think this was -- these videos were leaked on purpose as a way for the security services in Russia that have come under some criticism for not kind of acting ahead of this attack, given the warnings about it, a message that they are taking this incredibly seriously and being ruthless in their pursuit of the perpetrators. And I think that's the evidence of that is what we saw on the faces of those men in the court today.",

So, this is within the range of what Hamas had said that it wanted to see. Now, we know that this is one part, a key part of the first phase, but it is just one part of the first phase. And there is agreement between the U.S. and Israel, it appears on this. Of course, there has to be agreement from Hamas as well, and that could take several days.Here in Doha, the technical teams remain. But, of course, those who make the key decisions, the decision makers, are not physically here at this point. We have heard from a diplomat, who is familiar with these talks, that there are also other outstanding issues where there hasn't been agreement, the entry, for example, of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and also Israel's military positioning once there is a ceasefire in place. We've heard very clearly from Hamas that they would like Israel to pull its military out of the whole of the Gaza Strip or at least move it from certain areas once a ceasefire is in place. But, Israel does not seem willing or able to do that. We've heard from the Israeli Prime Minister consistently that he still wants to have this major ground offensive into Rafah.

Dave Calhoun says he will leave the airplane giant by the end of the year. Now, as you know, Boeing has faced more than five years of problems, including those two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX planes that killed 346 people. More recently, a door plug blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX in January, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Let's bring in CNN's Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean. I guess it doesn't come as a surprise to many. But, what are your thoughts on this? What do you know? PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: It doesn't come as a surprise to me either, and many had been wondering if there would be major change at the top of Boeing, and now CEO Dave Calhoun stepping down at the end of the year. The irony here is that this is all stemming from the MAX 9 door plug blowout back on January 5, when that plane left the factory at Boeing without those four critical bolts back in October, according to the NTSB, then the door plug blowout happened all on board, uninjured and nobody was killed. That is significant, but it could have been so much worse. And now the fact that Calhoun is stepping down has many wondering if this is too little too late. There was a huge financial loss reported at Boeing for the fourth quarter of this year. And airline CEOs had been especially critical of Calhoun after these issues that continue to come up. The irony, as I mentioned earlier, is that Calhoun came to power after the Boeing 737 MAX 8 issues in 2018 and 2019, two crashes killing 346 people abroad. Now, he is stepping down at the end of the year. The other changes at the top, Larry Kellner, the board chair, he is retiring, and also Stan Deal, who is the head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is out of Boeing effective today. Up until now, there has not been a major change at the top at Boeing. The only person who has stepped down in the wake of the door plug blowout was the head of the MAX program, which is somebody that a lot of people really had not heard of, leaving the question that, was this person really a scapegoat, and should there be major change? Now we are seeing it play out. There has also been a lot of incredible pressure on the workers at Boeing who have wondered whether or not there would be change at the top at the airplane giant. The workers have been especially criticized because of the fact that there was a quality control issue on the production line in the Renton factory, and they've been criticized for some of the work that they do there. The NTSB has really wanted Boeing to produce the records of the work that Boeing did on the factory floor that led the door plug bolts to be not reinstalled. That is so significant. And so, now, a lot of workers are getting at least what they may have hoped for when it comes to the change needed at Boeing. We will see if the company could ride itself. And now, Calhoun is not leaving until the end of the year. So, there is maybe a chance here for Boeing to sort of turn the aircraft carrier around and write ride ship. But, there is a lot of question now about whether or not he will stay until the end of the year, simply because Boeing has reported these incredible financial losses, and airlines have been really heavily criticized Calhoun. Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci wants $150 million in damages from Boeing. CEO of United Airlines Scott Kirby has also heavily criticized Boeing. They have a lot of Boeing planes on order. One of the only few companies, Ryanair, has heavily supported Boeing through all of this. It's the backbone of their fleet. We will see, though, if orders ultimately drop off, and if Calhoun drops off along with them a bit earlier than planned. And Pete, you mentioned that the pressure that Boeing and of course the CEO, who is now stepping down, Calhoun, has been facing.

And so, now, the FBI wants to know if whether -- and the Department of Justice wants to know whether or not there was a bigger case at issue here. And they're really digging into that.Of course, this only adds on to the layer upon layer of investigation into Boeing. There is not only the NTSB investigation looking into the incident itself. It's only partway done. They just issued a preliminary report not long ago. But, the final report will take about 18 months. The FAA investigation of Boeing's quality control, they just did an audit of Boeing quality control on the floor of the Renton factory plant that builds the 737 MAX, and now this Department of Justice and FBI investigation.

They don't have full support of the security services, they feel. And in different parts of the country, in Nigeria, you have different threats, but the same outcome. Just a few days before these children were abducted by gunmen, there were more than 200 people taken in Borno state in the northeast of the country, likely by extremist groups where that continues to be a highly insecure area.And as you touched on, Amara, it's nearly 10 years since the Chibok girls were taken. That caused a worldwide outcry and a social media campaign to get them freed. There are still some girls, who are now women, who have remained in custody all of that time. So, Nigerians are fed up, and they believe more needs to be done to ensure their safety. And if a ransom is paid, of course, it might fix one immediate problem. But, many fear that this will just perpetuate the issue of kidnappings for ransom, certainly in large parts of the northwest and central parts of Nigeria. Amara.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. One of the things that could come out of this pre-trial hearing today is whether the judge has decided that the case can actually go ahead next month. The reason it was delayed in this particular case was because the Southern District of New York found a bunch of documents that they believe could be pertinent to this case, and they handed them over to the prosecutor here and the Trump legal team. Trump says that this means, that his team needs more time. And in fact, it means that the case should be thrown out. It doesn't look likely that that will be the case. Many of these documents don't, in fact, appear to be relevant to the particular matter in hand.But, the judge has already delayed this till the middle of April. He may decide today that that is enough and the case would go ahead, in which case, it would be the first time that a former President would go on trial in the United States, or he could say we're going to take a little bit more time and push it forward -- back further into the summer. All of this, of course, is taking place as Trump is trying to delay and prevent three other criminal cases, two over election interference and one over his handling of classified documents coming to trial before November's election. He really doesn't want to go to the electorate with the possibility of a criminal conviction.",

      "sentences": "It certainly looks like it, because the federal election interference trial has been put on hold because Trump has appealed to the Supreme Court with a sweeping claim of presidential immunity for acts that he took while he was in office. The court isn't due to hear that case until the end of April. We probably won't get a judgment until probably the end of June at the earliest. That makes it a very narrow window to get that case on before the election campaign really gathers pace, sort of early September.The classified documents case down in Florida is proceeding very slowly. There is all sorts of pretrial litigation. And it also appears that the Georgia election interference case, which has had its own set of delays, and has a really complicated racketeering case with many co-defendants, it looks unlikely even though the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis wants to push it ahead this summer. There are all sorts of things that could derail that. So, the hush money case, which a lot of people believe is the least potentially damaging to Trump, probably wouldn't entail jail time, even if he is convicted. That may be the first and potentially the only criminal trial to take place before the election.",
