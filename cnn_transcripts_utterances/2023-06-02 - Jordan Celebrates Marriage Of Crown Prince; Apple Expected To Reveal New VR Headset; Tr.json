Homeowners in the state pay private insurers about $6,000 a year. That compares to a national average of $1,700. You know, hurricanes are only part of the problem. Regional and local insurers say they are struggling due to frivolous lawsuits and excess claims.Looking at markets around the world right now, the Hang Seng closed up four percent. That's the biggest one-day gain in three months. The rally led by news that China may unveil stimulus to boost its faltering recovery. European markets are also higher this morning. On Wall Street, stock index futures also moving up. Investors yesterday cheered a vote to raise the debt ceiling. That and the thinking on Wall Street this week if the Fed will pause its interest rate hikes this month. The debt ceiling is resolved but not before the drama pushed up mortgage rates to their highest level since November. A 30-year fixed- rate mortgage is now 6.79 percent.

I said manufacturing, but I also point to finance under the weight of higher interest rates in terms of the mortgage market, information tech. We've seen those big headlines coming out of the tech industry.

And talking to some of the residents here they say that when the wind and the rain picks up it almost gives them a sense of PTSD because of what happened here eight months ago. You'll remember Hurricane Ian devastated this very area.And that is why we came on location because yesterday was the start of hurricane season and now we're facing the prospects of what could potentially be another tropical storm, but that is looking very unlikely with the latest update. The graphics you'll see -- the storm system just to my west. It's about 280 miles to my west with the Gulf of Mexico. Directly behind me you can see what was left of the Fort Myers beach pier completely left in shambles from Hurricane Ian. So that is why there's so much interest behind this particular storm. Thirty-five-mile-per-hour winds. It's still a tropical depression. The good news is this system is expected to dive south and stay away from the Florida peninsula. But what it's going to do is it's going to actually help enhance some of the shower and thunderstorm activity across Florida once again today, so the potential for localized flooding is real. We have a marginal risk of flash flooding across this region -- another one to three inches, especially in some of those stalled out storms that form. But let's broaden the view and show you kind of what's going on across the rest of the country because there are other areas of flash flooding that we're concerned about today, mainly across the Texas Panhandle and throughout central Montana. Two different storm systems there but bottom line, what you need to know we have a potential there for flash flooding. A moderate risk there that we're keeping a very close eye on. Two to four inches of rain possible in an already saturated environment means more flooding. So, active and busy start to the hurricane season, Christine.",
