The deal, which was announced on Monday, would resolve a lawsuit brought by a Jane Doe last year.In the lawsuit, the victim alleges that the bank enabled Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by turning a blind eye to a number of red flags. Among them, large cash withdrawals, as much as $750,000 in one year. Authorities allege it was those cash withdrawals that Epstein used to pay the underage girls and the recruiters who found them. David Boies, a lawyer for one of the victims, said that it was a great day for survivors of Epstein and for justice. He said he expects more than 100 survivors to seek compensation under this deal. Now, the deal still requires the approval of a federal judge, and as part of the settlement, JPMorgan will not admit or deny any wrongdoing. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
