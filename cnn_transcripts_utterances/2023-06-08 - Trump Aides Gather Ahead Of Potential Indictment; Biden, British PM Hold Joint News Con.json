You're looking at live pictures right now from two podiums where we are anticipating the two leaders. This follows the first meeting in the Oval Office between the two since Sunak took office summit of -- amid a bit of political turmoil in the U.K. We will, of course, bring this news conference live as it happens.But first, right now Donald Trump and a small group of aides are gathering at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. It comes as sources tell us the Justice Department has officially informed the former president that he is a target in the classified documents probe. This, the strongest signal yet that he could soon be indicted.",

They're circulating talking points as well, attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith.We have CNN's Katelyn Polantz outside the federal courthouse in Miami where there has been a flurry of activity.

Katelyn, what more are you learning?KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Boris, we are watching and waiting to see if there was some sort of combination of this special counsel investigation that's been going on for more than a year. We knew that there was this great amount of grand jury activity behind closed doors as investigators were pulling in all kinds of witnesses who were around Donald Trump, had conversations with him, were at Mar-a-Lago after he left the presidency, and particularly leading up to that moment where the FBI did the search of Mar-a-Lago and found more than a hundred classified records in rooms, including Donald Trump's private office. And so, as we watch, we are watching the federal courthouse particularly because there's been grand jury activity two days in a row here. This is not the court where this originated. We had seen so much happening in the federal court in Washington, DC, where the grand jury also heard testimony about it. But just yesterday, a witness came in, who was a spokesperson for Donald Trump, still someone in his close community of advisors, and that person is very likely to have testified about statements Donald Trump wanted to make after he wanted to say that he turned everything over to the National Archives just a year after he left the presidency, but had not at that point. And now today, we are seeing prosecutors. They're milling about, they're getting snacks, they're still inside the building. The grand jury, we believe is in today in that -- we are seeing the prosecutors around the grand jury area. But there is no additional information other than this target letter that we are confirming exists, and that was given to Donald Trump and his legal team. The sort of thing that happens at the very end of an investigation, Boris.",

And you know, carried it out at times the correct way when it suited him.But what's really interesting here is this is unique in the sense that this person has talked to prosecutors in both investigations. And really drew a colorful distinction between the line of questioning and the focus of those two investigations. So, while prosecutors were really aggressively focused on securing firsthand testimony and firsthand you know evidence about conversations with Trump, Biden, and prosecutors are more interested in logistics. They're interested in more of the mechanics of how documents were packed and moved to Delaware. So, some interesting insight and a rare insight into the comparison between the two investigations.",

They've argued that there was a standing declassification order. They said that he could declassify things with his mind. They've also alternatively argued that he had no idea that any of these things were packed in boxes.But just last month, one of his current attorneys, Jim Trusty, told CNN this.

But at the end of his presidency, he relied on the constitutional authority as commander in chief, which is to take documents and take them to Mar-a-Lago while still president as he was at the time and to effectively declassify and personalize them.He talked about declassifying them, but he didn't need to. And if you look at the Constitution, you look at the Presidential Records Act, there is absolutely no basis for saying that bureaucracy rules and the president doesn't have the authority entrusted in him by the voters to possess and to declassify and to hold on to document.

But what's so interesting about Zach's reporting is it his expert is completely undercutting that confusing explanation. Saying, look, he was well aware of the process, he followed it, he should have continued to follow it. So, that's one of the reasons this is so significant. Clearly, prosecutors are not buying really anything that the defense team is selling in the court of public opinion.",

You have a former president receiving this letter indicating that he's a target, not just the subject, a target of this investigation.

I think most legal experts would say with the many signals we've received over the last few weeks, it's extraordinarily likely that he's going to be indicted, that you know, go back to the battles over piercing attorney-client privilege, which required the prosecutors to go in front of a federal judge and prove at least to make a prima facia case that the -- that former President Trump had used his attorney to commit a crime. Once you've made a showing of proof like that in federal court, in front of a judge who agrees with it, it's almost impossible to imagine walking back from that cliff and saying, we're not going to go forward with an indictment.",

But some of the things you would look for are exactly what you're seeing in Miami.There's clearly been testimony taken in different grand juries, the one here in DC, now we have witnesses appearing in Miami. Wherever they are going to be asked to vote, that grand jury has to be read or give it -- given a chance to read the testimony that was taken in the other grand jury. After that happens, the prosecutors put on essentially an informal kind of closing argument where they summarize the case and then they read the indictment to the grand jurors before they ask them to go vote on it. So, there's a fair amount of logistical kind of mechanics that have to happen before the decision is made.",

There's all kinds of protocols already in place.Now, if this was to be brought down in Miami, in the initial appearances in Miami, there will need to be a plan to accommodate the former president to account for any potential security threats, protests, there is also potentially the option of a virtual appearance. Now, unlike what we saw in Manhattan where there were still photographers allowed in the courtroom and there actually cameras in the hall of the courtrooms that Trump got his \"photo op,\" that's not going to happen in federal court. So, it'll be interesting to see how they weigh this -- these you know, federal criminal charges, new cameras in the court, if it still is appealing to come in person, or if they'll potentially if he is charged try to do something virtually. Because it's extremely complicated. Like you said, we are once again as we are so often with former President Trump just in a completely unprecedented situation.",
