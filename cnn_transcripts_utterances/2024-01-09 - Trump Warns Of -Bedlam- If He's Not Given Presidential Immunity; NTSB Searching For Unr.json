All they have left is the fig leaf of a negative inference from the impeachment judgment clause, which makes plain that if he is impeached and convicted, he's also subject to criminal jurisdiction and prosecution. There's -- it's silent as to, you know, a president who's impeached and not convicted. It's silent as to presidents who are not impeached.

But, you know, it is disturbing. As a practical political matter, you were raising the question before about why he would show up. I said for a long time, you know, in the 19th century, we had front porch campaigns. This for Trump at least in the term is going to be a courthouse steps campaign. He thinks there's political value in showing up for the court because for his base, his aroused base, they believe that he's being persecuted and targeted for political reasons.

He also owned at least 15 vehicles and had access to two private jets.Born in Brooklyn to working class parents, he actually never received a college degree. But that didn't stop him from getting a job teaching mathematics at the prestigious Dalton School in New York City. It was there he tutored the daughter of Bernstein chairman Alan Greenberg and wound up getting a job at the investment bank. There, he met billionaire Leslie Wexner, who ran L Brands and Victoria Secret. And Epstein not only became his money adviser, but was given power of attorney over finances. In the '80s, Epstein began operating his own money management firms. In the early '90s, Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite would become his Epstein's lifelong companion. For years, the pair would host billionaires, politicians and celebrities. But in 2005, Epstein was accused of paying a 14-year-old girl for sex and was criminally charged in 2006. Epstein was charged with Florida state prostitution crimes. He pleaded guilty in 2008, served 13 months in a jail work release program and registered as a sex offender. Despite his criminal conviction, Epstein and Maxwell continued to mingle with the rich and famous and continued to recruit young girls for massages, a code word for sexual services according to the court documents. But 11 years later, Epstein's legal troubles caught up with him again. Wexner wrote that Epstein, quote, misappropriated vast sums of money from Wexner and his family more than a decade ago, over $46 million, according to the \"The Wall Street Journal\". And in July 2019, a federal indict indictment charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.",
