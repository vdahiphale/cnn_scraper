It's not looking to crush its military capabilities, which are considerable.What Israel is trying to do, and it has said that very, very explicitly, it wants Hezbollah to stop shelling, to stop launching rockets at Israeli communities in the north, and so far Hezbollah is refusing to do that. They say that they will continue their assaults on Israel as long as the war in Gaza continues. They show no intention, no sign of aiming to stop their attacks on Israel, as long as the war in Gaza continues. But Israel has made a decision after almost a year of shelling from Hezbollah that they are not going to allow that to continue.

There is a great fear that if there's a change in government in the United States, if Republicans, if Donald Trump wins the election, American support for Ukraine is going to change. And I think there's a sense that it's time to Trump-proof support for Ukraine and we're seeing that in Europe, we're seeing that in other places where there's more of an impetus to help Ukraine ahead of the elections, ahead of the January 20th, so that it can fortify itself and be in a stronger position should Trump become the next president again.",

McMaster, obviously raised serious questions in his book.They are conspicuous by their absence, and it's a question of whether we're going to hear from them before November. But I do think that all of these kind of testimonials and validations are really about creating a permission structure, primarily for right of center men who would -- who have hesitations about Trump, but tend to be skeptical of Democrats on issues like national security and keeping the country safe. This, you know, everything is a -- is trench warfare in our politics. There are no big blitzkrieg movements.

One thing we do know is that it's a remarkable step for federal investigators to go ahead and search the homes of the interim commissioner just took place on Friday. And what our law enforcement sources are telling us is that they were looking for documents that the commissioner may have held on to from his previous positions in law enforcement.As you mentioned, he worked for the FBI for several years. They also tell us that this latest search warrant is not related to any of the four federal investigations that are currently looking at different parts of City Hall. Now, Commissioner Donlon issued a statement confirming part of this information late last night, and I want to read you a portion of it. He said that federal authorities \"took materials that came into my possession approximately 20 years ago and are unrelated to my work with the New York City Police Department. This is not a department matter and the department will not be commenting.\" So, there is a real effort in that statement by the commissioner to separate this latest search warrant of his homes and any other investigations, which include an investigation that's looking into the NYPD. And I think that that is a significant distinction here. We should also mention that Tom Donlon held several positions with the FBI including working at the Joint Terrorism Task Force here in New York. He worked at the Department of Homeland Security here in New York. So it is possible that maybe he has some sort of classified documents from that time. We are still trying to understand is why this is happening now and why they're bringing it up in this moment. It is certainly a headache for City Hall. They've haven't said much about this, only that they expect their employees to follow the law. But even though it is not related to these other investigations, it's still part of the many questions that they will continue to have to answer over the next several days. Fred?",

Constellation Energy announced that beginning in 2028, it will revive one of its reactors to sell energy to Microsoft. The software giant plans to use the electricity to power its growing AI program. This is part of a move by some businesses to turn to nuclear energy as a zero-carbon energy source. But some environmental groups have raised concerns about the amount of waste it creates.Joining us now as CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. Bill, good to see you. So, what do you make of this decision to reopen Three Mile Island?",

But now, generations later, you look back and realize that the harm to humans during that meltdown was negligible.And now there is such voracious appetite for clean energy that now technology companies like Microsoft are driving nuclear energy's resurgence in many ways. Amazon also just signed a contract with another nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan is trying to get a nuclear power plant revived there as well. It's never really been done. And there's a lot of questions about getting federal subsidies to bring this plant back online and using it for all that electricity for one customer instead of 800,000 families like it once did. The company says that electricity will go on to the grid and they'll just take their share. But it is a stunning turn of events when I just want to think about nuclear energy where it's going, but it has a lot to do with AI. We thought bitcoin and cyber currencies would take a lot of juice. AIs orders of magnitude more. And so, anything, whether it's Icelandic, geothermal or new kinds of small, modular Bill Gates's style nuclear reactors out west, there is a huge demand, and this will drive us to hold across (ph).",

So this is not anything that can be reversed.
