      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now, we are following two major breaking news stories, regaining power and reigniting fears. In just hours, Congress will meet to certify President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 election win four years to the day after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol, smashing windows and doors, brutally attacking police officers and shocking the nation. Plus, a deadly winter blast slamming the East Coast, more than 55 million people are caught in its grip here in Washington, D.C. We could get more snow than in the last two years combined. Despite the weather, though, House Speaker Mike Johnson says the election results will be certified today no matter what. CNN chief Congressional correspondent Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill for us. Manu, today marks exactly four years since the insurrection on January 6th. Take us what take us through what today looks like.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it actually feels a lot different than what happened four years ago. Just walking through the Capitol four years ago, there really was not the amount of security that there is at this moment, really all over the Capitol security personnel, officers, law enforcement, as well as big steel fences all surrounding the Capitol, a much different approach, even as we are not expecting any significant demonstrations outside the Capitol.And we'll see something happened much different on the House floor than we saw four years ago, and going back to what's been a routine event really through the history of the republic up until January 6th, 2021, when things change. And one big reason why that this is going to be more of a routine event is that in the aftermath of the violence that occurred on January 6th, 2021, Congress took steps to make it harder for Congress to overturn an election result back before then, the law allowed for one House member and one senator to vote to overturn any individual state's election results. They could, by having one member from each chamber, actually could force a vote in both chambers of Congress to get rid of that state's certified electoral result. But, in the aftermath of 2021, Congress required now one-fifth of both the House and the Senate. That is a threshold for the number of members that have to agree to force a vote to overturn a state election result. That much higher threshold will make it much harder for anyone to try to get rid of an electoral result that was certified by individual states. And also Congress took steps to make sure that the vice president's role is ceremonial. Vice President Harris will be presiding over her own defeat here. She can't do what Donald Trump wanted Mike Pence to do four years ago, which was simply reject the electoral results, send it back to the states as Donald Trump suggested. Of course, Pence resisted that approach. Then Congress took steps saying that that can't happen. The vice president simply cannot do that. So all as a result, and Democrats are not expecting, Jim, to object in the House floor, which means this could go pretty quickly this afternoon when they meet, then Donald Trump will be well on his way to the White House come January 20th, Jim.",

We value everyone's vote. We cherish elections. We want and we encourage everyone to participate, whether we agree with them or not. So, this is a much different day. You know, Jim, I remembering that day just before we actually were ordered to put on our gas masks, I witnessed because I was sitting way at the first row at the top. One of our security officers was violently pushed into the gallery, and thank God that he was able to maneuver and balance himself and he was able to push back that aggressor back into the hall. And soon after that, they locked that door. And that is when we began looking for weapons and anything to help defend ourselves on that horrible day.

Congresswoman, thanks so much for your time.And let's make sure we take a moment to remember the bravery of the police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6th. Their courage helped safeguard American democracy after Trump's lies about the 2020 election incited a violent insurrection, officers like Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, Harry Dunn, and Michael Fanone, who have all been on this program, they deserve all of our gratitude, as do the many, many other officers who were at the Capitol that day. CNN Political Commentators Maria Cardona and Brad Todd join me now. Maria, today's election certification comes four years to the day after Trump supporters tried to overturn our democracy. Stephen Collinson here at CNN wrote something very interesting. He said, Trump will send a message down through the ages that a president who refuses to accept the result of a free and fair election and who incites an attack on the Capitol can get away with it and regain power.

And I don't think history will judge him well. I do agree with Stephen that, clearly, voters decided to prioritize the economy before they did the dangers of democracy but I also believe, Jim, two things. First one is I'm a huge believer in that things happen for a reason, and it might very well have been that if Kamala Harris had won, there could have been violence, because Donald Trump would have promoted it, because Donald Trump would have urged it.And the second thing is I think Americans trust Democrats to be the ones to protect that democracy. Because as we see today, we are going back to what a day like this should be not violent, not deadly, not bloody, but something that is pro forma, almost boring, right? That's what it should be. That's what Democrats are going to demonstrate today that it is. So, I think history will judge Donald Trump, not in a good light in terms of somebody who understands and supports and respects democracy. But I do think that for now, we know what voters prioritized in this election.",

However, voters, they punished him for it. That's why he was behind Ron DeSantis by 20 points until Alvin Bragg indicted him.

      "sentences": "So, Trump's lawyers have asked the judge who has been overseeing this trial to now postpone the sentencing that he just set for this Friday. The reasons, they say they're going to appeal the judge's two previous decisions. One was issued on Friday where the judge dismissed Trump's claims to have the whole case thrown out because he's president-elect, claiming that he had immunity, and also a decision last month where the judge said that the Supreme Court's decision on immunity did not have the same impact on the trial that Trump had wanted because the judge said that all of the acts during the trial and that made up the allegations, the criminal allegations, were official acts. So, because they are moving to appeal that, they're saying that a stay, a postponement of the sentencing should automatically happen.Now, they're saying if the judge doesn't view it that way, they're still asking him to put the sentencing on hold so that they can make these legal challenges, these appellate challenges. And in part, they're saying that the Supreme Court's decision issued over the summer actually includes that in that. Now, it remains to be seen how the judge is going to view that, so they are moving simultaneously filing these appeals with the appellate courts and also asking the trial judge to now postpone the sentencing that he had just scheduled. Trump's team writing in a statement today, President Trump's legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.'s witch hunt, the Supreme Court's historic decision on immunity, the state Constitution of New York and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed. They're also arguing to the judge that there's no reason to rush this sentencing. You'll remember on Friday, the judge said that he would sentence Trump on Friday. He also said at the time it would be an unconditional discharge, meaning that there would be no legal punishment for Trump, even though the sentencing would happen just about ten days before his inauguration.

And for that reason, I guess, after a holiday break, the prime minister has decided to resign as party leader. What does that mean, Jim? That means in the next hour, we'll hear that he will step aside as party leader, but continue as prime minister in the next few months. And that will set off what I'm sure will be a fierce contest to lead the Liberal Party into the next election. I will say that Pierre Poilievre, the conservative leader, is saying pretty much bring it on. He has found resonance in the MAGA base. And, you know, Donald Trump, the president-elect, has been trolling Justin Trudeau, even though he went down there to Mar-a-Lago to try and settle some issues. He's been calling Justin Trudeau the governor of the 51st state of Canada and threatening to impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada into the United States. Given all that and some political scandals, the fact that his deputy prime minister and his finance minister quit in the last few weeks with a scathing resignation letter, you get the picture here, Jim.

This really is shaping up to be the worst snowstorm here in D.C. in at least three years, maybe even longer than that. And so there is this snow warning in effect until well into tonight.There are also emergency declarations across at least six states impacting tens of millions of people. You mentioned all the way west of Missouri, east out here to Virginia, Maryland and here in D.C. It really feels like this region now, as the snow starts accumulating, it's sort of frozen. We know almost all schools are shut down right now across this region. Federal government offices are closed right now. Streets are quiet. People aren't commuting. Most of what we're seeing around here outside the U.S. Capitol are law enforcement vehicles, dozens, if not hundreds of them. And that is because, as we know, Congress getting ready to certify the presidential election a little bit later today. And law enforcement, both local and federal, Jim, really on high alert right now, not just because of what happened four years ago on January 6th, but also that recent attack in New Orleans. The local police department, MPB Metropolitan Police, they're fully deployed right now, fully activated. Every officer in the city on the street working 12 hour shifts every single day. And so it will be interesting to see how does the storm affect that.
