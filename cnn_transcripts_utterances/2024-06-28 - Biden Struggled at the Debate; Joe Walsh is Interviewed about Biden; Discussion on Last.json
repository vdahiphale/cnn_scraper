He also says, \"I refuse to join for the Democratic vultures on Biden's shoulder after the debate. No one knows more than me that a rough debate is not the sum total of the person and their record.\"Now, on the subject of Pennsylvania, just moments ago we spoke to the governor of that commonwealth, Josh Shapiro. Listen to what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Here's the bottom line. Joe Biden had a bad debate night. But Donald Trump was a bad president. I think we have a responsibility right now to ask ourselves what kind of nation we want to be. I think the answer is clear on that. And then we've got to stop worrying and start working.

And even further, I'm told that the president is still committed to a second debate in September, which is currently scheduled for September 10th and hosted by ABC News, much along the lines of the rules of the debate that was hosted last night. Now, the adviser that I spoke with said that they're not putting too much stock in that conversation last night and that many of the staffers on the campaign and in the White House also worked on President Obama's reelection in 2012. And they tried to draw the parallel to that first debate that was a very low performance for President Obama. Even he would call it a stinker. And they said, if you had believed the pundits in the wake of that debate, Mitt Romney would be president - would have been president after that. But the - of course the big differences is, in the wake of that debate, no one in Obama's own party was calling for him to resign the office of president. And that is the moment that Democrats find themselves in right now. The mood that I'm hearing from Democrats who are texting this morning is described as fatalistic behind the scenes. And while we've seen some of these public pronouncements from members of the president's own party, there is still so much consternation about what happens next and whether the performance aspect of last night can even be fixed going forward because, if not, that September debate is likely just to be a repeat of what we saw on stage last night, putting Democrats in the same position they're in right now, even closer to election day. That being said, Biden himself did not seem to be fazed by it. He was asked at a Waffle House following the debate how he viewed his performance and whether he had any concerns about it. Here's how the president responded then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
