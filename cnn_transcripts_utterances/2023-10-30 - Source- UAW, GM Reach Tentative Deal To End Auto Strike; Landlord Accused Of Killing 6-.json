Joseph Czuba pleaded not guilty today in court. This was a brief hearing. The 6-year-old boy who was stabbed to death, stabbed more than a two dozen times, his family was in court today. His father was there as well as other close friends and family members. It was so painful, Brianna and Boris, because they had to relive the facts. Prosecutors once again ticked through how this day happened. That Saturday, the Saturday of this attack, began like any other day, according to his mother, who was also injured in this attack. She was stabbed around a dozen times. Joseph Czuba, according to the mother, told police he had been growing increasingly agitated about what he saw going on in the Middle East, about the conflict in the Middle East. The Saturday that this happened, he confronted her about that. She said let's pray for peace. And then she told police he attacked her shortly after that, just moments later. Here in court today, again, his family was there. It was extremely painful. One woman sitting in the gallery covering her face appeared to be silently weeping. Other family members spoke with us briefly after the hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I thought that was significant. What do you think? PLEITGEN: I think it's significant. And I think it's also something, Wolf, that's being picked up inside Israel as well to describe what happened on the ground there in Makhachkala. It's quite interesting, there was an interview earlier today with the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog. He was speaking to a German publication called \"Bild.\" He also said that, to him, it looked like a pogrom. And it was very troubling. He said it was very troubling to the Israelis to see that as well. And certainly, something that had a chilling effect on folks from Israel but, of course, on Jewish folks from around the world. One of the interesting things, Wolf, that just before we went to air that we picked up is that the Israelis have actually already reacted to all of this. And the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Israeli National Security Council have now put the northern Caucuses region the highest travel alert for Israelis. Four out of four from there. Obviously, after this incident, certainly, one which is having a chilling effect. And you're absolutely right, the Israelis and the United States calling on the Russians to ensure the safety of Jews and, of course, Israelis specifically -- Wolf?",

Much more coming up from me later tonight in \"THE SITUATION ROOM,\" 6:00 p.m. Eastern. I'm still in Tel Aviv. Including my special conversation, a very moving conversation with two families whose loved ones have been kidnapped by Hamas. One was at the Nova Music Festival when he was kidnapped. His family did not know if he survived until an unknown phone number sent them Hamas video of him. I also spoke to the granddaughter of an 85-year-old. She was kidnapped from her home in the Nir Oz Kibbutz and was last seen in a golf cart in Gaza surrounded by Hamas terrorists. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

O'TOOLE: Well, the takeaway is really critical because there wasn't just one red flag, there were multiple. The one red flag we've seen over and over again for the last quarter century, 25 years, is the one called \"leakage.\" These are statements that the individual will make to other people, whether it's a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a fellow worker, a neighbor, or a family member about what they intend to do. And leakage has got to be taken very seriously, even if, at the end of the day, it's determined that this person doesn't have access to weapons or was just joking. That leakage is just absolutely critical. And then you compound that with someone who does have mental health issues, and then you compound that with someone who has access to weapons, that leakage takes on far more significance.",

O'TOOLE: There's no way to listen to those words and just have a magical resolution to it. So, in threat assessment, we're trained to actually do a deep dive into every case where we see leakage. And that means going far beyond what the person has said. So, we've got the leakage, and then you start talking to other people. He had already spent time in a mental health facility out of concerns for what his behavior might be. That was already present. Then you have access to firearms, some of which he obtained very recently. So, as the pieces come together, this individual becomes more and more concerning. And that's what happens when you check out leakage and other red-flag behaviors. You start to see whether the picture falls apart or whether or not it really takes on a life of its own.",
