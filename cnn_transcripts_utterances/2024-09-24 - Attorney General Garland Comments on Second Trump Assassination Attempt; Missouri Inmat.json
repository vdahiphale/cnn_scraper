A Missouri inmate is set to die in just a matter of hours, even though the office that prosecuted him has asked for his murder conviction to be overturned, citing new evidence which could show he's innocent. Despite a flurry of appeals, Missouri's Supreme Court and the governor have refused to grant 55-year-old Marcellus Williams a stay of execution. CNN's Whitney Wild joins us now. Whitney, can you describe this new evidence and why, even with the prosecutor's office asking that this be overturned, this conviction, this execution seems to be proceeding?",

      "sentences": "If the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't intervene in the next few hours, Jim, that is what we expect will happen in Missouri tonight, that Marcellus Williams will be killed by lethal injection. And let me just walk you through the case here.So this case goes back to 2001. This is a more than two-decade fight to try to save Marcellus Williams from the death penalty. He was convicted in 1998 of the stabbing death of a woman named Felicia Gayle. He and his supporters and his family have been fighting, again, for two decades because he has adamantly maintained his innocence. And, in fact, Jim, the former Missouri governor, Eric Greitens, actually launched a commission to try to explore whether he is improperly on death row, improperly tried. That commission that was launched under Eric Greitens was disbanded under the current governor of Missouri, Michael Parson. Again, there have been a flurry of appeals in this case. And, in fact, over the weekend, in a pretty rare move, the St. Louis prosecutor, Wesley Bell, and Marcellus Williams' attorney, Jonathan Potts, filed this joint motion saying, look, there are two major issues here. And the first is that Marcellus Williams was denied his right to a fair trial when a former prosecutor on his first case struck a juror because that juror was Black and he believed looked like Marcellus Williams. That is a point that attorneys representing Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey disagree with. They say there was no racial bias there. And then further, Jim, the other piece of evidence that those supporting Marcellus Williams think exonerate him is this DNA evidence. And what they argue is that there would have been DNA evidence that would have exonerated Williams from this case. However, recent DNA testing showed that that murder weapon, the DNA was contaminated when law enforcement, a prosecutor and one of the investigators working on that case, handled that murder weapon with their hands and not with gloves. Again, this was more than two decades ago. The state attorney general's office arguing that that was an unintentional effect, that they didn't know enough about DNA at the time to maintain what we now would consider the integrity of that DNA. Either way, these were not arguments that the Missouri Supreme Court agreed with. Now, Marcellus Williams, as we know, very likely set to die at six o'clock central, his family, though, saying that they will be by his side.",

I wonder, Mercedes, what you think about what the Missouri Supreme Court said here, considering you have St. Louis prosecutors, right?This is not defense. Prosecutors who had argued that DNA testing could exclude Williams as the killer. But then you did have that argument fall apart last month when it turned out that the murder weapon had been contaminated with a former prosecutor, a former investigator's DNA. What do you think about what the court said here?",

When you look at the records that are kept of exonerations, there's also the question of whether a Black juror was wrongly excluded from the jury.Do you think that the Supreme Court looks at these things and intervenes or not?",

So there still is that plea to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution and remand it for further -- not further investigation, but a further hearing. That's what's being asked.Even in what was really extraordinary is that once even Attorney Bell had an agreement on the record where Williams had agreed to plea and have that plea then have a life sentence and stop the execution, that was stricken as well. So these are extraordinary circumstances -- Brianna. There's really no reason why this execution shouldn't be stayed, that these matters and the evidence that's being raised looked into. There really isn't anything that could validate the stay of this -- that could validate proceeding with the execution. When you have such extraordinary circumstances and such extraordinary evidence and the fact that you have both the prosecution and the defense are aligned and wanting to stay the execution. It is completely befuddling why this wasn't done.",

      "timeStamp": "15:40:00",

      "sentences": "Great question, Brianna. It certainly calls into question the legitimacy. Think about it.Since the capital punishment has been on the books since 1973, there have been 200 individuals that were convicted and placed on death row that were later then exonerated. That's 200 lives that were spared because through the appellate process, they were able to actually establish that they were innocent of the crimes that they were convicted of. But how many others are we talking about that have been gone through this process and were absolutely innocent? And it goes back to the DNA evidence. The DNA evidence has so much evolved since the conviction of Marcellus Williams. And that's one of the issues that Prosecuting Attorney Bill raised, that at the time, the DNA evidence that was at that time was not as sophisticated as it is currently. And that alone should allow be the compelling reason why this execution be stayed, further investigation be done. But at the end of the day, really have to question the legitimacy of capital punishment when you have circumstances like this, where you can't even stop it when there are such compelling arguments to stop the execution.",
