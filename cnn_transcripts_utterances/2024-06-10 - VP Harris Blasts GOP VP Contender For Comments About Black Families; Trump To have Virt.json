He is scheduled to do a pre- sentencing interview ahead of next month's sentencing in his criminal hush money case.Trump will do the meeting virtually. He'll be there at Mar-a-Lago with his attorney, Todd Blanche, by his side. And during the routine interview, a defendant typically answers questions about their conviction and other basic background information. It forms part of a report that the probation department then sends to the judge ahead of the sentencing. Let's talk more about this with former U.S. attorney, Michael Moore. Because, Michael, this could impact a lot. What happens with Trump? How much does the judge usually take into account this report? And in particular, the fact that the probation officer is going to ask Trump about his convictions and Trump it's really not shown much remorse with them. How is that going to play out?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, I'm glad to be with you.This is an important report. And I think that's why you see the president agree -- the former president agree to participate in it with his lawyer, even though they're doing it remotely. And that's expected, frankly, because it's just a logistical nightmare to move him around and get him to New York to meet face-to-face with a probation officer. So this information will be relied upon by the judge. The judge takes a great emphasis or places great emphasis on what the probation department will tell him about Trump, about things that were said. It's a chance for Trump to help himself or hurt himself. He can help himself if he says, look, I maintain that I did not do anything wrong. I'm going to appeal. That's this is a normal process. He won't be punished for that. He would be punished for things if he continues to be defiant about the judicial process, about how there was nothing that went right, about maybe specific witness comments, or certainly if he made any threats toward people. Those kinds of things the judge, I think, would frown upon. But I do think it's a chance for him to say some things that would help him. A lot of this is history gathering. And the probation department doesn't know -- if you think about just a normal criminal defendant, they don't know as much about that person as they know about the former president. We know pretty much everything about him. Some stuff we -- he may say we believe some stuff we don't. So it's not going to be -- this is not as important about digging into his background as it is going to be sort of painting an image of the person who is going to be coming before the court, ultimately, be sentenced soon on these felony charges.",

You've got some of these that stretch from New Mexico all the way back into northern California.You've got heat advisories, excessive heat watches and warnings for several of these areas, and that does include the city of Phoenix. Now, what's interesting about Phoenix is it's not just one or two days. They've had 14 consecutive days of those temperatures being in the triple digits. And it's not going to end any time soon. They're also not alone. When you look at Las Vegas, they've had 11 consecutive June days of those temperatures above triple-digits. But when you look at the forecast, there is a 70 percent chance of them maintaining those triple-digit temperatures for at least the next several days, maybe even a few weeks. The record for them is 25. They may very well get to that record. The more interesting thing, too, about Las Vegas is normally this time of year, their average is 98. They shouldn't even have one day of triple-digit temperatures. But when you look at the forecast, every single one of the next seven days, those highs are expected to be in the triple digits. Now, a lot of that is this heat dome right here. You can see all of these areas under it. That's where the focus is really going to be for those temperatures that are not just above average by a few degrees but, in some cases, record-breaking temperatures. Now for some areas, it's going to be an up and down. Take Sacramento, for example, still above today, really above Tuesday, and then we start to see that coming back down on Wednesday. But Phoenix, Vegas and Palm Springs all looking at those temperatures that continue -- continue to go up over the next couple of days.",

For example, she has just had a record-breaking college career. She's made an incredible start in the league as a rookie. Her stats for a rookie are off the charts. And of course, we all know that she has single-handedly transformed the interest in the WNBA in just a matter of weeks. She is, no doubt about it, the most famous and, arguably, one of the most talented female basketball players in the world right now. And arguably, she is one of the most famous female athletes in the world right now. Then there is the other camp, which says, look, this is a team game. You can't make it all about just one player. Remember she has just had an insane college season, no break leading into the WNBA. Now, she's on a grind of a schedule and maybe a few weeks will do her some good. So maybe this is actually for the benefit of Caitlin Clark and she will be in it one day. And of course, the next games are in L.A. in 2028. Those who say it's a snub would say that's her choice to make. If she doesn't want to go to the Olympics because she needs a break, let her make that decision. But perhaps that decision has been made for her. Caitlin Clark has spoken about it. This is her perspective. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
