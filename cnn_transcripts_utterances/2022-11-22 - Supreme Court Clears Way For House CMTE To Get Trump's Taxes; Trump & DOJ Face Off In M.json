The judges raising concerns about why a special master was put in this particular situation when the search of Mar-a- Lago has never been deemed to be unlawful concerns about the precedent that this could set and that other criminal defendants will also ask for this kind of thing that could delay their investigations. And there was even one moment where a judge reprimanded one of Trump's attorneys for referring to what happened at Mar-a-Lago as a, quote, \"rate.\" Now, we are not going to get a decision today or possibly anytime soon, but this is a very significant case where this ongoing investigation.

I mean, he's fought so hard against it.

We know in the past, Joe Biden has waited a very long time to decide when he wanted to run for the presidency in 2016. I believe he waited so long, he actually couldn't get into the race anymore. So this is not unusual.I think the question that's not being asked out loud is when people are concerned about this, they don't just sort of follow up and say, and of course, we would support a Kamala Harris run or something like that. There's a kind of blank space there as everyone waits for his answer. And I'm going to be curious to see how the answers from people who are asked that question kind of evolve over the next couple months.",

And now the state party along with national Republicans are doing all that they can imploring the state Supreme Court to get involved. They argue that that it unfairly privileges Democrats.But listen, early voting is already underway. Counties are figuring this out. And they have an optics problem here because Democrats are arguing the folks that vote early are largely African American, right, are largely working-class folks who maybe can't get to polling locations during the week. And you have Republicans very forcefully pushing against this. It's also a question of strategy here. They're spending so much time fighting this Saturday voting, which is just in a few days, just a few days after Thanksgiving, rather than I think working on building an infrastructure or shoring up an infrastructure to ensure that their voters participate in this Saturday voting as well. We know at least two counties where in Walton, more than 70 percent of those counties during the general election voted for Herschel Walker. So if those counties are providing early voting, why not spend this time, making sure that Republicans, they are actually participate in the Saturday process.",

They're not quite sure about their Republican voter and how they'll turn out and how those show up.And if that independent swing voter will actually say, you know what, fine, this time around.

So a lot of work is happening behind the scenes that the public may not be seeing, but that are very critical to this case. I also asked about this incident being targeted, because that is the -- what they said initially. And they still believe that it was. And the communications director told me that that is partly because two roommates in the house survived the attack. And that if the attack were a bit more non discriminant, that it's a potential that everyone could have died. I also asked about the ongoing threat to the community because the initial messaging was a little confusing to the public about whether there was a further threat.
