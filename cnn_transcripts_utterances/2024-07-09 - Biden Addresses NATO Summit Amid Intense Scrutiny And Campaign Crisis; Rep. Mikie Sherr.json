And that is the reality that he now faces as he pledges to go on with the nomination.Today, obviously, this was potentially a very big day for the president as a test here. Did the House Democratic Caucus get together? Did the Senate Democratic Caucus get together? And the news here is what didn't happen, which is that there was no rush to the microphones en masse, all these Democrats calling for Biden to go. No. The effort to push him out of this nomination is currently failing. That is where that story is. So, I don't think Joe Biden's in balance here, oh, is he going to be the nominee or not? Joe Biden has made it pretty clear he's the nominee, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as of this moment, Wolf, make pretty clear that they think he's going to be the nominee, too. The problem is, those same Democrats who think he's going to be the nominee, many of them don't think he can win the race against Donald Trump, and they are very concerned about what it means for their own chances.

And so that's one really big part of it.And when you listen to Senator Chuck Schumer in Manu's report there, as you see him, Senator Chuck Schumer is incredibly loquacious. He has never wanted to really hold his thoughts to him. And I watched that press conference. He only took three questions. He would not elaborate at all on his position on President Biden. He would just say, I'm with Joe, I'm with Joe, I'm with Joe. He said it three times. But that was all he said, really.

That's why President Biden immediately on Monday morning was working so hard to heat off these defections, so having one more House Democrat there. But I think it's interesting also to look at the, the, who's getting behind. President Biden at this point, because if you look on the Hill, especially in the House, it's Hispanic and black Democrats who are lining up and are very unified behind him for the most part.

But I think in terms of what Kaitlan is saying, just in the movement in the last 12 days and the president going on a much more offensive posture in the last 48 hours seems to be keeping at bay some mass defection within his own party.One thing about Mikie Sherrill that I think is really interesting, back in 2019, you remember it was these national security freshman Democrats, Mikie Sherrill, one of them, that sort of moved Nancy Pelosi off the dime to move towards that first impeachment of Trump. It took them a long while to join their more progressive Democratic colleagues. This wasn't in a group this time. Mikie Sherrill was alone in this moment doing that.

Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. What was the mood like inside that closed door meeting earlier today up on Capitol Hill? And was there a consensus about President Biden's candidacy from your House Democratic colleagues? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): Yes, we can't quote from me, but I would call it respectful and thoughtful. And I wouldn't make too much of a single meeting, but think of this as a process. This is as close to political post-traumatic trauma that I've seen. And every member has to process that a different way and decide what's best to do. And that takes a little while.

This is -- the situation is chaotic and that's good news for him, the fact, I think, the Republicans want Joe Biden to stay on the ballot. So, I think that's very telling about what's taking place right now. But, again, I tell you, don't discount polling. It's what all of us look at so much in making these analytical decisions. It's going south in a hurry. I'm not a pundit, it's getting into the cross tabs, but it dramatically affects all those close races in the House and Senate. I just encourage my colleagues, this isn't a time to think about this as being loyal or disloyal or friends. This is pragmatic politics at a time when our very fragile democracy is at great risk.",

Now, the Ukrainians say that the death toll currently stands at two, while dozens of people have been wounded in this attack. They say one of the fortunate things that happened is there was a missile alert, and the staff of the children that were being treated here actually got evacuated to a bomb shelter. The staff then immediately came out and started sifting through the rubble. Now all of this is currently a cleanup operation. But you can see just how powerful that blast must have been. This is one of the floors of that building, and here it's evident that it just flat packed down. Those are some of the supporting beams.And the Ukrainians say that there will be a response to this. The Russians claim this might have been a stray Ukrainian interceptor that hit the building. The Ukrainians having none of it, saying it was a Russian missile, saying this is an attack on Ukraine's healthcare system and also on Ukraine's children.

We saw them have early success around Kharkiv partly -- not exclusively, but partly because we were slow to get security assistance to Ukraine because of the delay in passage of the supplemental. But once that supplemental passed, we served security assistance to Ukraine, worked with our allies and partners, and we've seen them stabilize the front and Russia stopped making major gains all along the frontlines.Now, that's not to say Ukraine doesn't continue to need help. Of course, they do. We saw that yesterday with that brutal attack on a children's hospital, as well as other civilian sites in Ukraine. And that's why we continue to support them, including with the announcement the president made tonight that we are sending five strategic air defense systems to Ukraine, including Patriot batteries. These are batteries supplied by the United States and our allies and partners, and dozens over the coming months of tactical air defense systems. These are systems that can be deployed to protect Ukrainian cities and to protect Ukrainian troops on the frontline. And what I can tell you is that is the first announcement of security assistance that is being made over the course of the three days of the NATO summit here in Washington. It is not the last one. BLITZER: We heard President Biden just a little while ago, Matt, say that NATO is stronger than ever right now and Ukraine will prevail. But can world leaders trust President Biden in the long-term when they see him in this major political crisis right now here in the United States, and they potentially could have concerns, at least in private, about his fitness to serve another term?",

As long as President Biden is in office, he will continue to support Ukraine. We have made clear from the beginning that we have had Ukraine's back.But I also think it's important to note that there are clear, overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress that support Ukraine.
