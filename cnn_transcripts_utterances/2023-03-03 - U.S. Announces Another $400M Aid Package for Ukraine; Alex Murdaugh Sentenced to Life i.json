Jeff Zeleny at CPAC, at National Harbor, Maryland, thank you.While many Democrats are fuming about President Biden's surprise announcement that he would sign a Republican-led bill that would block a Washington, D.C., effort to overhaul the city's criminal code. The president's decision comes after House Democrats rejected the GOP bill last month, by a vote of 173-31, and after Biden previously said that he would oppose the measure. CNN's Tom Foreman is digging into what's actually in the D.C. crime law for us. So, Tom, what does this bill actually do, and why are so many lawmakers opposed?",

      "sentences": "OK. This is complicated, but let me make it simple here. D.C. wanted to rewrite its criminal code. It's been around for a long, long time. They spent a whole lot of time working on it and they came up with a new approach that was generally more progressive than punitive. Some of the measures they were talking about there are things that would sort of lessened the mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes that you might run into a doubt there, reduce the maximum sentence of crimes like robbery, and carjacking, and expand the requirements for jury trials and most misdemeanor cases.Initially, remember, D.C. laws can be overturned to the federal level. Initially, Joe Biden indicated the president that he would back what D.C. wanted to do. But then Republicans started making a lot of noise and said this is soft on crime, we can't have that. And then the president seemed to know about-face. This is his latest take on what's happening here. He said I support D.C. statehood and home rule, but I don't support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the mayor's objection, you might note, such as lowering penalties for carjackings. If the Senate votes to overturn what D.C. just did to rewrite their code, I'll sign it. And that has created an uproar among Democrats because there are Democrats out there who went on a ledge saying, no, no, we're with the president in opposing the Republicans and now he's not opposing them anymore. So, it seems those Democrats feel that they've been vulnerable, but they can be accused of being soft on crime. And just as importantly, Democrats are a long, long time, had said D.C. deserves statehood. D.C. should be allowed to make decisions like other places. Some of them see this as a real violation of that, that Joe Biden can't say that I support D.C. having autonomy in theory. But in practice, when it comes to something like this, I will go against what D.C. wants. Politically, very complicated. Bottom line, this could point to some of the challenges for Democrats dealing with the issue of crime going forward.",

It seems counter to how Republicans, obviously they don't want their government.This is definitely government coming in and big footing a city. I also think that where the White House might have made a misstep is that by taking the bait for Republicans about a soft on crime narrative. Joe Biden has made it very clear that he supports police officers, that he believes in a new vision for public safety which he just laid out in the State of the Union, and allowing people to do criminal justice reform like the D.C. code would be doing in this bill, would be a great opportunity for the president to say \"I support new ways to think about public safety\". But instead, several provisions in the bill that the Republicans really double down on, it seems like the White House doesn't want to be on the Republicans talking points. They should be pushing back. We cannot be playing defense about being a soft on crime party, when we really know that what we all want is communities that are about public safety and where people can feel safe in.",

And frankly, it's a huge misstep for those who are advocates of criminal justice reform.D.C. is in the middle of rising crime, rising carjackings, rising homicides. The fact that city council would take this moment, instead of doing things to actually reduce crime, to do things to be soft on crime puts Democrats in a horrible position, because now, there are going to be Republican ads run all over the country against every single one of those Democratic House members who voted against overturning this policy, making the case that they supported softer penalties.

CPAC has been, as Kellyanne Conway described in 2017, it's now TPAC. It's true. He's won the straw poll every year since he's been president. But also, CPAC is not as determinative of who becomes the Republican nominee is. I think some of the rhetoric would suggest, in 2016, it was Ted Cruz who won the straw pill. Donald Trump pulled out of speaking their entirely right before he won the Republican nomination. You had a bunch of wins from Ron Paul, Rand Paul, a lot of people who never wound up going on to the Republican nominees for president. I think sometimes CPAC has overstated its importance in process. It used to be a great place to hear where lots of different pieces of the conservative movement were thinking about things, have those, inside the tent debates.
