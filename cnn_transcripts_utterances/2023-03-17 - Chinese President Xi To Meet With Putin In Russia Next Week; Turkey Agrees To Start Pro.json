      "sentences": "Hello everyone. At This Hour, the details on why China's President is headed to meet with Vladimir Putin. A friendship they've declared his quote, no limits. Plus, a double whammy for Florida, algae blooms now threatening the state's east and west coasts, what they're doing now and also to prepare for more. And taking to the streets, protests and clashes with police in France after the president their moves to raise the retirement age. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Thank you so much for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. It's a milestone a potentially troubling development and a bold statement on the growing partnership between Russia and China. Chinese President Xi Jinping announcing that he will travel to Moscow next week to meet with Vladimir Putin. This will be Xi's first trip to Russia since Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine. China says that the visit is meant to promote peace and that Xi will uphold Beijing's neutral position on international issues including the war in Ukraine. But this comes after CNN has learned of course that the U.S. has intelligence suggesting China's considering providing lethal aid like weapons to Russia's war effort. A move the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. said would cross a red line. China has denied that intention. In another key development, Turkey's president just announced moments ago that his country has agreed to start the process to move forward with the process of ratifying Finland's NATO membership, a significant move at this hour. NATO requires the unanimous approval of its 30 existing members in order to expand. We're going to get to it. Let's start with Will Ripley live in Taipei for us At This Hour. Will first on this trip that Xi is planning, what are you learning about the plans for him heading to Russia?",

      "sentences": "Well, the big question, and certainly they're watching very closely here in Taiwan is whether Xi will, you know, agree to provide Putin with these lethal weapons that the United States strongly suspects that China might do. I mean, they've already been providing things like high tech chips and parts that could be used, you know, dual use parts for both military and civilian, as well as parts that are, you know, overtly labeled for military use.A hundreds of them have been flowing in from various defense companies in China since the beginning of the war, but lethal weapons, providing ammunition, the type of things that could actually help turn the tide potentially, for struggling Russian forces on the ground, giving them the kind of equipment that they don't have that China has a plenty, that would be potentially very problematic for Ukraine's efforts to resist and push back the Russians. And it also would be China and Russia, sending a message to the West that despite sanctions, despite warnings, they are going to go their own way. That is a very dangerous message if indeed, that message is sent, because that also indicates that China's potential ambitions for Taiwan and possibly other places beyond Taiwan now become much more of a feasible possibility. If indeed, you know, China's weapons actually were to help Russia, humiliate the United States and NATO by, you know, helping Russia actually win on the battlefield in Ukraine. And some analysts say that might be exactly why China could and Xi could consider doing this.",

It is seen as a significant move which could help Ukraine in its battle against Russia's -- Russian forces in the East including in Bakhmut. Ivan Watson is live in Kharkiv with more on this.

Join me now for more on all of this is John Herbst, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and retired general Philip Breedlove, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander of Europe. Ambassador, let's start with the reaction to this news that we got just as I was walking into the studio after resisting Finland's bid to join NATO for so long, Turkey is now says that it will support it. Turkey agreeing hearing from a Turkish president himself saying that Turkey is going to start the process for Finland's NATO membership. What does this mean for NATO?JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: This is good news. And it's not surprising. Finland is a country with a modern military. And it will add to NATO strengths in the north. And I love General Breedlove I'm sure can say more about that. And it's also a strong sign to Russia that its aggression in Ukraine has consequences. It should also be a reminder to Americans who don't understand the importance of defeating Putin in Ukraine, that alone neutral countries like Sweden and Finland now want to join NATO because he Russia is a very great danger.",

But it's not all the good news we need. And that is we look forward now to Turkey making the same move towards Sweden. And what we don't want to see is a delay of Sweden downrange. So celebrate what is going on with Finland. And now begin to work hard on bringing Sweden alongside. And the ambassador is exactly right. Both of these militaries are very capable, very modern militaries who have exercised extensively with NATO, and they're ready to contribute immediately.",

And it's very clear that Crimea and airspace and so we need to stick to our guns when it comes to operating in international airspace. I think, not to belabor but I think one of the most important things here is not really being talked about in the press or others. And that is, it's pretty clear now that this was a deliberate act. We haven't even seen all of the film, but we've seen a good and very important part of the film. And this were -- they were deliberately harassing and trying to affect the flight of this drone. And so that tactically is important, but more important strategically is Russia has taken a policy decision to physically knock down drones in international airspace. And that I think, requires a policy reply from the West, and certainly the United States as we are aggrieved.",

You're working on a few pieces of legislation now in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank strengthening Treasury Department oversight is one and also if I'm speaking generally expanding the Feds mandate. But the chair of your committee says that he thinks it's way too soon to be to say whether new legislation is even necessary, while you're still trying to figure out what really went wrong. Why do you think the time is now? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY), FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE: Well, look, I mean, we have to examine what went wrong. We know that there have been failures at the level of regulation and supervision and management. But I don't think it's too early. I think the legislative process is deliberative. And we should start exploring what are the solutions that are going to prevent a repeat of these bank failures in the future. And the federal government has an obligation to protect the safety and soundness of our banking system, which is the cornerstone of our economy. Without a banking system, our economy will come crashing down. So we must do everything we can to protect our banking system and to prevent a cascade of bank failures.",

The ICC clearly views this very differently, saying that this is illegal, what it's doing, and has taken, I think, a very precedent breaking step of again, issuing an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin himself against one of his top officials, accusing them of kidnapping Ukrainian children, basically, since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.
