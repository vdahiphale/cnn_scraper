If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.According to a CNN exclusive report, sources say Donald Trump and his legal team are considering allowing federal agents to search Mar-a- Lago again under supervision. The move is an attempt to keep Trump from facing more legal troubles. That comes as a federal judge says emails between Trump and his former attorney John Eastman must now be handed over to the January 6th committee as part of their investigation into Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Much more on these stories in \"EARLY START.\" Now with midterm elections in the U.S. less than three weeks away, we're following a dramatic turn of events in the Wisconsin Senate race. Democrats were expecting to knock off unpopular Republican incumbent Senator Ron Johnson to seeing their party's nominee Mandela Barnes scrambling to catch up. CNN's Manu Raju reports from Milwaukee. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It wasn't too long ago that Democrats could hardly believe their luck, despite being saddled with controversy. SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Guys, this is a complete non-story. RAJU (voice-over): In unpopular in battleground Wisconsin, Ron Johnson decided to run for a third Senate term making him the most endangered GOP incumbent, but the terrain has shifted. And now Johnson has an edge against Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes.",

And the S&amp;P 500 lost 25 points almost 3/4 of a percent.Now whilst inflation is putting a strain on many Americans, relief may soon be coming from an unexpected source.

      "sentences": "Today inflation is so high that they have to make these sweeping changes. Let's start with the standard deduction, which is what most filers claim. That is going up by 7 percent. Some context, that is the most since the cost of living adjustments were introduced in 1985 under Ronald Reagan.For individuals that means the standard deduction is going up to almost $14,000, that is a $900 increase. At the same time, we are seeing the rates, the income thresholds, that has also gone up by seven percent. For example, if you are a single filer, you made $90,000 in 2022, you're taxed at that 24 percent rate. If you still make $90,000 in 2023, you actually go down to the 22 percent rate. So, you're getting taxed at a smaller amount. Same story for joint filers. Now a reminder, these changes do not take effect until 2023 so this won't help you on the tax returns you file this coming April. Still, this is a bit of a silver lining for inflation because it does mean less money going to Uncle Sam, more money staying in our pockets. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
