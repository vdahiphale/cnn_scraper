A Christmas Day plane crash with at least 29 survivors, but dozens are feared dead. We want to warn you some of this video you might see might be disturbing. The plane went down near Aktau, Kazakhstan after a reported bird strike. Rescuers were there in moments putting out flames and pulling survivors from the wreckage. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now from London. Nada, what more can you tell us about this crash?",

The plane, which carried 67 people, including five crew members and 62 passengers, circling the airfield somewhat erratically before it appears the plane attempting to make an emergency landing -- in fact, bursting into flames upon crashing into the ground. Now, remarkably, authorities say there were survivors. At least 29 people are said to have survived the crash, including two children. And they have all, of course, been taken to hospital for medical attention. We've seen video emerging of some of those passengers emerging from the wreckage, some of them injured and bloody. But, of course, this is a huge moment of anguish, and many will be anxious -- many of those family members of the loved ones who were onboard. Dozens are, of course, feared to be dead -- to have been killed in that crash. But we are still waiting to hear more from the authorities with regards to the status of the remaining passengers that have not yet been identified. And, of course, the investigation into the incident is ongoing. Russian -- or aviation authorities say they believed according to preliminary information the emergency landing may have been caused by a reported bird strike. But again, we are still waiting to get more updates and clarification on that -- Danny.",

Just the other day I was returning something from Amazon -- some sneakers. Didn't even have the sneaker box but just brought it back in a bag and they wrapped it up at the UPS Store. So that was really easy. Sometimes you can even get UPS or they're partnering with Uber and DoorDash to come pick up the returns at your doorstep. You don't -- so you don't even have to leave the house. And then we have some good news for shoppers. Some good news and some bad news. So occasionally, returns -- retailers will just tell you to keep the return. They don't even want you to bring it back because it's more expensive for them to ship it back. So maybe you'll buy something and you want to return it and you end up just keeping it. Maybe a new toaster or something.
