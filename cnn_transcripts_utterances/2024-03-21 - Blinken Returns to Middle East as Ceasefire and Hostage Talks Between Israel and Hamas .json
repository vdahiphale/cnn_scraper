It's clear, I'm not interested in cleansing.WARD (voice-over): What is clear is that Weiss' views, traditionally seen as extreme in Israel, have become more popular since October 7th. In late January, jubilant crowds packed an auditorium in Jerusalem for the Victory of Israel conference, calling for the resettlement of Gaza. A poll that month from the Jewish People Policy Institute found that 26 percent of Israelis advocate the reconstruction of the Gush Katif settlements after the war is over. Among supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government, that number jumps to 51 percent. Several ministers were present at the conference, including far-right heritage minister, Amahai Eliyahu. In a rare interview with Western media, he tells us his political decisions are guided by the Torah. WARD: Is there anything about Gush Katif in here?",

So, in recent times, it's really quite rare that Kyiv would come under or see a barrage as it saw this morning.As you mentioned, only ten people have been injured. There are no fatalities, thankfully. But it all comes just hours after Jake Sullivan was in Kyiv meeting with the Ukrainian president in what was largely publicly, anyway, appears to have been more of an optics tour to say that, look, Ukraine, we are still standing with you. The United States is still standing with you because it's been 13 months since Joe Biden or Jake Sullivan have even been in the Ukrainian capital. And with that $60 billion military aid package still stuck in Congress, I think the White House wanted to get the message across saying, bear with us. We're going to do our best. We think we will get this over to you, but we can't promise when it will be. Pivoting, as we come back into Europe, there is an E.U. Council meeting today of E.U. leaders where Ukraine will once again be top of the agenda. And the European Council President Charles Michel in his note that goes to E.U. leaders ahead of the meeting has already suggested that Ukraine is going to be the number one billing. I want to read to you what he wrote, which is, into the third year of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, we face a pivotal moment. Urgency, intensity and unwavering determination are imperative. Our foremost task is the swift provision of military aid to Ukraine and fast-track procurement and delivery of ammunition to Ukraine. So that idea of military aid is becoming increasingly fraught for the Ukrainian army as they see they continue to lose small bits of ground and they are coming under renewed attack again from Russia. But one of the interesting things Rosemary to look out as well in today's Council or over the next couple of days is the idea that Ukraine, Russian frozen assets, the profits of which could be used to fund, help Ukraine fund its war and reconstruction as it goes into its third year and these are frozen assets held within European central banks.

The Los Angeles Dodgers have fired the interpreter for their star player Shohei Ohtani.Earlier ESPN and the \"L.A. Times\" reported the interpreter was accused of massive theft. Ohtani's legal team says the translator stole millions of dollars and placed bets with a bookmaker. The Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres in Wednesday's MLB season opener in Seoul, South Korea and the interpreter was there with Ohtani at the time. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is following developments for us. She joins us live from Tokyo. So Hanako, what more are you learning about these allegations and of course the fallout?",

Dodgers and also we're learning from a statement provided to CNN from Ohtani's lawyers that and I say and I quote, \"in the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities\".This is provided again to CNN by Ohtani's lawyers and now also from an ESPN interview with Mizuhara on Tuesday, we learned that Mizuhara has denied ever betting on Major League Baseball games and that Ohtani has never been involved in any of the gambling. Now Rosemary, I have to say this has been a huge, huge shock for fans in Japan, especially given the fact that there is so much excitement around Ohtani being in Seoul playing for the Major League Baseball season opener and also the recent news that he got married. And you know, adding to this is the fact that Ippei Mizuhara is no stranger. He is the longtime translator and friend of Ohtani. The pair have actually been working together since 2013 when Ohtani was still playing professional baseball in Japan and in fact, because Ohtani trusted Mizuhara so much, he asked the translator to move with him to Los Angeles when he first made the move to Major League Baseball back in 2018. And also, their relationship isn't just all about business. It's actually one of friendship. The two are always seen together. They are practically joined at the hip. Mizuhara in the past has joked about how he spends more time with Ohtani than he does with his own family. So because of their relationship, Mizuhara's profile has also been, you know, extremely elevated. So because of the nature of their relationship, again, this has been such a shock to Japanese fans. Many of them are concerned. They are worried about how this emerging gambling scandal could affect Ohtani's performance given the fact that also this season has literally just begun. So again, it remains to be seen how this gambling scandal will affect the pair's relationship, Rosemary.",

A patient suffering from depression, that could last for several days or even weeks. Since that time research has continuously shown that it can generate antidepressant responses in people that haven't benefited from the standard oral antidepressant type treatments.

There are some more immediate physical risk changes in heart rate and blood pressure that could create real problems for people at risk. But there's also psychological risk to it.

So that is available throughout most of the U.S. and in several parts of the world. So that is readily available for most people. The intravenous ketamine comes at a little bit harder to find. We have less evidence overall, although there's growing evidence to suggest that the intravenous ketamine therapy is effective. But as I said, the further we get away from that, what we know from the FDA trials, the less we know about it. What I recommend to people is that you really go to a reputable place. The FDA approved medication comes with a very strict REMS so that you have to use it a certain way or you can't use it. But a lot of physicians go around that and they just use the off-label treatment, but you can use that however you want. We have to be very aware of the fact that this is not a medication like Prozac, for example, that you take daily, that you're always looking to have this medication on board. This is a medication that you take pulsatile, you take it at a time and then you leave periods of time for your brain to have time to heal from it or time to have the reaction that seems to be generating that antidepressant response.",
