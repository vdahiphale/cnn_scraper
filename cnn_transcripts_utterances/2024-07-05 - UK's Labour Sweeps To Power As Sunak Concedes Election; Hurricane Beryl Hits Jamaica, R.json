And if you look at the percentage votes that it appears reform is getting already, that won't be quite matched by the number of seats that they can expect to get in parliament. And that could be said of parties like the Liberal Democrat Party, who are on track to improve their standing in parliament as well, probably at the expense of the Conservatives. These parties, it would seem, could potentially even over time, change the electoral system in the UK. They're certainly indicating that they want to do that because that would favor them and push the country away from a two party, politominated, two party political system.

But the atmosphere is completely different, isn't it? That was, you know, it was celebration. It was genuine confidence in that Labour Party.But even Keir Starmer tonight was quite sober, wasn't. I know he's sober at the best of times, but he was quite sober, considering what he's achieved. And he talked about change. So this is about change more than, look, you know, it's changing what we've got. Right. And we've seen that in some of those small accounts as well, which are nevertheless significant in Bristol with the Greens and also with Nigel Farage's seat. SPIRIT: Yes, and there have been 14 years that the Conservatives have been in power here in Britain. And I think it's become a common refrain in recent weeks to say that any landslide labor defeat would be more motivated by antipathy, by dislike towards the Conservatives and an urge to get them out office than it perhaps would be for a full throated endorsement of any vision that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party have to offer. And I think tonight, Jeremy Corbyn, you know, some, is predecessor running as an independent in Islington north after he was suspended from the Labour Party. He was successful tonight. And when he was questioned about this, he made it clear that this was not, in his view, a massive, unquestionable mandate for Keir Starmer to do what he wants. That actually vote share looks like it will be lower for the party than it was in, say, 2017 when he was the party leader. Of course, it's a much more efficiently spread vote for Keir Starmer now, but I think, as you say, the energy compared to '97, which is what people in Westminster love to talk about, is this going to feel similar to the last time we had a change of conservative government for the first time in a long time? It's a different mood. And Keir Starmer himself said, when he said walk into the morning, he said, the sunlight of hope hail at first, but stronger throughout the day. We've heard a lot through this campaign from both him and Rachel Reeves, his shadow chancellor, about how there is going to be a grim inheritance, in their view, about how the finances aren't looking good, about how they're going to have to make difficult choices and decisions, and about how their job will be one of repairing losses, rather, I think, than in the case of perhaps Tony Blair saying that they have a kind of much more bold and positive vision, perhaps. So that will be interesting to see in.",
