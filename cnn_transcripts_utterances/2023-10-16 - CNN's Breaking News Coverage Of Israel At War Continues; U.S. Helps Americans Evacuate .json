The actual total number of hostages has been increased by the Israeli authorities today to 199 from 155. That is an absolute national priority to get those hostages out safely. And at the same time, the IDF released numbers on soldiers killed since this conflict began, what, 10 days ago, and it's 291 already. So, those sort of numbers will be resonating.

So, in response to those comments from the president to 60 Minutes, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. said that Israel has no plans of occupying Gaza. So, if that's the case, once Israel does deem its mission to uproot Hamas successful, what follows if it's not Israel that controls and governs Gaza, then what is a palatable alternative? Because the Palestinian Authority, as we know, is corrupt, it's old, it's feckless. It's hard enough for them to even maintain control over the West Bank right now. MIRI EISIN, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM REICHMAN UNIVERSITY: The framing that you're talking about right now means that you're asking me about something which is a bit too far in the future. I greatly appreciate the question itself, but right now we're in a war, a war that is unprecedented. It's not like any other. So, I find it really hard right now as an academic, as a Colonel to try to say what's the day after.

You train, you do ideas, you try to be innovative. This is the way that you go about it, but I'm going to be clear. There are going to be casualties, certainly because Hamas use their own people as human shields, as they have done, not only over the last 10 days, but for years, but also the casualties on the Israeli side.

And we are already seeing evidence of that escalation. Since Israel declared its war on Hamas and launched strikes on Gaza, close to 60 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank, many by Jewish settlers. I went to one village there where residents just in the past couple of days have been caught in the deadly crosshairs. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice-over): Twelve-year-old Abdulrahman can't sleep at night. His sister Rabia says he's too scared to be alone. His home in the village of Khizra just south of Nablus was attacked by Jewish settlers. You can see them here in this video lobbing rocks and firing at the property, Shattering the windows. Inside, the floor littered with glass. Scars of bullets scraping the walls, a bleak emptiness. Four local Palestinians were killed in this attack. On the way to their funeral the following day, two other locals, Ibrahim and his son, Ahmad Wadi, also shot dead. Images of the lost plaster the walls in Khizra. Hani Odeh is the mayor here. His community lives in fear he says, constantly attacked by Jewish settlers. And he says it's getting worse. HANI ODEH, QUSRA MAYOR (through translator): The situation is so, so bad. You can't even describe it. We're living in a devastating psychological state. None of us can sleep. ANDERSON (voice-over): Torched cars, water pumps, electricity lines, ransacked. Hani tells me settlers roam freely here, often under the protection of the Israeli police. Their aim, he insists, to drive Palestinians from their homes and ultimately from the occupied West Bank. In Israel's current government, far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a former settler leader himself, previously convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. Others denying Palestinians' very existence. While you and I have been talking, I'm just getting an urgent update on my phone here, local sources, settlers storm Mount Al-Ama in the town of Beita, protected by the occupation forces. UNKNOWN (through translator): The policy is clear. It's no secret. They want to displace this area. We just have to defend ourselves and defend our land. We will die here. Where else will we go?

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in a call with President Joe Biden, demanded an end to attacks by settlers and extremist incursions, expressing his rejection of actions harming civilians on both sides. Well, look, I've been covering this conflict for 20 years and I can tell you the plight of the Palestinian people under occupation is at the heart of the problems of conflict here and in the past 10 months, we've seen signs that we are on the edge of an abyss here especially with settler violence in the West Bank and indeed with Gaza, an enclave that has been under siege for nearly two decades. Israel though, had sort of placed the Palestinian issue on the back burner suggesting it was a matter of lip service to an outdated cause. But after Hamas' unprecedented attack, it became quite clear that it can't be ignored. And in my time spent in the West Bank, the mayor of the village that you met in my report told me himself, young Palestinians are very, very angry. He said what they -- we are seeing in Gaza can be connected to what's happening in the West Bank just in the past 10 days and in the months before. We're reaching a stage, he told me, where people would rather die in combat than be humiliated and killed in their own homes. Well, Tor Wennesland is the U.N. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and he joins me now live from Jerusalem. And what I have just suggested is something all too familiar with you. You and I have had this conversation. Now, for months and months, you've been warning that things are on the brink here. Let's start with Gaza if we can and then let's sort of step back to the wider story of escalation. What's your assessment on what's happening in Gaza and what might happen next at this point? What are we seeing here? TOR WENNESLAND, U.N. SPECIAL COORDINATOR, MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS: Thank you, Becky, for having me on. Well, what we are seeing is the following. We are seeing a huge number in hundred thousands of civilians being moved from the northern part of Gaza to the southern part of Gaza, presumably out of the worst expected fighting zones. So, they leave their house and whatever they have to move to a place where it's considered not to be as dangerous. The problem we have at the moment now is that all these moves and all these dynamics is happening with the people that are running out of supplies completely. They're running out of water.

Israel, as we've been reporting, has vowed to wipe out Hamas, the Islamic militant group who controls Gaza. Palestinian officials and aid groups in Gaza meantime are warning that the enclave is on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe after more than a week of Israeli strikes.",

This comes after a widespread appeal to allow in much- needed aid into the territory. Joining me live now is the Outreach Associate for Just Vision in Gaza, Fadi Abu Shammalah. Fadi, thank you so much for being with us. I cannot tell you how crushed I am to see some of the images coming out of Gaza right now. I can only imagine what it's like to actually live through it. We're talking about just under 3000 people dead. People struggling with a lack of electricity, a lack of water, a lack of food. People in hospitals, by the way, in northern Gaza talking about being surprised at the fact that they're still alive at this point. Gaza is being pummeled right now, and I hate to say it, but do people understand that it's likely going to get a whole lot worse? How are people bracing themselves what is about to come their way?",

You know, one could argue. And this is not the format for this conversation right now, about where that blame lies and Hamas's role in all of this, but of course it is civilians and it is children.
