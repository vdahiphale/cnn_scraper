Russia President Vladimir Putin is cracking down on four regions he illegally annexed in Ukraine, as Russian-backed separatists evacuate civilians from the frontlines, another sign that his war is losing momentum. Plus, hours from now, President Biden will announce new actions to tackle gas prices, including another release from Strategic Oil Reserves, as voters say inflation and rising prices are key issues heading into the midterms. But let's begin in Ukraine. Earlier this morning, I wrote with Russia and Cyber Expert Dmitri Alperovitch, and asked what he makes of Putin's move to declare martial law. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Putin is losing more and more territory in all four of these recently annexed territories.And just yesterday, the new head of the Russian ground forces, Suvorikin, said that they may have to make some hard decisions in Kherson Oblast, where their position is particularly untenable on the right bank of the river. And that's probably an indication that they're looking to withdraw potentially from that in the coming weeks and months. And what Putin is trying to do there is forestall, of course, any further loss of territory, desperately trying to put the military back in charge of everything, including civilians in those regions, but it's really not going to help him much.",

They didn't want to be conscripted into fighting in Ukraine.But in Ukraine, today, you have the Ukrainian civilian residents of Kherson, which is illegally occupied, illegally annexed and controlled by Russian-imposed authorities, who this morning told by text message that they would evacuated or they needed to evacuate from Kherson towards Russia. Now, the implicit effect of martial law is that they will have to do what the military tells them, or potentially face being locked up or potentially worse. We don't know what the punishment is for disobeying the military under martial law because that's the sort of ambiguity that Russia likes to operate in. But it is very clear a degradation for the Ukrainians civilians who are living inside Russia-occupied Ukraine at the moment. Their future and livelihoods are more tenuous, their lives are in greater danger. And today, many are being forced out of their homes from Kherson towards Russia, and even more uncertain futures.",

Some missiles have got through in some of the central cities in Ukraine and have damaged electrical power-generating facilities there. And the populations there, the residents are now without electricity and water. Not clear how long it will take to repair those facilities and get them back up online. But the fact that the air defense is having a good track record against the drones, the fact that they're able to take down the cruise missiles is affording a better level of protection in the capital, at least, and many other cities than was the case about a week-and-a-half ago, where Putin suddenly escalated the war into the cities around Ukraine, targeting the energy generation facilities with the ferocity that really wasn't matched previously.

In fact, the Georgia secretary of state, I think, just announced that the first couple days of early voting in Georgia has surpassed the 2020 presidential level of early voting turnout at this point 20 days prior to the election.

But for now, we'll be sort of guessing about what his answers are. I mean, he has been pretty adamant in his denials of E. Jean Carroll's claims that he raped her in a department store, and that's the basis of this defamation lawsuit, because you not only denied, he also went on to say that she made this up to boost sales of her book and that she wasn't his type, as well as some other criticisms.And so this deposition is kind of a long time in the making. A federal judge cleared the way for this to happen last week, saying that there had already been enough delay tactics by Trump in getting even to this point. So, he said Trump would have his deposition today. E. Jean Carroll had her deposition on Friday. One of the other issues is that the judge thought that they're running out of time because both the former president and E. Jean Carroll are in their 70s. This case has been percolating through court since 2019. And there's really still -- it's an unsolved issue. There's a question before the appeals court here. And if the appeals court finds in favor of Trump, then this lawsuit will essentially go away. But in the meantime, this judge is saying, we don't know when that will happen, so let's move ahead for this trial that he is scheduled for February. Now, what also is on the horizon is E. Jean Carroll has said that she's going to sue the former president under a new New York State law that goes into next month. That law allows people who have been sexually assaulted or abused to bring civil claims against his accusers even years after the encounters. E. Jean Carroll said that she intends to do that at the end of next month. And the judge overseeing this case said that the deposition today is one that will be very important and critical to that future lawsuit.",
