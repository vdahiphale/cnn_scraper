Decision made:  Kamala Harris has chosen her running mate for the U.S. presidential election. It is Minnesota governor Tim Walz. We have just learned that Harris has personally informed Walz of her decision. This pick capping off a whirlwind few weeks, in which Harris secured the Democratic presidential nomination, then dove into what was an accelerated vetting process for a potential VP. Sources say she had to sleep on a decision after narrowing it down to two choices, Walz and the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania, of course, a swing state crucial to winning the November election. Kevin Liptak joining me now from Washington. Kevin, who is Tim Walz?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a good question and I think it's one that a lot of Americans are actually going to be askingthemselves today as well. He does not have a huge national profile. The task for Kamala Harris over the next several days is going to be to introduce him to American voters. He is 60 years old. He is the governor of Minnesota. One of the most interesting things about him, I think, is that he came to politics relatively late in his career. He began his career as a high school social studies teacher. He coached the high school football team. Eventually, he went on to run for Congress in Minnesota. He served six terms in Congress. He became the governor and he has had quite a progressive record while in office. He's overseeing things like legalizing recreational marijuana, an expansion of abortion rights in Minnesota. And what the real thing that I think clicked with Kamala Harris is this idea of chemistry. She interviewed him at her home here in Washington on Sunday. She did not know him very well, until that moment. They had met before but they hadn't necessarily interacted in this kind of way. And in that meeting, I think what you hear from people close to Harris is that they shared something of a sense of humor. They shared a shared outlook about this race. Eventually she slept on it last night and she made the final call this morning. And she is in the process now, as we speak, of calling both Walz and also the other contenders in this contest who she didn't select, namely Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania. And I think this morning there will be some questions about why she didn't select Shapiro. Pennsylvania is a much more critical battleground state than Minnesota. Democrats have won presidential elections in Minnesota dating back decades. Pennsylvania is very pretty much a linchpin of any electoral strategy for Harris if she is to hope to win, in November. But I think what were really came down to is this personal connection. And when you talk to people around Harris, they are confident in this choice. They think that he will appeal to white, working class voters who have been folding away from Democrats for the last several elections. Now the task will be to introduce him to voters and we will see them at this joint rally in Philadelphia later this evening.",

They've been losing kind of like regular folks. That's what Tim Walz is. I mean, you can put him in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania; this is a guy that can go into beer halls.

I was thinking back just this morning to back in 2008, senator Barack Obama was weighing, should he pick senator Joe Biden or Virginia governor Tim Kaine? He went with senator Joe Biden. Of course, that set the course for really almost 12 or 15 years of politics. So Vice President Kamala Harris could also be doing that.

And so think of all the important issues before them. Right? What weapons should we be sending to Ukraine? What should our negotiations efforts be like in Gaza and Israel? What new weapons do we need? How do we keep our -- take care of our veterans? How do we, in fact, keep our enlisted men and women happy and efficient in their jobs? All of these things, he can bring firsthand experience to and, therefore, he is a perfect balance to Harris' experience.

They, say look, he's the real deal. He's empathetic. He, as many people have said, he's a former football coach, he talks like a normal person. He seems very normal. But they also say that he is steady. And make no mistake,  just because he is authentic, normal, a regular guy does not mean he's a pushover. They also say he's a fighter and it's that combination that has definitely one vote here in Minnesota and that is why the people that I spoke with are so certain that he is the one who can take this all the way to the finish line. This is quite a moment out here, Becky. There are -- there's a growing crowd here at the -- people in the neighborhood as well as people across the river in Minneapolis are very excited. There's a lot of momentum here today. But we are still waiting to see if the governor is going to come out and make any remarks, Becky.",

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran that, of course, was blamed on Israel. We do know that there's an IEC (ph) meeting in Jeddah tomorrow called by Iran, alongside Pakistan. We wait to see what comes out of that. As the region, as we've been reporting, is still very much on edge, the risk of escalation, significant at this point. Ben, always a pleasure. Thank you very much. Shared on the show. The Democratic presidential ticket is complete with Kamala Harris' selection of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate. I speak to a senior political commentator for CNN, Van Jones, about that decision and its potential impact on the race. That is coming up. (MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (MUSIC PLAYING)",

This guy was literally is the ultimate dark horse candidate. How does this guy come out of nowhere and get this thing? Here's how, because exactly what you said. He's a Democrat that talks like regular, everyday Americans. He is a populist but he's a positive populist. He's not an East Coast elitist or West coast elitist. He doesn't have an Ivy League background, used to be a coach, a high school coach. He talks like everybody's dad, everybody's favorite PE teacher. But his agenda is an up with the people agenda. He's unabashedly trying to use government to help everyday people. But he doesn't talk in some weird way. And he just set the grassroots on fire in the United States over the past couple of weeks. He also, he defined Donald Trump as weird. We have been calling him a fascist, a dictator, authoritarian. It was actually giving him more power and scaring people. He comes along and he punctures the Donald Trump balloon. He goes, this guy is just weird. And suddenly you had a way to frame Donald Trump that actually deflated Donald Trump. They have not been able to deal with it. And who was this guy? And he comes out of nowhere. Only in American politics can somebody come out of literally left field and get this nomination, gets the opportunity and extends the honeymoon in this party.

And also, let me tell you that the Trump campaign accusing Walz are very specific policy issues. He's too progressive on climate, pushing a carbon- free agenda, limiting emissions on cars. In the Trump campaign statement, he said he wanted convicted felons to vote. Look, how will Democrats fight this? We've already seen the beginning of what the Trump campaign is up to here.",

But I'm going to tell you what, you put this guy in the same room and the same ring with a JD Vance, who is a complete phony, who the -- who's like a weirdo, hates cat ladies and all kinds of nonsense. You put him next to an actual Midwesterner, somebody who really comes from where he says he comes from. And it's going to be no contest. So they will try and define him in a negative way. But then you got to listen to the guy. And he is a breath of fresh air, not just for Democrats, for American politics. He does, he's not mad at anybody. He's not trying to put down immigrants, he is not trying to put down transgender people. He's just trying to make sure that everybody can see a doctor if they're sick, go to a good school, get a good job. This is going to be a tough person for the Republicans to beat up on because he's a fresh face. He's brand new and he's bringing a new style of politics for the Democratic Party.",

And honestly, Democrats usually have the better argument in terms of having policies that would help regular people. When you're talking about getting more childcare, better education, that sort of stuff. Where we slip on a banana peel and fall down the stairs is on the cultural stuff. Somehow, we just sound weird. We sound like we all took some PhD in political correctness. And people don't understand what we're -- and they don't trust us. They don't think that we are close to ordinary people, regular people. And that's where a lot of populism in the United States is cultural populism. It's saying these people have an agenda that is anti-family. It's anti- everyday Americans. And so what I think you're going to see is, for the first time, a real marriage with this guy of an economic agenda that's up with everyday people but also a cultural agenda that just feels like this, you know, if you have a great public school teacher. They're going to love all the students. They're going to hug all the students. And I think not only is he huggable, I think he's trying to hug everybody and I think he's got -- look, we haven't seen this. You've got to go back to John Edwards in 2008.
