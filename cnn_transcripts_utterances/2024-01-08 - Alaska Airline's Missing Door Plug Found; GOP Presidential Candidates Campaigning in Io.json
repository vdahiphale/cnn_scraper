Just ahead, the door plug that blew off midflight on an Alaska Airlines plane has been found. Why it could be critical to figuring out what happened.U.S. Congressional leaders reach a deal on government funding but isn't enough to avert a shutdown. And for the first time in decades, a high stakes mission to the moon is blasting off from U.S. Soil. Good to have you with us. And we begin here in the United States where investigators say the missing part of the Alaska Airlines plane that blew off mid-flight has been found. They say a Portland school teacher contacted them after he found it in his backyard on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: We are really pleased that we -- that Bob found this. He took a picture. I can just see the outside of the door plug from the pictures, the white portions. We can't see anything else. But we are going to go pick that up and make sure that we begin analyzing it.

They even asked for the public's help locating it. Investigators also say that the plane's cockpit voice recorder was completely overwritten and there's nothing on it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOMENDY:  The cockpit voice recorders aren't just convenient for the NTSB to use in investigations, or the FAA to use in investigations. They are critical to helping us accurately pinpoint what was going on. And it's key to safety. For Alaska Airlines, they want to know affirmatively what was occurring in the cockpit. Anybody who learned how to fly is taught, aviate, navigate, communicate. Communication is key. Why? Because the flight crew on the flight deck do not have situational awareness to what is going on in the back. They need to know what's going on in the cabin. So that communication needs to occur. They have to know how quickly they need to land. And if that communication is not recorded that is unfortunately a loss for us and a loss for FAA and a loss for safety because that information is key not just for our investigation but for improving aviation safety.

But real questions remain. Whether lawmakers will be able to pass pieces of legislation before January 19th, which is that first funding deadline.Now this agreement was struck by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The two men agreed on a $1.59 trillion top line spending level that includes about $886 billion for defense spending and $704 billion for non-defense spending. There is also an additional $70 billion that could be allocated to non-defense spending that was part of a side deal struck by President Biden and then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last spring. These overall figures track very closely to the agreement that had been arranged when they came to that debt limit deal last year. A deal that wrinkled a lot of House Republicans and already there has been some opposition expressed to this latest deal that was struck by congressional leaders. The House Freedom Caucus expressing frustration with the figures that are included that it does not include more spending cuts. They said, in a post, that it was, quote, \"a total failure.\" There is also some concerns that conservatives could use this government funding deadline as leverage to try to force more strict immigration and border policy changes. There is also a real question about whether lawmakers will be able to have the time to write these pieces of legislation, allocate all the funding, and actually get these bills passed with that first deadline coming up on January 19th and a second deadline on February 2nd. Now, President Biden in his statement said, quote, \"congressional Republicans must do their job, stop threatening to shut down the government and fulfill their basic responsibility to fund critical, domestic and national security priorities including my supplemental request. It's time for them to act.\" That reference, to the supplemental request is still up for debate right now up in the Senate and in the House. Senate negotiators have been working to try to see if they could reach an agreement on border policy changes. That is something that people have been stressing for before they pass aid for Israel and Ukraine. Now, these are two issues running on separate tracks, but it really speaks to some of the hurdles and the challenges facing lawmakers in the coming weeks as they are trying to avert that first deadline by January 19th.

And so, we were way ahead of our time then and we really weren't prepared to stay there budgetarily or otherwise or technologically. And so, we spend some time on the Space Shuttle, built the International Space Station. And now the push is to eventually go to Mars. And the thinking which I think is pretty sharp and smart is that if you're going to go to Mars, you might want to learn how to live on an outpost on the moon first, which, is a matter of a few days away as opposed to the better part of the year to get there. So that's what we're seeing right now. This is part of an (inaudible) overall -- NASA to get to Mars and the moon is the first stop.

So, a lot is riding on its success today. And I will tell you this, Rosemary, you know, to see a brand-new rocket launched exactly on time as predicted is a good sign.

Until then, we've seen his predecessors, especially the one he run against putting India first in terms of diplomacy for the country. And now, we have a president who's actually in China as I speak to you on a visit, on a state visit there and that has been seen by many analysts as a snub to India because usually and traditionally, we do see the presidents, once they're elected, making a trip to India first. Now, coming back to last Thursday, you have the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lakshadweep, which was just off the southwestern coast of India. It's a chain of islands there and he was promoting local tourism through videos, and images that he had put out on social media. And that to a lot of people also could've been, you know, they thought that he was trying to push Indians to travel to Lakshadweep and promoting tourism in that area. And that wasn't taken away by some people in the Maldives including that the officials that you spoke of and that led to comments by them for which they were suspended. Ever since then they have been a damage control mode, the Maldivian government, there has been a statement from the government as well and I'm going to read from that, Rosemary. It says the government of Maldives is aware of the remarks and social media platform against foreign leaders and high-ranking individuals. These opinions are personal, and do not represent the views of the government of the Maldives. There, you could see the government distinguishing itself from those comments.

This is according to new reporting from my colleagues Melanie Zanona, Anna Grayer and myself.We are hearing that House Republicans are growing increasingly confident that they can have the votes to actually impeach Mayorkas. This is a shift from some time ago when there are a lot of Republicans who simply did not know what they believe were essentially a policy dispute with the Biden administration, rises up to that very high bar in the Constitution, high crimes or misdemeanors, and a charge that has not been leveled against a cabinet secretary since 1876, only one other time in history, that was a secretary of war, William Belknap, back then. Alejandro Mayorkas could be the second because of how House Republicans are going after what's considered a crisis at the southern border. This uptick in migrants crossing the Southern border and what Republicans believe is Mayorkas' failure to deal with it. Now, whether it shifted here is a view among some of the swing district Republicans. We talked to several of them, saying that they are open to the idea of impeaching Mayorkas. Some of them said they are fully on board, like Congressman Anthony D'Esposito of New York, a freshman Republican who told me that they absolutely should be impeached. But there is still a very narrow margin for Speaker Johnson to get this through. Johnson will have to contend with a very narrow majority that's getting even slimmer with resignation upcoming as well as his top Deputy Steve Scalise going to be out for health reasons for the next month, so he has to limit his defections, potentially to only one vote if it comes down to it. And one Republican, we are told, Ken Buck of Colorado told us he believes that going down this path could be a dangerous precedent. He is not opposed to impeaching Mayorkas, but vote counting will be central here. Now, the Homeland Security Department is pushing back on this saying the house majority is wasting, quote, valuable time. They say impeaching him, charging him with a high crime is simply out of bounds and simply does not line up actually happening on the border. But the House GOP controls majority, and immigration has become a defining issue in 2024. What issue that is unifying Republicans which is why many of them believe it is more likely now that Mayorkas would get impeached and then Joe Biden, where a lot of Americans simply say they have seen the evidence yet to suggest that Joe Biden committed a crime while in office. So that issue is continuing to play out. The investigation into Biden. But Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee tells us that he expects a handful of hearings not to go on and on about the Mayorkas' impeachment, and then potentially an impeachment vote in his committee bypassing the House Judiciary Committee. That is the plan at the moment, taking us straight to the floor. But will they have the votes to get there, that is the main question.
