Do we know anything else about that tip and who the tipster was? I know that police have been pleading with the public for help, especially after putting out those pictures last week of the possible suspect? What else do we know?",

Was it someone possibly riding the bus with this person that is now being questioned by authorities? That's unclear.We also don't know sort of what agency. Again, so many are working with not only NYPD, but we have the Port Authority police. We have the FBI. We have all these local law enforcement officials. So it's not clear exactly where the tip actually went into. But we are still working our sources to learn a little bit more about that. But the fact that this person, again, was traveling by bus, as we know, authorities believed he left New York City on a bus and that they recovered these items from this person who is being questioned right now, like a suppressor, fake I.D.s We know that a fake I.D. was likely used when this person checked into that hostel on the Upper West Side ahead of the shooting that took place on Wednesday. So a lot of things are sort of pointing in the right direction for authorities. But, again, this person needs to be questioned. And that is what is happening right now, Pamela. But we will work to find out more about those tips, for sure. As you can imagine, police are hunting down lots of them all over this country.",

Daniel Penny, the former Marine charged in the choke hold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway last year, was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide by a Manhattan jury on Monday. This comes after a judge dismissed a second, more serious second- degree manslaughter charged last week after the jury could not come to a verdict on the count. They were hung. Gloria Pazmino, tell us the latest.",

      "sentences": "Well, one thing I can tell you is that you mentioned the jury. This is a jury made up of Manhattanites. I sat here watching a juryselection before the trial was getting started. And I watched just how carefully every juror was being questioned and picked out. These are people who live here in Manhattan. They ride the subway nearly every day. Many of them talked about the fact that they had witnessed outbursts on the subway. Some said that they at times felt threatened by those outbursts, but others said that they weren't. They were also asked about their experiences with mental illness and homelessness. And what I think all of that encapsulates and really just paints a picture about the state of New York City and many of the issues that the city is grappling with, mentally ill people, homelessness, public safety, and the perception of public safety, especially in the city subways. This was something that was really happening a lot at the time of the incident and people continued to be concerned about. So we are seeing that play out here by this jury.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pamela, I'm not surprised by it.Certainly, we saw just last week that they were hung up on the reckless charge. That was the manslaughter charge. That carried the 15 years. And I think that there were concerns as to why they were hung up. I think, when you look at this, what does it tell us? First of all, we have to look at what negligent, criminally negligent homicide means. It means that the jury would conclude that he was negligent, that is, that he failed to perceive the risk that his activities could cause the death of Jordan Neely. However, I think that there are two issues that you look at that are critical. Number one, was it self-defense? Certainly, that's what the defense argued, that he, that is, Jordan Neely, represented an immediate threat. And as a result of representing that immediate threat of death or serious physical injury, that restraining him in the way that he did was reasonable and appropriate. And so that was the one issue. I think the second issue was the dealing with causation. What does causation mean? It means that the prosecution had to establish that he caused, that is, the defendant in this case, Mr. Perry (sic), the death of Jordan Neely. And there was really dispute on the medical evidence. On the one hand, you had the prosecutors' medical examiner saying, in fact, that was the choke hold that caused it. On the other hand, you had the defense saying a number of things, number one, that there wasn't sufficient pressure applied such that it could be the choke hold, number two, that schizophrenia diagnosis, that the issue with the synthetic marijuana, et cetera, caused it. So I think there were plenty of issues for the jury to conclude that just beyond the reasonable doubt either, A, it was self-defense, and, B, that there wasn't -- he wasn't the cause. So those were two good reasons as to why they could acquit. And that's exactly what they did.",

The EPA has been -- done their due diligence. What's happening now is that these companies, mostly 3M and Chemours, which was formerly DuPont, are now dumping these wastes into our rivers and lakes, places where Americans spend a lot of time, our children spend time, where we get our drinking water from. And these discharges have no regulation on them at all. The good news is, is that the EPA now has some sort of limitations that they want to put and regulations that they want to put on these discharges. The bad news is, is that they're caught up by officials in Biden's EPA and actually the White House right now. And what we're asking is that the Biden administration takes this to its proper end, which is to limit these discharges. Now, the problem with these discharges is, they are ending up in our drinking water. And the country and the people, the taxpayers, are spending billions of dollars to clean these chemicals out of our drinking water. And what we're saying is, is, how long does it have to continue? These companies have known since the '60s that -- 3M and Chemours and DuPont have known since the '60s that these were dangerous chemicals. And now there's absolutely no regulation them being discharged. And how long do these people downstream, how long do the people downwind of these companies have to endure this? I mean, there's cancer clusters. We were -- spoke to the White House with families that had children who had brain cancer from these chemicals. They're seriously dangerous. And we want the Biden administration to finish the job.",

      "sentences": "Yes.Well, Mark is exactly right. The Biden administration earlier this year set the strongest-in the-world drinking water standards for these chemicals. And so water utilities are going to have to get these chemicals out of the water that we drink, out of our tap. But that puts responsibility on your water utilities, not on the polluters. And so this proposed rule is really about polluter accountability. It's about making sure that 3M and Chemours and Daikin and other manufacturers of these forever chemicals, which are linked to things like cancer, reproductive harms, like lower birth weights and lower sperm counts, immune effects, like making vaccines less effective, these chemicals that have really caused billions of dollars worth of disease and early death burden, that they are attacked at the source, and so that it is the polluters who right now don't have any federal limits requiring them to turn off the tap and limit how much they are discharging into our rivers, lakes, and streams, and ultimately sources of drinking water. This rule would finally say, enough is enough. These are limits on how much these manufacturers of these chemicals, these polluters, can actually discharge into waterways. And the effects of that is going to reverberate beyond just those manufacturers. (CROSSTALK)",
