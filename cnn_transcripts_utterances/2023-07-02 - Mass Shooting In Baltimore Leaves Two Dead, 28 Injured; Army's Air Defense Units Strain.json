The other victim was a 20- year-old man. Now, there are 28 people there injured, threw them are in critical condition. This is also new information. We are learning that 16 patients are being treated at hospitals within the University of Maryland medical system. Now, we heard from the mayor, and speaking to guys here in the past hour, they are working to determine how many people have actually been shot versus maybe injured in the panic of it all. We see oftentimes of mass shootings like this, folks that are trampled. They're working to determine how many people have actually been shot. All of this happening in South Baltimore, about ten miles away from Baltimore, Washington International Airport. And the broken homes neighborhood. That is a working class neighborhood. On the ground, investigators are canvassing the scene. There is debris, trash, broken bottles. And according to the acting Baltimore police department commissioner, Rich Worley, the crime scene is, quote, extensive. Right now, no real details on who is responsible. Police are going through cellphone videos, going through evidence, trying to find rounds, maybe for forensic testing, talking to witnesses. That's going to be important. Again, this is a block party, an outdoor block party. So, you're expecting that there is going to be folks taking videos. That will be crucial and identifying the shooter or shooters.

Folks who are out there having a celebration, and then at some point, gunshots rang out and folks, of course, were trying to get away and get out of there. But we know that we're going to not rest until we find these individuals and hold them accountable.

They are in the Middle East. They were some of the first soldiers employed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And leaders are saying these are the most deployed branches in the service. And so, that is having a real impact on soldiers. Leaders say that they are seeing an increase in air defense soldiers going to behavioral health, seeking mental health support. They are also very concerned about the unpredictable nature of some of these deployments and the impact that it's having on the military family.

All of this is adding on to the strain on those units. There's also, of course, the soldiers working tirelessly in Europe. I spoke with one of the soldiers who had led up the U.S. Patriot training for Ukrainian service members, who was emotional at times, recounting the interaction he had with his Ukrainian counterparts.

Officials said that there has been a reduction and commitments in the Middle East. So, instead of deploying their typical five battalions, they are now deploying two battalions, and offset by partners, you know, foreign nations in the region who are able to provide their own air defense. And, really, leaders are just emphasizing, communicate with these army families. Help mitigate some of that unpredictability, as soldiers and families are taken care of.

People had different opinions.But I think for Democrats, they can use some of these rulings to pivot to class more than race, and because these colleges and universities are going to be trying to make up for the loss of affirmative action by focusing on zip codes, and socioeconomic diversity, which can help bring more Black and Hispanic students into their universities. And so, I think that more Democrats, sometimes, talk about class, which will get some of those working class white voters to vote for them, the better off they will probably be, instead of focusing just on, you know, minorities, because you need a broad spectrum of voters to win elections.",

How does he recover from this? LIPPMANand say, hey, Supreme Court told us that we can't do this. And we tried everything we could in the executive branch. Remember, they had a months-long debate inside the administration about the legality of doing this. And so, clearly, this was not a slam dunk in terms of, yes, we have the executive branch to be able to do this. So, I think he can try to paint Republicans as being kind of stingy and not letting young people actually pursue their lives without these student loans hanging over them. And he is going to say to Republicans what's your plan for expanding Pell Grants? What's your plan for lowering the cost of college tuition which is affecting many Americans previously? So, I think it's a temporary political fall. But I don't think there's going to be a ton of young voters say, hey, I want to vote for Donald Trump who is, you know, a Republican, and Republicans are against the student loan decision, or they are for the decision, but against relieving these student loans.

There is a sense of racial profiling.

That's when she withdraw from four events while suffering from what's known as the twisties. We'll talks about those later. But Biles did return to the summer games for one event, the beam. She won a bronze medal. Since then she's been on a bit of a break from gymnastics. CNN sports analyst and USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan is with us. Good morning to you, Christine.

You're not quite sure where you are, and you can't necessarily locate the ground and aren't quite sure how you're going to land. And obviously, for a gymnast at the high level that Simone Biles is at, doing these incredible death-defying literally routines and landings, that could be devastating. And so that's really what happened with her. She just had this issue of not being able to basically do her job and do it right. And with the risk of potentially injuring herself severely. And so, that's why she withdrew. And I think everyone understood that it was something that wasn't made up. This wasn't -- there were critics out there, of course, on social media saying, what is this? And I remember people saying, oh, she's just got to get tough and handle it. Well, that's ridiculous. She was acknowledging a problem and then telling us about that problem and handling it. So that's what that was. Now, the question is, has she overcome that? The balance beam, where she won the bronze in Tokyo, she actually then changed her program to make sure she wasn't dealing with that.
