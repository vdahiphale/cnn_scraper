We continue our breaking news coverage of an extraordinary, groundbreaking international deal, the largest prisoner swap between the United States and Russia since the Cold War. Right now, \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan are on a U.S. jet on their way home. They are among some 16 wrongfully detained prisoners released, to be reunited with their loved ones in the coming hours. The White House says the president and vice president will greet their plane's arrival tonight at Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, D.C. President Joe Biden announced the news of the deal surrounded by some of the loved ones at the White House saying, quote, there agony is over. Biden also praised the power of diplomacy and global alliances. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in many respects, actually years in them making if you consider the fact that Paul Whelan was already in detention when President Biden first took office in early 2021. So his release is something that the president had been working on throughout the course of his first term at the White House.And we know of at least one phone call that the president made 11 days ago, the same day that he announced the American public that he would be abandoning his 2024 campaign. This was a phone call to the prime minister of Slovenia that now U.S. officials are describing as having made the final piece of this deal fall in place. So just remarkable that President Biden, as he was considering the end of his campaign, was actively working to get this deal across the finish line. Of course, this is significant. That phone call because we now know that there were Russian nationals in the Slovenian custody who were of key interests to the Russians. The other big part of this and perhaps actually the biggest part of this is, of course, Vadim Krasikov. This is the Russian assassin who had been in German custody that we now know President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had really pushed the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on in their private conversations to consider releasing him as a part of this deal. U.S. officials have basically described him as the biggest fish that the Russians had wanted as part of this big agreement. And, you know, here at the White House, it has certainly been an emotional and joyful morning. We saw Jake Sullivan, the president's national security advisor briefing reporters in the White House briefing room. And he grew emotional as he talked about the significance of this moment and how much has really gone into so getting this deal across the finish line. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, White House officials have gotten a lot of questions about whether the fact that he knew that he was now going to be just a one-term president did that sort of give the president a nudge, give the administration a notch to really try to get this done before January when he will be leaving the White House.But keep in mind again, as we were talking about before up for some of this, you the president has been working on for a number of years, particularly Paul Whelan, who has been in Russian custody for a number of years already.

He was arrested in 2022, just after the invasion of Ukraine as Moscow cracked down across the board on any dissent. Kara-Murza and Biden have long known each other, both served as pallbearers at the funeral of the late Senator John McCain. Earlier this month, I spoke with his wife, Evgenia, about what he's been through and her own fears for his life. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVGENIA KARA-MURZA, WIFE OF VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:  I know that my husbands' life is in danger and I've been fearing for his life since 2015, at least, when I first saw him in a coma with multiple organ failure, hooked on so many machines I couldn't count them because none of his major organs worked.

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's really hard to calculate because trying to figure out what's going on in Putin's mind at any given time, isn't -- isn't clear? I'm going to answer your question, Jim, but I think in reference to what you've just been saying about this horrible ordeal, we've seen the video of Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Vladimir Kara-Murza being escorted by the -- by the Russian handlers taken by the arm.Evan looks in that video as the one who's bearing up, perhaps best. Paul Whelan looks very, very, very sort of bearing with it, if you will. But it's Kara-Murza there. You just saw him in the video, the one who had the organ failure, the one who was poisoned who is almost bent over almost physically protecting himself as it's going and I think that really speaks to the psychological as well as the physical way that they've been treated while why they'd been held in captivity. I mean, Kara-Murza, you feel pain just looking at the guy, walk in there. So why is Putin done this now? It absolutely isn't clear. He is released 16 foreign nationals and Russians to the West and received eight Russians and two children, Russian children, back in the other direction. So it's just a simple numerical imbalances, an imbalanced because the prisoners held in Russia were wrongly -- were convicted on trumped-up charges. There's no other way of putting it than that. And those who've been released include murderers, include spies, include a high-value people for Russia. But why did Putin go for it at this moment? Maybe he believed the political time was the best time for him with the U.S. elections coming up, that he that he figured that he could get what he wanted through Biden and he couldn't get what he wanted through Trump. It's just impossible. It's just impossible to calculate why Putin did this. However, I think we have to understand that the war in Ukraine hangs behind this. That Putin is overspending, that the sanctions are having an impact and is very likely more that he wanted beyond just these eight Russians back.",

Let's speak now to former CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty, also, Susan Glasser of \"The New Yorker\". Good to have you both. Jill, I wonder if you could just put this into a broader context here.

And Putin is very transactional. And we all know this has been coming for quite a long time. The deal took a long time to pull together.And so I think number one, Krasikov. You know, he wanted Krasikov back because its kind of like the KGB thing, that promise to each other, I'll get my guys back. And then he could also get back at least he saw some of his spies. And remember after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there were a lot of spies, a lot of Russian agents who are running around Europe and then they began to be arrested. So there were -- some like two in Slovenia, one in Germany, et cetera. Then I think also political advantage. He can -- he can play it as he got some of his guys back to his own people in a very now militarized society. Then I think we cannot eliminate the possibility that Putin actually sometimes does things for emotional reasons. And there could be something that just at this particular point, remember, obviously the American election, maybe at this point he just decided that there was something that would push him to do it right now, but it's very hard to say.",

As we got seven different countries involved.Also, the president United States exerting his own personal diplomacy in order to make this happen, I think that the Germans had been for months very reluctant. Remember that this was on the table and different iterations for even a couple of years. And the German said no. They didn't want somebody who had killed in broad daylight in the Tiergarten in the heart of central Berlin to release that person. It didn't happen until Biden personally urged the German Chancellor Scholz to do so. Same thing he needed to make a phone call with the leader of Slovakia in order to close the deal. So I think you're right to underscore the alliances. It's contrast this with Donald Trump, who actually, earlier this year bragged in a social media post that he was just going to use his one- on-one good relations with Vladimir Putin. And that he theorized that perhaps Evan Gershkovich would be released right after he Donald Trump won the election.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, this was really a remarkable operation from various points of view and you know, yesterday, we were hearing reports from Iranian state media as well as Hamas that it was a rocket fired from outside of this building, perhaps from a drone, perhaps from somewhere else that hit that building and killed Haniyeh.But what we've learned is that this was a far more complex, far more clandestine operation that actually took out Ismail Haniyeh inside this guest house. Two months before he was staying in this guest house, we understand that a bomb was planted inside that guest house covertly, staying hidden there for two months until Haniyeh was confirmed to be inside his bedroom in that guest house, and then and only then was that bomb remotely detonated, killing not only Haniyeh, but his bodyguard as well. We know that Israel has yet to confirm or deny that they were behind this operation. They likely never will. That is pretty much standard operating procedure for them, but Hamas-Iranian media have said that Israel was behind this assassination, and I should note that my source on this told me that Israeli officials briefed U.S. officials yesterday on this operation only once it had been completed. Now, another interesting aspect of this is the fact that this guest house where Haniyeh was staying, he was known to have stayed in this guest house previously, and that seems to be how Israeli agents perhaps knew that this was the place to plant this bomb, but it speaks of course to a remarkable, remarkable breach of security for the IRGC, something very embarrassing for them that they're going to have to ask -- answer a lot of questions about it. And obviously, this whole development has put this entire region on edge as the Iranian supreme leader vows retaliation and Israel braces for exactly that.",

Here to discuss is Andrew Miller, former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli Palestinian affairs. Andrew, good to have you. First, I want to talk about this operation into Tehran, which we should note, Israel is still not commented pro or con on whether it was involved, but the details of this and explosive device planted in Tehran two months ago in a room, they believed Haniyeh would stay, and lo and behold, he is, and now he's dead. It's a clear breach of Iranian security, and by the way, one in a series, right, if you look at other assassinations carried out there on Iranian soil, how does this happen? ANDREW MILLER, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ISRAELI- PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS:  I mean, it really is remarkable that such a high level official would be would be targeted in particular of foreign dignitary or hasn't hit the column of dignitary, a foreign terrorist visiting Iran. Past assassinations have been primarily against the Iranian officials often nuclear scientists, and others who would be more difficult to protect. But it was clear that Haniyeh would have a lot of attention and the inability of the Iranian security services to provide adequate protection for him at a time when they knew who the threat would be particularly high is a major embarrassment for the Islamic republic and could very well play into exaggerating or increasing the nature of the response to try to deliver a stronger blow.",

By conducting this strike in Tehran, whether intentionally or not, Israel has upset that delicate balance. And now in order to try to return to the equilibrium, were caught in this action-reaction cycle. And its always very difficult to identify where the off-ramp is. And I imagine that my colleagues and the administration are working very aggressively both to deter Iranian attacks, to defend against them, to prevent Israel from suffering harm, but also to restrain the Israelis in terms of any response to an attack on Israeli soil, to try to bring this to an end as soon as possible. The longer this goes on, the greater the risks that this becomes a full-fledged conflagration.",

And before this, Putin have been sort of ambling along the red carpet at one point nonchalantly looking at his fingernails as if all the time doesn't matter to me, but it -- but it's clear, this is an important moment for him and then he gives a speech after this greeting on the tarmac, they walk inside. Then it gives, gives a speech and an even one of them sort of tries to applaud Putin in there. I guess that's sort of what he was -- it's often what happens when Putin speaks, people were trying to try to applaud. We couldn't hear precisely what he was -- what he was saying to them made.
