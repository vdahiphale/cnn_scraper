My colleague Brianna Keilar is live for us in Washington, D.C.And we're just minutes away from the start of the convention as major developments are unfolding. Today, Donald Trump scored a big legal win, as a judge dismissed his classified documents case. This comes less than 48 hours after the former president, rallying in Pennsylvania, survived an attempted assassination. This hour, we're also learning a flurry of new details about the gunman and new information about the troubling security failure at that Pennsylvania rally. Plus, one of the most anticipated announcements of the entire election season, two sources telling CNN that Donald Trump will name his vice presidential pick in the next few hours. Let's get the latest now from CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, what are you hearing from sources?",

And when it comes to who is the potential pick, we still are being told by senior advisers that they do not know, but we believe it is limited down to the three people we have been reporting on for the last several weeks, which is North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. Now, I want to show you some video here. This was taken just moments ago. We see Senator J.D. Vance leaving his house heading to the airport, where he will take a flight here to Milwaukee. Now, obviously, when you look at this, you might notice something kind of interesting. J.D. Vance is not just in a regular car. He is in what looks to be either an armored vehicle or he has his own motorcade. Obviously, we are just speculating right now, reading tea leaves about this. I will note that we are told that all three of those top contenders were given extra security after that shooting on Saturday. But, nonetheless, obviously, here, this is his motorcade leaving.

And the reason, she says, is because it's not constitutional for special counsel Jack Smith to have brought this case, to investigate it and to bring it against Donald Trump pursuant to trial. She says that because she says Smith was a private citizen the Justice Department brought in from outside the government and he is operating with very little oversight as special counsel. He was never Senate- confirmed and thus this is not a valid prosecutor in the way Congress has set this up and that the Justice Department, the executive branch, should allow. She also has issue with the funding behind the special counsel's office they have been using. Much of this is very untested in a way where there has been law established. Judge Cannon is ruling on something other judges at her level, the trial level, have looked at across the country and have said, sure, special counsel cases can go forward. But it's very likely now this issue is going to be appealed. And Justice Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court even teed up this question of the constitutionality of the special counsel's office two weeks ago. He wrote in a concurrence on the presidential immunity decision related to Trump in his other case: \"There are serious questions whether the attorney general has violated that structure by creating an office of the special counsel that has not been established by law. Those questions must be answered before this prosecution can proceed\" -- Boris.",

It is something that a lot of judges have allowed at the trial level, but it's never really been tested at the higher level. And I think it's something that does make sense. Oftentimes, you have situations like this where the government will do something. They will take existing regulations and they will stretch it a little bit further and a little bit further, and judges will kind of allow it. And, at some point, it should be ruled upon by the higher courts to either say conclusively, yes, this is permitted or, no, that it's not.

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, I think it is certainly a signal that the justice is interested in -- and the judge is correct about what he's saying about the difference between dicta and holding. And so that is something -- Justice Thomas' statement is also dicta.It's something that wasn't argued by either side. It is something that courts can listen to and take guidance from. But one thing to remember is that, from Nixon until today, as Judge Cannon laid out, there was a whole different statute that was enacted and then sunsetted. And so even though that has been in place for a very long period of time, we had different statutory scheme. One thing -- and the judge made a great point that this could be brought back by the U.S. attorney. It could be brought back by a main Justice. This case, when I was involved, it was investigated by the National Security Division. When Donald Trump announced his candidacy, they appointed Jack Smith as the special counsel. But, from our perspective, that seemed to be window dressing for several months, because the National Security Division kept doing everything. It was the same people, same signature blocks. They were still sending out subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas signed the National Security Division. It was only when actually I think CNN pushed them on why are you not using special counsel signature blocks that they all of a sudden got new e-mail addresses and started to fold Jack Smith into the decision-making process here. So Judge Cannon did not dismiss this with prejudice. So it certainly is something that they can find a way to go back and just kind of remove Jack Smith from the process and rebring in a more -- in a more normal way. KEILAR:  Yes, we will have to see the shape that this takes, but very insightful to hear what you gentlemen have to say. Judge Jones, Tim Parlatore, thank you to you both.",

He learned from law enforcement sources that the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, purchased 50 rounds of ammunition at a local gun store likely just hours before the shooting itself. So that may speak to part of the premeditation of this, or perhaps lack thereof. The other thing that we're learning overnight, Boris, is that the shooter here, Thomas Crooks, was actually a member of a sportsman club. And why that's important is because apparently, in this sportsman club -- and, again, we're confirmed this by an attorney for that particular club -- there was a 200-yard rifle range at that club. And if you will remember, the distance roughly between where the shooter was and where former President Donald Trump was just under that, maybe about 150 yards or so. But the other thing that I want to note, Boris, that we are learning just in the past few hours is, listen, the FBI has said from moment one, really, they're trying to figure out what the motivation might have been behind this attack. Well, CNN's Mark Morales is reporting that one of the key answers that we were -- or, I should say, the FBI was looking towards to hopefully find out motive was the shooter's cell phone. CNN's Mark Morales reporting that the analysis of that cell phone is now about 70 percent done, but, still, law enforcement officials are no closer to finding out exactly what caused that shooter, Thomas Crooks, to go up on that roof behind me and open fire at the president -- the former president, Boris.",

I mean, he did -- he was an exceptional shooting. He had no military training to speak of. Maybe he'd been in a club, almost kills the former president of the United States. And he does so in a way that, just looking at the images, is like sort of J.V. He's like sort of walking around, people are noticing him. He then decides to get on a rooftop, probably because it's vulnerable, and then take his shots. And so the fact that he bought them right before speaks to that this may been a very short period of time in which he was envisioning trying to kill the former president of the United States. And he -- and so I guess the point to remember then is the Secret Service, therefore, does exist to stop this kind of sort of random behavior. This is what -- exactly what you want to stop is someone who thinks that they can just show up and try to kill the former president.",

And remember, Boris, that's because that building was outside of the specific official perimeter where the Trump campaign event was happening. But the Secret Service said they did not know who was responsible for securing that building. Now, I will say we have been reaching out to a lot of the local law enforcement officials here on the ground to get more understanding after Secret Service put that information out there. I can tell you that the Pennsylvania State Police, they said that they were not responsible for that particular area. And they also doubled down then after I followed up, saying that not only did they have about 40 troopers on scene making sure that parts of the area were secure, but they were saying that they were very much following the direction of Secret Service and that Secret Service was in charge of this operation. So it's challenging, Boris, at this particular moment to figure out exactly what happened, because there, frankly, does seem to be at this point a lot of finger-pointing in the aftermath of this assassination attempt.",

Every father, every brother, every man that I saw in that crowd rushed to the aid of their families in that moment. I saw a lot of good. So I don't just want this to be about my particular story. We were all doing what we were supposed to. And what was going through our mind at that time, of course, was shock. It was disbelief. But, mostly, it was a concern for our loved ones and a concern for President Trump. We were in disbelief that something like this could happen in our backyard.
