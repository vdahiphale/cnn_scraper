So that undermines his ability to stand up for the Palestinians and say, hey, I can take care of your security.What does that look like? That looks like Palestinian gunmen coming outside synagogues and killing people here. But I think underneath that, it's important to understand the terror groups in the West Bank, Islamic Jihad and Hamas are purposely going after his credibility, Abbas's credibility. How do they do that? Because they do things that tempt the Israeli troops deeper and deeper into the West Bank. You'll notice that Gaza has been pretty calm. They're keeping a lid on that. They're drawing Israeli troops into the West Bank, which allows situations to develop where Palestinians get killed that inflames a situation undermines Mahmoud Abbas. That's the game for them.",

He is the former chairman and current ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, good to see you. So, you just heard Kylie Atwood discuss that the U.S. is still pushing the two-state solution despite no signs of any progress and no endorsement of it from the Israeli prime minister. Is the two state solution now an unrealistic goal for the U.S., to have? Does it undermine our own impotence to keep pushing for something that Netanyahu is pretty clearly not on the program for? REP. GREGORY MEEKS (D-NY), RANKING MEMBER, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: I think that is much needed and very important to say that we have to have a two state solution. To not to have one is not good for Israel, not good for the United States, not good for the Palestinians. You know, if you talk about a one state solution, then you're talking about having 6 million Palestinians in Israel where they may not have the equal rights. So, we need to make sure that there is a two state solution. We need to be strong on that with all parties. And there's mechanisms that we've got to try to get there by having the dialogue and conversation that I think that Secretary Blinken was talking about and deescalating. That's what has to happen right now, the deescalation of violence. Too much violence is going on right now. We saw the Palestinian terrorists killing a number of Jews in synagogue, and then we see the increased violence in the settlements to the Palestinians. That tension must be reduced, and it has to be reduced immediately. You know, we met today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and he said that, you know, we need to reduce it before Ramadan. And so -- and that we should do so in a collective way. So I think that the focus first is reduce the tensions that currently exist and then push forward so that we can again start talking about the whereabouts of a two state solution. And we know that means, you know, telling the Palestinians that they have to have a coordinated effort to keep peace and to stop, you know, Palestinian terrorists from coming over, as well as telling Prime Minister Netanyahu that they've got to stop the settlements would have taken place to the expansion, what prevents a two-state solution from occurring.",

But the United States will stand by.You know, look, the Middle East is a region that is very dangerous and because of the other countries that I've talked about, we know the threat from Iran, we know the threat from, you know, Syria, we know what a Lebanon that becomes a failed state, what that would mean. And so therefore, we have to make sure that the people of Israel is safe, that's unequivocal and the United States Congress will stand by that. The people of Israel must be safe, and that's why there will be no separation therein. And if we see somebody crossing the line, then we will have to stand up and say, this is not tolerable. I mean, this is what we've got to do. That's why I've said that it's got to be on both sides. It's got to be a way that, you know, for example, the United States has programs that are on the ground now of which we need to move further so that we could talk about diplomacy a little more, reduce tension and get compromised. And I think bringing the sides together, in fact, King Abdullah said there should be some kind of way summit, if you will, of all of the Abraham Accords and individual out of states in Israel. Unfortunately, on the Palestinian side, as you have indicated on this show, the head of the Palestinian Authority is very weak.

So these are convicts that they essentially just send to try and storm Ukrainian positions. And we spoke to a Ukrainian soldier who said he was in his position with about 20 other guys from his unit and they got attacked by 200 people from Wagner, they say they fought for about 10 hours. And he says that he believes that they either killed or wounded about 140 of those Wagner storm troopers, essentially, until they themselves had to retreat. So, that's the way that the Ukrainians on that front line are losing some position and are losing some ground. There's a lot of Russians who apparently die and are wounded in that whole process. So, certainly very bloody, those small victories that the Russians might be having there. One of the things that the Ukrainians say, though, that's really difficult for them as well, though, Jake, is that right now they say it's not only Wagner that they're fighting against anymore down there in Bakhmut, they say that increasingly the regular Russian military, also Russian paratroopers, are becoming involved, obviously making it even more difficult.

And one of them, he notes that on November 9, the FBI began an assessment to determine whether any classified information had been mishandled. Well, Jake, we have learned from our sources that assessment included the FBI going with the consent and permission of the President's attorneys to the former office. We've also learned from our colleague Jamie Gangel that by the time the FBI got to the office, all the relevant materials had been removed, sent to the archives, so they were likely just checking to make sure nothing was left. We've also heard from previous Justice Department officials who have told us, look, this is all standard operating procedure. But Jake, this is not a standard case. This has to do with the President of the United States and a Justice Department that is trying to prove to the American people that this case is being handled fairly and like the one into the former president.

There are plenty of members of Congress who are critical of Israel.But Congressman Gaetz tell CNN he just met with Speaker McCarthy over this issue and he's pleased with the compromise resolution that would allow her to appeal this to the House Ethics Committee.

So, you know, from the Democrats perspective, it's probably best to let them fight it out. But comments like that certainly don't help.

Also in our national lead today, a little over an hour ago, prosecutors in New Mexico filed formal charges against Hollywood star Alec Baldwin and the armorer for the movie \"Rust\".

I'll read you one passage in which the prosecutor lays the blame squarely with Alec Baldwin. She says that, \"A training session for at least an hour or more in length was scheduled, but the actual training consisted of only approximately 30 minutes, as according to the armorer, Baldwin was distracted and talking on his cell phone to his family during the training.\" So the prosecutor here not just focusing on that fatal shot, but what occurred before then, saying that Baldwin was allegedly not taking safety seriously. They also mentioned that per industry standards, actors are supposed to do safety checks with the staff on the set, saying that did not properly occur in this case. In really laying out her case, this is a really damning scathing summation here. I'll read you. The prosecutor says that, \"By not receiving the required firearm training, deviating from the required duties of checking the firearm with the armor, not dealing with safety complaints on the set, not making sure the protocol of safety meetings was occurring, putting his finger on the trigger of a real gun and the overall handling of the firearm in a negligent manner, Baldwin acted with willful disregard of the safety of others.\" Now, it's important to note that attorneys for both Alec Baldwin as well as it said armorer, have claimed that their clients are innocent. They expect to be exonerated here. Finally, as far as what happens next, I talked to the DA earlier this month. She said that there will be no arrests in this case. Baldwin and the armorer will receive what's called a summons. They will have to appear in New Mexico, either physically, possibly via video conference, and then they will enter their not guilty pleas, and then we'll see where this case goes. If the prosecutors can actually make that case, that they are negligent here for the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Jake.",

Dr. Narula, which foods are considered ultra-processed, and how harmful exactly are they?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a lot of the foods that you and I and our kids like to eat, Jake. This is things like breakfast cereal, snacks, some processed meats, frozen pizza, things that are highly palatable, marketed really aggressively, easy to heat, easy to reheat. The issue is that a lot of these foods are really low in nutritional value. They are chock full of fat, sugar, and salt. And, you know, we have seen an association with these foods and type two diabetes and obesity, but was really a question mark is around cancer. And we know that cancer is responsible for one in six deaths worldwide. In fact, 50 percent of it is preventable. And so when you look at food as being a potentially modifiable risk factor, this is important. So this study really looked at 200,000 British adults. They were average age of about 58. They had them take a food questionnaire, and they followed them for about 10 years. And they found that for every 10 percent increase in ultra-processed food content in their diet, they saw an increased incidence of overall cancer by about 2 percent, increased in developing ovarian cancer by about 19 percent. And then when they looked at the death risk, Jake, there was a 6 percent increased risk of dying from any cancer, about a 30 percent increased risk of dying from ovarian cancer. So these numbers sound alarming, but I think it's important to always point out some of the caveats to these studies so that people don't get frightened and there are some limitations.",
