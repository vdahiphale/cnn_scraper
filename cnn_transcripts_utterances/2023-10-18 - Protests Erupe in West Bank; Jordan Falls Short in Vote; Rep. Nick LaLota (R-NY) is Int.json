Hezbollah had called for an unprecedented day of rage.What we're seeing in Lebanon is scattered protests, but I wouldn't call it unprecedented in any sense. But, nonetheless, the mood in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East is starting to worry U.S. officials. Here in Lebanon, the State Department has said that family members of U.S. government personnel and other non-emergency staff are now allowed to leave the country on a case-by-case basis. Keeping in mind that the staff of the U.S. embassy all live on the grounds of the embassy. It's a highly fortified installation. They rarely can go out except with armed escorts. But that certainly indicates a level of worry. And we're seeing the worries shared by others. The Canadian foreign minister has advised Canadians in Lebanon that they might consider booking flights out as long -- as long as there are commercial flights available. Swiss air, Lufthansa have announced they're no longer flying here. So, there are concerns that the situation, already very volatile, could get worse. Erin.",

Nonetheless, when you start to see these international carriers cancel flights, as they have already done here in Israel, now in Lebanon, it is, you know, an ominous feeling for everyone, and including so many people who want to get out and are unable to do so.",

There should be a continuity of government. This position, the Speaker Pro Tempore, was contemplated post 9/11 specifically for the continuity of government. Business should go on in the House of Representatives in spite of their being a bonafide speaker.

I was one of the Republicans who supported funding the government to ensure that our troops got paid. We should not play games with soldier pay. And I've asked every single candidate for speaker who has approached me in the last couple of weeks, will you ensure the government gets funded? And that has been my number one criteria.Yes, we should pursue the commitment to America. Yes, we should continue to reduce spending. But we must keep the government open. While we do so, we must show the troops that we will put them first.

And when we raised the debt ceiling, and we funded the government, was doing the right things to fulfill our commitment to America, to make life better for my constituents, obviously for Carlos's constituents as well, and to throw out somebody who was making that progress was a political coup, that needs to be addressed. We should reform the motion to vacate rule. One should not be able to merely vacate the speaker. One should have to come with a bonafide alternative to do so, or else we're going to end in this chaos every time.It took McCarthy years to build relationships and to gain confidence and trust to get elected by his peers. And to think that somebody is going to be able to do it just in a couple of days or even a couple of weeks, is unreasonable. Those folks who voted to vacate the chair knew this chaos would ensue. They're responsible for it. And we need to find a way to move on.
