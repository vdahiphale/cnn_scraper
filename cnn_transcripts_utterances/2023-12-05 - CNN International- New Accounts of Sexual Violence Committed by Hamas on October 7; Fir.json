      "sentences": "Welcome back. Nearly two months after the shocking attack on Israel, the Israeli military says it won't wait for the end of the war to start investigating potential failures in preventing the terror attack. Among the issues to be studied is Israel's decision to move reinforcement troops from the Gaza border to the West Bank in the days before the massive assault.Israel's channel 11 reported Sunday that more than 100 reinforcement combat troops were relocated on October 5th to coincide with the Jewish High Holiday. Israel is trying to draw the world's attention to some of the most horrific crimes committed by Hamas during that siege, torture and sexual violence against women and girls. Hamas denies the allegations, saying they are, quote, unfounded lies. But Israeli police are compiling evidence, interrogating suspects, and collecting witness accounts. Building a case that Hamas targeted, tortured, and killed women as a specific component of their assault. Bianna Golodryga has the details and a warning that her report contains graphic and disturbing content. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN SENIOR GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST AND ANCHOR (voice over): The details are horrific. Listen to this Israeli paramedic, whose rescue unit responded to the massacre at kibbutz Be'eri. He did not want to be identified.",

One was lying on the bed.The one on the floor was lying on her stomach. Her pants are pulled down toward her knees, and there's a bullet wound down her -- the back side of her neck, near her head. And there's a puddle of blood around her head. And there's remains of semen on the lower part of her back. GOLODRYGA (voice over): A volunteer at the Shura IDF military base, where many of the victims of the massacre have been sent, testified at a U.N. event in Geneva last week, describing the evidence of sexual violence she saw on some of the bodies.",

Scientists with the Global Carbon Project say global emissions could rise 1.1 percent this year when compared to 2022. That's 36.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into our atmosphere. The good news is that the U.S. is expected to cut its emissions by 3 percent, while the EU could reach a 7.4 percent reduction. However, China is up 4 percent and India shows more than an 8 percent increase. Coal and oil emissions are also growing significantly in both of those nations.The first draft of the COP28 Climate Summit's agreement is calling for the phasing out of fossil fuels. The draft does offer several options, including the choice for parties to phase out in a, quote, orderly way. Another option would allow nations to possibly rapidly reduce fossil fuel usage and, in this way, leaving plenty of room for negotiators to water down the language in the final text. So, let's go now live to Dubai, where CNN's Eleni Giokos is standing by. Eleni, has a response to these options being warm or cool and what's on the agenda for the rest of the day?",

It's deciding on whether the world is going to phase out fossil fuels or phase down fossil fuels. And that's been a point of contention not only at this COP but also the previous COP.We have seen communiques being released. You've got to understand that these come with huge delays. And of course, you've got different sides of the spectrum, people coming together and saying we have to be pragmatic and absolutely realistic, that if we phase down and we phase down aggressively, that could cause some kind of socioeconomic crisis. And then phasing out just means, you know, way too much aggressive stance against fossil fuels. And what is the replacement going to be and what would that look like? What does it mean for the world? The good news is, Bianca, that 118 countries have committed to tripling renewable energy in their countries by 2030. And frankly, it's the private sector that's really been pushing interventions. While policymakers are still trying to come up with communiques and mechanisms to make things happen, it is the private sector that's making a lot of change. And joining me now, I've got the CEO of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson, joining me. And we've been having a lot of conversations about what the future is going to look like. But I want to start off with what Octopus Energy is doing. And you've got a platform across various countries and you're thinking about households in a very different way to sort of the traditional energy producers. How are you making a change?",

      "sentences": "Thank you. Look, the reality is that renewable energy is the cheapest energy we've ever had in most countries now, and it's getting cheaper every year. But the way we use it is different. For example, the way you use an electric car is different than the way you use a petrol car. If we can fill your battery when it's sunny and when it's windy, then we can do it cheaper than you'd ever imagine. You know, maybe 1,000 miles for $20 or $30.00. So, what we need to do is enable people to get the benefits of a renewable system.",

It's designed to isolate you, to break you down. And the letters that he receives gives him a lifeline to keep his spirits up. He needs to fight every single day. As he put it in his letter to me that it's like swimming against the stream every single day. He's fighting to keep his spirits up, his mental strength, his physical strength. He exercises, he walks outside of his cell. It's six steps, six steps, six steps and six steps. And it's tough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
