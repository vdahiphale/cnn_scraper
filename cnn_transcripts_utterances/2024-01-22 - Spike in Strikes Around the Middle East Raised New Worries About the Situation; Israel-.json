      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is exactly what the Pentagon had been hoping to avoid, a wider escalation of violence and tensions in the region, and something that they continue to insist has not widened really beyond Gaza. They say that they do believe still that the core conflict, the core war is still contained to Gaza between Hamas and Israel.But clearly, as you can see from this map here, the conflict has indeed spread even wider than that because of these Iran-backed proxy groups that continue to launch relentless, really, near daily attacks on U.S. and coalition bases in Iraq and Syria, as well as the Iran- backed Houthis in Yemen who are continuing to launch strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, including by targeting U.S. owned and operated vessels there. Now, the question now is how do you respond to this? Because while Iran can -- appears to be waging this kind of lower intensity conflict using its proxy groups to kind of do its dirty work for it, the Pentagon, of course, does not want to get into a war directly with Iran. The administration writ large does not want to have this direct conflict with the Iranians. And according to officials, Iran is not eager to get into a direct conflict with the U.S. either. But still, the Pentagon is grappling with what to do here because as these attacks go on, you are continuing to see U.S. personnel be injured, be put in harm's way. And the question now is how do you continue to respond to all of this when, you know, the Iranians are carrying this out through their proxy groups, and the U.S. is only continuing to respond in kind of an ad hoc kind of way, trying to take out various infrastructure.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right, with us now, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, CNN Military Analyst. Colonel, this is where the strike was in Iraq against the U.S. airbase, the Al-Asad Airbase there. No Americans were killed in that attack. My question to you, what happens when and if an American is killed, be it in Iraq or Syria or somewhere in the Red Sea? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER MEMBER OF JOINT STAFF, PENTAGON, AND FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING, NSA: Yes, good morning, John. Well, of course, it depends, I think, on the circumstances of a tragedy like that. But if an American were to be -- had been killed in the Al-Asad attack, for example, I think there would have been at least a direct response against the Iranian proxy group, the Iraqi pro-Iranian militia that was involved and claimed responsibility for that attack. The other thing that could happen, although, as Natasha points out at the moment, it's a bit unlikely is that there would be an attack against the Iranians themselves. That would happen if they could have, basically, have the evidence that the Iranians were directly involved and gave direct orders for such an attack and for that specific attack. So, those would be, kind of, the two options that would be there. But there would definitely be a response if it were -- if the circumstances were the correct ones for such a thing.",

But if the United States wanted to try to neutralize some of these forces that are going after them, whether it be from inside Iraq, these Iranian-backed militias there inside Syria or the Houthis in Yemen, which the United States is regularly hitting with airstrikes there. If they wanted to prevent further attacks, what could the United States do?",

For example, in the case of Yemen, John, what they could do is they could attack the Houthis directly, not just the emplacements, you know, for their Sam (ph) sites and for their drone facilities, but they could also go after the leadership.[10:35:00] They could take out just like the Israelis did in Damascus. They could take out members of the Houthi leadership. They could, for example, go in and to take out some of the installations along the coast and in places like Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, which the Houthis control. In other areas, what they could also do is they could launch attacks from the air bases, for example, Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. They could launch attacks against, not only the various militia groups in Iraq or in Syria, but potentially also in Iran. Now, I think the Qataris would object to doing it -- doing something directly against Iran from a place like Al Udeid, but it is certainly, at least, technically a possibility.",

When I talked to voters across New Hampshire and listeners who are, of course, paying attention to this race, and they are at a Nikki Haley event or talking about possibly attending a Nikki Haley event, they're kind of kicking the tires and shopping around a little bit.

There are some Republicans, of course, across the spectrum that are looking for something else, possibly, whether because they are looking for a more so-called moderate candidate or they're looking for someone who is maybe a little less bombastic and less rhetoric.

I think that the DNC, the Democratic National Committee did not do itself any favors in the PR department when they called New Hampshire's primary useless.

At the same time, the Biden White House has sent a lot of surrogates up to New Hampshire in the past two weeks to do a lot of campaigning with a kind of a nudge and a wink.So, you know, I'm -- I -- I'm really interested to see what happens on the Democratic side.
