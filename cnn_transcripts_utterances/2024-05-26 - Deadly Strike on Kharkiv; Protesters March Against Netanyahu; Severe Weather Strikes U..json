I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, at least 12 people are dead after a Russian strike on a Kharkiv hardware store. The toll the onslaught is taking on Ukraine's second largest city. Anti-Netanyahu protesters take to the streets across Israel. They want more to be done to bring the hostages home. And officials say there are multiple victims from severe weather in Texas, as much of the U.S. remains in danger on a busy holiday weekend. We begin in Kharkiv, where Russia's deadly strikes are becoming a cruel fact of life for Ukrainian civilians. On Saturday, Ukraine said two guided bombs hit a hardware store packed with shoppers. Officials say at least 12 people were killed and more than 40 others wounded. 16 people are still missing. A Ukrainian parliament member who is in Kharkiv told CNN in the past hour that Russian attacks are becoming all too familiar. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, meanwhile, a deadly Israeli drone strike near Jabalia in Northern Gaza has killed at least ten people. We have video from after the strike and have to warn you that it is graphic. A number of the victims were children. The drone hit a school that people were using for shelter. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment, but has not yet heard back. In Rafah, the Israeli military is continuing its offensive. On Friday, the United Nations International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its operations in the Southern Gaza city. Anti-government protesters in Israel are demanding that the government do more to bring the hostages home. Journalist Elliott Gotkine has more on that in the upcoming round of ceasefire talks.",

Plus, overnight, severe weather continues to threaten millions across the U.S. We'll bring you the details of this powerful storm system after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [03:15:00] COREN:  A desperate reality in Myanmar with civil war raging between the ruling military junta, which seized power in 2021, and several armed groups and resistance forces who are pushing back, Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority is once again being targeted with violence. Last week, the Arakan army, a powerful armed group, claimed to have seized a predominantly Rohingya town in Rakhine State. Residents and activists reported soldiers from that group forced some 200,000 Rohingyas from their homes, burning houses down and threatening to kill those who try to contact their relatives abroad. Human rights groups have condemned the violence, including the United Nations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIZABETH THROSSELL, SPOKESPERSON, U.N. OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:  In this appalling situation, civilians are once more victimized, killed, their properties destroyed and looted, their demands for safety and security ignored, and they are again forced to flee their homes in a recurring nightmare of suffering.

NAY SAN LWIN, CO-FOUNDER, FREE ROHINGYA COALITION:  Well, the current situation is similar to the 2017. So, it is not they are caught between the fighting between the military and the Arakan army. We can see that the Arakan army is also targeting the Rohingya. Previously, we have the military was only the sole perpetrator. Now, the Arakan army became the additional one. If you look at the, this arson attack last week on May 17th, there were the Hindu houses in the town. Those houses were not targeted. They were not forced to leave from their houses. Only the Rohingya Muslim are being targeted. Their houses were burned down by the Arakan army forces. And then they were just, you know, forced to leave from their town. Now, the humanitarian situation is really dire. This humanitarian intervention is necessary.

And from the Rakhine side, they have supported the Rohingya genocide, if you research about the 2017, the Rakhine civilian and the politician mainly involved in the Rohingya genocide.
