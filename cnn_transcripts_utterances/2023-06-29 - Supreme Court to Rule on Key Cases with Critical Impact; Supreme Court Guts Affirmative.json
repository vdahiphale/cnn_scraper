It is likely and it's expected that the Supreme Court will continue to find the nuances of race-based admissions, or race as a factor in the admissions process. But we do not yet know how they will come down in a case that has been continuously a part of successive Supreme Court confirmation hearings, let alone even ballot initiatives in places like California.",

So, what's so interesting here is we have tension, conflict between, in this case, the First Amendment right to free speech, the web designers arguing it would violate my free speech rights to compel me to create websites for gay weddings when I don't agree with them, versus, on the other hand, non-discrimination. Colorado, the state of Colorado has a law that prohibits discrimination against people based on LGBTQ status.We had a similar case relating to a bake shop, Masterpiece Cake Shop, that came out a few years ago, but that was brought on a slightly different basis. That was based on religious freedom versus anti- discrimination. This is First Amendment versus non-discrimination. So, we'll see. And that the dilemma, I think, here for the Justices is exactly what you said, John, which is if you allow this person to say, well, it violates my First Amendment right to make a wedding site for a gay couple, where does it end? What if someone objects to interracial couples? Can they stop there? And so I think we're going to see the Supreme Court sort of having to draw some very fine lines and thread, some meals. And just bigger picture, what we're about to see from the Supreme Court, what's going to happen today is a great example of how, what happens in that marble building with the big pillars, with all the legalese, has a real effect on the real lives of hundreds of millions of Americans when you take it all together.",

So, as was expected, the Supreme Court is saying that these affirmative action programs, particularly at Harvard and UNC, but this will affect all colleges and universities, they say that affirmative action violates the Equal Protection Clause. So, that essentially means that colleges and universities will no longer be able to consider race as a factor in admissions.This is the decision that seemed to be hinted at, at oral arguments here. In particular, the justices seizing on the decision back in 2003, which had allowed for affirmative action, race as a factor, but had sort of said, maybe affirmative action won't be needed in about 25 years. We're just about at that 25-year mark from 2003. So, the justices here, the conservative justices, ruling that affirmative action will be no more at colleges and universities. We have to dig a little bit more into the case to find out if race can even be considered holistically, even if they employ race-neutral factors, if colleges and universities can still look at race in some way, but they cannot use it anymore as a factor in the admissions process, as many college -- most colleges and universities have done. It appears that Chief Justice John Roberts wrote this opinion. In part, he said, eliminating racial -- let me start over. Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of this. And this was sort of a point that the chief justice had really hammered home on in oral arguments. He said, if we want to end racial discrimination, we shouldn't even consider race. That has been his view for a long time in other opinions he's written and it's something that we expected in this decision as well. So, I'll head back to looking at how this opinion shapes up. But the takeaway here is that, as was expected, the Supreme Court ruling that colleges and universities can no longer consider race as a factor in their admissions, they can no longer practice affirmative action.

And so part of the college admissions process is the practice of a student, a potential applicant, detailing why they believe their identity and being ought to be an additive addition to a particular school.Now, it will be very hard for an admissions process and an admissions office to delineate between how a student views themselves and their identity and what can now be considered in practice. An example that came up during the Supreme Court oral arguments is the idea of, well, what about a student who is writing about their personal identity as it relates to their race. Is the admissions office to look at that essay, burn it, throw it out, and say, I cannot see this here because it deals with race? And I want to read for you a quick notion here. I know we're short on time, but the monumental consequence of the decision cannot be overstated. Everyone from Apple to Ikea, to Starbucks joined in, in brief, to talk about racial diversity, improving decision making by increasing creativity, communication and accuracy. Some of the largest law firms in our country spoke about the private bar in the legal profession benefiting from a diverse pool of talent from which to recruit. Retired admirals, a group of them and generals, also told the court that, quote, diversity in the halls of academia directly affects performance in the theaters of war. And so for those who believe that the confines of affirmative action in the decision is going to restrict be here only in the halls of Harvard or perhaps University of Carolina, you have these amicus briefs and details about the impact more broadly and the potential domino impact of this decision.",

Let's read them because it's important.At one point he writes here, both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives, warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping and lack meaningful endpoints. We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way and we will not do so today.

So, we're not checking boxes. Students are not required to say what race they are. And one of the things the Supreme Court objects to, and was objected to an oral argument, is giving a specific numerical bump based on race.However, there still are things, as the passage you just read, Kate, makes clear, that colleges can do to try to generate diverse classes for themselves. For example, you can look at what's in a student's essay. You can't restrict what students write in an essay. And, yes, colleges can consider that. There are other race neutral factors. Economic background, is someone first generation that colleges can take into effect? What I think is really interesting is there is a recognition here, even in the majority, which is striking down affirmative action, that racial diversity is a virtue, it is a value. They're not saying it's a bad thing or it's meaningless. The question is, what are the constitutional means to get there? And that's sort of the dilemma that they're really grappling with here.

Of course, Brown versus Board of Education overruled, Plessy versus Ferguson ended Jim Crow in this country. So, the question then that always gets posed is when? And they always try to come up with these quasi legal formulations. They talk about super precedent, which is something that's been invented, but the practical answer is when five or more justices decide that it's time. And that's what's happened here with the six -- I think, fairly predictably, six conservative justices saying time's up on affirmative action, although as we said, important to note, there are other race- neutral measures that are still constitutional.
