He read all of the charges, those four counts of first-degree murder and that one count of burglary. And Brian Kohberger responded to the judge and said he understood the charges that he faces. But when it came time to enter a plea -- as you mentioned -- he didn't do it and neither did his attorney. Take a listen to what happened in court.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, I spoke to a University of Idaho law professor who said this could have happened for a number of reasons. The first being this case is under a lot of scrutiny. It is highly publicized. And so, it's possible that they didn't want to enter a plea one way or another to provide any kind of characterization. Obviously, if he entered a guilty plea, he would be admitting guilt. If he entered a not guilty plea, then it's possible that people would become outraged that he's not taking responsibility for his alleged actions. And so, by not entering a plea either way and by staying silent, it just doesn't provide any kind of characterization.Another possibility, according to this law professor that I spoke with, is that it's possible both parties are negotiating behind closed doors. Some kind of plea deal could be in the works and it could be that this was part of the talks that they're having. And then lastly, it could be that he is just not cooperating and is being difficult. So, we don't know exactly why this happened but there are a number of reasons that I listed that could be the case. So now that the judge has entered not guilty pleas on behalf of Bryan Kohberger, the prosecution has 60 days to decide if they will pursue the death penalty. And when the judge told Bryan Kohberger that he is facing life in prison or possibly the death penalty, he remained emotionless -- Brianna. All right, Veronica following this case every step of the way. Veronica Miracle, thank you -- Jim.",

We saw just how quickly a fake image and false news can spread on Twitter and around the Internet, causing confusion, even in this case a brief dip in the stock market. Multiple verified -- verified we should note -- Twitter account shared this fake image purporting to show an explosion, some sort of attack at the Pentagon. Thankfully, no such incident occurred. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan has been following the story for us. And Donie, you see here nexus between well, AI, true fake news, but also what appears to be a pretty pregnable Twitter verification system, right, in terms of how it works. What it reads out and what it clearly doesn't. I mean, and it came together in a dangerous way here. DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Exactly, Jim. Look, a lot of things happening here all at once. But it tells us a lot about the information and misinformation environment that's out there today. Look, Twitter changed its verification rules a few months back taking away the blue check marks from a lot of news organizations, from a lot of journalists. Basically, before Twitter -- if you had the blue mark, Twitter had verified that you are the person you claim to be. That's totally changed now under Elon Musk. So, anybody can really kind of go out there and pretend to be anybody else and get their little verification mark. In this case, we saw today, an account purporting to be link to the Bloomberg news network. Tweeting out this, saying that there had been an explosion at the Pentagon. That account was totally fake. It had nothing to do with Bloomberg. It has now been suspended. But from that, it got shared elsewhere. It got picked up by some media outlets in both India, and we also believe Russia. And as you mentioned, a dip in the stock market. And the image itself -- as you can see there -- people who are familiar with Washington, D.C., will notice that is not the Pentagon. And that is clearly quite a crude fake image. But still, it worked and it still had an impact.",

And you know, when media contact Twitter at the moment, there's an auto response, which is a crude emoji from the company that he's fired all his communication staff there. So, we haven't heard anything from Twitter. But I will just say, Jim, look, obviously, going into the 2024 election campaign with this sort, you know, of all this AI imagery, video, sound, and also a platform where people can pretend to be people they're not, it could spell trouble.",
