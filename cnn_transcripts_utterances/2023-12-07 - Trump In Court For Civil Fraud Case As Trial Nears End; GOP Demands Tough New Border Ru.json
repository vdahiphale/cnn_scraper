But the other part of that is that we've seen him really use these court appearances as campaign events. He had nothing on his schedule. And now we are taking sound from him at a courtroom, because he's talking to cameras, talking about his legal cases. They are really trying to seek to amp up these events as campaign rallies.

It doesn't mean that you are trying to defraud, it means that people have different ways to value things.And so that's a very good case that he's trying to make. And one way to do that is by showing up in court, one way to draw attention to that to what he was -- his lawyers are trying to do is by having Donald Trump show up in court. So there is a strategy. I mean, oftentimes we wonder whether it's a strategy, I think there was a strategy.

Because he's not really going to be the guy out there kissing babies in Iowa or anywhere else, right? He's not a regular politician, right? So these trial events don't really have that kind of an impact. But he's instead trying to use it to seize it to his advantage. You'll see that political calendar right there.

Democrats have that concern, too. But I think that Senator Padilla's statement on this of California really reflects where a lot of Democrats are.
