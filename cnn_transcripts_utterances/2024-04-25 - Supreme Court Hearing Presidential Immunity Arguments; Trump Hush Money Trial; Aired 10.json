We're standing by for the U.S. Supreme Court to begin hearing oral arguments on the former president's claim that he is immune from criminal prosecution over all actions he took while in office. The decision will determine whether Trump can be tried over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. It will also, of course, set a fundamental precedent for the powers of the executive. I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington. We're going to listen into those arguments in just a moment.",

That's of course, when insurrectionists tried to take over the U.S. Capitol violently. He contends that he cannot be prosecuted for his actions that day or any other day while he was president. Trump says, if presidents have to worry about being prosecuted, it would be harder to make tough decisions. Two lower courts disagreed vehemently. Jack Smith, for his part, says that no one is above the law; no president, either. It's not clear when the Supreme Court will issue a ruling following hearing those arguments today; may not be until the end of June. The outcome could impact two of Trump's other pending legal cases, not to mention, of course, his campaign schedule. We're going to have much more as those oral arguments in court begin.

Core exercises of his authority under the recommendations clause to recommend to members of Congress the measures he thinks necessary and expedient.

I think that we would have a really significant opposite problem if the President wasn't chilled. If someone with those kinds of powers, the most powerful person in the world with the greatest amount of authority, could go into Office knowing that there would be no potential penalty for committing crimes.

If the potential for criminal liability is taken off the table,wouldn't there be a significant risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon while they're in office? It's right now the fact that we're having this debate, because oh, well see, has said that presidents might be prosecuted. Presidents, from the beginning of time have understood that that's a possibility. That might be what has kept this office from turning into the kind of crime center that I'm envisioning. But once we say, no criminal liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever you want.

One more question. Yes, so what -- what is the argument that the President the United States, who you say is bound by the law is not on notice, that he has to do his job consistent with the law? I mean, to the extent the clear statement rule comes in at all, it's about the person not being on notice.
