It's not necessarily normal, is it, for the head of the country to open a religious site like this? VEDIKA SUD, CNN REPORTER: It's not normal. In fact, the constitution of India has the word secular in it. And once the word is in the constitution, one would assume that the head of a nation would not be presiding over a religious ceremony to do with Hindus. And that's what's exactly happened today, Max and Bianca. We're seeing the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, preside over the ceremony, which is very close to the hearts of millions of Hindus. Now, you know, we've been in Ayodhya for the last few days, and we've seen this temple town transform into a city of saffron, a color associated with Hindu nationalism. It's a pledge that Hindu nationalist organizations have taken over decades, along with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, his political party, to ensure that a Hindu temple stands where the mosque did once. And that pledge has now been completed. Their dream has come to an end with this huge, massive mosque -- massive temple that you see in Ayodhya. Now, in the inner sanctum of this temple, we saw Narendra Modi alongside the RSS chief, which is the main Hindu nationalist organization in India. And like I said, this was a campaign building over the years. It was a promise Modi made in 2014 and again in 2019, two election years. And in 2024, India goes in for yet another election. According to opposition leaders, most of them have boycotted this event. They say and they claim that Modi is using this for political gains to further consolidate on the Hindu vote base. Behind me, you can hear firecrackers go off. Now, this is part of the wider celebration that is happening straight off the consecration of the Rama Idol that took place a couple of hours ago. Now, there is a minority community here in Ayodhya, the Muslims, as it is across the nation. And we've spoken to them as well. A lot of them lost their family members in the 1992 riots that you spoke of. And most of them have said they will be watching the celebrations from a distance because it reopens old wounds. But clearly, there's a bigger picture here, which is for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has completely sealed his legacy and cemented his legacy as an Indian Hindu nationalist going into election seeking a historic third term. Back to you.",
