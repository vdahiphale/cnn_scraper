      "sentences": "Welcome to our second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Eleni Giokos in Abu Dhabi.Well, rebels in Syria say they're making gains today after launching a sudden offensive against the Assad government. In Lebanon it's day three of a fragile ceasefire with both sides accusing the other of violations. And some good news from Paris. After five years of restoration work, the Notre Dame Cathedral is ready to reopen. We'll get an inside look. Well, we start in Syria, where opposition forces say they have entered Aleppo for the first time since government forces recaptured the city in 2016. The surprise offensive is reigniting a conflict that had been largely static for years. A statement by a newly formed rebel Umbrella Coalition says clashes with Syrian forces intensified overnight into Friday morning. Analysts say the rebels are exploiting a vacuum left by a weakened Hezbollah to advance in Syria. CNN's senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has spent a considerable time on the ground in Syria, covering the civil war, and he's following these fresh developments for us now. And a lot of moving parts, Ben, at the moment, as the rebel forces are now starting to gain ground around Aleppo. What do we know about the coalition, the timing of this offensive and perhaps the vacuum that has been created by the weakened Hezbollah?",

They're looking the other way. They have other preoccupations at the moment, and it's unlikely that any Arab regime is going to come to the rescue of Bashar al-Assad, even though he has slowly reentered the sort of diplomatic theater of the Arab world. The regimes of the Arab world don't really have the political or military or financial capital, or perhaps desire even to come to his aid. Obviously, there will be serious concerns if these rebel groups really make a major resurgence and threaten the regime itself. It may not come to that at this point, but certainly what we're going to see if this rebel offensive continues is a weakened regime of Bashar al-Assad -- Eleni.",

The uneasy truce appears to be holding despite both sides accusing the other of violations. A senior Israeli official saying Israel's military will take unilateral action against Hezbollah if it perceives immediate threats from the group in southern Lebanon. And while many displaced Lebanese civilians return home, the IDF is warning residents in 70 southern villages not to go back right now due to what a spokesperson calls safety concerns. CNN senior digital Middle East producer Tamara Qiblawi is watching developments unfold from Beirut as she tells us in this report there are a range of emotions with relief and hope tempered by lingering concern that something could happen to upend the ceasefire.

We heard bursts of celebratory gunfire, and we saw people bundling their mattresses into cars and rushing to return to their cities and villages. The relief here is palpable. For one thing, people here don't greet each other by saying hello anymore. They say alhamdulillah salaam, which means I'm glad you're safe. It's a poignant acknowledgment of what this community has gone through. A pat on the back, if you will, for having survived yet another terrible episode in this country's crisis ridden history. But the truce here is tenuous. We remain at the very beginning of a 60-day period when both sides are expected to carry out their commitments. Lebanon, on the one hand, must ramp up the presence of its troops in the country's south to ensure that the area is free of Hezbollah's arms. On the other hand, Israel must completely withdraw their forces from Lebanese territory, but this will be phased and in the meantime it will be dangerous. But so far, officials see no reason to worry, and they see no serious threat to the ceasefire, at least not yet. But it is a bumpy road ahead. And meanwhile, all people really want is a return to normal life. Tamara Qiblawi, CNN, Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Russians saying on Thursday that that huge strikes that they conducted then using 90 missiles and about 100 of these strike drones, they said that was in direct response to the U.S. allowing the Ukrainians to use U.S. supplied surface-to-surface missiles to strike deep into Russia. However, just a day later, the Russians once again attacking apparently with 130 of these strike drones, and that does seem to indicate that they do seem to have some sort of mass production capability of these strike drones, that they are able to consistently use them in large scale strikes. Now, for the Ukrainians, it was quite interesting to see that they did say that they managed to take almost all of these drones down. They said more than 80, I think it was 88 of these drones taken down by their surface-to- air crews but then also some of them taken down with jamming methods as well, the Ukrainians say. Nevertheless, they do acknowledge that there was damage that was caused by these strike drones in Odessa. Several people wounded there and in Kyiv one person wounded as well. So certainly these drones are having an effect, as in general, I think a lot of people in Ukraine, Eleni, right now very concerned about the aerial campaign and the degradation really of the energy infrastructure in Ukraine as the Russians continue that onslaught there.",

      "sentences": "The U.S. still has nearly $7 billion in authority to send weapons to Ukraine directly out of U.S.inventories and stockpiles. The DOD, the Defense Department, has done this pretty much since the start of the war in what's known as presidential drawdown authority, allowing the U.S. to take 155 millimeter artillery rounds, HIMARS rounds, and all kinds of other equipment directly out of U.S. stocks and send them as quickly as possible to Ukraine. The challenge now is with that $6.8 billion or so left in the authority to send weapons to Ukraine, the administration isn't likely to be able to use that according to a number of U.S. and Defense officials with whom CNN has spoken. Over the course of the past several months, according to officials, the U.S. has tried to get to about $750 million of supplies a month. Now that number may go up to about a billion a month, with just under two months to go until January 20th and the incoming Trump administration. But even so, that will leave billions unused in this authority. This ability to send weapons directly to Ukraine. The challenge is, and has been for some time now, that the U.S. can't simply send everything it has, it has to keep a baseline of weapons and munitions in its own inventories, and only be able to send the excess. That has very much limited the ability of the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine. And that's effectively what we're seeing here. The question, what will happen to that billions or so in unused authority to arm Ukraine? Well, that is up to the incoming Trump administration. Do they choose to effectively cut off the supply of weapons? Do they choose not to announce any new military aid packages and let go what's already in the pipeline to get to Ukraine? That will be up to President-elect Donald Trump and his team figuring out how to handle Ukraine. Now, officials we've spoken with said there is still a lot in the pipeline to Ukraine that will get there before January 20th. But as we're seeing from the battlefield and the gains Russia is able to make, slow grinding, brutal gains, Ukraine still very much needs U.S. help. Oren Liebermann, CNN, in Washington.
