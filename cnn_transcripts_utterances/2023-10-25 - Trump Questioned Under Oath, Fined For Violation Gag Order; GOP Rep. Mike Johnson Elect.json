And the judge had previously barred Trump from making comments about members of the court staff. And that came after Trump posted about the judge's clerk suggesting that she was partisan, and Trump was subsequently fined $5,000 when that post remained up long after that gag order was in place. But today, Trump said that the judge was partisan, but also said that he was sitting alongside another very partisan person appearing to once again reference the clerk and that Trump's lawyers denied that's who he was speaking about. And on the stand, Trump insisted that yes, he was talking about the judge, but the person next to him he was referring to was the star witness, Michael Cohen.But Jake, the judge wasn't buying it. He said that he found Trump, quote, \"not credible\" and that these statements were intentional and hit Trump with a $10,000 fine. But, Jake, going forward, it's going to be challenged for the judge in this case, judge in at least one of the other federal cases to try to enforce these gag orders. Least the judge in the federal case here in D.C. said, look, I need to put on a trial and protect court staffers. But we know former President Trump is insistent, he is determined to try to paint all of these proceedings as partisan pursuits.",

Mike Johnson led the charge and that effort in the House. I put that question to several New York Republicans, people who are supporting him, people who are central to this narrow Republican majority and could see their seats flip in the next elections, given how their districts are swing districts, they downplayed his past positions and simply said, they want to look forward.

And I'm going to tell you a story now of almost unimaginable cruelty Hamas killing a mother in front of her three-year-old son. This is a story we've heard time and time again since the October 7th Hamas attack, even as these very same terrorists tried to use the very same boy for propaganda purposes to show their alleged compassion.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ADI KAPLOUN, KILLED MY HAMAS (through translator): Endless lemons and here there's more, millions of fruits and vegetables without end. TAPPER (voice-over): Her name was Adi Kaploun. She and her husband Anani moved to kibbutz Holit near Gaza to build a life together.

They gave me Eshel, which is his four and a half months old and Negev who's almost four years old, both traumatized. And they just gave them to me.TAPPER (voice-over): Avital, Negev and Eshel were then kidnapped and dragged at gunpoint to Gaza as hostages. Hamas then even used images of Negev and propaganda to show how compassionate they were, propaganda that appeared in Arabic media that we will not show you. The reality, of course, was far different.",

And then Eshel, the baby, he was breathing so much gunfire and his lungs were absorbing so much. Yeah, both of them were traumatized. And they were just quiet. They kept like, you know, gazing at the terrorists with terrified eyes. Negev, the four year old, he was wounded. So he couldn't walk, he was crawling, he was crying. And it was a traumatized experience.TAPPER (voice-over): Miraculously, Avital managed to escape with the boys and they were able to reunite with their father. Yaron was rescued from his safe room by Israeli soldiers. They searched Adi's house, they found nothing and no one. Y. VITAL (through translator): The entire house was filled with so many bullets, bullets from a firearm, the door of the safe room. The door looked awful. It was full of holes, full of bullet holes, dozens of bullets. TAPPER (voice-over): Then the mystery. Where was Adi? Where was she?",
