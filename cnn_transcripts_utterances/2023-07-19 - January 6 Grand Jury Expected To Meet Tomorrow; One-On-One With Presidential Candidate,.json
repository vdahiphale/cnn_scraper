We'll have a live report from the southern border. And later, new details about what motivated a US Army private to race across the DMZ into North Korea. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. A lot to get to tonight. We begin with behind the scenes drama unfolding as the former president faces a possible second federal indictment in as many months. The grand jury hearing the evidence in this case is expected to meet tomorrow, an indictment if there is one could come any time after that. Sources tell CNN the 2020 election case appears to be bigger than Trump's legal team may have been expecting in part because of the wide scope of the charges mentioned in the target letter the foreign president received. They are deprivation of rights, conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the United States, and tampering with a witness. That's according to unnamed sources we spoke to multiple news outlets including \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Now we should note that these are titles from the US Criminal Code that can cover a broad range of crimes and we will dig into those charges in a moment, but first anchor of \"The Source\" at 9:00 PM, Kaitlan Collins joins us.

It is unlikely he is going to do that, basically, that would be a major reversal if he does. They still haven't formally responded. They may never respond. They may just let the clock run out until midnight or whatever, tomorrow night. I think their team was not expecting to get this letter on Sunday night as they did and it gave them four days, which I've asked several of them, you know why four days? Do you have a sense of why that's the timeline? None of them really have a clear indication of it. But I do think what we should notice that, you know, when Trump notified the world yesterday that he had gotten this, that was because they had gotten a call that an outlet was going to report it and so they went ahead and essentially made their own news here.",

That's the conspiracy against the United States because it's a fraud when one candidate wins the presidency and the other candidate tries to stay in power and prevent that person from taking office.Then you have what's referred to in the letter as threatening a witness, but I think that is a reference to 18 USC 1512. That's the official caption, but Subsection C of that is interfering with an official proceeding. I think that's what's being targeted there and we wrote about that in our memo, and that, of course, is Act Two, if you will, when Donald Trump took those fake electoral certificates and tried to use them in early January to pressure Mike Pence not to do his duty. And then finally, you have a conspiracy to affect civil rights or privileges. That's what we talked about as Act Three. We considered should that -- that's the insurrection. That's the violence when all else failed. We looked at that through the lens of the Insurrection Act, but Section 241 or 242 of 18 USC is also a good fit, Anderson, because when Donald Trump unleashed the violence against Mike Pence, against Congress, he was interfering with their rights and privileges to do their job on January 6th, and in a sense, he was interfering with the right of every American because he was trying to stop the recognition of the rightful president.

Governor appreciate you being with us. We just spoke to former DC police officer Michael Fanone, who was badly injured, almost killed on January 6th defending the Capitol. He questions why so few Republican candidates are standing up for law enforcement and public servants. I'm wondering why do you think so many who are running for the Republican nomination for president aren't saying, you know, we at least trust the process, we trust the Department of Justice to do their job. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, first of all, I appreciate the officer's service and his sacrifice for our country, and whenever you look at what Republicans are saying, absolutely, we cannot dismiss the seriousness of the allegations. I've said repeatedly that when it comes to January 6, and the attack on the Capitol, Donald Trump is morally responsible. Now there is another question as to whether he is criminally responsible. And of course, we need to wait until we see exactly the charges. We need to see this play out, but we should not be dismissed, and we should not undermine the rule of law and that is probably the most troubling thing about the continued comments of Donald Trump, that it serves not just simply to protect himself, but he makes fun of the system of justice in our country, that is the world's greatest. It's not perfect. It's made up of humans, but at the same time, it served us well and everything he has done has undermined that rule of law and confidence in our law enforcement, in the FBI, and those that carry out really incredibly difficult duties. And so that's why this week I announced my reform of federal law enforcement, showing support for them, but at the same time, trying to narrow the mission of the FBI to provide more focus and accountability. This is the right way to approach it when you see an error. Let's fix it, but at the same time, let's make sure we support law enforcement, we support the Department of Justice and our system of laws in this country, and when it needs fixing, let's fix it.

That after the U.S. attorney in D.C. declined a partner on the 14 and 15 charges, Mr. Weiss took a good hard look at those charges himself, and ultimately decided not to charge them, and therefore, not to seek the Special Attorney status. He may have been right about that. He may have been wrong, as you guys make your case for, but it was his decision. Isn't that right, Mr. Shapley?",

And they would have had to pass by this Unification Bridge which is where we are standing right now. This is actually the closest that we are allowed to get because all tours have been suspended. But on the day that this happened, King and the other tourists, they were on a bus and they passed by this checkpoint here. This is the Gateway to Unification.They keep driving past all of this barbwire, the checkpoints, and they get to this Joint Security Area less than five miles down the road there. Now, in order for him to actually be able to get out of the bus and get into this highly sensitive area, he was on a passenger manifest that would have been approved by the United Nations command here. Apparently, that manifest must have been approved. There were no red flags, even though he had -- was supposed to be on a flight out for disciplinary action back in the United States in Texas, after serving almost 50 days in a detention facility here in South Korea. And then, what happened next was pretty fast, according to the tourist from New Zealand who told us what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH LESLIE, WITNESS FROM TRAVIS KING'S TOUR GROUP: Someone ran close to me, very fast. And I thought, what is going on? He -- I didn't think anyone who was sane would want to go to North Korea. So, I assumed it was some kind of stunt to run to the North Korean border fence and have someone film it or something like that. A couple of seconds after, I saw him that's when the shoulders soldiers shouted and started running after him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was described as -- he was actually doing labor in South Korea. Whether he felt that the future in the United States was bleak enough that he wanted to book this tour and try his luck in North Korea, there have been other U.S. service members who have been defected to North Korea, but we are talking about more than 40 years ago, the last case.Most of those other service members did actually stay in North Korea, with the exception of one of them. About half a dozen cases in total, some of them turned up on North Korean movies, others had their sons turn up in North Korean propaganda even in recent years, speaking Korean, talking about the value of the North Korean system. But things are very different and the value of having an American in North Korea for propaganda purposes isn't what it used to be Anderson.

Now it's important to point out, because so much of what we hear from the Kremlin is essentially smoke and mirrors and deception. It seems really that the chaos we saw on the surface was the real deal.But he went also to talk about how Putin really showed pretty strong weakness when it came down to what he referred to as cutting a deal to save his own skin. And he also talked about exactly how Putin had flip-flopped over Prigozhin during that particular weekend at the end of June. Here is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD MOORE, CHIEF OF MI6, BRITAIN: If you look at Putin's behaviors on that day, Prigozhin started off I think as a traitor at breakfast. He had been pardoned by supper. And then a few days later, he was invited for tea. So, there are some things on that even the Chief of MI6 finds it a little bit difficult to try and interpret in terms of who is in and who is out.

But he used this moment here in Prague, I think, to emphasize the weakness of those around Putin and make an abnormal appeal, essentially to say to those disaffected Russians, part of the elite, bring your secrets to MI6, to British Intelligence, spy for the west.Now, that is not something you often hear being said in public. But I think it shows that they see this as a very different unprecedented moment for the Kremlin and it was startling I think to see that there was not some complex private explanation of what has been happening inside the Kremlin during that period of time.
