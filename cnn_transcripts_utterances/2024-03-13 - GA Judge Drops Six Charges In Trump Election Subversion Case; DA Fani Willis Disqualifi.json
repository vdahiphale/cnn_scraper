Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, it's almost two weeks to the very day when the Fulton County judge, Scott McAfee, said that he would tell us his decision. What decision? Whether Fani Willis would be disqualified or not from that huge RICO and election subversion trial against Trump and his co- defendants. Now, the judge telling CNN -- quote -- \"I plan to stick to my timeline.\" All right, well, TikTok, we need to know because when it's going to happen is consequential. Today, when there were rumblings from the courthouse, we all jumping in that today was the day we would actually know. But in a surprise move, Judge McAfee threw out six charges in the 41-count indictment, all having to do with allegedly soliciting officials to violate their oath of office, including three charges that mentioned Trump specifically, saying -- quote -- \"As written, these six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes but fail to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission, i.e., the underlying felony solicited.\" Now, lawyers always, I mean, we overcomplicate everything, do we not? Let me translate that for you for a second. He's just saying that prosecutors were not specific enough. You're telling them that they were trying to get people to do something to violate the Constitution. Which part of the Constitution? How were they violating it? They need to know to prepare their defense. If they don't know, they might overprepare and miss some key things, or they could miss the one thing they need to know to defend themselves. The stakes are too high for all of that. The judge called that a fatal flaw. Now, let's take a trip down memory lane for a second because one of those counts, count 28, relates to this infamous phone call, the one that then president tried to get the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find him, say it with me now, 11,780 votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over): So, look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, what's interesting is that after months of following along on the drama of the disqualification trial, and I have been watching all of it, we are finally getting to the meat of the matter, the actual allegations in the indictment.So now that we know the judge thinks that they can proceed on their charges, um, who's actually going to try the case? I know how the case can be prosecuted, right? But who will prosecute it? My husband always has this saying, he always says to me, if not now, when? Well, when it comes to this, if not her, who? Because whoever gets next, if it's not her and her team, they're not required to do what she or the grand jury wanted done. The whole thing, not just the six counts, could actually go away if her, remember, and her team are disqualified. And democracy aside, passing it on, I mean, the migraine is real. Joining me now, CNN opinion contributor, excuse me, and former House Republican Investigative Committee counsel, Sophia Nelson, and white collar federal criminal defense attorney Rebecca LeGrand, who never overcomplicate anything. So, I'm so glad the two of you are here right now. First of all, guys, um, this is a decisive issue. They did not specify enough. This is coming on the long line of other matters, disqualification.

This happens, and the judge was pretty clear about that. There are plenty of facts in this indictment, plenty to support the RICO charge, which is the biggest charge there. [23:05:00] But for the specific solicitation of violating an oath charge, the judge said, look, I've looked at this, and even though under federal law, you could fix this with a much more easy step, under Georgia law, I think you need to add more specifics here. So, those counts for now are gone. But it's only six counts and there are multiple ways that those can be brought back --",

I watched the trial. The judge is a very thoughtful, methodical guy. He knows the stakes here. I don't think he's going to disqualify her. I will be shocked if he doesn't because I don't think the defense met their burden of proof. And I think he's giving you a window by saying, I don't like messy stuff. Yeah, you can get a do-over here, audience. She can actually just bring the indictment again, correct? If she's still there. They can refile those six counts, is my point. But I think the bigger issue is the judge is giving you kind of some insight into, I don't like mess, I like it clean, if you're going to make an allegation, back it up, tell me how it's rooted in law.

This is about a good Samaritan. His name, Termaine Hicks, and he'll join me in just a moment.He spent 19 years in prison after being shot by police and falsely accused of rape. All the way back in 2001, the then-26-year-old Hicks says that he heard a woman who was screaming in a Philadelphia alley. He stopped to help her and called 911. Police then shot him three times after arriving at the scene. And during his trial, police testified that Hicks reached for a gun after he was found raping a woman. He was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison. Now, throughout it all, he maintained his innocence. The Innocence Project eventually got involved, and new analysis completely undercut that police testimony. Medical evidence shows Hicks was actually shot in the back, and court records show the gun found on Hicks was registered to another Philadelphia police officer. The jury also never saw evidence that backed up what Hicks was saying. He was a free man in December 2020 after the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office vacated his conviction. Termaine Hicks joins me now along with Vanessa Potkin, the director of post-conviction litigation at the Innocence Project and the attorney who secured Termaine's exoneration in the year 2020. Thank you so much, both of you, for being here. Termaine, just to even hear what has happened is mind-boggling. People would not even believe that this was -- if it was a fiction story, they wouldn't believe it, let alone what's happening to you and what has happened.

Police claimed that they got on the scene, and as soon as they got there, Termaine was the assailant, and they shot him after he tried to attack them. But guess what? He didn't have a gray-hooded sweatshirt, and he didn't match the description that had been reported at the assailant. And so, you know, police jumped to the conclusion that he was the assailant when they got to the scene because he was in the alley. But of course, he was in the alley trying to, you know, help the victim. And they realized their mistake. That should have been the end of it. But instead of acknowledging that they shot an innocent man, once they realized he didn't match the description, he was unarmed, they initiated a cover up. They planted a gun on him.
