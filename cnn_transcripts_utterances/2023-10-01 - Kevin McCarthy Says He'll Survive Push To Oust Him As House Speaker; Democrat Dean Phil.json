The brinksmanship has to end. The president's remarks come after Congress prepped within just a few hours of a funding deadline that would have forced a government shutdown, hurting millions of Americans. The crisis was averted by a rare display of strong bipartisan cooperation. But Republican hardliners are outraged that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a deal with Democrats. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz on the Republican side says this week he will call for a vote to strip McCarthy of that post. It's unclear whether other Republicans will join him. In the meantime, McCarthy says this is nothing more than a publicity stunt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Yes, I'll survive. You know, this is personal with Matt. Matt voted against the most conservative ability to protect our border, secure our border. He's more interested in securing TV interviews than doing something. He wanted to push us into a shutdown, even threatening his own district with all the military people there who would not be paid only because he wants to take this motion. So be it, bring it on, let's get over with it and let's start governing. If he's upset because he tried to push us in a shutdown, and I made sure government didn't shutdown, then let's have that fight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So that's going to make McCarthy get some help, maybe from some Democrats voting present.It's also going to solidify his support in much of the Republican ranks. So I think he'll be able to survive. Gaetz has made some serious errors himself over the course of his career. I don't know that I would want to be in the position that he's put himself in.

They're all -- many of them are running in statewide primaries for other offices back in their home states.They're not there to govern. They're there, as Speaker McCarthy said today, they don't want to secure the southern border, they want to secure more TV time. And so I -- I mean, there's no advice, though, to be given to these people because they don't want advice. And I think Kevin McCarthy will survive. And I think it's important to remember that the speaker of the House works for all 435 members. It's not like the Senate, where the parties pick the leader. The speaker of the House is the speaker for everybody. We saw a bipartisan vote this weekend. We may see a bipartisan vote to keep the speaker.

It's very difficult for this to succeed.And they don't want to be associated with another losing effort and particularly one led by Matt Gaetz. So as I said, the stars haven't completely aligned yet, but probably McCarthy survives. The real question is whether Gaetz does this over and over and over again because as I understand it, and Scott worked up there, but as I understand it, he can do it as many times as he wants until the rules are changed. Maybe the House will decide that it's important to have 10 members submit a motion to vacate, rather than just having one person be able to do it. And you can see Gaetz doing it repeatedly.",

My suspicion is, is if Gaetz tried to shut down the House by doing this over and over and over, people would get tired of it and they would change the rules. And they should change the rules because it's not right for one person to impose their will on 434 other people.And it's not really right for one Republican to impose his or her will when you've got the vast majority of the rest of the conference going one direction, you want to go another.

Of course, as you know, was snipped out of that stopgap spending measure to keep the government up and running. I guess your thoughts on this, General Hertling. What happens, and I suppose the scenario could emerge, what happens if Congress can't get it done and this funding dries up? What message does that send? What does that do to the Ukrainians? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's a couple of things, Jim. First of all, you know, there's a very small minority in Congress who are sabotaging the United States foreign policy. And they are influencing in a negative way a fight for democracy and sovereignty and protection of an entire culture and its people by withholding this aid. We have been the leaders in this effort, with our Western allies, 50 of them, the last time that they met at the Ramstein Conference, and for the United States to go through the things that President Biden talked about this morning is just despicable in terms of being caused by a very select few in Congress. You know, Jim, you and I have talked, you know me. I've spent 16 of my 38 years in the military overseas. And people in other governments watch us very closely. They trust us to do things. And when they're seeing the kinds of things that are taking place in America right now, they lose some of that trust.

So it will be a hard push, but in order to regain that trust, which we need on the multi-national environment, this has to be done very quickly.There can't be any delays because it's not only going to affect how other people see the United States, it's going to affect the way Ukraine continues with their offensive, which truthfully is gaining some momentum in both the southeast and the east.

And El Paso, only about 1 percent stay in El Paso. The rest is coming to the United States so it's really important that we find a place for them to stay. They stay here between one to three days, but it's been really, really challenging for us because of the numbers. The numbers are huge. We have no hotel capacity. We started with four hotels about maybe two weeks ago. We're up to 10 hotels. We've opened up a recreational park. We've opened up an abandoned school that had been closed. We did that last night about midnight, because the numbers continue to increase. And if we continue to work with a broken immigration process, this is what happens. The good thing is, though, the federal government has been assisting us and we've had funding by the federal government, the local taxpayers cannot afford it.
