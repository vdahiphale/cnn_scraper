The amount of money that he had, the momentum he had after that 19-point victory. You mentioned that some people in the party saw him as the future of the party. Rupert Murdoch's \"New York Post\" actually put that on its front cover the day after the election, writing, the future.So, in that respect, yes, what happened a few hours ago is stunning, but as far as what's transpired in the days since what happened in Iowa, the writing has been on the wall. Most of his advisors over the last few days have been sort of in a morose state and acknowledging that there were few little paths to victory going forward. It was just a matter of time before DeSantis came to that realization himself. And I'm told that he did meet with some advisors earlier in this week. He had a brief visit to Florida where he spent the day, huddled with his closest team and they basically sort of laid out the case. It was the first time that he really had entertained conversations about potentially dropping out. And over the next few days as they talked to donors and got a real sense of the financial picture and the limitations he would have going forward, it became very clear that there was not a path for him anymore. So, he made this decision today with his wife, his closest advisor, Casey DeSantis. They moved. They came back to Florida after going to South Carolina yesterday, where they had tried to sort of manufacture another way forward, you know, skipping New Hampshire, going ahead to South Carolina. Maybe if they -- if they had done enough to bruise Nikki Haley there, it would give him a chance. But instead, they're deciding at this time to suspend the campaign. He's going to look ahead to his next three years as governor. And then potentially he's already been planting the seeds a bit for what happens in 2028, Jim.",

His strategic message was also never well received.And so, what it seems like to me is after he won his election for governor, his re-election for governor, he became the golden boy. But at the end of the day, he was always really just a GOP mirage. Everyone who was dying to turn the page from Trump focused all of their hopes and dreams and promises on Ron DeSantis. And so he was like this glistening, beautiful, a glittering thing in the desert. But when you got really close up to him, there was no there there.

And I'll just add one other quick thing. The other thing we don't talk about enough is that Ron DeSantis tried to say, I am Trump without the drama and that I can beat Joe Biden, he'll lose to Joe Biden. Well, the electability argument went out the window when poll after poll started showing that Trump was leading Biden in a lot of these key swing states.

So now we have the head-to-head matchup with the authentic Trump and an alternative to Trump. And that is certainly what Nikki Haley has wanted and, you know, many voters want.Here's the key interesting aspect of New Hampshire. We had the New Hampshire Secretary of State put out the latest numbers of the voters here in the Granite State. Registered Republicans, there are 267,000 registered Republicans. Registered Democrats, there are 261,000. The undeclared or independent voters, 344,000. And as we've had an education in New Hampshire politics, those undeclared voters can vote in a Republican primary on Tuesday, 344,000 of them. And if they are put off by the tone and tenor and the far-right messaging of Trump, they will more than likely come out for Nikki Haley. So, I think that votes well for Nikki Haley. The problem is, Jim, we've seen our polls. CNN poll shows Trump is 50 percent, Nikki Haley down to 36. She has a large margin to make up. And then the question is, where is her campaign staff after that? But I think given the unique nature of how New Hampshire politics in the voting process is and who can vote in a Republican primary, that benefits her. And I would -- I have said this afternoon, she had a very, very difficult shot to beat Trump. And now that DeSantis is out, she just has a very difficult shot.

And I think she's smart to try to do that.But the fact of the matter is, she was governor of the state. And if you, number one, are not even able to get any of your elected colleagues to support you over your opponent, and number two, the polls show your opponent is already trouncing you, I really don't see a path forward for her. I don't think she's going to win New Hampshire. And if she certainly doesn't win New Hampshire, I don't know that she wants to be embarrassed in her home state of South Carolina.",

Prove the fact that Donald Trump says I want to raise gas taxes. I've never said that or done that. Prove that Ron DeSantis says that I'm a corporate -- whatever he says I am. I've never done that. I was in South Carolina. We fought for the people every day. There's a reason that you don't see the legislature lining up behind me in South Carolina. It's because I fought to get them to vote on the record. I fought to have them do ethics reform. I vetoed half a billion dollars- worth of their pork projects. And then you see Congress. The reason Congress doesn't support us is I've pushed for term limits. I've pushed for mental competency tests. I've said if they don't give us a budget on time, they don't get paid. I don't get that political elite. That's what we need to be talking about, not the corporate stuff that they're talking about. The fact that they all side together against the people is what I'm doing. I'm going to continue to fight for the people. There were 14 people in this race, and now there are two. I'm going to finish this so Joe Biden and Donald Trump are not an issue at all, that we actually put them in the past and we go forward, because our country deserves it and Americans want it. They're tired. I don't think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House when we basically got to make sure that we can handle the war situation that we're in.
