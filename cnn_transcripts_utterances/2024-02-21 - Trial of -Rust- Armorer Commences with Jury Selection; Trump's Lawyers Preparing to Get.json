She has pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence in the shooting death of \"Rust's\" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Hutchins was killed by a prop gun fired by the film star Alec Baldwin.Joining me now to discuss is CNN Legal Analyst and Criminal Defense Attorney Joey Jackson. Great to see you. So, among the big questions, you know, why were there so many live rounds, even accessible and available on set? She's the armorer. She's responsible for everything.",

It's about the excessive or degree to which she acted as an unreasonable person would. And so, the issue for her and her defense team is going to be if this was the bane of your existence. This was your one job. This was what you were responsible for, ensuring safety on set. What went amiss? Did you know? Was it foreseeable?Her defense team, though, is raising all kind of defenses. She's being scapegoated. It was during COVID. There were restrictions with respect to her access to the set. She had no way of knowing, even in making the determination as to the gun, whether someone else may have done something to it to put it on there, right? The equipment supplies or anything else. You'll see fingers being pointed. You'll hear about the set in disarray. You'll hear about chaos. You hear about a lot of things. The issue is going to be whether prosecution can prove she was negligent. And as a result, the death occurred.",

      "sentences": "Yes, let's fact check out what we just heard. Again, I'm hearing that for the first time, but we've heard similar things before. First of all, the Presidential Records Act does not allow you to take classified documents home and then refuse to return them when you are asked. We know the former president, of course, caught on tape acknowledging that he didn't have the power to declassify them and should not have those secrets.Now, he says, we were talking. I was going to hand it back. He had numerous opportunities to return documents. He returned some of them, but not all of them. And then allegedly took steps to obstruct the government's efforts to get those documents back. Then he talks about a, \"Raid on Mar-a-Lago. That was not a raid. That was a search warrant that was executed again after multiple attempts to get those classified documents back where they belong. But moving forward in the Mar-a-Lago dot -- Mar-a-Lago document prosecution, Trump's lawyers revealing yesterday that they intend to file a slew of challenges. It's a straight laundry list, Sara. I'm going to read off the different challenges that they want to file. They want to challenge, \"The appointment of Jack Smith. Presidential immunity. The Presidential Records Act. Selective and vindictive prosecution.\" As well as, \"Due process violations. Prosecutorial misconduct. Impermissible preindictment delay.\" And the \"Illegal raid at Mar-a-Lago\", which I just said was a duly executed search warrant. And of course, the \"Improper violations of President Trump's attorney- client privilege.\" So, they're basically throwing everything at the wall to see if anything will stick. Well, the former president's attorneys absolutely have the right to file pretrial motions. We know this is also part of a larger strategy to try to delay both of the special counsel's criminal prosecutions of Trump until after the 2024 election. Because Sara, if he is reelected, he can make the Jack Smith's appointment and his cases pretty much go away. So, this is all part of a delay strategy. And next week we might learn more about whether it's working. There is a hearing where we expect to get some indication of whether that trial, currently on the calendar for May 20th, will be pushed back.",

Let's take a listen to what he said to Kaitlan Collins.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  It's been months ago, but really, it didn't last that long.

Ultimately, at the end of the day, the evidence against Trump is pretty devastating. I mean, we just heard a moment ago from the reporter, an analyst, talking about the facts of that case. Really, the question is, will that trial take place before the election?

We don't know what they're going to do.As we do wait for that, though, something happened in the court yesterday that flew under the radar that some people are looking at with a raised eyebrow now. And that had to do with a case out of Missouri where the Supreme Court chose not to take up this case involving the dismissal of jurors for voicing religious concerns about gay relationships. But in it, it gave Judge Samuel Alito a chance to talk about how much he still disagrees with the 2015 Obergefell case, which basically solidified the right to gay marriage. He said, Obergefell in 2015 shows how, \"Americans who do not hide their adherence to traditional religious beliefs about homosexual conduct will be labeled as bigots and treated as such by the government.\" Now, the reason this is significant is as we sit here in 2024, only two justices who voted for Obergefell solidifying the right of gay marriage are still on the court. Samuel Alito wrote the decision overturning Roe versus Wade. Is there reason to think that if they get the chance, the Supreme Court might take another look and overrule?",

Wade decision is really the same line of cases, the same -- essentially the same foundation on which the case that you referred to just a moment ago that essentially said that gay marriage was permitted is also based upon.And so, if I was an LGBTQ person who was relying on the fact that my marriage certificate is valid in my state, I would be concerned.
