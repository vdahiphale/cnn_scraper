We're live outside the Netflix studios in Los Angeles, just ahead. Then blistering temperatures hit millions of people across the U.S. and Europe. We'll look at how regions are scrambling to adapt. And confusion and confrontation in Russia's military. New details emerge about the showdown between Putin and his top Generals. Now, Hollywood actors are on strike for the first time in over 40 years. This was the picket line in New York today. Actors are joining screenwriters who walked off the job two months ago. The combined strike threatens to grind Hollywood to a halt. The cast of the new movie \"Oppenheimer\" walked out of their U.K. Premier in London in solidarity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We had a taste just then in that short clip which showed of how -- what impacts, you know, the use of A.I. could have and it's quite frightening, frankly, to see it laid out. You have called Fran Drescher's speech, that powerful speech that's kind of been at the front of every news line on this, a moment of historical significance. Can you just begin by explaining how justified she is and everyone else in the industry, by their fear that A.I. could take over their jobs? NINA SCHICK, AUTHOR &amp; COMMENTATOR, SPECIALIZING IN GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: I think that this is going to become one of the most pertinent debates in society. I have long been predicting that this is going to get intensely political. Because for the first time, if you kind of consider the technology revolutions of the past 30 years from the internet to the smartphone, it's all been about building a digital ecosystem and digital infrastructure. However, when it comes to A.I., and in particular, generative A.I., you can conceive of it as a knowledge and creative revolution. For the first time, you have machines that are able to do creative, intelligent output which we thought was only unique to humans, right? So, the capabilities of ChatGPT or the capabilities of artificial intelligence to actually clone people's biometrics. So, it's not only the entertainment industry that's going to be utterly disrupted by this. But I would argue that all forms of knowledge work, white-collar work, creative works are going to be impacted by the effects of artificial intelligence. And the key philosophical question, this is the thing that Fran is getting at, and that SAG is getting at, is to what extent is this going to augment or automate us? And obviously, the fear with this action is that it is going to automate us, and that we're not going to be fairly compensated.",

At the moment, we're seeing big names, big active names come out in support of lesser actors.

Now, six months, just six months later, the conversation is entirely different. And it's very interesting to see SAG and Fran kind of putting themselves at the frontline of what she pitched very clearly in her speech, as a bigger battle for labor, right? She said, we are just the first, but it isn't only about the entertainment industry. This is for all workers.

But I mean, this is the matchup we wanted since the tournament started, right? You got the number one player in the world right now in Alcaraz taking on the best player ever in Novak Djokovic. And Djokovic just looking fantastic against Jannik Sinner today to make it to that Grand Slam final. This is going to be the 36th Grand Slam final of his career. That's a record for any player, male or female. Djokovic looking to win that eighth Wimbledon title, which would tie him with Roger Federer for the most all- time. And he's just so good on the grass at the All England Club. Djokovic has not lost there at Wimbledon since 2017 in the quarterfinals. He's basically unbeatable there. So, it's going to take an incredible effort from Alcaraz in order to win that match. But if he played like he did today against Daniil Medvedev, that is not out of the question, Christina, because Alcaraz was just a wizard on the court today against Medvedev. So much so that at times Medvedev was just looking around his family and his coaches like, what do I do against this guy? The 20-year-old Spaniard, you know, he's -- we know how good of a player he is on the hard in the clay. He's becoming a great player on the grass as well, winning the Queens right before Wimbledon. He's got that one Grand Slam title already under his belt, the U.S. Open, looking now for his first Wimbledon. He's been the top ranked player in the world for 11 weeks now. So this is going to be just a great match-up. I certainly can't wait for it. They faced each other twice before. They're one-in-one in those match- ups. The last one coming at the French Open in the semis, you know, we were hoping that one was going to be an epic match, Christina. Alcaraz ended up having some cramps, which kind of put it downer on it, and Novak ended up winning it rather easily. But we're all looking forward to Sunday now in this Wimbledon final.

Just the power she shows out there on the court, the confidence that she seems to have in her game now at 28 years old. You know, she's the first woman to defeat three top 10 players at Wimbledon since Serena Williams did that back in 2012. So, her run to this final has certainly been impressive. She's got 28 grass court wins on the WTA. That's the most since 2021. So she's definitely on top of her game. On the other side of things, Marketa Vondrousova, 24 years old from the Czech Republic, she battled injuries last year. She was out for six months, but she's certainly, you know, getting her game back to where she hoped it would be. It's her first Grand Slam final since the 2019 French. But, Christina, she was not expecting this so much. You know, she's the first unseated finalist to make Wimbledon final since Billie Jean King back in 1963. She didn't have plans for her cat.
