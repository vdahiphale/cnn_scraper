Doctorsand members of the military strike over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial judicial overhaul. We hear from some of the protesters. Then, Europe fights record-breaking wildfires. We speak to the Hellenic Red Cross about the situation on the ground in Greece this hour. And then, the long fight. Ukraine says it's retaking heat round around Bakhmut as the counteroffensive drives on. Well, we begin with fierce backlash to a new law in Israel that removes a significant check on government power. A law pushed through by those in government themselves. Israeli doctors went on strike today to protest the first bill to become law in a sweeping judicial overhaul package. It strips the Supreme Court of the ability to block government decisions based on a reason of doctrine. The measure passed parliament unanimously after all opposition lawmakers, if you remember, walked out. We saw that video of them walking out. For many protesters, these newspapers really cover, as you can see there, say it all, a dark void, an ad placed by a group of high tech workers meant to represent a black day for Israeli democracy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's actually protecting democracy by correcting judicial overreach. That argument was rejected by the opposition who say they may have lost this battle, but not giving up the fight. Multiple legal challenges have already been filed at the Supreme Court. The question now is, if the court strikes down the law gutting its own power, how will the government respond? Listen to what one Israeli minister told CNN's Erica Hill today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is definitely something that's being debated a great deal here in this country, we've heard some statements from politicians, also from top military brass as well, who are saying that right now, the Israeli military is still in a good state of readiness. But of course, they also say that everybody in this very small country that is surrounded by threats, needs to pitch in for that readiness to maintain at a high level, and that's where the concerns are very big. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): As protests continue to grip Israel, among those taking to the streets, many military reservists angry at the Netanyahu government's moves to weaken the country's Supreme Court. Even some who are just getting ready to serve, saying, they feel alienated. (on camera): What do you think this means for the Israeli army?

And what you see here is what you see, I have to say in many other places in the world -- you saw this in America. You see it in Europe. People, politicians, who try, who crave for more power, they want endless power. And so, once they get elected, what they do while they're in office is to dismantle democracy. And Israel, unlike America, doesn't have a second house or a constitution or executive president. What we have is the Supreme Court, as the one check over government power. And what the government did yesterday was to try and dismantle that. I appeal to the Supreme Court against the legislation, together with many business people, leaders from the military and leaders from this movement. And we're going to do everything that we can in order to stop them. We're not going to give up.

Thousands have been forced to evacuate. Emergency services have been working around the clock to try and bring fires under control.

Temperatures, which, according to experts, would have been virtually impossible without human-induced climate change. In a new report, the World Weather Attribution Initiatives says extreme heat events are expected to worsen in both severity and frequency, unless the world rapidly stops burning fossil fuels.

The Ukrainian forces and officials who we've spoken with admit that this is going to be a grinding fight. This is a very tough fight in the face of extremely dense Russian mine fields and fearsome Russian artillery. So what we've seen today and yesterday are these modest gains on these various axes, these directions, as Ukrainians call them, as they try to push south toward the Sea of Azov. What Ukraine is trying to do on the southern front is to pierce through the Russian front line and divide Russian forces, essentially, breaking apart what has become known as the land bridge that connects Russian-occupied Crimea with Russian-occupied Donbas. That is the main priority. We are told that in the most recent Ukrainian military update, that they made 500 meters of progress in one area. A monitoring group called ISW says that, in another area, that the Ukrainians moved forward about 1.7 kilometers. So this is progress. And it's important; because that fight is so difficult, they do believe that, at some point, despite how slow going it is now, they will be able to punch through that line. And that will become the most important point, where they will try to drive south and split those Russian forces along that Sea of Azov coastline, that land bridge, Isa.",

They say that they saw land mines, directional anti-personnel mines. So the direction of these land mines is important there. They are pointing away from the nuclear power plant. These are anti-personnel. So relatively small in terms of their explosive power. The IAEA saying, if they were to go off, they would likely not hurt the -- or have an effect on the nuclear safety or the security of the plant. Obviously, of great concern, though. The IAEA had been told previously that there were mines both inside and outside the plant. Ukraine has accused Russia of mining the roof of the plant in a poise to carry out a terror attack, which, of course, Russia denies. Now Isa, Russia has been in control of this plant almost since the beginning of this war. They have control of that area. So it of course is extremely worrying anytime you hear the word \"explosives\" or mines alongside a nuclear power plant. There was a statement from the IAEA after their visit. It really an extraordinary understatement about their concern, Isa. They said that this is inconsistent, they say, with the safety standards of nuclear security and the guidance. Clearly, they would much prefer those land mines not be anywhere near and the fighting not be anywhere near the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, Isa.",

Among other offenses, involving a South African flight school allegedly committed over 10 years ago. A 2017 grand jury indictment accuses Duggan of training the PRC pilots on how to land a jet on an aircraft carrier as well as other specialist maneuvers. The Test Flying Academy of South Africa denies any wrongdoing, saying all skills it teaches are, quote, \"strictly unclassified and no training involves classified tactics or other information nor any front line activities.\" But last month, the company was added to the Commerce Department's list of sanctioned entities for providing training to Chinese military pilots using Western and NATO sources. Duggan doesn't deny training Chinese pilots in South Africa but says they were civilian plane enthusiasts seeking to improve their skills. His supporters say he's being used as an example, as tensions flare between the U.S. and China.",

At least 18 people have been killed and 11 injured as gang related clashes continue inside the country's prisons. More than 100 prison guards reportedly held hostage inside the prisons have also been released. A state of emergency is in place across the prison system. It will last for the next 60 days. President has authorized police and the military to take control of the jails and restore order. Journalist Stefano Pozzebon joining me now from Bogota. And Stefano, I, mean this is all escalating very quickly. What more are you hearing from the attorney general here? STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yes, attorney general, Isa, has confirmed that at least 18 people were killed in clashes, since the clashes erupted on Saturday in the Litoral Penitentiary that is in the city Guayaquil, which is the second largest city in Ecuador. It's an economic powerhouse; 18 people dead in clashes inside the penitentiary. We can only presume that, as it opens up, in this case, is the majority of them are inmates who are fighting between themselves. What's happening in Ecuador is a turf war between competing criminal organizations and cartels, spawning from the Mexican cartels. The Albanian mafia is involved in Ecuador. Brazilian megagangs from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are all involved in the narco trafficking and the cocaine trade out of Ecuador and toward North America, Europe and Asia. It's interesting to note this news that 106 prisons guards have been released. They were being held since at least Sunday in five different penitentiaries across the nation. And we want to focus on that number, five penitentiaries. Ecuador is not a big place. But these penitentiaries were in several regions, several provinces of the country, which suggests that, really, the entire prison system, the entire prison serving the penitentiary and the entire underworld of the Ecuadorian crime is boiling with violence at the moment. The government has declared a state of emergency early today, for 60 days inside the prison system that allows police men and members of the military forces to enter the jail to try to regain control. They had already declared a state of emergency yesterday in the city of Manta and in the surrounding provinces, because the mayor of Manta, which is the six largest city in Ecuador, was slained (sic) on the streets on Sunday. You can see that the government has really very limited arsenal to try to come up on top of this escalations of violence. They ordered 24 million cartridges of ammunitions (sic) just in the month of June. Take a -- Ecuador has a population of about 17 million. So 24 million ammunitions (sic), 24 million bullets, it's actually a big number. To try to rein in this escalation of violence before the country is due to held (sic) its general elections on August 20. Isa.",
