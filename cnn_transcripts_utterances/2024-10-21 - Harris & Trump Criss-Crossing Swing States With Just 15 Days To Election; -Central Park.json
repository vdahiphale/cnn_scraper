I was going to say undecided is much less important at this point than the motivation to vote, to get out the vote effort, the voter contact effort that's been going on for months.And really, that is a significant and not so hidden advantage of the Harris campaign and the Democrats. They have had, by all measures, a superb get-out-the-vote effort. The Trump campaign has delegated a good deal of that to other organizations that may be well-funded, but that doesn't mean they know what they're doing or they're doing it very efficiently. So if this does, indeed, turn out to be as close as many of the polls suggest it will be, it's that additional increment of a half a 0.1 point 0.2 points that get out the vote can generate. And that's -- what I look at undecideds, they're conflicted. That's why they're still undecided. And a lot of them will decide not to vote because they are conflicted. And others are just covering for the fact that they don't follow politics and aren't very interested in it, and they also won't vote.",

The most recent CNN polling shows that Harris has a slight edge over Trump in all three. But it's still a tight race. As you see on the top right of your screen, there was no clear leader in these races. How much of a difference do you think can be made with just two weeks until Election Day?",

      "sentences": "Well, we always like to talk about October surprises. I don't think we're going to have a really big one. I'll be very surprised if we do.But October surprises come in different sizes and shapes. And so you do have a series of October surprises every presidential election that can move a few thousand votes here, a few thousand votes there. So I think that's critical. The other part of it that we often ignore is that, OK, Harris is relatively low with black males today, or relatively low with Hispanic males today, or relatively low with males between 18 and 30. And Trump is having a lot of problems with women of all ages, even white women. But you know, things change as partisan identification kicks in, as the actual Election Day approaches. And that's when many of the people who have been apathetic or don't know for whom they're going to vote or are only leaning slightly to one candidate or the other, actually firm up. And in the end, they're often fewer surprises than you think. The gender gap's an example. Many times, the gender gap has been shown in campaign after campaign to be enormous during the polling period in September and October. And then on Election Day, it's still substantial, but it's not nearly as big as it was projected to be by polling.",

KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, this lawsuit is about comments that Donald Trump made publicly at this presidential debate. At the debate in September in Philadelphia, Kamala Harris had brought up the fact that Donald Trump, just days after the Central Park Five were arrested for this assault in Central Park in 1989, he had put an ad in several newspapers, full-page, that said bring back the death penalty, bring back the police. And then Donald Trump responded at the debate just this year this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They had ultimately settled with New York City after being forced into giving false statements. They had gone to trial.And they are all saying now, they never pleaded guilty. They were cleared of the wrongdoing. No one was killed in this attack in 1989. And this has been a pattern from Donald Trump, dating the whole way back to the aftermath of that attack when these men were arrested, that he has wanted to intentionally harm them and cause them distress. And one of the plaintiffs, one of the men in the Central Park Five, he was at that debate in Philadelphia and even tried to approach Trump and they had what he said, or what his attorneys say, was they wanted to have some sort of polite discourse about what Trump had said in the moment on national television about these exonerated men. And Trump essentially blew him off. You wouldn't engage with them. So this lawsuit is the defamation case that they're bringing now to try and say, make us whole, stop intentionally lying, stop intentionally harming us. And of course, the context here is right before the campaign. There's quite an ongoing appeal among the campaigns to black men, specifically, a lot of discussion about crime. And then also, in this context, Donald Trump has been found liable for defamation before against E. Jean Carroll.",

But the committee and Roberson's lawyers have been adamantly opposed to that for days. They want Roberson to testify in person. In part, for several reasons. The lawyers want the committee to be able and the public to be able to assess Roberson's credibility as they see him face-to-face. The other issue is that they say Roberson has been diagnosed with autism. And because of that, communicating over Zoom they feel would not be fair to him. They also say that, given his condition, it's very difficult to -- for him to have conversations with people face-to-face. So they want the lawmakers on this committee and the public to be able to see Robert Roberson for themselves testifying in this situation. Now, the attorney general has been opposed to this in the court filings we've seen. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has been quiet on this case for days, filed a court filing this morning where he is essentially says that this House committee has stepped out of line with this subpoena requests, a subpoena that essentially halted this execution. And the governor is saying that any House committee in the future could do this exact same thing to basically cause an end-around any future executions here in the state. The legal drama will continue to play out. They are not giving up hope that Roberson might be able to figure out a way to testify in the future. One of the representatives even suggested that the lawmakers make a field trip to the Livingston, Texas, Prison where Robert Roberson is held for a field trip to do this testimony in-person there.",
