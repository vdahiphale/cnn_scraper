He's the embattled Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina. The campaign telling CNN tonight four of its top operatives have stepped down from their roles. Those exits coming just days after a bombshell CNN report uncovered racist, sexually graphic, and lewd comments made by Robinson on a porn Web site years ago. Robinson, writing in a statement tonight, quote, \"I appreciate the efforts of these team members who have made the difficult choice to step away from the campaign. And I wish them well in their future endeavors. I look forward to announcing new staff roles in the coming days.\" CNN KFile senior editor Andrew Kaczynski, who broke this story, joins us now with more details.

One of the most disturbing comments we found was him saying that he supported reinstating slavery. Robinson has also run as a very harsh anti-transgender candidate for office.And we found a comment in our story where he said he enjoyed watching transgender pornography. He's running as a socially conservative candidate, very anti-abortion. We found a comment where he said that he didn't care if a woman had an abortion. There was a lot of very sexually graphic stuff that we couldn't even publish in our story. And then we also found, you know, a whole number of comments like where he said he got sexual gratification from a memory of spying on women in public showers as a teenager. So just a whole lot of disturbing stuff there that we were able to trace to Robinson because he's used both the same username all across the Web that he used on that forum that is actual -- his name was listed on that forum.

But also number two, Jessica, it forces the Trump campaign to spend dollars in a state that under the ordinary set of circumstances you would expect a Republican to win and those resources could be spent and utilized in Pennsylvania, which we all know is a must-win state, not only for the vice president, but also for the former president, if they're trying to get to that magic number of 270.With that said, I am not surprised that the senior staffers of Mark Robinson have resigned. I mean, this guy is a disgrace to conservatism. He is clearly not authentically conservative. The Republicans in North Carolina had an opportunity, and Jessica, I keep saying this on our airwaves for days now, to nominate and go with former congressman and pastor, Mark Walker, someone who is a conservative, who would've ran an incredibly competitive race and particularly could have even won. I don't know. But yet they decided to go with Robinson. And from my conversations with people in North Carolina, many people knew that this guy had a troubled background, and yet they still risk not only the seat, but they also potentially risked the presidency by nominating this guy with a deplorable background. Now you run the risk of turning off Republican voters who may say, you know what, this is just too much chaos. I'm just going to sit this out. What are the implications for something like that for the top of the ticket, that being the former president Donald Trump? You also have to keep in mind the implications for the battleground -- for the lower tier tickets. Congressional races, state Senate, state House seats, all of those things are going to unfortunately be impacted by this one man and all he had to do was step down several days ago.

JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Of course it will because of course Donald Trump has yet to criticize Robinson even after all the horrible things that Andrew Kaczynski uncovered, and all the horrible things that we knew about even before Andrew Kaczynski covered them. Look, let me just say this, because this is so reminiscent of what happened to the Trump orbit back in 2020. All of a sudden Mark Robinson looks like he is not going to win. So his staff en mass decides they're going to resign not because they're offended by what he said because let's be very clear, he has said incredibly offensive things before as Shermichael pointed out, but because now it looks like they don't want a lost, they don't want a big L on their record. This is so similar to what happened in 2020 where Trump's staff stayed with him and stayed with him and stayed with him after Charlottesville, after all of the comments that he made throughout his presidency, and only after he lost, January 6th gave them the excuse to say, oh, we just (INAUDIBLE) from this guy. He's a bad guy. Well, listen, if you are with him throughout the entire four years of his term when he was doing unconscionable things, trying to open fire on protesters, I mean, the march down the White House after his loss, you know, the holding up the bible, if you were there for Charlottesville, and yet you stuck around. And after January 6th, when you knew that he wasn't going to get certified, you didn't want that loss on your record, suddenly you had some sort of moral epiphany about him. Same thing happened here with Mark Robinson. This staff resigning today I think is kind a disgrace because they had no problem sticking with him when he said that the holocaust was kind of not a big deal, when he said that some people, quote-unquote, \"need killing.\" Talking about I guess his own constituents. You know, to me, this is a little bit disingenuous and it's so completely symptomatic of the illness going on in our politics right now. And I just don't know why more people don't talk about this.",

You look at the cost of living, the economy, Donald Trump has an advantage. You look at crime, Donald Trump has an advantage. And one number that goes to Tom Cotton's point about people being concerned with just about cost of living, the economy, maybe even their futures, 66 percent said that they are afraid or worried about what future looks like for them economically. So while the top numbers look great for Harris, if I'm on the Trump campaign, I'm trying to figure out how do I articulate a message to voters who are concerned about the issues that I just laid out, particularly in a state like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, those really crucial states that the former president absolutely must win if he wants to go back to the White House.",

Is it really that difficult for Thom Tillis, the senator from North Carolina, who said, well, if this isn't true, then I guess that Mark Robinson should sue CNN and if it is true then he should I guess resign?Why not have said that before? Why not just say point blank this is not the kind of rhetoric we need in the Republican Party, and we distance ourselves from it? And we also think the president -- the former president should distance himself from it, too? Because Donald Trump has yet to say anything negative about Mark Robinson, and so these people are so desperately terrified of Donald Trump that they won't criticize him for not distancing himself for his own good from Mark Robinson, potentially to win the state of North Carolina/ Even at the expense of losing North Carolina, they're so afraid of him that they won't say that he needs to distance himself from somebody who said he wants to buy slaves. A black man saying he wants to buy slaves. I mean, is this really where the Republican Party is today? Look, I'm a Democrat, has been a lifelong Democrat, but I strongly, and I agree with Shermichael, we need a strong conservative party because we need two strong parties in this state. What the Republican Party is today is a cult and you just saw that with Tom Cotton saying what he said. This is not a party that has any kind of values other than whatever the president, former president of the United States wants to espouse. And I think it's sad, it's tragic.

And so I think a lot of those politicians are aware of this, Jessica, and are trying to sort of walk the line of not offending them, but pivoting to things that they believe most voters are ultimately concerned with. But look, I just want to say quickly, most conservative people, most Republican people, I do not believe were in a cult. I think there are a lot of Americans who are conservative, who are Republican, and they're good, decent people. Now, we can sort of raise the question of why certain voters would support someone like a Robinson, and that's complicated conversation we haven't have enough time for, but I don't want to insult every single American who happens to be Republican, who happens to also be conservative.

And so based upon that history, I really doubt that Trump will say something negatively about him. Maybe he'll say, you know, he's a weird guy, or he's an odd sort of guy.I mean, that's probably the best we're going to get out of the former president in that regard. But look, I think if you're looking at North Carolina and the data suggesting that this state is becoming more competitive to Julie's point, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to more directly and aggressively distance yourself from someone like a Robinson because you don't want to turn off some of those independent voters who may actually like Trump on the issues of the economy and immigration, and may strongly be considering voting for him but for Mark Robinson.

And there aren't any signs either side, Israel or Hezbollah, is prepared to back down.Early Sunday, Hezbollah launched the first of three volleys of rockets deeper inside Israel than any time since the beginning of hostilities last October. Hezbollah claimed the targets included the Ramat David Airbase and a defense factory outside Haifa. But it appears those rockets that weren't intercepted hit other areas, causing a few injuries and some damage to property. While Israel continues to strike targets in southern Lebanon, more than 300 between Saturday and Sunday. In Beirut, Hezbollah held a funeral for Ibrahim Aqil, one of the group's senior commanders killed along with more than a dozen other militants in an Israeli airstrike on southern Beirut Friday. The strike also killed more than 30 civilians including women and children. At the funeral, Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem vowed that Hezbollah's strikes deep inside Israel are an installment in what he called a battle without limits, and said, despite the pager and walkie-talkie attacks and Friday's airstrike in Beirut, the group will continue to fire into Israel. Israeli officials are making equally dire threats toward Hezbollah with Israeli army chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, saying, our strikes will intensify -- Jessica.",
