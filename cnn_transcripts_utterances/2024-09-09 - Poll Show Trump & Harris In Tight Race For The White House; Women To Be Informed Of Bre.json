New polling shows the race for the White House as tight as it can get, making the debate that is one sleep away even more consequential.A New York Times/Siena College poll showing there is no clear leader among likely voters between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Joining me now to discuss is Democratic strategist Doug Thornell and Republican strategist Neil Chatterjee. Thank you both for coming on. As you saw, there were 35 hours. Again, I think one sleep is a better way to say it, but that's just me. Mr. Chatterjee, I am going to start with you. Are you surprised that this is in a dead heat now?",

I think coming off the assassination attempt and the Republican convention, there had been a lot of momentum for former President Trump.That was obviously flipped when Vice President Harris was swapped in for President Biden as the nominee. And there was a lot of initial excitement and enthusiasm and momentum in her direction. Everyone sort of predicted at that time that as we would get into the fall, as we would get past Labor Day, the race would settle. And it's basically where it was before the first debate between former President Trump and President Biden that led to President Biden dropping out. It's been a stable race for a while, so this doesn't really surprise me.",

And I think that's really going to be an important point for her to make. Stay on the offense. Don't follow the shiny objects that Donald Trump is going to try to throw out there. And talk about the issues that matter and go on offense. And I think she's going to be fine. I think -- look, he's a very unpredictable debater. It's very hard to prepare for someone like that. He's done this six times before. So, he's -- he's obviously not going to be afraid of the lights. But she's got a real opportunity here.",

And in it, he goes after what he calls anybody who he thinks is going to basically defraud the election, who cheated, as he put it.And he talks about putting people in jail, including those members of the Department of Justice. Is this something that she needs to -- and this is first to you, Doug. Is this something that you think she needs to address that this idea that 2020 was stolen, that Donald Trump keeps pushing that, and now he's threatening people who are, you know, official pollsters and official folks that are going to be going through with this election. Is this something that she needs to address, or should she just stick to sort of what her policies are?",

I don't think he should focus on this in any way on the debate stage. He needs to make this about Vice President Harris, try and define her, pin her down on the economy, on the border, on crime, on her flip-flopping on various positions. I think any breaths he takes re-litigating 2020 will be a mistake. He's got to make this about defining the Vice President and the future.",

It was interesting that 28 percent of voters said when asked whether they still need to learn more about the candidate, 28 percent said they did need to learn more about Kamala Harris and where she stands. Only 9 percent said so for Donald Trump. What does she need to do here? That is a huge difference, and they want to know more about where she stands and also potentially who she is.",

Trump really has little room to grow here. He's largely pretty much defined, and a lot of the issues about him are baked in. She has a real opportunity with this debate. There's going to be tens of millions of people watching to lay out a very clear vision for the future on the middle class, what she's going to do for the middle class, what she's going to do to protect our national security, what she's going to do to keep our community safe. So this, I see that as a positive sign. She's been in this race for, what, eight weeks? So of course, there's still more that she needs to do, and that's why there's a debate and there's still, you know, two months to go in this campaign.",

The FDA is requiring that all patients who get mammograms to be notified of their breast density, a key risk factor in detecting breast cancer.CNN's Jacqueline Howard has much more on this for us. She's joining us right now. Jacqueline, talk about the importance of this change and what it means. JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN REPORTER (on-camera): Yes, Kate. Well, knowing your breast density is so important for two reasons, one, we know that having dense breasts is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. But number two having dense breasts can also make it more difficult to read a mammogram itself. The reason why breast density is a measurement of how much fibro glandular tissue you have in your breasts compared with fatty tissue and the more fibroglandular tissue the denser the breasts but that fibroglandular tissue can appear white on a mammogram in the same way a tumor or a lump may appear. So, in some cases it can mask or hide signs of cancer. So that's why knowing your breast density is so important with this new rule that goes into effect tomorrow, Kate, it will make it a national uniform standard for all patients to have their Breast Density Information on their mammogram result letter. In some states, 39 states in Washington, D.C., they already have this requirement at the local level. But what changes here Kate is now this will be a national requirement for all patients. That's the takeaway.",
