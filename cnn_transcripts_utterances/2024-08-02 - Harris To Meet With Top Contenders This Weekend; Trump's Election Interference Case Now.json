Look at how quickly she could move and how the case may change to please the High Court. Later, our Gary Tuchman in Appalachia, talking with people who know JD Vance, not just as Donald Trump's running mate, but also as the kid next door. Good evening, everyone. John King in Washington tonight, in for Anderson tonight. Just 12 days since President Biden decided not to seek a second term, his vice president is now in all but title the democratic nominee for president. Today, Kamala Harris went over the top in virtual balloting, securing enough support from Democratic delegates to win her party's nomination. Meaning when Democrats convene later this month in Chicago, she will become the first Black woman and first Asian- American, yes, both, to lead a major presidential party ticket. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are excited about the future, but we also know that we got a lot of work to get there, and we have a lot of work to do. It's good work, we like hard work. I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Now that she will be our party's nominee, I couldn't be prouder.\" Now, a big consequential weekend for Harris, settling on a running mate.A source familiar with the vetting process tells us she will interview the six top finalists you see right there. With Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz described as the top recommendations from her team. The official rollout, next Tuesday in Philadelphia, some see that as a clue. Others just stay smart, battleground state for the first stop. We will know soon. The campaign today also announcing it had raised $310 million last month compared to $138 million for the Trump campaign. That is proof, real proof of new Democratic optimism. But also some worrying news today on a different money front. Stocks plummeting following anemic jobs numbers to an economy is just what the Federal Reserve wants right now to tame inflation. But for Harris, talk of a slowdown may not be helpful. As voters think about issue number one, the economy and consider whether they think Harris or Donald Trump would do a better job on it. Perspective now, from Trump 2016 campaign official, Bryan Lanza, 2016, Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona, and Tolu Olorunnipa, White House bureau chief for \"The Washington Post.\" Robby, you've been through this. She has the book as they call it. Eric Holder, the former attorney general led the vetting process. She has the book. Now, she has to go through staff questions first, interviews this weekend, you've been through it. What do you think should be criteria number one? This person can get me a swing state.
