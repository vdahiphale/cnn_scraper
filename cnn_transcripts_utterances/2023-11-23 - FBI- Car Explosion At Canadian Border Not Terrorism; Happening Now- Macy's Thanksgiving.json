Incidents are spiking. Students on campus, feel threatened, receive threatening notes, have to listen to people protesting globalize the Intifada, which was a wave of suicide bombings, and they have to hear that that's going to be globalized on their campus. It's the same evil that we hear when we see tiki torches and Jews will not replace us just from a different side.But how do we respond to it? That's our choice.
