And she brought those talents, and along with being the one who paid all the bills in the house and, you know, wrote all the letters and he was the archivist, if you like.They came to Washington and it was a breath of fresh air. It was exemplified on the inaugural when they walked down Pennsylvania Avenue together and she created this new role, actually created the East Wing in the White House with the First Lady Chief of Staff. And she would sit in on meetings and be a key advisor.

And instead, she kind of started really becoming tough. She saw she had to defend her husband.She hated losing. It's a sign of her people don't see. In fact, when Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980, she was more upset, more bitter than her husband, but she gained her chops going out there and meeting people and she was good at it. And in fact, in 1980 when President Carter really was a lot of time in the White House dealing with the Iran hostage crisis, as Rosalynn Carter traveled the country, state after state, shaking everybody's hands and really becoming the best surrogate that Jimmy Carter had. This love of her translated when her book, \"A First Lady from Plains\" was published. It outsold Jimmy Carter's book, \"Keeping Faith.\" It's one of the, I think, one of the finest, if not the finest written memoir by a First Lady.

The IDF's ability to continue its operation in Gaza and the credibility of Israel are at stake here, as the number killed in the fighting surpasses 12,000, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The IDF says one of its missions is to destroy Hamas, but with international criticism mounting, Israel has to show the terror organization is using Gaza's civilians and infrastructure as cover to justify an ongoing war.

At the same time, the IDF had its daily press briefing earlier this evening in which they said they had more information about three of the hostages taken on October 7th. One of those was 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano. They say they know she was brought in alive, that she was injured in an Israeli strike that killed her captor. And they say she was then taken into the hospital, where they say she was then murdered by Hamas in the hospital itself. To this point, they had simply said she had been murdered. Now they say -- now they give a little more detail about how they believe she was murdered based on intelligence. They also say they have video from October 7th of Hamas bringing a Nepali hostage and a Thai citizen who was a hostage into the hospital. And it may be a surprise that there were Nepali or Thais here, but many of them come to Israel to work as migrant workers on the farms.

There have been a number of false starts in the past when it comes to these hostage negotiations. They are extremely delicate. There are a number of different parties involved, including the Qataris, the United States, and of course Hamas. And so that makes it extremely complicated. And another sticking point here that we're told is that the dynamics of actually getting fuel, getting aid into the civilians in Gaza during that four to five day pause, that is a key sticking point in terms of the logistics. How is that actually going to happen? How is that aid going to get in? And so, there are a number of key points here that are still yet to be worked out, but all of the parties involved, including the United States, including the Qataris, they seem to be very optimistic that there is a chance for a large number, scores of these hostages to be released in the coming days and we should note that it is expected that the first hostages to be released will likely be women and children.",

First ladies are much closer to the American public than their husbands are.And so, she absolutely laid the groundwork for women like Dr. Biden and Hillary Clinton who are changing the role of first lady, Dr. Biden by working outside of the White House, which is pretty remarkable, and I'm sure Rosalynn Carter would really envy that in many ways. But she was also her husband's biggest supporter and she did so much for the Carter Center. After they left the White House, of course, when I interviewed her, she had tears in her eyes when she talked about eradicating Guinea worm disease, this terrible disease that afflicted so many people in Africa. What they did with the Carter Center was absolutely incredible. And they are the most humble former president and first lady you would ever meet. Their house is absolutely normal. There's a lot of things that have been said about it, but I can attest that they are a rare example of a president and first lady who didn't profit from the presidency in the same way that we've seen other presidents.

So, she could be a very tough politician. But what she cared about was faith, family, and making real change. And I think for her, mental health is how she would most want to be remembered. But she saved countless lives. And she was right by his side, as one of their friends told me, digging latrines in Africa, helping build houses for habitat for humanity. And they could be found in Plains, Georgia holding hands, walking down the street. You know, they were very humble people, and what you saw is what you got. It was her idea to have the Camp David Peace Accords. The famous summit happened at Camp David because she thought it would be a great way to get the Egyptian and the Israeli leader together, and that's one of the longest lasting peace agreements in that part of the world.

KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYSTSo, they're proceeding very carefully and doing things like -- the video clip that the IDF released that Aaron talked about, they gathered that from security footage, allegedly from inside the hospital. That means someone had to sit down and watch thousands of hours of security footage since October 7th to find those two alleged hostages. Now, I'm interested in hearing from the countries from which they've been kidnapped to see if they also confirm that, yes, those are pictures of our hostages confirming what Israel claims because, of course, Israel has been just in a couple of incidents in the past caught out saying one thing and then later backtracking.
