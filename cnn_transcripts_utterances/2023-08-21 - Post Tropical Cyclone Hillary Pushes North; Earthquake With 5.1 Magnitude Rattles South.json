Right now, flood watches are in effect for morethan 25 million people from southern California to northern Idaho as post tropical cyclone Hillary pushes north. Earlier Hillary's torrential rains triggered catastrophic flooding and record-shattering rainfall in parts of Southern California. Some of the heavy rain caused huge fast-moving mudslides like this, like what you see here. This is east of Los Angeles. Leann Coulter shared this dramatic video on social media. This was from Sunday. The images were just as bad in Mexico, where at least one person was killed. Heavy rain and flooding hit the Baja Peninsula before moving north into the U.S. on Sunday. And amid the record- breaking storm and chaos, as if they weren't already dealing with enough, then had a 5.1-magnitude earthquake rattling Southern California on Sunday, as well. The epicenter was in Ojai and it's located north west of Los Angeles. There are no immediate reports of injuries or serious damage. CNN's Stephanie Elam is tracking the storm east of Los Angeles in Cathedral City, California. We've also got journalist David Shortelle in Mexico. Stephanie, let me start with you. The storm has technically dissipated, but at this point, is there still a risk of life-threatening flooding at this point? Walk us through that.",

This is a pretty big intersection where I'm standing, where you could get to the interstate highway to get on Interstate 10. But you can see this looks like it wouldn't be a road, but it is a road and it is muddy and disgusting. And in some places, it's very deep. And yet we saw a truck just come make its way through here, which they're not supposed to do because the roads are barricaded and they were very happy and proud of themselves. And then they made that turn and they hit the police officers there who were blocking the road. Didn't hit them, but they stopped them. And now, they're impounding their truck. This is exactly what they don't want people to do, to come out and think that this is some sort of joyriding that they can do here because it takes up resources for one thing and it's dangerous. And if you turn around and look at this other direction here, these cars have been impacted in this mud overnight. You can see that they're just docked there. They've been there. That little black car went flying by, spraying up all kinds of mud around the barricade. And you see how far she got. She got stuck there. Now, she'll be there for hours. Down the road, you see semi-trucks. There's a police car that is stuck there, as well. I mean, Zain, we're talking about a year's worth of rain in about a 24-hour period here in the Coachella Valley, in the desert. They are not used to getting this much rain. It was the wettest day, the rainiest day that they have had here in a hundred years of records in the summertime. So, that just shows you how bad it was. All the major ways into Palm Springs are cut off right now because they're dealing with this flooding in the aftermath and this mud, which is really, it's so thick, it feels like quicksand. Like it just like sucks your boots in and it's hard to get out. And that's what's affecting these cars here. But luckily, we have not heard about any deaths, but we have heard about three water rescues that happened overnight. But it just shows you, even though the sun is up now, this is why schools are closed because people will not be able to get around, Zain.",

It's not nearly as powerful as it was, but where is it headed to now? DEREK VAN DAM, CNN Meteorologist: Yeah, so, much of the western U.S. being impacted by the remnants of what was Tropical Storm Hillary. A lot of rain still to fall from this, but certainly not over the heavily impacted Southern California regions where scenes like this unfolded within the past 24 hours. And I just want you to see how dangerous these mudslides and debris slides can be. It literally picks up anything in its path from boulders to full trees, even vehicles and houses, and it can rush over 65 kilometers per hour as the water gets literally impacted and funneled through all these cracks canyons and into the ravines and causes this rapid rise in small creeks and streams. We get that terrain flooding, but anytime there's leftover burn scars from previous wildfires that changes the landscape of this mountainous terrain for years to come after the fire and the surface of the earth becomes what is called hydrophobic, meaning that it repels water. So, the water literally just sheets off the top of it as if it was falling on pavement, for instance, and picks up everything in its path. That's what makes those so dangerous. Here's the remnants. Tropical Storm Hillary, this is a post tropical now. What you need to know is that this produced a significant amount of rain and some of the higher elevations of Southern California and of course that rush down into the valleys below and caused the scenes you saw just a moment ago but kind of parsing out this information this is just incredible in Palm Springs they did receive or nearly received a full year's worth of rain in just a 24- hour period. San Diego had one of the five rainiest days in over 100 years during the summer months and Los Angeles had a rainy summer day ever recorded. So, yeah, that's impactful, right? Look at the amount of weather alerts still impacting much of the western U.S. This is the latest radar. We still have one flash flood warning in southern Nevada, but the rain has largely come to an end in and around Los Angeles, and certainly into San Diego as well, as the storm system kind of just gets caught up in the upper-level winds, starts to move around an area of high pressure, and moves eastward. And I wanna show you this as well, Zain, because while we have had an active Eastern Pacific storm system so far, year, year -- hurricane year, but look at the Atlantic, really starting to light up like a Christmas tree. We have several areas of potential tropical activity that we are monitoring for the days ahead. Zain.",

But, today, Zain, will really be the opportunity for President to correct that and to show that signature empathy that he has been known for throughout his political life. And that will be a major goal for the President as he heads to Maui today to survey the damage and also to meet, of course, with first responders, local officials, as well as survivors and victims' families. The President will begin his trip to Maui with a helicopter tour, an aerial tour to be able to see the damage from up above. He will then land in Lahaina, where we expect him to get an on-the-ground tour of that hard-hit area over there. The President will also deliver remarks where he will talk about the enduring federal response and as part of that he is set to designate the FEMA Administrator for that region -- Bob Fenton, excuse me, as the chief federal response coordinator for this disaster, a move that is intended to signal that this is gonna be a long-term effort and that the federal government is indeed in it for the long-haul. The President will then meet privately along with the First Lady, survivors and victims' families as well as First Responders and volunteers who have been assisting in the recovery efforts. Now, beyond the President's silence during those days, there have also been criticism from some residents there who feel like the federal response was too slow. So, that is also something that the President will have to confront, but his message would be to say that the federal government is there for the long-term. He will point to the fact that there are more than a thousand federal personnel already on the ground. More than $8 million have already been dispersed and millions perhaps even billions of dollars more of federal aid expected to be dispersed in the future. Zain.",

Right now, they could potentially be used to dent Russian air superiority over the front lines in the south of the country where so much of the Ukrainian counteroffensive is pushing. That could potentially speed up Ukraine's advance from the pace that's now accepted, I think, by most people as being slower than anybody in Ukraine's side would like to see. Russia was able to use its jets to drop significant amounts of munitions upon troops and even civilian cities, too. And so, F-16s could potentially challenge that and could potentially allow Ukraine, too, to use air power to push Russian troops back, to balance things up slightly at the moment. But that isn't going to happen. Because even now with this recent flurry of European statements, the Danish saying 19 jets are on their way, only six this year, the Netherlands saying they have 42, probably give quite a lot of those to Ukraine but need to keep some back for the training of Ukrainians. Even with that happening, we're still at the best of times not going to see jets in Ukraine skies until early next year. And that's even, too, if Ukrainian pilots manage to pull off an exceptionally fast training program. Remember, these are high-tech things. You want pilots who fly them to be good at that, to be able to deliver what they can do in the best way possible. And so, while I think what we've seen again is a very familiar pattern, Zain, of demands from Ukraine that have originally been shunned as far too much by NATO members slowly being heard as the pressure builds and then a sudden flurry of compensation. We're not seeing anything actually materializing here until a later stage next year when we simply don't know where the war will be. Could it be that Ukraine has achieved its goals and pushed through breaking the land corridor, getting to the Azov Sea and separating the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia in 2014 from the rest of occupied Ukraine and the Russian mainland? That's their goal but it seems distant at the moment. Instead, we might see a winter in which the current front lines have concretized. People are digging in and essentially the F-16s may be more about trying to patrol the skies of Ukraine and keep civilians safer. So, a lot of questions aren't really answering frankly about what they might be able to do when they get here. The key thing to remember is they're not going to get here anytime soon despite the urgency that they're needed. Zain.",

The reports by Human Rights Watch alleges that starting last March, border guards used explosive weapons to kill hundreds of Ethiopian migrants, many of them, by the way, at close range, migrants who tried to cross into the Gulf Kingdom from Yemen.

We initially researched the whole route, so running from Ethiopia across the Gulf of Aden or Red Sea into Yemen and onwards to Saudi Arabia. There was a bigger piece of research we put out some months ago actually. But then more information came our way, information that's being collected by community informants operating in northern Yemen. More information came our way on what's happening precisely at the border. Some of our interviews already alluded to it. So, we decided to do additional research. We interviewed more returnees, witnesses, survivors who were returned to Ethiopia, but -- that crossed the border to Saudi Arabia before. And they spoke of their first-hand experiences and everybody had witnessed people around them dying. Everybody had experienced these shootings at the border. They've all seen mass graves, very shallow graves where Ethiopians are buried. So really, as you said, I mean, we've been researching migration for more than 15 years, including this particular route, but this is by far the most distressing piece of research I ever worked on. One of the things that stood out just in terms of your conversation with our producers is that prior to 2022, and it's worth noting that Saudi Arabia has issued blanket denials, by the way. But based on your research, prior to last year, these sort of killings were random, ad hoc, somewhat infrequent. After 2022, what you noted, just in terms of your research, was that these killings became much more systematic, much more targeted. Just walk us through, I mean, and it might be difficult to sort of know the answer to this, but what exactly changed last year from the Saudi perspective?",

So, maybeto some extent this was already happening before. But the U.N. put also out a communication back in October 2022. And basically, what was more common, people were killed before at this border, but it was more sporadic and occasional. And what was more common is that people might be caught in the crossfire between the parties to the conflict. So, as you say, what we are seeing from the evidence that we have is that this became much more widespread, much more systemic from 2020 to onwards. I mean, why this is happening, that's hard to say. Of course, this is a highly securitized border. So, there might be still concerns that rebels might be crossing the border. But then again, I think it's quite clear that this is deliberate, this is targeted towards migrants. But it's really hard to say why exactly this is happening. And I think there's only one way to find out and that will be asking the Saudis. But that question has been asked to the Saudis. And so far, as you said earlier, the allegations are rejected.",

One of them took a lot of people by surprise, Daniel Noboa, who is the son of a business tycoon, one of the richest families in Ecuador, certainly an outsider. Nobody really expected him to do this well, but he had a surprisingly good debate performance, and that led to many Ecuadorians rallying around him. Patrick, we'll go through it.",

Yeah, that's what he wants. And certainly there has been a vacuum left by Usain Bolt, who dominated track and field for what, three Olympic cycles. And so, that vacuum is there to be filled by somebody. He would love it to be him. He's 26. He's already running faster than Bolt was at his age. Remember, his preferred event is the 200 meters. He has won the last two 200 meters. at the World Championships. So, later this week, he's going to try and make it three in a row. If he snags that, he would be the first man since, bold in 2015 to win the one and the two at the World Championships. But really, he wants to leave here with three gold medals running in the relay, as well, for the American team.
