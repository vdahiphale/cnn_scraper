      "sentences": "Yes, incredibly cautious, the president was there. And I think that's because of the enormous implications of what this would mean. The president says it was unlikely that this missile originated in Russia. Now there are two countries in this region that are using Russian-made missiles in this conflict. One is Russia and one is Ukraine.And so certainly these leaders when they met behind closed doors today did go over the assessments of what they knew about where this missile originated. And what American officials say is that they have pretty good intelligence on this sort of thing. They can track these missiles' trajectory, where they began, obviously where they ended. Now a White House National Security Council spokesperson earlier today said that they were going to support Poland in its investigation. Certainly they want to allow that investigation to proceed, and as we understand it, that is still very much underway on the ground collecting pieces from this missile, trying to put it back together to see exactly what happened. And these leaders will want to be sure they are absolutely certain they know where this missile came from before they come out and say so officially. Now the reason for that is because Poland is a member of NATO and if Russia were to have launched a strike that landed in Poland, that could potentially evoke NATO Article 5, which is the Collective Defense Treaty, an attack on one is an attack on all. And that would be an enormous escalation of this conflict and President Biden certainly doesn't want to do that unless he's absolutely positive that that is what happened. Now we do know that NATO ambassadors are meeting in Brussels today. This intelligence will also be discussed at that meeting as well. They are considering evoking Article 4. You hear a lot about Article 5. Article 4 is the Treaty of Mutual Conference -- Mutual Consultation. So they will want to talk with each other about what the next steps are. President Biden is on his flight back to Washington. It's a 24- hour flight. But this is certainly something that he will be talking about plenty with his National Security aides and potentially with other leaders before he gets back to D.C. -- Christine.",

      "sentences": "Well, those talks have gotten underway here. And what we're talking about here, Christine, are the 30 ambassadors, all the 30 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They've met this emergency meeting going on even now. The first thing that they're doing is looking at that intelligence. As you say, all we know is that this missile has landed on Polish space. Also that it is a Russian-made munition.The question is, of course, who fired it and where it was fired from. Now we do know that there was a NATO aircraft that was overflying Polish air space at the time. It was able to track that missile and will be able to provide a very clear picture. That intelligence has now been passed on not just to Poland but of course here to NATO officials as well. So we should have a fairly clear idea fairly quickly of those very important details as Kevin was just explaining because of course the next steps are sufficiently escalatory that they have to be extremely careful about the intelligence and their assessment of exactly what went on. We should have a better idea of exactly what that is in the next couple of hours since Jen Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, is due to hold a press conference once these talks are done. What we also know at this hour, Christine, is that Poland has both increased its level of military preparedness as a result of this missile landing on its territory, and is also considering invoking that Article 4. It wouldn't be the first time. It was invoked in fact at the start of the war by eight NATO countries. It simply means that consultations begin around what is of course an extremely worrying development.",

In fact, the diplomats in charge of the relationship that Russia has with the United Nations, the ambassador to the U.N., has gone on the record saying that this incident was, quote, \"an attempt to provoke,\" as he said a military clash between NATO and Russia. That's the official line from current serving officials in Russia who overnight have repeatedly denied Russia would have any reason to want to fire a missile into NATO territory, across the border from where obviously in Ukraine it rained down about 100 missiles yesterday. One of the biggest, strongest barrages that Ukraine has faced yet coming from Russia.But if you look at some of the former officials like the former Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev no less, well, the rhetoric gets slightly more worrying here. He's taken to Twitter just a couple of hours ago, describing this incident involving this missile that fell on Polish territory as, quote, \"Proving one thing, that in waging a hybrid war against Russia the West moves closer to world war.\" The that type of rhetoric, as you can imagine, will probably be alarming to officials who are around the table in Brussels where Melissa is. It will be alarming to officials who'll meet later on today when the U.N. Security Council will convene this afternoon, London Time, morning time if you are in the United States and New York. But, this is why the investigation will now continue at very fast pace to determine which missile landed. Even if it was even Russian made, remember that Ukraine and Russia's post-Soviet countries do use the same types of missiles, one for offensive reasons, Russia, and then for defensive reasons, Ukraine. So the question is, which fragments will they find on the scene, and that will determine further Russian responses from here -- Christine?",

And yes, the lake- effect snow machine is going to be cranking in full effect across parts of the Great Lakes here with winter weather alerts and spanning across parts of 15 states.But some of these areas we'll see four to eight inches of snowfall every single day, each of the next three days. And the elements are in place here where we have really cold air going right over portions of relatively warm waters here across the Great Lakes as we see this time of year, and that transition and transfer of energy, really downstream, produces the significant snowfall totals where we're expecting 18 to 24 inches near Buffalo, points southward near Erie as well. And work your way towards portions of interior New England as much as six to eight inches are expected in the coming several days as well. But yes, the temperatures is really going to be the big talk of town here with wind chills this morning in the 20s in spots. And it only gets colder in the next several days across the Great Lakes, and we get another reinforcing shot of cold air going into this weekend. So these temperatures, you think it's cold in Chicago today. It should be 48 this time of year. The best you can do today is 37. Down to 32 for a high come Thursday and even the 20s. We're talking February-like cold in some of these areas over the next couple of days. In New York city, Christine, 54 is normal. Close to it today.
