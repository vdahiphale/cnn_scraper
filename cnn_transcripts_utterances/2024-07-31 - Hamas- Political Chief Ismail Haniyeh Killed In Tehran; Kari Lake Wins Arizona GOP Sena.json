And Haniyeh had really been considered the interlocutor that was more likely to agree to a deal.So we are seeing, certainly from Qatar's point of view, surprise that this has happened at a time when those talks were really appearing to make some progress. Early on Sunday, there were -- there was a meeting between Qatar-Egypt, the two mediators, and the United States and Israel. Now, we have heard from the hostage families themselves pushing for this deal to go ahead -- wanting to see the hostages released in return for a ceasefire and potentially, thousands of Palestinian prisoners released, but many experts are now questioning whether this can go ahead. Certainly, in the short term, it seems unlikely. We have heard some very fiery comments and statements from Hamas officials after this assassination calling it a grave escalation, saying it will not pass in vain. Also, hearing from the Iranian supreme leader saying that \"You killed our dear guest in our house. We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.\" Jessica.",

That strike reportedly involving an airborne-guided projectile that killed him where he was staying in Tehran. Iran is blaming Israel for that strike. So far, Israel has remained quiet. We just learned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a security assessment in Tel Aviv later today.And, of course, we're going to continue to follow this story throughout the morning. We will bring you any new developments as we get them. Turning now to politics. Kari Lake clinching the Arizona Republican Senate nomination. The controversial conservative firebrand beating out Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye in last night's primary election. She's going to take on Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego this fall. It's a key race that could decide the balance of power in the Senate. In her speech last night, Lake gave a special thanks to former President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE, (R) ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE:  I think we all share one common hero, and I think I'm safe to say that we think of our favorite president, Donald J. Trump, as a hero, right? This is not a battle between Democrats and Republicans. This is a battle between good and evil. This is a battle between the people who want to destroy this country and the people who want to save America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we've actually seen both of them try to moderate on a few issues.We've seen Kari Lake, for example, on the issue of abortion. She has tried to kind of step away from her harder stance that she had in the past. She has said that she's opposed to a national abortion ban, for example, and was in favor of a more moderate Arizona law after an initial old law came into play earlier this year. And the same thing for Ruben Gallego, especially on the border issue -- another issue that's very important in Arizona as a border state. We've seen him as well try to say that he is for stronger border security, trying to step away from maybe past comments where he has been more lenient on border policy. And so it's been something that's been fascinating to watch and, of course, they're both pointing fingers. It will be interesting to see whether, especially, Kari Lake has a real shot at winning at this point. It seems like Gallego still tends to be doing better in the polls. There's not a lot of faith in Kari Lake's campaign when you talk to Senate Republican leadership. They see other states that's more likely for pickup seats for Republicans than Arizona.",

And, of course, we've seen Republicans immediately go after Kamala Harris for her role in dealing with the border. And back in 2021, Biden did give her an important portfolio -- an important part of the border issue to handle, focusing on Central America nations where, at the time, most of the migration was coming from. That was during the migrant child crisis early in the administration. It was definitely an important role for her, but it was not to address all of the complicated border nuances and domestic policy as well. But we do see Republicans trying to take the role that she did have and kind of give her responsibility for all that has happened at the border. And there is -- this is going to be an issue for Kamala Harris no matter what because she's part of the Biden administration and she is going to have to make clear whether she supports the actions that President Biden has taken on the border or whether she's going to take a different direction. And I do think we're going to have to -- we're going to see her make that very clear and we're starting to see that in some of these early ads.",

So this is a very dark day for the families of the hostages right now.As for the assassination itself, Israel seldom comments on these things.

Did they have any foreknowledge of this? Perhaps, maybe -- we simply don't know. Did Israel go ahead and kill a leading Hamas negotiator in negotiations the U.S. has invested months and huge amounts of capital? Did they simply kill someone without tell the U.S. first? Huge questions for the U.S. to answer -- and I think questions potentially over their relationship with Israel after the less-than- positive Netanyahu visit to Washington in the last week or so. So that's a key question we need to hear an answer from the Biden administration. The next question is how does Iran respond -- essentially, saying their supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, a guest in their house, had been killed, and vowing harsh punishment against Israel. But its options are limited. He's 85. He's just seen a more moderate president sworn in than he perhaps would have liked after years of unrest internally. He's seen potentially a drone strike against Israel in April intercepted by Israel and its allies. And may be reluctant to play the one card they have -- their proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon to the north of Israel unless utterly vital. So, many questions here and I think a lot of them will be answered when we started hearing the details of exactly how this killing occurred -- Jessica.",
