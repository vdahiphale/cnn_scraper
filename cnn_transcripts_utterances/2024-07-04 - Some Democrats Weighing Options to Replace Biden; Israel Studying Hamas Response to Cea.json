If you're just joining us, some top stories today.Hurricane Beryl has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm, pushing its way across the Caribbean. Beryl is currently passing by the Cayman Islands. It's expected to make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday. Voting underway in the U.K., with polls set to close at 10 p.m. London time. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak heads the Conservatives, and the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, will have much more on that throughout the day. And the U.S. president admits the next few days will be crucial in convincing Democrats he's their best candidate to beat Donald Trump. Joe Biden met with governors on Wednesday, who say despite his poor debate performance, the president is in it to win it. Some Democrats already gaming out potential ways to replace President Biden, though, as the party's nominee, CNN's Brian Todd, has that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): If President Biden leaves the race, analysts say it would almost certainly have to be his decision to bow out voluntarily. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: It is unlikely that if Joe Biden does not step down voluntarily, that there would be a different nominee at the top of the ticket. TODD (voice-over): If he doesn't voluntarily leave, someone in the Democratic Party could try to replace him by introducing an open nomination process at the Democratic National Convention in August. But that scenario is unlikely. Still, even if the president decides on his own to quit the race, the process for replacing him is uncertain and somewhat messy.",

But does he have control over who they support if he is out of the race? KANNO-YOUNGS: It is not like Joe Biden can say, OK, I'm stepping down, all of you delegates that signed on for me have to now support this other candidate. That is not how it works. Those delegates would essentially be free to move the way they want. TODD (voice-over): Like the days of old, backroom deals and lobbying could prevail at the convention as potential nominees try to convince the delegates to get behind them. In the end, how many of the 3,900 delegates would a candidate have to win at the convention to get the nomination?",

It would all mean a late start for any candidate, including in the money race. If Vice President Kamala Harris won the nomination, she would presumably be able to use Biden's campaign war chest because her name is on all the filings.

But the deal is still not finalized, nor is it assured.Israel says it's evaluating the latest response from Hamas after it was delivered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Hamas says it dealt with the proposal, quote, positively, and repeated its demand for a complete cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Israeli officials believe the latest response from Hamas will enable the two parties to begin negotiating the specific details of a deal. Israeli negotiators are set to meet with the country's political leadership, including the prime minister, over the coming days to decide on next steps.

Drones and missiles pummeled the city on Wednesday morning, killing at least six people and leaving several others injured. Ukraine says the attack destroyed a medical clinic and damaged other buildings, including schools and a children's hospital, while starting multiple fires. That's despite the fact that Ukraine says it shot down 11 drones and missiles. Ukraine's president later said only two things can preserve strikes -- prevent, rather, strikes like these, modern air defenses and long- range capabilities for Ukraine to hit back. More U.S. military hardware will soon be heading to Ukraine. Washington's announced a new batch of military aid worth about $2.3 billion. It includes artillery rounds, interceptor missiles and anti- tank weapons, which will be taken directly from U.S. military stocks. That's the fifth aid package since Congress approved about $61 billion in aid for Kyiv in April. The U.S. has provided close to $54 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the war began.
