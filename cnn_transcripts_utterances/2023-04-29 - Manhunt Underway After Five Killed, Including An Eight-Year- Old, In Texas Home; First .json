And we begin with this breaking news on the manhunt underway right now. Police in Cleveland, Texas are looking for a suspect connected to the shooting deaths of five people including an eight-year-old. At least three others were wounded in the attack. And now the search is on for the suspect who took off before police arrived on the scene. CNN's Ryan Young is following all of this for us. So, what more are we learning about the suspect? Whereabouts? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Look, troubling details on this. We've been following this for hours. We do have an update. We've been given a name at this point. Francisco Oropeza is the name that the sheriff is looking for at this point. Talking about the five people who have been shot and killed. You see the man's image up on the screen. They are still actively looking for him. This all started with a 9/11 call over like a noise disturbance. Apparently, he was on his porch firing a weapon. Neighbors asked him to stop shooting. He then at some point, according to the sheriff's department went inside a home. They have ring camera footage of this and started shooting people execution style. In fact, take a listen to the sheriff early on in this investigation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right. And this, now just in to CNN. The first U.S.-led effort to evacuate private American citizens from Sudan. And the conflict there has just been completed. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. So, Oren, what can you tell us about this evacuation? Because for a very long time, and we heard her from, you know, various authorities within the Biden administration that there would not be any efforts to get American private citizens out of Sudan. So, obviously, there was something underway.OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Very much so and we'll get to how this played out over the last couple of days in a moment. This was a convoy from the capital of Khartoum hours long convoy over hundreds of miles to get them from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, over to Port Sudan where there are U.S. Navy ships and other ships waiting to assist from there. The State Department says from there, it'll take these American citizens, locally employed staff and others and take them to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia where there are more American personnel there to help them with travel on to other destinations. All of this happens, as you rightly point out, as we heard increasing anger from U.S. citizens in Sudan about what they felt was a lack of help from the U.S. government and from the State Department on either getting out of the country or finding other forms of assistance. And this as we watched countries from all over the world send in their aircraft, send in their convoys to get their own citizens out and to help U.S. citizens get out. Crucially, the State Department didn't say how many buses or other vehicles on this convoy they had sent in or how many Americans had been evacuated. They only say that through this effort and the other efforts with partner countries, partner aircraft, partner convoys, they have to this point evacuated hundreds of U.S. citizens. Remember, it was last weekend where we saw military helicopters go in to Khartoum and evacuate U.S. embassy staff, family members and several others, less than 100. The U.S. government had said but since then they have insisted it was too dangerous to send in other military personnel or other assets to evacuate American citizens. So, we see this convoy carried out. Defense Department says they had assets watching overhead, surveillance assets and we'll have Navy ships able to help import Sudan. So, how did this play out over the last several days? On Thursday, several American citizens had gotten e-mails that said the U.S. government is planning to assist U.S. nationals and immediate family members with valid U.S. travelled documents in the coming days perhaps as early as tomorrow. Then on Friday, those who had registered and were looking to leave got information. CNN has learned telling them to prepare food, water, travel essentials, limited to one travel bag only. They were then instructed to meet at a golf course, where they were led out through on this convoy to Port Sudan. Again, an hours long journey over hundreds of miles to get them safely to Port Sudan where they'll get help from there. Meanwhile, the state department says for those who were not on this convoy, but are still looking for help, get in touch with the State Department as quickly as possible. Fredricka, that seems to suggest there may be more convoys, more efforts to try to get out more American citizens if possible.",

It's also going to depend on how quickly everything can be brought to the front. The Ukrainians are going to try to keep a lot of what they have kind of under wraps until that last very moment tactically that they will be fit in order to move forward.But the Ukrainians will be looking for weak spots in the Russian defensive line. The Russians have had about six months to get ready for this. And they've certainly put up a lot of defensive barriers, a lot of anti-tank weapons and barriers. So, it's going to be pretty tough going. It won't be the surprise that we saw in the northeast, back in this -- in this past summer.

And then number two, what kind of preparations is the White House, you know, putting in place for Title 42, which will soon be ending as the COVID era border restriction that let border agents quickly expel certain migrants.PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Administration officials have been saying over the course of the last year that they have been in touch with cities around the country. And that includes New York City and the office of Mayor Adams and Adams himself. I spoke to a Homeland Security Official just yesterday who told me that they are in touch with their office as these concerns mount about a surge on the U.S.-Mexico border next month. And what that means not only for those border cities, but also for the interior. And Fred, we're really already starting to see that uptick. Just moments ago, I talked to Homeland Security officials who told me that there are now more than 20,000 migrants in custody along the U.S.-Mexico border there. Facing about 7000 people a day. That's a number that they expect to go up. And they're already seeing that as they see that restriction Title 42 come to an end on May 11th. And the reason it's ending is because that is also when the Coronavirus public health emergency expire. So, it all will go away together which puts pressure on the administration to make sure that their preparations are underway. So, what does that look like? This week, they announced regional processing centers in Latin America, where migrants who are traversing to the U.S.-Mexico border can actually stop there and apply for legal pathways to legally come to the US. And that's really what the administration has been underscoring. Programs, policies that would allow people to stay where they are and apply to come to United States. But for those who do come, they've also talked about how going back to decades or protocols means we're storing legal consequences and pushing people back.

It's called Tirzepatide.According to the data from the manufacturer, Eli Lilly, more than 900 adults with obesity and diabetes took the injectable drug for more than a year. Those who received the highest dose lost an average of about 34 pounds, or about 16 percent of their starting weight. The data has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Eli lily says it will use the findings to ask the FDA to fast track approval for weight loss. I want to bring in now primary care physician, Dr. Saju Mathew. Doctor, good to see you. So this could be a potential game changer for diabetes patients who are also obese. How does it work? And what are the side effects? DR. SAJU MATHEW, PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN: I'll tell you what, Fred, I don't take the word \"game changer\" lightly at all. I think this absolutely can be a life-changing event for obesity patients. We have about 40 percent of people who are obese in this country. And, Fred, we spend over $170 billion in obesity related medical issues. So how does this drug work? It basically mimics a hormone in your stomach that talks to your brain and your G.I. system that your stomach is full. It delays gastric emptying and that means people don't eat a lot and you're full consistently. And just like you mentioned as well, it lowers the sugar. It increases the insulin level. So it works on that patient who is both obese and a diabetic as well.",

And then they were sent to 27 schools where kids lined up as the dogs smelled their ankles and feet. The dogs were trained to sit when they detected what could be those volatile organic compounds that are associated with Covid. Then the person the dog sat next to would need to complete a nasal swab antigen Covid test. Now, as part of this pilot program, the dogs accurately detected 85 infections, ruled out more than 3,400, resulting in an overall accuracy of 90 percent. The dogs missed 18 infections. And the searchers say the dogs do not necessarily replace nasal swab testing. Instead, they can help indicate which person may need a test and which person. And that could help save on time and resources. The researchers think the dogs could be trained to detect other types of diseases, too. Here is Carole Edwards, executive director of the non-profit, Early Alert K9s. She works with the dogs. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAROLE EDWARDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, EARLY ALERT K9S: We've talked about T.B, we've talked about flu, A and B, possibly, for this next flu season, if we can get the dogs to alert on that.
