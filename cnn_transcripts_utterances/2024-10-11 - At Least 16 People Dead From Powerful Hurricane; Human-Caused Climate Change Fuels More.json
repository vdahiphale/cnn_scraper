The Northern Lights put on quite a show around the world. Hello everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. You are watching ONE WORLD. Wrecked homes and wrecked lives in Florida at this hour as millions of people try to pick up the pieces from Hurricane Milton. The dangerous storm is responsible for the deaths of at least 16 people now, and more than 2.5 million households are still without power. Water rescues are still ongoing from heavy flooding. This comes as Florida's East Coast got hit with at least nine tornadoes and emergency responders in just one area. Had to cope with 900 calls for help in just 90 minutes time.

Well, insurance companies could face upwards of $50 billion in claims for the devastation caused by Hurricane Milton, that's according to Fitch Ratings. And CNN's Bill Weir finds that most climate scientists point to climate change as the factor that's fueling intense storms like Milton. He visited a flood ravaged community where right now the future seems uncertain. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms that take lives and livelihoods. But as families, real and private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County, from the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field peeled like an orange by Milton's winds. The Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium with taxpayers kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars.

You know, Bianna, for all of the reasons that you just laid out, we've seen President Biden'sweek be completely consumed by first preparing for Hurricane Milton and now dealing with the storm recovery efforts. And remember, you know, this week started with the president making the rare decision to actually postpone a foreign trip to Germany and Angola so that he could fully focus and be here stateside as the storm was coming. And each day, you know, we've seen him get briefed multiple times. On some days, we've actually heard or seen the president publicly discussing these efforts multiple times as well. Just gives you a sense of the urgency here and the focus across the federal government that they are trying to show. And we even actually reported yesterday that the White House had, at some point, discussed the possibility of appointing a coordinator. This is the hurricane czar as we often so use that title here in Washington, D.C. Somebody who would take the lead in being sort of the public face of all of these efforts and streamlining those efforts. Ultimately, the White House did decide against it. But even the fact that discussion had happened, I think, again, stresses the urgency that everyone is feeling here. You know, the physical response to all of the damage from Hurricane Milton, but also two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene, that is absolutely Herculean. I think the president has been making that clear. But also as you mentioned, Bianna, there is a fight right now to really combat the misinformation and the disinformation that this White House says has been widespread and so reckless. There was a really important moment earlier this week when the head of FEMA came to the White House briefing room and she said actually one of the ways in which this has had a real effect on people on the ground is that people who are actually needing assistance and can get assistance from the federal government, they are simply not asking for it because they are getting all different kinds of information and have a basic concern or fear about exactly what the federal government's response is and what they are doing. For example, she said this idea that's out there that the federal government, if you ask for help, is going to confiscate your land. She said that is simply not true. And I think that is why, as in the clip that you just played, we've heard some really strong language from President Biden saying these kinds of lies are un-American, that they are stupid, and directly calling on former President Trump specifically to basically cut it out, Bianna.",

She joins us from Aurora, Colorado, where Trump will speak later.I don't know what he's going to say about Colorado, but you only heard one or two applause there in Detroit when Donald Trump was bashing that very city, giving an economic address there, speaking at the Economic Club. What has the fallout been thus far? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we've heard from a number of city and local officials saying that that's simply not true, hitting back at the former president. Just a reminder, this is not the first time that Donald Trump has done this. This is not part of any planned remarks. But remember what he did just months ago when he insulted the city of Milwaukee days before he was slated to attend the Republican National Convention in the city of Milwaukee, something that his campaign then had to backtrack on. Now, when it comes to Aurora, Colorado, one thing to keep in mind, this area is solidly blue. This state is solidly blue. He is not here to try and reach out to swing voters. Instead, this has really become the epicenter for the disinformation campaign against around immigration and migrants. In particular, they have been perpetuating this narrative, which has been proven false by the mayor of this area, as well as by the governor of Colorado, that the city of Aurora has been overtaken by Venezuelan gangs. In fact, just moments ago, they had a picture of what essentially looked like men with giant hoodies on holding guns that said, your apartment complex under Kamala Harris. And then the next slide said, you're better off under Donald Trump. This is a lot of the same fear-based messaging. When you heard it in Detroit, it was based on the economy. When you're hearing it here, it's going to be based on immigration. But, Bianna, one thing to note about this is that we don't expect him to tone it down at any point before November. And here's why, this messaging, regardless of whether it is true or not, is resonating with voters on the ground. Look at the recent \"Wall Street Journal\" polling that just came out today. These margins between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are razor thin, and in part, his campaign believes it's because of these kind of message. So you're -- don't -- we don't expect him to change anything that he is doing before November. In fact, he might even be ramping up the rhetoric. As I said, I've never seen these kind of slides that he is showing here about migrant crime in Colorado, but that's the reason that he's on the ground today. And what his campaign says is, well, it's not a swing state, that clips of this rally will be promoted on social media over and over again on the internet and that enough people will see it that it will essentially have the same kind of punch that doing a rally in a swing state would.",

And I don't want to sound too cynical, but I'm old enough to say this. Hate and fear have a lot more impact at the voting booths than love and hope. I'm sorry to say that, but it is absolutely true.
