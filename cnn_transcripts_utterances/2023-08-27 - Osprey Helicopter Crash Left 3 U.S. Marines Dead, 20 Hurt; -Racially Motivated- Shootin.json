Three of those U.S. Marines have been confirmed dead. All 23 suffered some form of injuries and five were taken to hospital, one of whom required surgery.Now, this is something that's just happened. The Australian public has been waiting for information as this has leaked out through the day. Concerns for these brave marines participating in training exercises up there in the northern territory, where the marine rotational force based in Darwin is there on a semi-permanent basis. Now, as I said, information is just coming out. We just, moments ago, got this statement from the U.S. Defense Department, saying that these three marines had sadly died. Australians, as I mentioned, very concerned about this. This happened just weeks after an Australian helicopter went down in joint training with the U.S. in Queensland, killing Australians onboard there, too, Kim. So, a tragic time in Australia right now. Thoughts with the families of the three marines who have died.",

It comes after he was filmed kissing a player on Spain's team moments after they won the Women's World Cup last weekend. Rubiales says, the kiss was consensual, but the player, Jennifer Hermoso, denied that. The controversial kiss sparked outrage and many demanded Rubiales' resignation. And just hours after his suspension on Saturday, nearly a dozen members of the Spanish women's national soccer program also resigned. In the last hour, CNN spoke with Catalonia's Minister for Equality and Feminism and they asked if Luis Rubiales' case could be a turning moment for other women in sports. Here's what she had to say.

Now, we're noticing a lot of that heat beginning to increase across the southwestern tier of the U.S. Take for example, Palm Springs, topping out at 114 on Sunday then jumping to 117 by Monday. Phoenix, not much better, 113 for the high on Sunday, 115 for the both Monday and Tuesday. So, you're looking at 10 degrees above average for both of those cities.Now, we will get a brief reprieve for some locations. Take Tucson, for example. Well into triple digits the next few days, but then we do start to see a little bit of a dip in temperatures once we get some rain chances back into forecast by the end of the upcoming week. Along the Gulf Coast region, also still dealing with heat. But there is light at the end of the tunnel for many of these locations. Houston, for example, 107, still triple digits on Sunday, but then finally starting to see them below the triple digits by the early portion of next week. Very similar scenario for New Orleans, looking at 102 on Sunday, dropping back into the 80s, possibly, on Tuesday. And it's been a very hot week for a lot of those locations. Shreveport, Louisiana topping out at 110 on Friday, that ties the all- time record high in that location. Houston doing the same thing the day before on Thursday, hitting 109 degrees, also tying their all-time record high. But some cooler temperatures are in store for a lot of these areas, especially across the southeast and the midwestern portion of the United States. Take Atlanta, for example, going from about 10 degrees above average to wrap up the rest of the weekend down to 10 degrees below average by the time we get to Wednesday. And that's because we've got some rain chances that will be filtering back into a lot of these locations, bringing those temperatures down, adding some cloud cover. So, again, at least there is relief for some of these cities once we get to next week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a letter included in court documents dated August the 11th, the company writes, \"Hawaiian electric is taking reasonable steps to preserve its own property that was damaged or destroyed because of these devastating fires. However, state, local, and federal government actors and others are moving forward to fight the fires and clear out debris that may impede that effort. It's therefore possible, even likely that the actions of these third parties whose actions Hawaiian Electric does not control may result in the loss of property or other items that relate to the cause of the fire.\" So, this story about evidence possibly being compromised in the Lahaina fire investigation was first reported by \"The Washington Post.\" But in an e-mail to CNN, Hawaiian Electric said, the paper's allegations are inaccurate and they did not elaborate further. The company is telling us, its personnel have been in regular communication with ATF and local authorities and are cooperating to provide them, as well as attorneys who represent the people affected by wildfires -- these wildfires on Maui with inventories in access to the removed equipment which they have carefully photographed, documented and stored. This is all about preserving the integrity of evidence to find out if the power company was responsible for the spark which grew into the Lahaina inferno. Mike Valerio, CNN, Los Angeles.

The highly mutated variant was collected in the U.S., but the CDC isn't saying where and it's also been detected at low levels in Switzerland.Meanwhile, it could be time to break out your masks again. A growing number of hospitalizations due to COVID have triggered the concern. And some experts are urging people, especially those with a higher risk of contacting COVID to mask up. Joining me now is Anne Rimoin, professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Thanks so much for joining us here. So, I know there have been small surges of cases here in the U.S., a rise of hospitalizations over the summer. But COVID, you know, I have to say, is pretty low on most people's list of concerns these days. So, how concerned are you about what you're seeing right now?",

But in general, if you're not feeling well, if you're sick, the best thing to do is to avoid contact with other people, if you can, and in particular, people who are vulnerable. People who are older. People who are sick. If you have -- people who have young children around, in particular, you know, infants, newborns. You might want to think twice before spending time around them if you can avoid it.It's going to be good etiquette, good common sense, and what we know how to do already. If you're -- if you want to avoid getting this virus, you could wear a mask in crowded places. You can take your activities outdoor where you can. Wash your hands so that will also help with many of these viruses. And use good common sense when you don't feel well.",
