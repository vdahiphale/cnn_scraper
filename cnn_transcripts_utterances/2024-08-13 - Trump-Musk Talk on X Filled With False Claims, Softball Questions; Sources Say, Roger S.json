That is, if you believe the new claim from Elon Musk, there have been a billion views of his interview with Donald Trump overnight, and then discussions about it. It is unclear how he got to that number, but whether it was dozens of people, or quadrillions who did tune in, what they heard was a major technical delay followed by relative fawning, then the normal campaign rhetoric. Some people even claim they heard a lisp.These were some of the attacks on his opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Kamala wouldn't have this conversation. She can't, because she's not smart. You know, she's not a smart person. She is a radical left San Francisco liberal, and now she's trying to protect -- now she's looking like she's -- she wants to be more Trump than Trump, if that's possible. I don't think it's possible, but she wants to be more Trump than Trump. She's terrible, but she's getting a free ride. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They heaped praise on each other. Musk lobbed softball questions at the former president, and it really allowed him to kind of rattle off the same exact talking points we hear at all of his rallies and while Donald Trump is on the campaign trail. We heard Trump go after Harris, attack her on the border, attack Joe Biden for claiming -- or his claims that he failed to prevent the wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine. And he also, you know, tried to portray that America was better off while Donald Trump was in office. Now, one interesting thing that I took away is he spent a lot of time attacking Joe Biden, even though Biden is no longer his opponent, even if Donald Trump sometimes wishes he were.

The Harris campaign is trying to have a heyday with this one. What are they doing with it? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, look, Kate, they are trying their best to mock this, not just the technical problems, which there were many, but the kind of conversation that had there. And it is part and parcel of the Harris campaign's attempt here to continue to make out the Trump campaign and Donald Trump himself and his top supporters as part of like sort of a cynical circus act here, really denigrating them. Making fun of them every which way they can. There's a statement from the Harris campaign last night, Trump's entire campaign is in service of people, like Elon Musk and himself, self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream in the year 2024. That's the way that this is going from the Harris campaign overall. The vice president herself not really addressing Trump directly at any point so far over the last three weeks except to say, you know, she knows his type, but the campaign to take those digs every which way they can.",

Obviously, many of them pushing Biden to leave the race, but a connected collective message from Democrats that they're trying to move forward as a country. It is, I will say, a pretty stark contrast to the Republican convention where you did not have previous nominees for president or vice president there in Milwaukee with Donald Trump, as Trump tries to make the Republican Party overall reshaped in his own image. The Democratic Party coming together through all these generations and presidents over the course of the four nights next week in Chicago.",

But here is what we do know about the Harris plan to eliminate taxes on tips. It would apply to hospitality and service workers. The tips would remain subject to payroll taxes. Harris wants to pair this with a push to raise the minimum wage. And, of course, this would require congressional approval.Now, this is one of those ideas that politicians love. Economists, they're a little bit more skeptical. One of the concerns is that this would really only apply to a small slice of work, and that raises some fairness questions, right? Like, why should a bartender get to duck taxes on tips but a warehouse worker making the same amount of money have to pay taxes on wages? Believe it or not, just 2.5 percent of all employees actually get tips, according to Yale University. These tend to be lower wage jobs, like food delivery workers and hotel staffers, and that's important because it means a lot of them, they don't make enough money to even pay federal taxes. Yale estimates just 37 percent of tipped workers in 2022 actually owed federal income taxes. Even fewer restaurant workers did. And all of this explains why Erica York at the tax policy -- that the Tax Foundation told me that this is good politics, but bad policy, John.",

But without those limitations, one thing I know about really wealthy people is they don't like paying taxes.

      "sentences": "Definitely. Of course, that is a major concern because this would essentially incentivize people to reclassify ordinary income as tipped income. And it's easy to see how without guardrails you could have wealthy earners sort of game the system. That's why the Harris campaign says that they would have guardrails.One, they would have an income limit. Two, they would have requirements to prevent hedge fund managers and lawyers from benefiting. But implementing those requirements is not easy. The devil would really be in the details. Another concern, though, is the cost here, right, because this would come at a time when we have High deficits, a lot of national debt. And estimates from the committee for responsible federal budget, they say that if you exclude tips from federal income taxes, that would cost at least $107 billion over a decade. If you also include -- if you also exclude tips from the payroll tax, this could spike to as much as $250 billion over a decade. John, one last point, this does not address the elephant in the room, the expiring 2017 Trump tax cuts, nor the fact that the federal budget is a mess. Hopefully, we'll hear more details on that in the coming days.",
