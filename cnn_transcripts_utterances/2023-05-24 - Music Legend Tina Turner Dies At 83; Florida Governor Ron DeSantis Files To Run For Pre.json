The man who currently appears to pose the biggest threat to Donald Trump winning the Republican nomination for president has officially entered the race. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis filed the paperwork this afternoon and in less than two hour, he is set to make his public announcement during a audio event on Twitter with Elon Musk.But in the hours leading up to his grand reveal, the attacks against DeSantis have escalated, giving the governor a taste of what he can expect as the campaign begins to ramp up. Other presidential hopefuls are on the trail today. Ambassador Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, Congressman, I'm sorry, Senator Tim Scott in Iowa. One of the reasons why DeSantis is thought to pose such a serious threat to Trump is his ability to fund raise. DeSantis and his allies currently have more than $100 million in the bank. So let's start with CNN's Jessica Dean who's in Miami where a DeSantis donor retreat is currently underway. And, Jessica, DeSantis-aligned group is already out with a new video, labeling DeSantis a president for the people.",

We saw that super PAC releasing the video not too long ago and interestingly, zeroed right in on his biography and took swipes not at his Republican rivals, but at President Joe Biden and Democrats.That is something we can expect to see more and more of as he tries to contrast himself with President Biden and with the Democrats in power, saying that he can be the one that can move the country forward in the direction that Americans want it to go. That's going to be a big part of his pitch. We also saw him, as you mentioned, filing that official paperwork with the FEC today that will make him a candidate for president in 2024 and the donor retreat that is underway, $100 million. It's an historic figure that's behind him once he launches his campaign, and they want even bigger number. They really want a fundraising blitz out of this. That's why they've gathered all these donors together here in Miami to really start bundling the money as this campaign getting underway. And then, of course, we go to the big announcement today, Jake, which is unconventionally going to be on Twitter. Audio only is what we are ex expecting. That we will only be able to hear this conversation between Elon Musk and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as he talks about his announcement to run for president. So, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. It is certainly an unconventional choice. That is not by accident, Jake. His team wants to do this in a different way. They want to make unconventional choices and reach people in a way they can directly and this goes right in with that.

He's got about half as much support as Trump. When you see he's in a category by himself because everybody else not named Trump is in single digits. I want to show you how this race has moved over the last few months as Trump has been hammering away at DeSantis while he's be doing his day job at governor of Florida. So, again, now, 53 percent to 26 percent, but a little over two months ago in March, it was a much closer race between Donald Trump and DeSantis in our polling. You see 40 percent to 36 percent.

It should just be a set. But they are. And my understanding in talking to sources who have talked to Ron DeSantis is that he seems to be more understanding of some of the things that he has done wrong, basic things like when it comes to approach to campaigning, when it comes to his approach to Donald Trump, and when it comes to kind of the way that he has framed, the way that he has framed the voters and his connection or maybe lack of connection until last couple of weeks in Iowa with voters.",

Back when I was in Tallahassee when he was being sworn in for a second term, that is gone. I mean, the reality is he is I guess you can, I guess, look charitably on this, his expectations are now in check. The reality here though is there is still a hunger for Republican voters for an alternative, at least among some Republican voters. Of course, with every new Republican who gets in the race, the pie is sliced up a little bit and helps Donald Trump. I think we just have to see how the governor does once he is out of the friendly confines of Twitter this afternoon, this evening, after his Fox interview. Once he hits the road, potentially this weekend and definitely next week, how does he do with those voter questions? There are going to be many who have questions about his policies.

Now, certainly, there's a new strain in the GOP, particularly younger Republicans, who are not necessarily interested in say robust engagement in Ukraine.

According to the gun violence archive, there have already been 241 mass shootings in the United States just this year, 241. Does more need to be done to stop it? It seems like the very obvious place to do it is to try to keep peoplewho are obviously risk, at risk of harming themselves or others from being able to obtain weapons. We've seen so many incidents of people that family and friends knew what the person was in a bad place and yet they were able to go legally purchase guns and commit horrific acts of violence.",

Since that bill has been signed into law, there's been over 160 cases in which minors that had mental health issues were not able to purchase a firearm. I think that's a success.It was a largest investment in mental health in our nation's history, but part of the problem has been getting the money from Washington, D.C. down to the communities. I'll give you an example. Last year, I had six of my communities submit cop's grants and guess what, I put a letter of support behind these and they were all denied. I met with the attorney general afterwards and we're working together on how to fix that, but it can't just be legislation without the money and resources making it down to the ground. Also, I started myself and the representative who represents Parkland, Florida. You know what happened there nearly five years ago. We started this bipartisan school safety and security caucus. We kicked it off today. I thought it was a very productive conversation. I'm looking at what can we -- how can we pass meaningful legislation in the 118th Congress. I get what other people want, but how can we move the ball forward today in this Congress.",

So the Justice Department is going to have to find some way likely, optically, to accommodate this request. But the idea that they're going to get an audience with the attorney, that's a stretch. It's unclear who else they could meet with, because again, the special counsel is supposed to operate independently just with answering to the attorney general.

From our reporting, we also don't know what is going on with Mark Meadows. It's very difficult to believe the Trump team when they are, like, yeah, everything's been done, they have spoken with everyone if they're completely in the dark and had no communications with Mark Meadows' attorney.
