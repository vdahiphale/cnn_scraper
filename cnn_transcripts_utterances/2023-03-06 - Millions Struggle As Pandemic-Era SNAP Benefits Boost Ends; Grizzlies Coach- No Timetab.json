In some cases, it was a couple of hundred dollars. And it's coming at this really difficult time with inflation still squeezing families. The food -- the price of food is still through the roof. And look, I've spoken with food banks across the country from Arizona to Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania -- all of them telling me that they are seeing record demand right now, higher even than at the peak of the pandemic. And in many cases, these pantries are having to ration food so that there's more to go around and that means families are getting less food when they show up for help. And you mentioned this weekend The Washington Post publishing that powerful piece showing a mile-long line -- a three-hour wait at a food bank in Kentucky where people are struggling.

Still like the winter war with Finland in 1938. Still like much of the Second World War. They've learned nothing about maneuver -- you know, things like outflanking the enemy.

But on the other hand, let's just say he only had two other opponents for Trump and in a given primary they each got 33 percent. He could still win with 34 percent. I think the focus here has got to be on eliminating Trump from the -- from the nomination process as early as possible.

      "sentences": "All right. So this video you have to see this morning of a wild moose attack. That's right, a wild moose attack. Things got scary for two Idaho brothers when they encountered this giant moose last week. The average moose is about six feet tall. They can weigh as much as 1,400 pounds. But our very own estimation at CNN THIS MORNING is that this one is a ginormous one.At one point, the moose suddenly turned and charged at one of the men, trampling the snowmobile and really tumbling it into the snow. There it is right there. Look at that. Wow, it's frightening. So, fortunately, no one was hurt in this incident. The moose eventually ran off and the brothers left happily they were alive to tell the tale. One more look -- oof. I think the snowmobile kind of actually helped, right?",
