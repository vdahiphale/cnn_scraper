And is climate change making air travel more dangerous? I'm going to talk to Captain Sully Sullenberger who made that miraculous emergency landing in the Hudson River. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, put us in jail. That's a direct request from Russian soldiers. In a new video that we have OUTFRONT tonight, you're going to hear a conversation. This conversation is between mobilized Russian soldiers and their commander. The men are angry about their orders. One of them surreptitiously taping this and make it clear that they would rather be put behind bars than die in Putin's war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Are we specialists, or something? You don't want us to refuse? We better go to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) jail. Put everyone in jail. We'll stay there. No one will go there to attack. How long is? Five, seven U.S.? Ten? Don't give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED)! At least I will be alive and not giving the rest of our life away for whom? For what? RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  I have no right to put you in jail. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  My life is dear. I'm being serious. I'll be earning money in jail and sending it to my family. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And for Putin, a fight that has become so brutal and bloody that now, for some men on the Russian frontline, it is driving them to suicide. It's a horrible moment, and here, again, those Russian soldiers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Like yesterday, a guy went outside, sat on the bench, put a gun to his head, and blow his brains out. He was walking, saying, I'm sick of it.

It does provide important insight into the mindset of the Russians who are fighting.And it comes as we have new drone video of the fight for Bakhmut. You can see fires burning in the distance there, in that video. Ukraine claims that killed more than 100 Russian soldiers there in just the past 24 hours. That's what the Russians are dealing with, 100 dead in a day. And inside Bakhmut, the war of words over who is in control is now in full swing. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, today claiming his men control the eastern part of the city. But Zelenskyy's number two general showed up in Bakhmut as well today, his third visit to the city in less than a week. And Ukraine released this new video of soldiers, they say, really driving through the city of Bakhmut. We've geolocated this. Playing music, storefronts shattered, apartment decimated. They're driving through, playing music, an incongruous and odd thing. It also appears a vital Ukrainian supply line to Bakhmut has been repaired. Now, this is a temporary bridge you're looking at into the city. The bridge had been destroyed. It means Ukraine no longer has to rely on one dangerous terror that we showed you yesterday. Wearable to fix that bridge that the Russians have blown. That's not a setback for Putin in a months long battle that Russia expected to last just a couple weeks. Now, coming up, you're going to hear from someone who's been a thorn in Putin's side for years. I just spoke to Nadya Tolokonnikova, a member of the punk group Pussy Riot, which is long protested Putin's regime. She was jailed for 21 months in Russia just for criticizing Putin and you're going to hear what she has to say to Russians now. But, first, Fred Pleitgen is live in Moscow to begin our coverage.
