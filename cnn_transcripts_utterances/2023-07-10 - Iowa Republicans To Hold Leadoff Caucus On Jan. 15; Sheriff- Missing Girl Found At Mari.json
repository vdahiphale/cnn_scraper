No date yet for New Hampshire's Republican contest, the first in the nation primary. But it's likely to take place before the end of January given how things are going.Joining me right now to talk about the impact of this calendar and the states and everything we've seen. CNN political commentator, and political anchor for Spectrum News, Errol Louis. Also the host of the \"You Decide Podcast.\" OK, Errol, let's talk first about this calendar. January 15 for Iowa. If you look back at the past few cycles, it's earlier -- weeks earlier than the last two cycles. But as we know, this does jump around. It's also a federal holiday. It's Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Earlier in the cycle, earlier in the calendar means what?",

In the case of Iowa, though, you got to keep in mind that it's a very particular electorate that's going to come out for these Republican caucuses, and it's -- it tends to be more evangelical. It tends to be a lot more conservative, so they'll benefit as well from having a couple of extra Sundays in there to try and mobilize the base and make sure everybody turns out. And who that will advantage, I guess will be those who are tuning their strategy to this unusual calendar development, Kate.",

Unfortunately, the voters seem to feel otherwise but -- by quite a large margin as a matter of fact. And then I was looking through the first dozen or so states, and you just can't find a place where Trump doesn't have you know, like a 20-plus point advantage over Ron DeSantis.In fact, I think the first place where they're even remotely close is in Wisconsin, but that's in April, and that's on the other side of Super Tuesday, more than half delegates will be allocated by that. So, the donor class, or there's a faction of the donor class that clearly wants an alternative to Donald Trump. Now, all we've got to do is find some voters who feel the same way.",

Also, you know, you'll hear a candidate say they're not -- they don't run their race by tracking the poll numbers, though Ron DeSantis is now blaming the media for the fact that he's not doing so well in those very same poll numbers. Let me play for you what he said this weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): These are narratives. The media does not want me to be the nominee. I think that's very, very clear. Why? Because they know I'll beat Biden. But even more importantly, they know I will actually deliver on all these things. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the problem with Ron DeSantis is the more known he becomes, the worse he does in the polls. So, there's something fundamentally wrong there.And when you hear a candidate blame it all on the media, what that tells you is it they've got to blame somebody because they spent a lot of time and a lot of energy and gone to a lot of appearances. And every time Ron DeSantis opens his mouth, it seems like voters like him a little bit less. So you know, I -- you want to blame the media, you can blame the media. If he somehow thinks the media has a hold on evangelical Republican voters in Nevada and in Iowa and in South Carolina, that's way, way, way more authority or influence than the mainstream media has. The reality is, he's got a -- he's got a real serious problem, and he's going to have to fix it. He's going to have to fix it --",

The Iowa caucuses have not been a great predictor of who's going to become the eventual Republican nominee.You can ask Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008 did not become the nominee. You can ask Rick Santorum who did the same thing in 2012. You can ask Ted Cruz who did it yet again in 2016. It's not a great predictor. But if you can even do that, if your Mike Pence or your Ron DeSantis, that's the base of the base for you. The conservative evangelical base. If you can't win them over, it's really hard to see where you get back into the race. And an early knockout blow I think is what the Trump team is going to try and accomplish.",

And that's where military police found her.They also say that a marine was taken into custody for questioning. And it all happened on the 28th. I want to read part of the statement from the Marine Corps because this is what they're saying. This command takes this matter and all allegations very seriously. The incident is under investigation and we will continue to cooperate with NCIS and appropriate authorities. Now, the NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. We reached out to them as well and they declined to comment out of respect for the investigative process. But the sheriff's department here in San Diego County did release a timeline of essentially what happened leading up to this entire situation. The sheriff's department is saying that her grandmother reported her missing on June 13. But the grandmother told deputies that she actually ran away from home on that night. The grandmother also is saying that this was not the first time that she ran away from home but normally returned home quickly. So, they put her name into missing persons' databases. And it wasn't until the 28th that military police actually found that 14-year-old girl here on base. Then detectives were able to speak to her, they offered resources, and they reunited her with her grandmother. But yes, there are still a lot of questions in terms of how this all happened, how this little girl was able to get on base. But we will probably have to wait for the findings of the NCIS investigation since this is a very just complicated case because of what we're dealing with here in terms of a 14-year-old girl, Sara.",

This is after a new study -- a recent study that found nearly half of the tap water in the United States contains these chemicals that have now shown to be harmful and dangerous. They're manmade chemicals known as PFAS. They're nearly indestructible, hence why they are called forever chemicals. And they're almost ubiquitous.I mean, they're in everything from nonstick cookware to cleaning supplies to fast food wrappers, microwave popcorn containers, pizza boxes. Now, you get my drift of where I'm going here. But if they are everywhere, how do we get rid of them now? Joining us right now is Faye Flam. She's an opinion columnist for Bloomberg News and host of the \"Follow The Science\" podcast as well. Faye, thanks so much for coming in. You took a bit of a look back to understand a little bit of how we got here, especially after some would see massive settlements of some of the big chemical companies over these chemicals. What is the backstory with PISA -- PFAS? What are they? And where do they come from? FAYE FLAM, SCIENCE &amp; MEDICAL JOURNALIST: Yes, it's really interesting. So, the company that had to pay I -- a huge settlement was Three-M and they are the main makers or were the main manufacturers of these chemicals. And they were considered a real innovation in the 60s. A chemist that I interviewed sent me a book called The Chemical History OF Three M. And there was an anecdote in there about how the chemists at Three M were so confident that these chemicals were safe that they actually brought some of one of them in a crystalline form to a corporate meeting and dished it out on paper plates and ate it. And they all survived. This happened because the chemicals are considered inert. And at the time, people thought inert chemicals, they don't react with things. That means that they're safe. And it doesn't mean they're not going to poison you. But it also means they're really hard to get rid of. They don't degrade in the environment.",

I was doing a read of it and probably more dangerous even at levels thousands of times lower than previously believed.
