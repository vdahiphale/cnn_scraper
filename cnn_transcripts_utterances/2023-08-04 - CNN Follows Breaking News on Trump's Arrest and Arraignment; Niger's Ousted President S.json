Trump was released without any real conditions, but the judge reminded him not to commit any crimes and not to interfere with any witnesses. Sources say he left in a sour and dejected mood after the judge addressed him as Mr. Trump and not Mr. President. He spoke briefly to reporters at the airport.

That is a pretty quick turnaround for these kinds of decisions, suggesting that the judge would like to move this along quickly. Now, it is unclear at this point if this case really will go to trial before the 2024 election. One of the big outstanding questions that could really impact a possible schedule is if the special counsel intends to add additional charges or additional co-defendants.

But I think this entire episode of Trump's -- the attempts to bring legal accountability to Trump has really shown the extent to which we are living in two countries that are operating on a very different set of values and really living almost in completely different information spheres.Now, this is not unique. I think people who study threats of democracy around the world will tell you that quasi-authoritarian leaders who are later brought to account for their actions are often able to generate this kind of response in their core supporters. Not only that poll that you point out from CNN today, a recent poll from a group called Bright Line Watch, which is a consortium of political scientists studying threats to democracy, found that 60 percent of Republicans in London now call the January 6 riot legitimate protest. The separatist impulse that is now evident in the Republican coalition, the belief that they are the victims of -- in a changing society is really profound. We are seeing that and we are seeing some of the dangers, but not -- I don't think we've seen the last of the dangers that represents. KINKADE: Yeah, exactly. It really is. Those -- those polls are just absolutely startling. The former president is accused right now of defrauding the nation that he once led. Many Republicans are defending the president claiming that he is entitled to say what he wants due to the First Amendment. This is what House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY, U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: You are entitled to raise a question. You're entitled to question whether it was honest or not. That's the uniqueness of the First Amendment. That's the uniqueness of America. But you know what? You shouldn't be prosecuted for your thoughts. And the difference here is, when Hillary Clinton said it, nothing happened to her.

      "sentences": "It's astonishingly misleading. First of all, as many legal scholars have pointed out, the First Amendment does not extend to your right to launch into a conspiracy, you know, or to yell fire in a crowded theater, in effect. And as you point out, Marco Rubio made a similar argument as Kevin McCarthy. This is not only primarily -- this is not even primarily about what he did -- said. This is about what he did.The First Amendment does not include your right to organize a conspiracy to pressure the Justice Department to send letters without fact telling states that there that there is serious fraud in their results or to enlist, you know, co-conspirators in the states to create slates of fake electors. What's really striking to me is that you have many of the people who worked around Trump in the executive branch even to the point of such a slavish defender as Bill Barr, not to mention the defense secretaries, Mark Esper, James Mattis, General Kelly, the former Chief of Staff, basically saying -- John Bolton -- that his actions have rendered him unfit to be President. And there are vanishingly few Republican elected officials who will say the same, a few candidates on the periphery of the race, Chris Christie, Will Hurd, Asa Hutchinson among them. But the vast majority of Republican elected officials are rejecting these prosecutions out of hand. And I think, in some ways, are creating a closed circle. They say they can't, some of them will say they can't oppose Trump or legitimize these elections because the base is with him. Well, one of the reasons the base is with him is because no one they trust is telling them otherwise. So, these, in fact, are historically serious charges in the same way that someone like Bill Barr even is now saying. [02:10:00]",

And you know, openly, basically -- openly telling the electorate that if he is reelected, not only will he seek to end the cases against him, but as he has said many times, that he will seek to pardon many, perhaps most -- all of the January 6th rioters.He is creating a very stark choice for the country. It is one that has rallied the Republican base around him. I believe, you know, as I've written for many years, I believe the fundamental fault line in American politics is between those who welcome and fear the way America is changing demographically and culturally, for those Republicans, for the dominant faction in the Republican party that is uneasy about the way the country is changing. They view Trump as their indispensable warrior, and they are with him down the line because they believe he is the one politician committed, I think, to combating the changes they think are marginalizing them. And so, the prospect is that he will be a strong candidate. Now, the other Republicans are still hoping there's some straw that eventually breaks the camel's back and causes the Republican electorate to break away from him. But if he, if that doesn't happen and he is the nominee, the broader elector will face a fundamental choice, unlike any I think this country has faced before. We have never had the dominant faction in a major party be so open to a leader, openly willing, be so committed to a leader, openly willing to use anti-democratic means to advance. And we really haven't seen anything like this, I think, since the South's efforts in the pre- civil war to try to govern the country as a minority and prevent the majority from acting against slavery. This is an extraordinary moment for the country and whose gravity really cannot be overstated.",

There's the center of the storm here. There's Okinawa back off toward the east and the storm is forecast to turn back off toward the north and toward the northeast over the next several hours and next several days. The only problem I see here is that there is a swing back up toward Japan at the very end of this forecast from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It doesn't have a lot of strength here, but still it's beginning to build. I don't like this trend back up to 130 kph as it makes its way into that warmer water.

So, all the models now beginning to turn it to the left into parts of southern Japan. We'll have to watch that. Some models are to the left, some models are to the right, but most are doing this, still gaining some strength and times, gaining some wind speed, maybe getting the eye back. If that happens then all of a sudden this turns into a much bigger story over the next coming days. We've seen a lot of rainfall with this and I think we're going to see more. Even if we don't get landfall we're going to see a couple hundred inches -- a couple hundred millimeters there -- of rainfall across parts of southern Japan.
