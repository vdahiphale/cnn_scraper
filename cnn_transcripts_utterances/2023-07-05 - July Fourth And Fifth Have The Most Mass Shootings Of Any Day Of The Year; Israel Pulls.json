The U.S. is reeling from multiple mass shootings that rattled cities across the country over the holiday weekend. Several shootings have occurred in the past few days including tragic events in Maryland, Texas and Pennsylvania, the July 4 holiday and the day after account for more mass shootings than any other days of the year. Well, that's according to a CNN analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive. In Indianapolis, a 16-year-old girl was killed in a shooting during a block party.

His campaign says that it is this all 99 county visiting each one shaking as many hands as possible, hitting the coffee shops, hitting the pizza cafes. This is where they believe that the former vice president shines. And you certainly saw it as he was walking a fourth of July parade in Urbandale, Iowa. It was a two-mile parade route that at many points, the former vice president burst into a jog, shaking hands with as many people as possible, trying to sell this idea of a conservative future that he sees as a blueprint for America.

And as you noted, we have this very striking trend in polling, where roughly half of the people who voted for Biden and half of the people who voted for Trump say the view -- they view the other party, not as a political opponent, but as an enemy whose victory would threaten their, you know, their very conception of America. So there are a lot of centrifugal forces built into the system. Plus, you have in Trump really, I think, the first national leader who has seen it to be in his interest to accentuate those divides, even to the point of threatening to undermine democracy, if that's what it takes to advance his goals. I mean, you add it all up. And this is a very fraught period for America.

I mean, already a majority of our under 18 population, our kids of color, as of last year, a majority of our high school graduates are kids of color.White Christians, who are a majority of the American population, for most of our history are now down to 42 percent, large more of Gen Z of young people in America do not identify with any organized religion that identify as white Christians, one-fifth of Gen Z identifies us somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum. We are seeing profound cultural and demographic changes reinforced by changes in the structure of the economy as we transition from the industrial to the Information Age. And, you know, I first wrote in 2012. And it's certainly more true, I think, since Trump emerge that the fundamental fault line in our politics is between those who welcome and those who fear all of these changes, I call it the coalition of transformation that Democrats rely on and the coalition of restoration that Republicans rely on. And you certainly see in the early stages of this primary race, those are the issues that animate the Republican base, and I'm talking about the Reagan era issues of strong national defense and cutting taxes and less regulation. They're talking about transgender kids, and whether transgender girls can play high school sports and what books should be banned. The animating force, the glue that holds together each coalition, I believe, at this point, is their attitude on these underlying cultural and demographic changes. And that is another reason why our politics is so volatile. Those are very difficult issues to find compromise on. Now, you know, there are those who argue that the American public is less polarized and the politicians and that might be true, but there's no question that we are now organized in many ways around the central grievance, the central distinction about our attitudes toward change, and as long as that's true, we are going to have a very contentious politics.",

A hazmat team with the City of Washington D.C. came in deemed the substance non-hazardous.But two sources familiar with the matter, say that that powdery substance tested positive for cocaine. Now that was done via a field test, which is sometimes inconclusive, and it has been sent out for further testing and evaluation. Now, Secret Service Spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, he says that this powdery substance was found in a workspace within the West Wing. President Biden for his part, he was not at the White House when this took place. Now, we should note that on the weekends here at the White House, there are often tour groups that go through the West Wing of the White House. So it's certainly possible that that is how that baggie of cocaine apparently should have been confirmed, made its way into the West Wing. But that being said the Secret Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the matter to determine exactly how that substance made its way onto the White House grounds, Jeremy diamond, CNN, the White House.",

Yellen will have a busy agenda as she tries to rebuild contacts and relationships between both governments.She will meet with China's new economic leadership and is expected to bring up human rights and debt trap issues. Yellen's trip is happening a little more than two weeks after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a similar fence mending visit to Beijing, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Relations between China and the U.S. reached their lowest points in years recently because of China's deepening ties with Russia, as well as the spy balloon that was shot down over U.S. waters earlier this year. In Southwest China, some incredible video of a dramatic water rescue you see a couple sticking out of the sunroof of their car which is nearly submerged by rising floodwaters. CCTV reports the complicated rescue effort took about three hours, but the couple was finally pulled to safety using a rope and a crane. They are certainly lucky. A woman who'd been missing for a week in Massachusetts has been found alive. Some hiker's say they heard her screaming for help on Monday, and that she was stuck in mud at a state park about a half hour south of Boston. They couldn't reach her so they called 911. Rescuers say they had to wade through thick brush and swamp to get to her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Storms a little bit less than the Northeast a little bit more in the Southeast, and then the severe weather into parts of the southern plains right through parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, even into parts of Missouri, that's where the biggest threat of hail also, of course, lightning, and the gusty winds that could cause some damage, that's where most of the weather will be.So I take you kind of hour by hour move you ahead from where we are all the way to where we will be, especially by the afternoon, things are going to get hot, the storms are going to begin to bubble and some will be five to seven miles high in the atmosphere. And some of that could also be rotating with some of that severe weather. The forecast rainfall though, kind of spreads itself out. We don't really see these isolated, very, very concentrated areas of heavy rainfall that could cause significant flooding let it spread out for the most part. Back out here toward the west the temperatures are beginning to come down in some spots. Now Phoenix you're still going to be hot for a few more days. But if you take a look at Death Valley in Vegas, at least by Friday, Vegas, you're back to normal and although normal is still 104 degrees, it is still going to be back to that number not where you been. Still another couple hot days across the Pacific Northwest and across the south still, obviously the McGee's are still here. Temperatures although in the 90s will feel closer to 100 by the afternoon when you add that heat index in the mix.",

It's part of this larger scripted symbolic effort to convince Japanese citizens, Japan's neighbors, and really the rest of the world that this water release is safe and that it is the right thing to do.I was at the plant in April, and I know you have been there before. And these days, it very much is reminiscent of a water treatment facility. And that's what's taking place there. This wastewater that has been used to cool the plant over the years has been treated, it has been diluted. And even though there are some remnants of a radioactive isotope known as tritium, it is still very much in line with international standards that permit this kind of release. But obviously, there are still skeptics within Japan and on a much broader scale, including from China.
