For the second straight day, striking writers are meeting with the heads of four major studios.The person familiar with yesterday's talks tells CNN that attendees left, quote, \"feeling encouraged.\" The standoff has now dragged on for more than 140 days. And the estimated costs are pushing towards $6 billion across multiple industries. Joining us now is Sara Fischer. She's a CNN media analyst and senior media reporter for \"Axios.\" Sara, these negotiations under way with the writers could have a big impact on content produced and it could be something for the actors' strike as well?",

If they can get it done, it means they can pivot their attention toward that other strike, the ongoing strike with the actors.The thing is note is today is a pivotal moment. Writers and producers met first time yesterday in over a month as tensions were growing bigger. They restarted negotiations today. If we don't get a deal soon, it's likely this strike could go on towards maybe even end of the year. So if you think about what it's already done to fall TV production, pushing shows out to 2024, imagine if it goes through end of the year? Talking about award shows potentially pushed, more movies pushed into later 2024. It would not only wreak havoc for a lot of these Hollywood, companies but it consumers who are waiting for new shows to hit their streaming services and hit their linear TV networks. SANCHEZ: In terms of timing, if things play out really well in negotiations and the strike lifts, how soon can these workers, these writers and actors, get back to production?",

It's something that Rupert Murdoch espoused today in his note to staff. The main question becomes, what's the largest succession plan for Rupert Murdoch? Even though he steps back out of the chairman role, he's a 92-year-old executive. So I think there's a large looming question around what happens after he passes to his empire.",

Big picture, Rupert Murdoch, a populist, conservative, has owned a global empire of media outlets. A lot of these hard news outlets, like the \"Wall Street Journal,\" for example, they produce hard editorial straight news. But their opinion sections have been very influential for Republicans over the years. So it will be curious to see how this moves forward as he steps into a new role.",

In fact, most of them -- several of them having to have had to be air evacuated from the scene there. We are working to get you also pictures. And in those images, you will eventually be able to see a bus on its side in a heavily wooded area just off of -- about 16 miles northwest of New York City, where this accident took place in Orange County, New York.
