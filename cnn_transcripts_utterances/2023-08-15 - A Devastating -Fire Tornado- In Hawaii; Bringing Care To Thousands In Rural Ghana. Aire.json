Right here, this is the first hotel in Hawaii. The pioneer hotel, pioneer theater it`s completely gone. Right over here was the library. It`s just now a stone shell of scorched blocks around front street there, Fleetwood, Mick Fleetwood of -- of the band Fleetwood Mac. His place is gutted out with flames. It`s just unrecognizable.

Answer is going to be Ghana, located in Western Africa, translating to warrior king. Let`s travel to Ghana now to meet one of our CNN heroes. After watching many family members and neighbors struggle with access to basic healthcare, they decided to make it their life`s mission to bring medical care to remote communities in Ghana, through his doctor`s office on wheels. Now, their hope health man has served more than 4,000 people in the community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "In Ghana, many people don`t have access to healthcare. We`ve designed the van like a clinic when we are traveling,especially in long distances. There`s a lot of potholes. There have been a lot of times where our car got stuck in the mud. This is our daily experience. Sometimes because of the poor network, we can get home as late as 12:00 a.m. We bring healthcare to the doorstep of rural and unserved communities in Ghana. I grew up in a very small community in Ghana. We grew up where people had to walk several miles to go to the nearest hospital, which is located in the urban areas. There were a lot of people who lost the lives due to diseases that could have been easily prevented or at a bare minimum managed. Early screenings wasn`t an option for us. I lost my grandmother and my auntie. My grandmother was a very big part of my life. It was very hard when we lost her and it was due to something that could have been easily prevented. That is the painful part. This is my family. And I said that once I come of age, I`m going to ensure that people have access to healthcare. I took my education very seriously. So in 2016, I got in a scholarship to study at Cornell and really learned about how diseases affected the human body. I realized that these people don`t have the luxury of time. The food that they put on the table is determined by what they sell in the market. If I tell them to go to the hospital, there was no way they`re going to go. Thank you so much for coming. It`s going to be a long day. So then, I had to think like, how do I bring healthcare to them? And that was the birth of the mobile health van. So, we just arrived at one of the rural communities that we`ve been working with. Currently, we are setting up our PPEs, disinfected, taking out our diagnostics and also medications. (Through translator) As you are all aware we came here from time to time for this health outreach. 90 to 95% everyone that comes through has one health issue or the other. And the first person they meet is our operation director, so he will collect the demographics like name, age. And then the person will move on to the nurse. The nurse will collect the vitals. And once the nurse is done, the patient will move onto the doctor. We`ve been to communities where they haven`t seen a doctor before. Literally, they haven`t been to the hospital before. Seeing how the moms, the fathers, the grandmothers, the children are really excited and really grateful. Words cannot describe the feeling that you get providing care for someone who otherwise wouldn`t be alive if your mobile health van wasn`t there. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
