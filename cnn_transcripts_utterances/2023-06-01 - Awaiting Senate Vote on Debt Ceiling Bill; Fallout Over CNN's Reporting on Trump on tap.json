They are just in the process of wrapping up some votes on amendments. None of those are expected to pass. And then they're going to move immediately to final passage. So, that could happen really within the next 30 minutes. And we are expecting it to pass. Then the final step will be to go to President Biden's desk for signature.But I want to point out that this was actually a very rocky road to get here. It took weeks of intense negotiations. There was multiple breakdowns. And even just getting a time agreement to fast track this bill in the Senate tonight took some cajoling because there were some Republican defense hawks and Republican appropriators who were really worried about this bill's impact on the spending process going forward, worried about cuts to key defense programs. And so in order to earn their cooperation, Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell put out a rare joint statement saying they are committed to passing all individual 12 appropriations bills on the Senate floor in order to avoid a 1 percent across the board spending cut that would be mandated by this bill if they don't pass all those bills. And then Schumer also took to the floor and made a floor speech where he said, they have other means, like the supplemental appropriations bills, to try to pass emergency aid packages, including for Ukraine. But Republicans weren't the only ones with concerns. There was Democrats. They don't like the work requirements, stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients. They didn't like some of the new energy permitting reforms. So, there was a lot of members on both sides of the aisle who were grumbling over this bill. But in the end, we are expecting members from both sides of the aisle to come together and to avoid what would be the first ever catastrophic default.",

So, the burden becomes even more difficult.

We don't know whether Joe Biden or Mike Pence knew they had classified documents. They've denied it. Donald Trump has many times over acknowledged that he knew. And in this new recording that we have reporting on, he again acknowledges that he knows he has classified documents. Then you get into the question of intent. What was he going to do with these?Now, he's not posting them online on a gaming platform, but one of the really important things about this reporting is it gives us the first indication of what on earth was he doing with these documents and what is he doing in this scenario? He's trying to persuade some journalists to spin things his way for political advantage by sort of flaunting, I have this classified information.

Was that fall that you just saw cause for concern to you?DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, it was bad optics, certainly, for the president, but he tripped on the sandbag. We learned a little bit about the president's gait from his doctor, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, after the president had his physical this February. And what -- Dr. O'Connor said is that the president does have a fairly sort of stiff gait. It's pretty noticeable that he takes relatively short steps. He almost shuffles his feet. And Dr. O'Connor had some of his neurology advisors assess the president to look for any neurologic cause. And it appears that the conclusion was that he's very arthritic and he's very stiff and he walks with a stiff gait. And when you do that, you don't have a lot of sort of agility. So when your foot catches a sandbag, you go down. We've seen the president fall a couple of other times going up the stairs of Air Force One. And if you don't get your leg up high enough, if you're a little bit stiff and you catch the step and you're trying to jog up the steps pretty quickly, because otherwise you're in pretty good shape, you know, you go down.

But the president apparently doesn't have any of the other stigmata of that, and they didn't think he had Parkinson's. And it appears that the president is just 80 years old, and we know that 80-year-olds fall. It's thought that about one out of every four people over the age of 65 will fall in any given year. There are millions of, there are about three million E.R. visits a year for mechanical faults. One of the most common reasons people come to the E.R. But older people fall more commonly. And once someone falls, they're more likely to fall again. Now, the sequelae of falling can be severe for an 80 year old. You can break a hip and that can be absolutely life changing or life ending if you break a hip. And the president takes a blood thinner for atrial fibrillation. And if you're on a blood thinner, you're more likely to bleed as a consequence of a fall. So these are not, you know, so benign.

Democrats in particular worried about the stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients. They also did not like some of the permitting reforms for energy projects.
