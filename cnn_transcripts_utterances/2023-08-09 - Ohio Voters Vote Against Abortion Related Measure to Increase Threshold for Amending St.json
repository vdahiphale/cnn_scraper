A Republican-backed measure was soundly defeated in a high-stakes special election.

The failed measure would have changed the rules and required a 60 percent super majority instead of a simple majority to pass abortion amendment when it goes on the ballot in November.

Those are the types of voters who went in Ohio last night, probably, and voted no on that particular ballot issue. And here's the other thing, right. It's not just about abortion. It's about going to the rest of the ballot box. So I want you to take a look -- this is a little complicated. But this the average special election, and this is the Democratic margin. Look at where we were in 2021 and 2022 before Roe v Wade was overturned. The Democratic candidates were doing three points worse than Joe Biden on average. But look at where we were since Roe was overturned. Look here. They are doing about six points better than Joe Biden's been doing on average. So it's not just about abortion. It's other these issues, what you are seeing is Democratic-leaning voters more likely to turn out and they're more likely to support Democratic candidates. So abortion, it's not just about abortion.

You're talking climate, but also economy. And the latest CNN poll out just days ago showed that Americans are pretty sour on the state of the economy. They think it's in a downturn or getting worse. About half of respondents, the president's approval rating for his handling of the economy is at 37 percent, 30 percent on inflation specifically. From the White House's perspective, why is their disparity between the good story, the narrative you think you have to tell, and how it's received by the American people? JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things, Victor. Look, as we know, polls don't show everything. They don't tell the full story, as you just stated. And we have to remember, if you look at where we were back in the fall of 2022 during the midterm elections, when the president delivered a historic midterms for Democrats, when we think about how, as a - as a Democratic president he delivered a victory that we hadn't seen in decades, right? And he led that messaging throughout those months going into November. And we are in a stronger position now than we were back - back then in the fall. And so that is important to note. Look, there's a - there's a lot going on in this country and we understand that, you know, Americans are coming out of a pandemic. We are dealing - we're dealing with a lot, when you think about the economy. But, here's the thing, this is a president who has spent the last two years turning the economy around. You hear us talk about Bidenomics. You just mentioned how we're doing this west - this kind of - this West Coast swing, talking directly to the American people about how wages are actually going up, about how inflation is going down over a long, extended period of time, more than - more than 12 months. That is important. That is important. Consumer confidence is up. And so, when you see unemployment is lower than 4 percent, that has been steady for some time, this is what we are going to talk about. This is why the president is going out there, is going to talk directly to the American people to have that conversation. Again, polls don't tell the entire story. We're going to continue to tell our story, tell what we have done in the past two years. When you think about creating 13.5 million jobs -- BLACKWELL: Yes. JEAN-PIERRE: -- that is all important. And so this is why I'm on with all of - with both of you to talk about that, to make sure that the president's message is reaching your viewers.",

That you've got a narrative now of Bidenomics and things going in a certain way, but that can quickly turn in the opposite direction. Why literally fuse the president's name with the economics that Americans aren't very happy with?JEAN-PIERRE: Well, here's the thing, Bidenomics is indeed working when - when we say that -- you look at the data, right? Cost of - cost is going down, right. We think about inflation. When you think about wages going up, that is Bidenomics. Look, the president has always believed -- not just as president, but as vice president, as a senator, that we need to build an economy that is building from the bottom up, middle out, right? We need to make sure we leave no one behind. He came from a middle class family. You heard him talking about growing up in Scranton, what that means.

I just started talking about the Inflation Reduction Act. That is a piece of legislation that is clearly now law that is so ambitious, that is going to make an investment in dealing with climate change that we have never seen. We have not seen before. And so you think about $369 billion of investment into clean energy, that's going to make a difference when you think about cutting pollution, when you think about creating clean energy jobs, this is what we're talking about. You talk about the bipartisan infrastructure law, right, that's going to strengthen our power grid, right, that's going to actually make efforts to deal with an existential threat. And you heard the president say that. And you have heard him say that multiple times. We were just in Arizona yesterday where the president announced his fifth national monument. And what is that going to do? It's going to honor the tribal communities and - a nd the indigenous people by protecting land. Almost a million acres of land. And what does that do? That protects clean energy. That helps the economy and local - and the local economy, and clean water, right? And so all of those things are incredibly important, and the president has been incredibly ambitious. Look, what the president was talking about is the - the defense - the Defense Production Act. That's something that he did very early on. What does that do? That makes sure that when - when we - when we think about the domestic approach, those clean - clean energy manufacturing moved - moved here. So, all of these things are important.",
