I'm Rahel Solomon in New York, in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.We're now just nine days from the election and it is crunch time for both campaigns. Today, the candidates are blitzing the campaign trail, making their final pitches and targeting key voters. And it comes as CNN's brand-new national poll of polls shows the race is deadlocked as we enter this critical home stretch. So far more than 40 million Americans have already cast their votes. The campaigns now focused on rallying the rest of their base to head to the polls and also trying to sway the few remaining undecided voters. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris, she is in battleground Pennsylvania where she spoke this morning at a church service. She's also making several stops in Philly's black and Latino neighborhoods. Meantime her political rival, former President Donald Trump, is skipping the swing states for a homecoming in deep blue New York. In a few hours, Trump will host a rally in New York City's iconic Madison Square Garden. Let's kick off our team coverage this hour in the critical state of Pennsylvania. That is where Vice President Harris is campaigning right now. Let's get to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who is there. So Priscilla what can you share with us about the Harris campaign strategy as we enter these final few days now?",

So that is going to be part of the closing argument. But also reproductive freedom. We saw on Friday the vice president with Beyonce in Houston, Texas talking about this issue at what they see as the epicenter of what they've called the Trump abortion ban. So the vice president, both trying to draw a sharp contrast with former President Donald Trump over the closing days of this election, but also prominently featuring some of the key issues that Democrats say will galvanize voters to the polls and that especially means reproductive freedom. So a lot expected on those two fronts, including here in Philadelphia today.",

I talked to his camp about it really for months. They were trying to figure out how to do it. There was concern, just given the politics of New York it would never happen. Given the timing, it would never happen. And then this all fell into place and they're treating this rally really like RNC part 2. They have a list of speakers, some other celebrities who have endorsed Donald Trump as well as those lawmakers here to really rally up the crowd. Now Donald Trump has privately said he thinks he could win New York, but every single campaign adviser, every ally of his seems to think that is just a pipe dream. It's something he said, even said it on a call last night with New York lawmakers. But they are hoping that this rally could at least spike some enthusiasm among Republicans in New York to help with some of those vulnerable House seats. That's why he did that call last night. The other thing to keep in mind here is that this is serving as one of Donald Trump's largest fundraisers today. They had been selling packages that include a free event with the former president, VIP suites, a photo opportunity. All of this to raise money around him being here at Madison Square Garden. I look around the room and there are already thousands of people here. The floor is filled. The first row or the first set of rows is all filled and they're letting people in continuously. There was a long line outside, not clear where these people are from. I'm also seeing a handful of former administration officials, Trump allies, donors that they are intending on at least trying to fill the entirety of Madison Square Garden. As you noted, Rahel, this is a real homecoming for Donald Trump something that he has wanted to do. This is his home city of New York. Obviously, he lives in Florida now, but it's something that's important to him and they are certainly putting on a show which Donald Trump loves to do today ahead of this kicking off of the last week of campaigning before those voters hit the polls on November 5.",

We'll keep an eye on that.But Doug, let me bring you into the conversation. Former President Trump as we just said, campaigning in his hometown with a big rally later today at Madison Square Garden. Your reaction to that. Is that the best use of his time now and will this rally still reach critical voters in the swing states, even though it's happening in Manhattan. DOUG HEYE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I think what -- you know, Rahel, whether you're talking about Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, I'd say time spent out of the seven key states that are the swing states that could turn this election by and large is wasted time. Your time is better spent in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada, Arizona, et cetera than it is in Texas or in Washington, D.C. or in New York. But with this Trump event yes, it's going to get a lot of coverage, although a lot of people, especially young males, who Trump wants to win with big margin, will probably be watching football. But I think Karen would probably agree with me that every political campaign that you're on, whether you're running for mayor or for president there's always some event that makes staff sort of scratch their heads, why are we doing this in this way? And the answer is always to scratch that itch that a candidate has. So many times in campaigns I've been on, again I'm sure it's the same for Karen. You're doing something ultimately because the candidate really wants to do it. And clearly, Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden is sort of like a lifelong dream for him, regardless of whether he wins or loses.",

So it didn't look quite so small. Clearly, they're trying to show some momentum. We heard our own reporter talk about this is sort of RNC part 2. They know they had some momentum coming out of the RNC. They're trying to recapture that. The problem that I would say with Harris if you look at not just what the vice president is doing today, but we have four other top campaign surrogates on the road today, holding events, crowd events, retail politics events, meaning that it's a force multiplier. More people in more places talking to more voters. Whereas Trump is largely going to be speaking to people who probably already support him. Maybe could reach some of the folks that might be on the fence.

But he's trying to also put it in a way that it is somewhat more explainable. I would say though this is not what you want to be talking about a week out from the election. You want to be talking about those things that voters are saying they either don't like about the Biden-Harris administration. We don't hear the word Biden all that much anymore. We should hear more of it from Republicans. And those concerns that they have about Kamala Harris and hit on the issue of the economy, hit on the issue of the border over and over again, work the leg like the Anderson brothers used to do and you can have success.

And I understand that the specific location in Parchin that is what was targeted and targeted successfully. I think Reuters reported it.

I think that we really are, and I'm not sure that many people appreciate it, but we really are in a different stage now in western Asia or the Middle East whereby Iran has kind of opened itself up to Israeli strikes. And Israel now will have the ability to decide when and where to strike. Of course, taking into consideration diplomatic and military and political considerations. But it's really a new situation, not a good one for Iran.",

If you break it down by party, 685,836 registered Democrats, 633,710 registered Republicans, independents coming in at 72,075.Obviously, they will play key role in this election because this district, the 45th congressional district, could be one of the key races that could end up the deciding if Republicans or Democrats take control of the House. The district's incumbent, Michelle Steel, a Republican she's running for reelection. A third term against Democrat Derek Tran, and to highlight the importance of this race, former President Bill Clinton was here stumping for Tran yesterday, trying to get out the Asian American vote. That's very important in this district, Rahel, because since redistricting in 2020, about 40 percent of the population of this district is Asian-American. They've become an extremely important voting bloc in this area. And I spoke with one of them earlier, Vietnamese American, Vietnamese born and American citizen who's been in Orange County for more than 30 years, is a retired engineer and a registered Republican, but he told me that the Republican Party doesn't represent him anymore, and that the voted Democrat up and down ballot because he's very concerned about Donald Trumps ability to run the economy and to handle the country during a time of conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, both of these being key factors to draw voters in to get their votes early.",

In the city of Asheville, classes resume tomorrow, but on a modified schedule and no after-school programs. Asheville City School superintendent Maggie Fehrman told CNN this morning that none of their schools were damaged in the storm and will have electricity, internet, and running water. Asheville is in Buncombe County, but operates an independent system -- an independence city school system, I should say. Buncombe County's students went back to school Friday. Schools are on a two two-hour delay and drinking water is being delivered just as Asheville schools are doing because what's coming out of the pipes is not yet safe for drinking.
