      "sentences": "Omar, it also reduced the powers of the attorney general to rule that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was -- should step down, effectively, because of the conflict of interest.All of this -- what we're hearing today in the Supreme Court -- this hearing before three Supreme Court justices has its roots in Netanyahu's legal troubles. You will recall that he is on trial for corruption charges he vehemently denies. So, at the time when his legal troubles began there were petitions to the Supreme Court saying Netanyahu is unfit for office. He shouldn't be able to be prime minister. The Supreme Court said no, he can be prime minister so long as there's no conflict of interest. But then roll on to this government. It unveils this judicial overhaul -- this controversial overhaul that has led to hundreds of thousands of protesters being on the streets for several months here in Israel. And the attorney general says hang on, Netanyahu. You're on trial for corruption. This represents a conflict of interest. You can't be involved. So the government passes a law effectively allowing Netanyahu to be involved because it reduces the attorney general's power to say that this is a conflict of interest and he would have to step down from office. So what the Supreme Court is hearing today is whether that law is OK. The petitioners, including the attorney general, say no, it's not OK because it was tailored to Netanyahu and it therefore represents an abuse of power. And the significance of this ruling is that this law that was passed is an amendment to a basic law. That's the closest Israel has to a constitution. And never before has the Supreme Court struck down a basic law or an amendment to a basic law. And if it does decide to strike down this basic law it could indicate the Supreme Court's willingness to strike down this reasonableness bill when it gets together in September -- this first part of the government's judicial overhaul. So that would make that less significant if it doesn't set a precedent because the precedent would be set in this case. And that, Omar, is why this hearing matters.",

If anything, his lead could actually grow.So let's bring in Michelle Price, a national political reporter for the Associated Press. Great to see you. Thanks for joining us. So I want to start with Trump's former attorney general Bill Barr. He was on CNN last night and here is part of what he had to say about using campaign funds for legal fees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I find that sort of nauseating, and this guy claims to be a multibillionaire. And he goes out and raises money from hardworking class -- hardworking people -- small donors, and tells them this is to defend America and to take care of the election. He didn't provide any significant support during the '22 elections and a lot of this money seems to be going to his legal fees. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That being said, this is the third indictment. It's possible there will be a fourth indictment. It's unclear how many times he can kind of go back to this well and keep tapping these folks for donations. But he has spent an extraordinary amount of money. I think it was $40 million that his political action committee has spent on legal fees just, so far, in 2023.",

So, I -- after the -- I guess I have multiple indictments to choose from now, but after the second one -- the classified docs one -- I spoke to a lot of Trump voters and the indication I got from them was they weren't just going to take Jack Smith or any federal indictment at face value because value-wise they just don't trust the Department of Justice.And so, along those lines, when you look at the rest of the GOP field they're still figuring out how to walk the political tightrope and being critical of Trump without upsetting his base, outside of Chris Christie who I think it's safe to say has held nothing back. What types of lines have you seen these candidates try to walk and how they navigate these indictments?",

Now, just ahead -- or right now, honestly, Lionel Messi continues to show why he's considered the greatest soccer player of all time with another showcase performance last night.

His club, Inter Miami -- they were taking on state -- in-state rival Orlando City in the Leagues Cup round of 16 last night and Messi was just at it again. In the seventh minute, he's going to receive this ball off his chest and just drills it into the back of the net. Now, Orlando was not making this easy on Messi. They were getting really chippy with him and Messi was giving it right back. He even got a yellow card in the 21st minute. But we're going to fast-forward all the way to the 72nd minute. Josef Martinez is going to receive this ball and get it over to Messi and he, once again, just rifles it in. Messi, five goals in three games now with Miami. They win 3-1 to advance to the quarterfinals of the Leagues Cup. All right. Elsewhere, Iowa State quarterback Hunter Dekkers is stepping away from the team after criminal charges were filed against him as a part of an ongoing sports wagering investigation. The redshirt junior is accused of placing 366 bets with 26 of those involving Iowa State events, including a 2021 football game in which he did not play. The complaint alleges the bets were made from Dekker's phone using an account set up under the name of a family member. He was also under the age of 21 at the time, which is below the legal betting age in Iowa. Dekkers has denied the accusations. Seven current or former Iowa and Iowa State athletes are facing charges, including Broncos defensive lineman Eyioma Uwazurike. He was suspended indefinitely by the NFL last week for gambling on league games, some that he played in. He can petition for reinstatement in one year. All right. In the latest chapter of college realignment, the Big Ten could soon expand to as many as 20 teams, according to multiple reports. The league has reportedly begun preliminary talks to add Oregon and Washington. Cal and Stanford are also said to be under consideration. All four of those schools are currently members of the Pac-12 conference. That would leave the future of the Pac-12 certainly uncertain. In addition to USC and UCLA already going to the Big Ten, the league also is going to lose Colorado to the Big 12 after this coming season. All right. In baseball, Yankees pitcher Domingo German is going to miss the remainder of the season after voluntarily entering inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse. The right-hander, who turns 31 tomorrow, threw a perfect game back in June against the A's. He was scratched from his scheduled start Monday night against the Rays. The Yankees said it was because of armpit discomfort. But German did enter in relief and tossed five scoreless innings of two-hit ball in that one. All right. Finally, Tom Brady is back in football. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM BRADY, 7-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION:  So here's the deal. I'm officially coming on board at Birmingham City Football Club. And maybe you're asking what do you know about English football, Tom? Well, let's just say I've got a lot to learn. But I do know a few things about winning and I think they might translate pretty well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Is the Biden administration justifiably angry about Fitch's recent decisions or are these decisions pretty warranted at this point? JOHN LEER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco):  I think there is a reason to be disappointed. Of course, they're private sector enterprises so I don't think that the government really has room in this instance to get too bent out of shape. But it is particularly concerning because I think the timing is -- it's just off. It is a little bizarre, as Richard said in that prior piece. The U.S. economy has been pretty steadily improving. We got through the debt standoff and the debt ceiling negotiations I think without really harming the underlying governance structure.

Yes, I think a lot of folks on Wall Street think that inflation is over. We don't quite see that yet. I think it's likely that you'll get some sort of a bounceback inflation possible from the housing market.And so, on top of that, I think it's a slightly nuanced view. But even if interest rates stay the same and inflation starts to fall, which we've seen, real rates -- inflation-adjusted rates are essentially becoming higher so, effectively, borrowing money is becoming more expensive. So even if the Fed doesn't raise rates again going forward there's a chance that it will, in fact, become more expensive and ultimately, more contractionary in the economy.",
