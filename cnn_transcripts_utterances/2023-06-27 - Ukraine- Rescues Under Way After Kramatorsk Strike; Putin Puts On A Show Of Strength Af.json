Local officials accusing Russian forces of deliberately targeting crowded civilian areas right in the center of the city of Kramatorsk.In Russia tonight, Vladimir Putin is attempting to show strength after the mutiny by Wagner mercenaries. This as we have a new satellite image suggesting the Wagner chief is indeed in exile right now in Belarus. And Donald Trump is now responding to the audio obtained exclusively by CNN in which he acknowledges having secret documents he did not declassify. Stand by to hear the recordings and what Trump is saying now. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. We begin in Ukraine with the new Russian missile strike on a very crowded city center. The death toll now up to at least four, including a baby and more than 40 injured. CNN's Ben Wedeman is joining us no live from Kramatorsk, where it's obviously very dangerous right now. Ben, give us the latest. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we understand from the authorities that the death toll now stands at four, with a 17-year-old girl among them, as well as 42 injured among them, and eight month old baby. Now, this happened at 7:32 in the evening when this -- the restaurant that seems to have been the target was full of people, full of soldiers, full of civilians. There are also indications that perhaps in the basement dining room of that restaurant, there was some sort of party there as well. So, all expectations are that the casualty numbers are going to rise. Now, when were at the site, we had to leave suddenly because there was word that an air raid might happen, and therefore the rescue workers and everybody else who was around had to leave the area and all work had to halt. Now, we believe the work has resumed, but there's a lot of work to be done, Wolf. We actually managed to get inside the most damaged area. What we saw were rescue workers digging desperately in the rubble. They also brought a crane in to try to lift these huge slabs of concrete that had fallen. And it was a huge explosion. We're not quite sure if it was one missile strike or two, because the extent of the damage wasn't just around the restaurant, but in the entire area. I saw, for instance, one car engine that was actually thrown across the street. We saw one woman who was desperate to find out about what had happened to her, two adult children who were working inside the restaurant. Lots of people just trying to find news of loved ones who were either patrons or workers there. So, this is obviously not the first time Kramatorsk has been struck, but it was struck at a time and in a place that was full of people. Wolf.",

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader has now arrived in neighboring Belarus, according to its officials, after charges of insurrection against him and his fighters in Russia were dropped. It's possible Wagner fighters could now work alongside the Belarussian military, suggests Aleksandr Lukashenko, the country's leader, though he said no camps for them had yet been built. The Russian Defense Ministry says the mercenary group must first surrender its heavy weapons. And the Kremlin, which now admits fully funding Wagner, says it will investigate how more than a billion dollars recently paid for salaries and bonuses was really spent. Back at the Kremlin, a minute's silence for the Russian pilots killed in Prigozhin's uprising.

I want to bring in retired U.S. General David Petraeus. He's the former CIA director of the former commander of the U.S. military's Central Command. General Petraeus, thank you so much for joining us. As we see these devastating images from this latest deadly Russian strike on Ukraine, how do you expect the Wagner mutiny will influence Putin's approach to this war in Ukraine? GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTCOM: Well, I think the central issue here is that Putin and his military have lost quite a capable force. Keep in mind that the only success in the winter offensive that was concluded a couple of months ago was that achieved by the Wagner group when they took Bakhmut, terrible losses in doing so. But again, they did actually achieve the objectives set out for them. That force has now been withdrawn from the battlefield and now it's no longer an option of bringing it back into the fold. And depending on how large you assess that was, the numbers go as high as 25,000, some also a good bit lower than that. Those forces are no longer available. Prigozhin himself is no longer available. For all of his thuggish acts and so forth, he was on the front lines, he was with his soldiers. And by the way, that thuggish approach had some appeal to those in the ranks and also, frankly, to some throughout Russia.",

Prigozhin's criticisms of the minister of defense, chief of the general staff, the decision to launch the war the way the war was being conducted, all of which, of course, enraged Putin in the end, when this gets to the soldiers, will it cause them to question what it is that they're doing?And then, can the Ukrainians capitalize on this? They've been conducting all of these probing attacks, reconnaissance and force positioning these new armored brigades that are full of the Western tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, can they then capitalize on this? Crack the Russian lines, force the Russians to start moving in response to that, and then really build on that and generate momentum that could ultimately allow them to cut that ground line of communication from Russia through southeastern Ukraine to Crimea.",

About half would like to see someone else nominated, about half would like to turn the page. The other half would like to stick with the former president.But all of this is built into sort of this ongoing campaign. I was speaking with an evangelical minister in Iowa who would desperately like the party to nominate someone else. He told me, look, I don't think this moves the needle much at all. He was sort of regretful about that because he believes that some people view this as a badge of honor, his words, other people simply are ready to move on. So, I think even hearing these sounds from the former president, we've heard so much over the last eight years, voters have just been inundated by so much information. Even though Republican voters are likely to render judgment on him before jurors ever will, there's just not a sense that a majority, a large majority of the Republican Party will turn against him. But, Wolf, you just never know. There is an opening in the Republican Party among Republican voters to turn the page, again, half the party. But he doesn't need half the party to win the nomination, he can do that by 25 percent or 30 percent.
