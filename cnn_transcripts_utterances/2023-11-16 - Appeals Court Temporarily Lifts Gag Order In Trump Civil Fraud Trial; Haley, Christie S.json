So this one judge and associate justice at the first department, New York Appellate Court, granting at least on a temporary basis, a stay of the gag order, meaning that has lifted. That the former president and his attorneys can now talk more freely about the case and the judge and his communications with the law clerk.You know this has been something that Trump's lawyers have made an issue of throughout the trial. Ultimately leading to the gag order on them. And their argument here is that the public needs to know what is happening inside the courtroom, and they want the public to be able to hear Trump's version of this. But his accusations of bias, they don't want him to be infringed from making any of these allegations. They have said that imagine if this was a Trump appointed judge who was taking steps in the other direction that the public would want to know about it. This thing is only fair for Trump to be able to speak about what he alleges to be bias in this trial. In this -- in you know, entire trial now and it's seven weeks. So for now this gag order has been lifted and the former president will be free to speak about the judge, the law clerk, any of the staff, you know, and the judge that you remember has already fined Trump $15,000 for violating the gag order. Now that is also appears to be on hold as well -- Pam.",

Donald Trump, still way out in front here to be clear. But Haley and Christie have gained support since September. And then Ron DeSantis he is down just a little bit there, a point. Let's talk about this now with CNN chief national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny and CNN national political writer Fredreka Schouten. OK, Jeff first just take us through this polling here.",

This is our new poll out from the University of New Hampshire and CNN. It was out at noon today. And let's take a look at these numbers.Donald Trump is at 42 percent. That is up slightly from 39 percent just in September. Also, Nikki Haley 20 percent. That is up eight points from September. So she has the most movement, the most change in this race. You've seen that, of course, as her debate performance has really been one of the stronger aspects of her candidacy. Chris Christie, also up just a bit up to 14 percent. And then DeSantis at 9 percent, that of course explains why the Florida governor is now putting essentially all of his campaign efforts into Iowa because New Hampshire has stalled a bit. So this is where we are a little more than two months before the New Hampshire primary. They set the date of it yesterday. It will be on January 23rd. But again, Nikki Haley, having a good moment, but it's still Donald Trump's race to lose by a mile.",

Not just the folks who have said I'm with her. For instance, Ken Griffin, hedge fund manager, billionaire many times over, said that he's actively contemplating supporting her. That could be a game changer. I mean, this is someone who puts $71 million into the midterm races, into super PACs to help elect Republicans. Imagine if he were to sort of jump into her race.",

And one of the things that they are very interested in is the factthat she has been talking about being compassionate and trying to find a middle ground. And what I'm hearing from them is concern about the six week ban that DeSantis signed in Florida. And the fact that we've had a string of losses on the abortion issue in Kentucky and Ohio and Virginia, and they're looking for someone who can really appeal to moderate voters in a general election. And that's one of the things that has been like loud and clear in the conversations I've had with fundraisers and donors.",

And to give you an idea of how, you know, this started it started with a user on X daring people to prove that, quote, Hitler was right. And I'll read you the exchange.One user took up this other users challenge and he wrote back: OK Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. And then Elon Musk responds and says, quote: You have said the actual truth. Later Elon Musk tried to sort of walk back what he said. He said he was only maybe referring to ADL. But to be clear, Elon Musk has engaged in this sort of antisemitic rhetoric in the past. I mean, earlier this year he went after George Soros, who has been the victim of a number of antisemitic attacks -- mostly from the rights. And in that case, he said that, quote: George Soros wants to erode the very fabric of civilization. Soros hates humanity. And so this is not new from Elon Musk. Elon Musk often engages us in in this kind of rhetoric. And frankly, Pam, as you well know, he hasn't met a conspiracy theory that he hasn't really jumped on the bandwagon with.",

That said, all these brands have been had -- having their ads placed adjacent to hate speech.And IBM coming out quickly and saying that they have quote: Zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination, and they have immediately suspended all advertising on X while they investigate what they described as an unacceptable situation. Again though, Pam, not new. We had a review last month at CNN that found a number of major advertisers, including the NFL and Amazon, and Big Blue chip advertisers were having their ads placed on a account for one of the most antisemitic, racist publications in existence. And so, this is a huge problem for Elon Musk and his chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, over there because they're trying to tell advertisers this is a safe place to advertise your products, to market your products.

And they said content promoting this letter clearly violates our rules and supporting any -- any form of terrorism. They said that they are taking it down. They also claim the videos on TikTok -- the number of videos on TikTok on this issue are small and reports of a trending on our platform are inaccurate. I will say me and my colleagues Allison Gordon and Catherine Thorbecke have been looking at TikTok all morning. We have found dozens of videos with millions of views of people praising this. Now let -- and we should stress here right? This is not hundreds of people. It's not thousands of people. We have seen dozens. But it is still stunning to see dozens of American children, young people praising this sort of thing. But clearly TikTok is not doing the job that they're saying they're doing in that statement.",

That's roughly 300 Americans per day.Now, most of the. Illicit sources of fentanyl come from outside of the United States. Typically, that supply chain starts with chemical precursors made in China, which are then synthesized and manufactured by Mexican cartels and smuggled into United States. Now look, to be sure, solving or making meaningful progress on the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. is not just about supply. We need to meaningfully address the drivers of U.S. demand. To provide more access to treatment. That being said, if we can have an agreement that compels or spurs China to meaningfully cut down on those chemical precursors, it can make fentanyl supplies more scarce and more expensive.

This is precisely that middle class issue that affects so many Americans. So that's part of it.But we're also heading into an election year. You starting to see Republican candidates for president making noise about the fentanyl issue.
