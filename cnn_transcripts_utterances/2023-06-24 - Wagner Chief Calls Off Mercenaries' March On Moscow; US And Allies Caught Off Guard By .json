Vladimir Putin facing the most serious threat to his hold on power in more than 23 years. Even now, the ultimate outcome for him, for Russia, for Ukraine still uncertain with the world watching, in a deal alleged broken by Belarus. The founder in chief of the Wagner mercenary group, abruptly stopped his fighters' advance on Moscow and apparently pulled at least some fighters out of Rostov-on-Don.We don't know the status of Wagner forces right now. They had made it to within 120 miles, according to Prigozhin, of the capital when they suddenly decided to turn around. The Kremlin now saying the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has Putin's word he can go safely to Belarus free of any prosecution. You could see him in the backseat of that SUV being cheered by some folks on the street there in Rostov-on-Don, even want to shake his hand. Prigozhin saying he made the deal because he didn't want to shed Russian blood. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, FOUNDER, WAGNER GROUP (through translation): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides. We turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to start with CNN's Nick Robertson and Ivan Watson. So, Nic, Prigozhin has been seething at Russia's military leadership. We've been watching these videos he's been making for months attacking the Defense Minister Shoigu and others. He claimed that Russian forces had attacked his men, intentionally tried to kill Wagner forces. We don't know if that's true or not. And that's what ostensibly led him to invade the southern Russian cities, the Rostov-on-Don and start advancing on Moscow. Do we know anything about why he would make this deal? I mean, he says he wouldn't want to shed Russian blood. He certainly seemed pretty bloodthirsty before.",

So potentially, if his troops were attacked and he did overreact and he extended himself, he potentially realized his best way to back out of his overreaction and overreach whether he was safe temporarily in Rostov-on-Don, was to find a deal that would allow him to move out of Russia, at least lick his wounds, make his next move. But again, so much we don't know and we don't know his huge push to get rid of Shoigu. We don't know where that stands. We don't know where Shoigu is, and we don't know if Putin is going to keep him on as Minister of Defense.",

In this case, Russians not only saw what was happening on the streets in front of them, if you happen to be in Rostov or stuck on highways that have been blocked by the security forces, or you saw it on Russian state television, which actually has covered it and is actually saying, hey, the highways to Moscow were blocked. Now they're open again. They're reporting that Vladimir Putin is saying that this is treachery. This is a betrayal of the state on the scale of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But now Putin has just made a deal with the guy who he was calling a traitor just a couple of hours ago. So this has revealed, certainly, a weakness. And one that people saw in the 1990s, Anderson, and more recently, with the raids that Ukrainian forces have launched into Russian border areas that have been difficult for the Russian security forces to deal with. And if you think back to the 1990s, Chechen separatists used to go charging into Russia and would take a school hostage or an entire theater in Moscow hostage. And dealing with that was always a terrible, terrible crisis and disaster for the Russian security forces. And that's why this scenario could have been so much worse, potentially, because these were battle hardened mercenaries who also had their ranks filled with convicted criminals.",

That there would be a revolt in the town, or more of Prigozhin's people would go on a wild revolt in other parts of Russia. It demonstrates fear.Putin was the guy who could maintain the power balance with all the oligarchs. He was the one at the center who could be the godfather, who could say, yes, you can run that business. You give me that much. You do that, you do that. He was the balance. Then he went into Ukraine on the premise that he could win it really quickly, completely failed. Then he got stuck in a bit later now in essentially a trench warfare. So he's kind of failed the second go round. And now he's had this revolt on his streets, which hasn't been seen in Russia in decades. That's on his watch. And this was the guy who was supposed to be, A, so powerful, B, so -- had such a good idea of strategy and control, and now it all appears to evaporate. He is in a much weaker position, and his enemies, who weren't enemies before frenemies maybe, will now see opportunities here. Prigozhin is not the first in Russia to turn on their sort of advocate and the person that helped them develop their business and become an oligarch. Look, Putin himself, when Boris Berezovsky helped Putin become prime minister and then become president. Putin then turned on Berezovsky, who ultimately fled the country.

So, Putin has had a knack in terms of juggling all these different power centers, playing them off against one another. So he stays the man in the middle, the man in control.But he clearly lost control here. Prigozhin may have overcalculated, of course, but at the same time, Putin must have, too. Putin clearly didn't see this coming. And this is the biggest challenge that he's faced since 2000 when he took control of the country. So there's blood in the water now.

They report back whether they've taken certain towns back, but every town they take is completely wrecked. They're just flattened. There's not a lot to the real estate.

Because not only is it the war in Ukraine, but, I mean, they have real, obviously, a huge presence in CAR, in the Central African Republic. They fought in Mozambique, they fought in Namali, a number of places throughout Africa, and they have real financial benefits for Russia and certainly for Prigozhin.",

      "sentences": "I think that's the real question that we're facing now, and likely that Prigozhin himself is facing. We don't know if any discussion about Wagner's activities further abroad were part of that negotiation between Prigozhin and Putin today.But we do know that, really, the bulk of Wagner's activity and the core of Prigozhin's business empire does sit in Africa, and particularly in Sub-Saharan African states, where Wagner has specifically exchanged its various paramilitary services for access to natural resources like gemstones and gold. So this is in places like Sudan, the Central African Republic, Mali, although we haven't seen evidence of them exploiting the resources there yet. And so, I expect that while certainly there's a lot still up in the air, one of Prigozhin big priorities now will be to try to reassert his control over that wider network of Wagner operations and the various shell companies that are connected to him and to Wagner. And that's going to potentially be another stress point with Moscow, because Russia has relied so much on Wagner to be able to spread its different geopolitical and economic goals in Africa. There potentially could be some competition if Prigozhin can continue to control those operations, or if we see those operations become under a broader state umbrella, if we see someone else step in to replace Prigozhin, and then the potential fallout of a replacement stepping up.",

There was a report that Wagner forces would be able to sign contracts with the Russian army to continue to fight in Ukraine. How likely is it -- would Wagner forces have to join the Russian army, or are they free agents? They could not do that. Do you know?",

The Ministry of Defense had set a July 1st deadline for Wagner troops to sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense. And that's something that Prigozhin had just categorically rejected.What we see in the reported terms of the agreement between Prigozhin and Putin today is that Prigozhin and the sort of core group of his Wagner fighters who are involved in the activities over the past two days will not be forced to sign those contracts. And on the grounds, publicly-stated of their service in Ukraine, they will not be punished for their activities today. That's certainly up for debate. Putin is not someone to forgive lightly.",

At this point, I don't think that we can put a lot of credibility behind specific numbers. But I would also just cite the fact that while that's looking at troops in the Ukraine Russia area, there are also a large number of troops, a relatively large number of troops involved in activities in Africa and in other countries where Wagner has been active in recent years. So there are others that Prigozhin can continue to fall back on if he can maintain that control.",

And over the last 24 hours, White House officials have been really monitoring the developments, both through open source intelligence as well as what intelligence agencies are gathering. But the decision not to speak out is partly tied to the fast moving nature of events, but also because they don't want to give any appearance that the United States is involved or trying to put its finger on the scale of this attempted insurrection that was unfolding inside of Russia.Instead, what we have seen is US officials quietly behind the scenes monitoring developments, and also President Biden speaking with key allies. He spoke with several NATO allies this morning on the phone, including the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Top US officials, including cabinet officials, have been speaking with their counterparts as well. Now, listen, the US was caught off guard by how quickly this attempted insurrection by Yevgeny Prigozhin played out. But that's not to say that US officials were entirely surprised. And that's because the US has been keeping a close eye on these simmering tensions between the Wagner Group and the Russian Ministry of Defense. As early as January, the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, he referred to the Wagner Group as becoming a rival power center to the Russian Ministry of Defense. And more recently, US officials got a sense that Prigozhin and the Wagner Group were indeed preparing something. Now, in terms of when President Biden or the administration are going to break their silence and really weigh in here tomorrow, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, he is slated to appear on several Sunday shows, including CNN State of the Union. We will see what the US assessment is perhaps there is where we will get our first sense. Anderson?",

You'll remember if we just wind the clock back seven years ago, he was running the Internet Research Agency. The group that went out, sent people to the United States to go figure out divisive issues, came back and started posting from the Internet Research Agency on Facebook and elsewhere, efforts to basically send out disinformation and try to get -- to open up divisions within the American body politics.And they did it very effectively. They declare a protest in one place, and then a counter protest for the same day in the same place, and try to create a small riot. They did this in Texas, they did this in other places. So speed forward seven years and he's using Telegram, a widely-used messaging app and social media app as well. And he's announcing each of his moves, but he's also using it to declare that the Defense Ministry, the Defense Minister, General Gerasimov, the famed head of the Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, are corrupt, incompetent. And the amazing thing is, until today, he didn't get shut down.",
