      "sentences": "They say that on a per episode basis, these fees have gone down in the era of streaming. And so, they want studios that into account in their contract. And also, a show on Netflix or HBO Max or some of these other streamers, generally isn't as long as they show that would have aired on a broadcast network, usually there are about 10 episodes per streaming show versus the 20 plus episodes that were ordered on broadcast shows.And so, writers want this taken into account as well. And this is seemingly one of the main sticking points because the AMPTP, the trade association that represents the studios, they're saying they were willing to move up on compensation and some of the other things, but that they don't want to be forced to basically hire writers they say they don't need. And of course, the writers say that they would like studios to, obviously, make sure that their profession isn't a temporary profession. So, they are calling for some assurances on this. I want to read to you, John, a statement that the Writers Guild put out yesterday after the negotiations failed to materialize in a deal before the deadline. They said that, the studios' responses, to these industry challenges, have been wholly insufficient given the existential crises writers are facing. And they go on to say, the companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing. And of course, John, as you pointed out, we will see the immediate effects of this strike, late night comedy shows, like the one you just played from Colbert, those are expected to immediately go to reruns given there are no writers to produce their contents. And if this does go on for some time, those shows that were set to premiere in the fall could also be postponed. We'll keep a lookout, John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: We are watching very closely, the picket line start this afternoon. Oliver Darcy, thank you very much. Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR: And joining us now is Jonathan Handel, he's an entertainment and the author of \"Hollywood on Strike!: An Industry at War in the Entertainment -- in the Internet Age.\" Jonathan, thanks for coming in. I mean, you've been in this business for years. I mean, you wrote a book on the last major writer's strike that we're talking about. How do you describe and how do you lay out what is -- what this fight is really about? JONATHAN HANDEL, ENTERTAINMENT ATTORNEY AND AUTHOR, \"HOLLYWOOD ON STRIKE!\": Well, thank you for having me, Kate. This fight is about compensation and precarity. In other words, adequate pay and making sure that the profession remains a sustainable occupation for people. What the writers are saying is that compensation is down or flat, you know, they have released certain numbers, they haven't released other numbers. You know, there's debates about some of it. But, you know, they -- the fundamental issue, as Oliver pointed out, is the decline from a 22-episode model per season to a 10-episode. 10.2-episode, I think is the episode as the actual average. And what happens is, writers are hired by the series, and as, you know, any viewer knows, there are just tons of new series every year, scripted series, but they are paid by the episode and/or by the week. So, more writers are drawn into the system, because of the increase of the number of series, but there is less work for each individual writer to do. That makes the business a much more difficult one to sustain. And in addition, the so-called mini rooms, these rooms with a smaller number of writers working together than was typical, those rooms also tend to often close before the show even begins production. And the problem with that is for a junior writer, a staff writer, so- called, to move up the career ladder, they need experience doing production re-writes. They need experience interacting with director and with actors and indeed with editors. They need experience in post- production so that they are able to ultimately, when they got a good idea and a good pilot script, become sole winners (ph) themselves. Without that experience, writers are saying that they find themselves mired at the lower end of the career ladder.",

Let me play a little bit more for everyone what Seth Meyers said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SETH MEYERS, HOST, \"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS\": A strong writing is essential to the show. It's essential to any show where the host, myself, is at best a C-plus performer. Really got to have the jokes. Look, no one is entitled to a job in show business, but for those people who have a job in show business, they are entitled to fair compensation. They are entitled to make a living. I think it is a very reasonable demand that is being set out by the guild, and I support those demands. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The -- in the era of irrational exuberance, when money was like water, the company spent millions, tens of millions, and even in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars on so-called overall deals, which are deals with show runners who then become exclusive and they're trying to generate good ideas for shows. And if they get a show on the air then they get paid more and so forth.You know, and we're talking at the very pinnacle. People like Shonda Rhimes, Greg Pallante and a whole host of others. But some of those deals don't prove out. They don't make economic sense. And if an event of so-called force majeure, an earthquake, civil unrest, or in this case a labor strike, shuts down the industry for at least eight weeks -- six to eight weeks in some case, on -- in those contracts, the studios and streamers have the right to terminate the deals. And we are going to see the terminations and forceable renegotiations, and then the companies will go to the street and say, look how much money we've saved. And look how much money we've saved not producing in this good quarter. They'll have a good quarter because of the strike.",

The third-place finisher in the recent election is among those claiming that fraud took place. Authorities say 42 protesters have been arrested, 10 police officers have been injured in clashes.

They have to have computer records of it.And in February, this hack actually disrupted a key component of that system. And we're finally learning a bit more about this this week, because the Marshals Services telling CNN that they're still recovering from this hack. They had to take the system offline, kind of, rebuild it and put it back in place. And bit by bit, over the course of months, it's now getting back up to speed. But in the meantime, it's, as you mentioned, up top, there's fugitives on the lam right now that they need to track. Now, the Marshals Service tells us that they are not hindered in their ability to do so. However, this computer system has been historically a very important part of the way that they do track fugitives and it's something that they're trying to get back fully online as soon as possible.
