We are following a busy day of new legal filings and awaiting a critical ruling that could come at any time.Also tonight, one of the longest prison sentences yet connected to the January 6th riot, a Proud Boy who led members of that far right group to the Capitol was just ordered to serve 18 years. And we're tracking a huge manhunt for a convicted murderer on the loose after escaping from a Pennsylvania prison. Authorities now warning he is extremely dangerous and likely heading toward Mexico right now. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. First this hour, Rudy Giuliani is now the most prominent Trump co- defendant to enter a not guilty plea in Georgia, besides, of course, the former president himself. Let's get straight to CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider. So, Jess, we have seen a series of new not guilty pleas in this election interference case today, including Giuliani. What is the latest?",

And by entering these pre-arraignment pleas, all of these defendants including Rudy Giuliani, including the former president, they will all be able to avoid going to court and appearing in person on Wednesday, September 6th. So, any of the remaining defendants between now and then who don't file this paperwork for this pre-arraignment, they will have to appear in court on September 6th.So, all of this is happening in the midst of a flurry of legal filings as well, especially from Kenneth Chesebro. So, he was the Trump campaign lawyer who was indicted along with those other 18 defendants. But Kenneth Chesebro, he has asked for a speedy trial, he's already been given a trial date of October 23rd, but he's now asking for the prosecution to really speed up the discovery. They need to hand over all of the documents. Prosecutors have now said that they will hand it all over by September 15th. But Chesebro is saying that that is just too late because that would just be about five weeks before a trial. So, he's demanding the prosecution hand everything over before September 15th. Also, he's asking for a solo trial here. Since he's going to trial so soon, also Sidney Powell has asked for a speedy trial, Kenneth Chesebro wants to be separated from Sidney Powell in particular. He said that he never communicated with Sidney Powell, that they are not accused of the same thing. So, Alex, he wants to make sure that he has a solo trial that Sidney Powell is in no way involved in.",

He basically said, since Mark Meadows, one of the charges the racketeering conspiracy, and there are a number of overt acts alleged as part of that, the question being, does Mark Meadows only have to prove that he was serving as a federal official for just maybe one of those acts. Of course, Mark Meadows team came back in the briefing and said, yes, he only has to prove that he was acting as a federal official for one of those acts. Fani Willis' prosecutor team said no, they came back and said no, because we're charging this as a full conspiracy, not just one act. So, the judge has all of the arguments in his hands.

As you mentioned, he is holding a fundraiser for Giuliani at his Bedminster resort next week, a $100,000 a person. But that is all he's doing. All of these other co-defendants are having to find out how to raise the money themselves, and they're turning to creative, alternative solutions, including crowd funding. At least four of them have gone on a faith-based crowd funding website. Now this is very different from some of the other investigations that we have seen. Trump paying the legal bills for advisers, aides, employees both former and current, in both the January 6th committee investigation and those federal investigations. Now, Trump himself seemed to differentiate with those cases and his co-defendants in Georgia. Take a listen to what he said about his co- defendants in Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It is so sad. And they don't have a lot of money, and some of them almost nothing. They don't even know what they're being charged for.

So, how does that fit into all of his legal troubles? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Well, it fits in because, number one, we know that Ruby Freeman was one of the witnesses who was called to testify before the special grand jury and more than likely the regular grand jury and more than likely Mrs. Freeman and as well as her daughter, Shaye Moss, could be called as witnesses in whatever trial that proceeds on this racketeering case.

And, by the way, he's right that it is absolutely unjustifiable for the prosecutors to say we need another two weeks to give you discovery. That is about a quarter of the time between now and when he's entitled to a trial.These prosecutors took over two and a half years to charge this case. They should have had discovery out for these defendants on day one. On the separate question whether he's entitled to his own individual trial, the answer is, he is not. It is up to the judge to decide whether it makes more sense in terms of judicial efficiency, in terms of not having to have everyone replicate effort to try him together with Sidney Powell. On the other hand judges do sometime like to give each individual defendant a shot at individual live justice. [18:10:03] So, I suspect that prosecutors will going to oppose this and say you all need to be tried together, all you early birds, but each of those defendants count on them asking the judge to be tried alone.",

He knocked over fences and really helped drive some of the violence that day for members of the group. Now, the judge really emphasized in all of the sentencing that we've seen this week, that what the members of the Proud Boys did that day was not just the violence, it was also taking away from the American public the tradition of the peaceful transfer of power, which is obviously something that the country was known for until then. I'll read you part of what he said from the bench today. He said, if we don't have the peaceful transfer of power, I don't know what we have. And he also said that the violence that day did not honor the founders, it was the kind of thing they wrote the Constitution to prevent. This obviously, the 18-year sentence that the judge handed down, Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, by the way, as you pointed out, is the longest for all of the January 6th cases.

The members -- other members who were sentenced, Joseph Biggs, and Zachary Rehl is the other one. I almost lost his name. 17 and 15 years, those two got.

It would only take five Republicans to force such a meeting to happen, but there is no formal mechanism to formally remove Mitch McConnell. So, really, this is a conversation and a question about whether Mitch McConnell intends to serve beyond 2024, which is when his current term as leader is set to expire. And, you know, it is really unclear whether he would run again or whether he would have the support even within his own conference to do that. But whenever he does decide to step aside, it is going to be a scramble to replace him. Remember, he has served in this position since 2007. He's the longest serving party leader. Already there is some discussion about theoretically who might replace him, including three senators, all with the first name John, John Barrasso, John Thune and John Cornyn.

Number two, I actually think there's two different issues that are being conflated. McConnell is recovering from an injury. He fell and had a concussion. And so this is not really as an age related issue. It is part of the normal recovery process from a concussion, according to the note I read from the Capitol physician. So, I think some conflating is going on here.But I agree with Bakari. Ultimately, it is voters who make these decisions. We could sit here and opine about it all we want. But, ultimately, next year, the ballot is going to come out and people are going to look at it and voters are going to decide who they want to lead the country.

Beyond that, let me show you some of these images we've managed to get exclusively from Ukraine's security service that show very clearly what lies beyond that and they're now having to take on it. You're looking at this very long line of so called dragons teeth, the anti- tank sort of pyramid structures, the ones that show on those pictures go on for 70 kilometers, beyond that, another trench with more Russian positions. And what these security services have told us, as they shared these images, they were taken by the way yesterday with a drone that they had over those Russian positions looking ahead to the next strategic town they're trying to take is that they've been watching Russians build these fortifications now since about March of 2022, so just a month after the invasion began. The Russian have been created these fortifications extremely deep as well as long. Ukraine watching them do it all of the time. Now they're having to take them on. But they say they're managing to do it partly helped with the western artillery they've been receiving, which has allowed them, they say, to push the Russian artillery positions back. And that has helped a great deal. That's what official say. This even as the war is moving increasingly clearly, Alex, towards Russia itself, it is daily now that you hear of fresh drone attacks. We have had another series this morning. And what has changed is not just that Ukraine is beginning to accept that it is behind some of these, but actually claiming that the ones that we saw up in the very west of the country earlier this week were launched from inside of Russia, some 600 kilometers from the Ukrainian side. So much more brazen attacks and a much clearer determination to claim them, Alex.",

Trump wants to delay his Georgia trial passed the October start date that was proposed by the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, possibly until after the election. So, do you think it is critical that these criminal cases resolve before the election? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I think there is a great public interest to resolve before the election. And when you're looking at speedy trial requirements, that's just not for the defendant but also for the public as well because the public has an interest in having these, an outcome on this cases. And particularly the voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, and on Super Tuesday, you know, they'll be voting blind unless some of these cases are resolved. And so, the facts will come out. It's a huge distraction. It's hard for the candidates to get the message out. But it is critically important that we continue to fight that battle, talking about the economy, talking about border security and the fentanyl crisis. I'll be talking about those things.
