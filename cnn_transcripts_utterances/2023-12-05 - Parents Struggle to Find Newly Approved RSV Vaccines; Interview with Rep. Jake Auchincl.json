The initial concern was essentially that hospitals and pediatricians may not stock it because they weren't sure they would get reimbursed for it. Then by the time October came around the fall season and RSV was starting to pick up. One of the manufacturers actually said that demand was outpacing supply. It was higher than anticipated. And the CDC started recommending that infants under six months of age and those medically vulnerable be prioritized for the -- or the shots. And so, really, we're in a situation now where a lot of doctors and parents feel like we're in a shortage.",

The measure, introduced by Jewish Republican lawmakers, contains language that is concerning to some Democrats and it includes this line. This is why it concerns some.Quote, \"clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism.\" Joining us now with his perspective, we have Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Congressman, I understand that you voted yes on this, is that right? Can you tell me about your vote and how you decided to support this? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Good afternoon. Thanks for having me on. I voted yes, I'm a Jewish member of Congress. I represent a big, diverse Jewish constituency who since October 7th are feeling increasingly afraid and alienated. So as their voice and vote, it's important that I use every opportunity to condemn antisemitism. However, this resolution is duplicative. Congress did this last week in a overwhelming bipartisan fashion. The time now is to move past resolutions and towards action, and that means Speaker Johnson needs to put a bipartisan bill to support Israel on the House floor so that we can send our ally the support it needs as it fights against terrorism.",

In my town halls and my conversations with my Jewish constituents, I think they continue to want to see unequivocal action and statements against antisemitism, but where I strongly agree with my fellow members on the Democratic caucus is this is duplicative -- this resolution. And we really need to be focused on supporting not just Israel, but Ukraine, Taiwan and humanitarian aid to Gaza as well. That is what the President has asked Congress to do.

What's most critical is that we support Israel as it tries to win this war, which means dismantling Hamas and rescuing the hostages. And then we support the Palestinian people as they win the peace.

I do wonder though, from your perspective, having served in Afghanistan, knowing what the ratio was when it came to noncombatants and combatants there. You know what we're seeing in Gaza far surpasses what you saw in Afghanistan. And I don't mean to argue points of degree because the U.S. faced a lot of criticism and skepticism about civilians who were killed in that conflict as well. Is that an acceptable ratio, though?

It's important to stress though, that the Law of Armed Conflict when it talks about proportionality, it doesn't put forward an equation. What it says is that any military target needs to be sufficiently valuable that civilian collateral damage can be justified in a court of law. And Israel is subject to that. Destroying Hamas's ability to wage terror, not just against Israel but against the Palestinian people as well, is a high value and legitimate military object.And while Israel should certainly be under pressure to continue to abide by LOAC. We should also be putting pressure on Hamas. Because Hamas is the only entity in this entire universe of conflict that could instantly end this suffering with a simple statement. And that simple statement would be Hamas agrees to abide by the Law of Armed Conflict. If Hamas did that, and by the way, that would not require that it lay down its arms or announce its charter. But if Hamas agreed to abide by LOAC, it would have to free the hostages and would have to stop using Palestinians as human shields. It could engage the Israeli defense forces as combatants but would have to do so in a way that is in accord with the Law of Armed Conflict. Hamas is the one that can end all of this suffering right now.",

Maybe the Palestinian Authority, as part of that, maybe they're not. If that remains to be seen.

Let's discuss now with senior sports legal reporter for Sportico, Michael McCann. Michael, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us.

The idea that you can do an endorsement deal and make money. The NCAA shifted course in 2021, allowing that to happen. And since then, some college athletes have done very well. And the NCAA believes though, that some schools are basically directly paying, or perhaps through boosters NIL money.So, this policy change is significant because it involves, as you mentioned, direct payment to athletes. It involves partnering between schools and athletes for their NIL. It's a more transparent process. It's also a more -- it's a more equitable process and that the athletes are getting paid. And it also separates these top schools from the rest, which might help those (INAUDIBLE).",

To say, well, I thought this is college sports, this is amateur sports. But remember, some of these coaches are making over $10 million a year.

If it wishes to adopt a more traditional model, it can leave that subdivision or not enter it. And it gives the school discretion.Now, many schools cry that they're poor, that they can't pay athletes. It will be really interesting to see if, in fact, schools adopt that more traditional approach and not pay athlete. The cost to them would be leaving this more marketable division and I think many would say they're going to be skeptical that schools would actually do that because they're making so much money through college sports. As you noted, Boris, it's not just TV money, it's also impact on donations, alumni, admissions. Some high school students want to go to a school with big time sports. The impact is huge. Will schools actually forego that? I think that's going to be a really interesting question to answer in the years ahead.",
