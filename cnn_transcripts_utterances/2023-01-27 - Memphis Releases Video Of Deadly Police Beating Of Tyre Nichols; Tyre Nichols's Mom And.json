(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In Memphis, candles burn for a life snuffed out, the life of 29- year-old Tyre Nichols, being remembered where friends say he felt the most free -- a skate park. Twelve years ago, Nichols is seen here doing what he loved. Twelve years later, he ended up dead, officials say, beaten by five men sworn to protect and serve.

As you and Shimon alluded to, what we saw on the video tonight was the deadliest possible combination of what was done to Tyre Nichols, and then what was not done for him that really jumped out at Shimon right there. Joining us to talk about it, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, back with us tonight. Sanjay, let's take that in two parts. First, what was done to Tyre Nichols?",

      "sentences": "I mean, there were so many different mechanisms of injury there. I watched that. I've got to tell you, John, I've watched this a few times now, it's just increasingly hard to watch. I mean, it just gets worse each time because you see how defenseless he is and how many different types of assaults he has.He's standing at one point and there are these punches to the head and to the face while he's on the ground. There are kicks to the face. But he's also a very thin guy, and he's got these blows to the torso and to the abdomen. I mean, he can get significant bleeding. One thing I will say, John, is that he was in the hospital for a few days after he was ultimately taken there and that means that they have more of an idea of exactly what the consequences of all those various blows in that beating was. They probably did scans of his brain and scans of his body. They may have had some idea. But we know within a short time, he was unconscious, he was unable to breathe on his own. So, you know, even though he was still sort of talking a little bit, moving around a bit, I think, you know, after when he's leaning up against the car, it deteriorated pretty quickly, it sounds like, once he got to the hospital. But there is that time period, John, that you have alluded to, Shimon has alluded to. I looked at the timestamps on the video and it's around 8:33 when the beating finally stops and he's leaned up against this car, handcuffed. And it is a good eight minutes after that before the EMTs and fire arrive, but they don't really do any kind of assessment for a good nine minutes after that. It isn't until about 9:02, which is roughly half an hour, John, after this, that they actually start bringing out a gurney and things.",

First, I thought to myself, did they not recognize the gravity of his injuries? They must have known because they just inflicted this upon him.So, he was essentially, you know, he's dying, John. I mean, there's no other way to really say it. He's critically injured and there is nobody really doing anything there. They sit him up a couple of times. He slumps back over. I do see him sort of move his legs once on his own. He seems to be in a state of what we call agonal breathing, which is typically a sort of breathing pattern when somebody is just in near respiratory distress. And even when the -- I think the paramedics or the EMT, I couldn't quite figure out who first got to him, again, about a half an hour later, they are the first people to sort of bring out a bag and start assessing him, doing things like looking in his eyes to see if, in fact, he has evidence of brain swelling, something you can do by looking at the pupils, assessing his breathing.

And when it starts to swell like that, the brain, unlike any other organ in the body, has no place to really go because it's encased by the skull. So, what happens ultimately is that it goes downward and that's called herniation. And that is something that can lead to brain death, which is, you know, a real consideration here.Again, I'm sure the hospital, St. Francis, I believe, where he was taken, probably assessed him. They have the answers to some of these questions. Did he have that sort of brain swelling? Did he have bleeding in other parts of his body? Did he have obstruction of his airway when he was essentially being knelt upon, you know, face down? They probably have the answer to those questions. But brain swelling and that sort of pattern that we saw where he was lapsing in and out of consciousness, that sort of fits.

Joining us now, CNN law enforcement analyst Michael Fanone, who nearly lost his life defending the Capitol on January 6th, and CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams, former deputy assistant attorney general. Elliot, I do want to start with you, first off, you are new to this discussion here, and I think everyone who has seen this video has had the same visceral, human reaction. That is one thing. There is no legal case that will need to be made in a court of law with the charges that have now been filed against these former officers, which do include second-degree murder.

And in looking at this, you know, I'm hard-pressed to see.Now, here's the point. The point of the matter is -- Elliot, you know, very good point that he makes with respect to, look, cases are very difficult. But if you want to talk about second-degree murder, what you are looking and talking about that as a knowing killing is, do you mean to tell me, in the event that you literally kick someone in the head multiple times -- the person happens to be 140 pounds, right? -- you all are burly gentlemen who -- I use the word gentlemen loosely -- who are actually out here doing this job? Not only do you kick him in his head multiple times, but you are sucker punching him multiple times as well. You are hitting him with the ass (ph) multiple times. You mean to tell me that a reasonable juror cannot conclude that those are actions and activities that would lead to death, that you don't know and appreciate the nature of your conduct such that it may have that result? And so, I think, you know, all cases are hard, but I think a skilled prosecutor can make that case in this particular situation. So, I think what happened, John, last point, and that's this, you know, you could talk about and relate it to Rodney King but here is the difference. When you had Rodney King, what they were doing is looking at what strikes and movements, et cetera, that Rodney King was making so that they, that is the officers, could put it in context with an expert witness. You tell me, and looking at the videotape of a defenseless Mr. Nichols on the ground, what sort of movements he was making that would justify the conduct. No immediacy of danger, such a gross disproportionality of force being used, completely unreasonable conduct, and a failure to act. I think you could certainly secure a conviction under the right set of circumstances.",

Tyre Nichols, in the video that we saw, didn't appear to be putting up almost any resistance.And Michael Fanone, I want to put that to you there. Just the force that these officers used, at least nine blows, it really felt like, watching the video, came out of nowhere there, leaving one to say, what are they thinking? What could they be thinking with a human being? What did you see? MICHAEL FANONE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER D.C. METROPOLITAN POLICE OFFICER:  I'll tell you what I saw, John. At the outset of that video, I saw an intense, chaotic situation. I saw police officers trying to gain control of Mr. Nichols. I believe that those officers' actions clearly escalated that situation. And by the end of the video, I saw police officers who got caught up in the emotion of that pursuit and lost control of themselves and lost control of the situation.",

I think first and foremost, to identify other people who might need to be caught up in the investigation as well. We've heard about the two sheriff's deputies who have now been suspended, pending investigation. Of course, we don't know what's happening with the EMTs.But there is also a parallel federal investigation that's looking at this through the lens of determining whether these officers unlawfully denied or impinged upon Tyre Nichols's constitutional rights. And there's all sorts of constitutional rights that appear to have been violated by the pretty obvious, you know, horrendous acts they inflicted upon him in that beating. I should also say, John, I think one of the things that will characterize those investigations as they go forward and ultimately the perceptions of jurors or people who sit in judgment of the officers is that second interaction, the beating in the second interaction, it is replete with a -- with a -- there's a vindictiveness to it. Right? There is -- it almost feels like a retaliation, from the way they beat him, the things they said while they were doing it, the threats, the taunting. You know, they -- it comes off as if these men are getting back at Tyre Nichols for embarrassing them, for resisting their authority, for making them chase him, and it's so over-the- top that it appears on its face to be unreasonable. It is that unreasonable standard that will work against them in both prosecutions.",

Again, looking at the video, I wonder what you make of the apparent -- I don't know if it was difficulty they seemed to have in getting him in handcuffs, if that's what they wanted to do, at least at first. What did you see them trying to do and maybe an explanation for why they couldn't make it happen? FANONE:  John, I spent nearly my entire career, which spanned 20 years, working in units like this, proactive police units charged with pursuing violent criminals, narcotic traffickers, and people that commit crimes with firearms. When you place a person under arrest, trying to gain custody or control over them and they don't want you to gain control over them, it doesn't matter whether they are on some type of narcotics or just sober. It is very difficult if they don't want you to gain control of them. It can take multiple officers. So, to me, clearly, there were tactical missteps here. At one point, it seemed like the officers were working against one another and were caught up in the chaos of the moment. There were clearly decisions that were made that escalated this situation to a point where Mr. Nichols lost his life and did not deserve that. Yes.",
