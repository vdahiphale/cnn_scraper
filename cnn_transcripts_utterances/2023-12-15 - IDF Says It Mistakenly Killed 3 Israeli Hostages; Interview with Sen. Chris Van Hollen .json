Even as they insisted that they would try to distinguish between civilians and militants. But in this case, these loosened rules of engagement perhaps may have been partly to blame for what we are seeing here. Of course, we do not know that for certain. We do not know exactly what has happened. But we do know the Israeli military has been operating in very, very intense combat. Several Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting in that area earlier this week. And now, apparently, Boris, tragically, three Israeli hostages are also among the dozen.",

SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Pamela, it is an incredible tragedy, as you just reported. My heart goes out to those families. It is essential that all of the hostages be released. As you know, there's also been an ongoing debate in Israel about whether or not the release of the hostages should be a priority. President Biden, rightly, in my view, said that we really need to focus on the release of the hostages. There are many parts of the right-wing Netanyahu government in Israel that have prioritized the release of the hostages. And I am sure that this will open up that debate, again.",

They are in the fight of their lives.They are spilling blood. Their people are losing their lives in defense of their freedom. And it would be a huge discredit to the United States if we walked away from them at this point. We need to get that done. Republicans in the Congress have linked that to border security talks. Those are ongoing. I should point out that President Biden's proposal that is before the Congress right now already includes lots of resources for additional border security, including new machines to screen Fentanyl and catch and identify and stop Fentanyl from coming into the United States. But those talks are ongoing right now. It is imperative that we provide the people of Ukraine with the military assistance they need to fight off Putin.",

President Zelenskyy was clear when he met with us in the Senate recently, they will keep fighting. But their ability to fight off Putin will be dramatically diminished.So, it is a big risk that if the United States does not continue to provide support, then others will also step back. That will not only be a loss for the people of Ukraine, it will be a huge loss to U.S. leadership around the world and U.S. credibility around the world. Our allies won't believe us anymore when we say we will stand with them. And that will be true not only of our allies in Europe but around the world, including in East Asia. The flipside is that authoritarian leaders like President Xi of China will be emboldened. So this is a really important historical moment and a big moment for American leadership.",

And democracy and the rule of law on the decline. That would, clearly, be a huge loss for the people of the United States. And that is really what is at stake here. Now what really worries me is that you've got many members of Congress here who seem not to recognize this moment. In Moscow, you have Vladimir Putin and his allies actually applauding Republican members of Congress for blocking aid to Ukraine. So whether they recognize it or not, they are aiding and abetting Putin's attack on freedom and democracy in Ukraine. And, in fact, by extension, the attack on democracy around the world. And of course, Trump has also been front and center in that effort to undermine democracy here at home and around the world.",

We, of course, had the Munich moment when Hitler was emboldened. We need to recognize that this is a moment where, if we do not collectively stand up against Putin, he will be further emboldened throughout the region. But as we were saying earlier, so will autocrats around the world. Yes, I was referring to President Xi who has one eye on Taiwan as he has the other eye on whether or not the United States and its allies will remain true to the people of Ukraine. Look, the people of Ukraine are asking for weapons. They are the ones putting their lives on the line. They are spilling blood. In my view, it is the very least we can do both for them and to stand up for democracy to provide them with the assistance that they need. Waving the white flag right now would be a loss for Ukraine, a loss for America, and a loss for democracy across the world.",

One person was also arrested in the Netherlands in what the Danes also called an anti-terror operation. It was the Israelis who came forward who said it was ordered by Hamas. That it was, essentially, a Hamas plot that was foiled. The Danes are essentially saying there are other suspects out there. They have already formally issued arrest warrants for those suspects, but they don't have the suspects in custody. They call this detention in absentia. So clearly a manhunt is going on right now in Denmark as the Danish authorities clearly believe there seems to be members of the cell out there that could be quite dangerous -- Boris?",

Health officials warn these respiratory diseases are on the rise.CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, joins us. So just how bad are these vaccination rates right now? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: We are sort of sleepwalking our way into this respiratory season. That's what Dr. Tom Frieden said. When you look at the overall numbers, they are concerning. I will show you these, but I preface this by saying we have never been great in this country about vaccination rates, even before the pandemic. Flu vaccination was typically below 50 percent. But it's even lower now. So compare last year to this year, for example, for kids and for adults, the numbers are lower. They are too low. If you look at Covid -- I sort of made this graph for you, Pamela, to take a look at since the beginning of vaccines, where we have been and where we are now. You can see, as we put up that graphic, that the red line there is sort of -- those are the first shots that came out. A lot of people got those first shots. The blue line are some of the second shots. That is still pretty high. The bottom right of the screen, if you can even see it there, Pamela, that's right now. That is the most updated Covid shots. Fewer than 20 percent of people in the country have gotten that. And then RSV. We did not even have a vaccine for this up until recently. People over the age of 60, they are recommended to get it, but only around 16 percent of people have received it so far. One thing I will say is that it's not too late still. So people may think the time window has passed. It has not. And the numbers are still increasing. So go out and get it if you can still get one.",
