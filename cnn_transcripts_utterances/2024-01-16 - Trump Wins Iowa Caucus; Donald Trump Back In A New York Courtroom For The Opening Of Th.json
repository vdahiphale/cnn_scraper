Cupp. So S.E., I'm just going to ask you the same question, basically, that I posed to Steve Contorno there. Is there really a path? Is there a path for anyone to beat a man who just won Iowa by 30 points? And if so, what does that path look like? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah, it's narrow and circuitous and weird. Okay. But it's there. Let me put some of this in context. Obviously, Trump won. He trounced. He won decisively in Iowa. However, 40 percent, 40 plus percent of the Iowa Republican electorate, right, a very MAGA sort of base, voted for someone else, someone not named Donald Trump. Now, that's meaningless, as long as DeSantis and Haley keep splitting that 40 percent. But if that would consolidate around one person, well then that would really pierce his inevitability. That's tricky to do because, let's say Ron DeSantis drops out, not all his voters go to Haley and vice versa. So, there's kind of some weird math in there that you'd have to see shake out. But those two are also kind of waiting out the clock, right? We know that Trump is under threat of all of these legal cases. He could in fact be in prison when the election happens. And I think they're both banking on if they can hang in long enough, enough voters and donors saying, I'm not sure I want to risk this important election and this vote on a guy who's in prison currently. And guess what? Nikki Haley beats Biden by an even wider margin than Donald Trump does. So, this isn't so much of a loss. I think that's the calculus that they're both considering as they look toward the next few primary states, hoping to make it to Super Tuesday.",

So, I was going to sort of talk about, listen, it is hard to sort of see how donors continue to fund candidates who are losing or who have lost Iowa by 30 points. But I think for an international audience, there is another question that I think is more pressing. This is the first election or rather 2024 is the first election year that we've had in this country since January 6, since the insurrection, January 6, 2021. And what does it say that Republican voters in Iowa are rewarding someone pretty significantly by 30 points who was at least in part responsible for that insurrection we saw that day.

Ron's problems are immediate. He does not do well in New Hampshire and not in South Carolina either. He is hoping on bare bones money to last long enough to get to states that are more favorable to him. Nikki's problem is in the future. She does great in the next two states, good enough to keep going anyway. But the states after that get less and less attractive for Nikki Haley. There are fewer moderates and independents to court.

All right, tensions in the Middle East are heating up after Iran fired a barrage of missiles into northern Iraq on Monday. A Kurdish news outlet says missiles fired by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards destroyed the home of a Kurdish businessman under the pretext that it was used by Israeli spies. Officials say at least four people were killed in the city of Erbil. Iran also fired missiles at what it called terror groups in northern Syria, describing them as a security threat. Meantime, U.S. Central Command says the Navy -- the U.S. Navy, seized Iranian-made missiles that were en route to Houthi militants in Yemen. It happened during a raid off the coast of Somalia just last week. During the operation, two Navy SEALs went overboard, and those Navy SEALs are still missing as I speak. We're also learning Houthi militants have claimed responsibility for striking a cargo ship owned by the United States in the Gulf of Aden on Monday. They vow any future strikes on Yemen will not go unanswered. They are vowing to retaliate. The Qatari Prime Minister spoke at the Economic Forum in Davos about these Houthi attacks. Take a listen.

And there is mounting concern, not just in the region, but of course broader and further afield around thepotential for the war that we are seeing unfolding in Gaza to escalate, to spill over into the region, and particularly when it comes to Iran and crucially groups backed by Iran. Now, last night's attack has certainly raised concern according to media in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq. At least 10 ballistic missiles were fired by Iran across the area surrounding the capital, Erbil, at least five of which are reported to have targeted the residence of a Kurdish businessman. Now, we have, of course, heard from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which has claimed to have carried out this missile attack, acknowledging this in the early hours of Tuesday morning. As he mentioned, Zain, they say that they were targeting what they've described and characterized as the main espionage headquarters for Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. We have received a statement from Iran's Foreign Ministry earlier today saying that these attacks were, in their words, precise and targeted, that they were focused on targeting what they've described as Israeli intelligence forces charged with killing Iranian commanders and carrying out attacks against Iranian assets. Of course, we have reached out to the Israeli authorities for comment on this. We have also, of course, in that same moment seen attacks carried out by Iran targeting locations in Syria as well. Now, on that front, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps says that they were targeting anti-Iran terror organizations, namely in response to those twin blasts we saw earlier this month in the Iranian city of Khedman, which of course killed dozens of people who had been paying their respects for slain Iranian Commander Qassem Soleimani at his burial site on the fourth anniversary of his death. He was of course killed in a strike on Baghdad International Airport, ordered at the time by then U.S. President Donald Trump. So, there has been concern for some time now around the potential reaction and response we may see from Iran at the time, of course, of those twin blasts that were shortly claimed by ISIS. Of course, though, when we have been hearing the messaging from Iran over the last few days and weeks, that has certainly raised alarm bells around the potential for further responses more broadly in the region. And of course, Iran-backed groups, as well. You had Natasha mentioning -- talking about the situation in Yemen, the Iran-backed Houthis, but also crucially here in Lebanon as well, where we continue to see crossfire on the southern border between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israeli forces along the border.",

That's a very high threshold, which requires quite a lot of thinking but mostly evidence which we do not have. This is why the ICJ in preliminary steps is going to put forward some intermediary measures because it's going to take them years before ruling on whether or not Israel is committing the crime of genocide. But the risks of genocide are real and that should be enough to intervene. There is an actual obligation placed on governments to intervene to prevent atrocity crimes, including genocide. The United States in particular, because of its degree of influence over Israel, because of its knowledge of what's happening, has a higher responsibility to prevent genocide.

But despite that sweeping performance, he still showed weakness among the kind of voters that Haley will need to rally in New Hampshire, particularly college-educated voters, you know, independent voters, not quite as sold on Trump as core Republicans. So, there is a path for her to do well in New Hampshire, as, you know, as Gary noted and you noted, she's put more effort there. She's also sharpened her argument as she was leaving Iowa, which is something that we've seen happen in races before. She'd been made a pretty tepid case against Trump so far, but last night I thought she took a significant step when she basically yoked Trump and Biden together --",

And between them, I believe they have spent to this point about $1 million on television criticizing Trump. You saw DeSantis in the last week escalate his criticism of Trump, basically arguing that Trump, you know, he had been making an ideological argument against Trump. That had very limited success. You saw how few voters who identify with the MAGA movement, who voted here for Trump last night, voted for DeSantis last night, which was a basic statement of failure of DeSantis' attempt to peel them away. But he moved to an argument that Trump is basically in it for himself, and you can't trust him on those grounds. They're both making a stronger case than they have, but as you point out, Trump's hold on particularly rank- and-file Republicans, non-college Republicans, overwhelming.

Also, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has been thanking his supporters. This is it for him, as well. After suspending his campaign last night in Des Moines, he's now endorsing Donald Trump, saying that he will campaign for him ahead of next week's New Hampshire primary.
