The World Cup final living up to the hype and then some. Argentina defeating defending champions France in a thrilling penalty kick shoot-out. The score tied up at 3-3 after an overtime period that saw each side hit the back of the net. For star striker Lionel Messi, it is redemption, capturing his first World Cup title on his fifth attempt. CNN has reporters around the globe with reaction to this instant classic match. This is the scene in Buenos Aires. Thousands of soccer fans gather in celebration, I mean a sea of people. And in the middle of it all, CNN's Stefano Pozzebon, he is there, wearing this confetti-like material because the crowd was all over you and all over this. This match went back and forth, how are the people there doing? I know they're excited.",

The match has gone first the Argentinian, then they've change it and France was able to go back in. But then Lionel Messi, just as you said, Fredricka -- Lionel Messi, the prodigal son, the player who left Argentina when he was 13 to learn how to play football in Europe, learned how to play football at Barcelona, going back and giving this country a joy that has been missing for more than 36 years, Fredricka.",

And myself and the reporters that I've spoken to that have just witnessed this game are all in agreement, this is the greatest match we have ever seen. And there have been some great matches over the years in different competitions. But for this to have played out the way it did in the World Cup final was absolutely extraordinary. It was epic. Argentina looked as though they had it in the bag. They were 2-0 up with about 12 minutes to go but then France, who of course, the defending champions, struck back with two goals in 97 minutes. Then Argentina went ahead again with Lionel Messi second of the game. Then France equalizer Kylian Mbappe's hat trick, his third of the game. And then it went to penalties and those were all with rollercoasters and that is how it turned out to be again. But this was a match that wasn't just a contest between France and Argentina. There were so many other sub plots and of course, the main one being could Messi in his fifth and final World Cup finally win the only trophy that had ever eluded him? They came close to blowing it.

Honestly, it is going to be really, really difficult to match the drama that we have seen not just in this final but throughout this tournament. It's been a tournament of (INAUDIBLE). There've been so many matches where the underdog has won, results have not been what we were expecting. Some exhilarating moments.

Then I started to realize like I'm starting to feel like I need this. And after I worked on this episode, I -- I just stopped because you can see, alcohol is a progressive -- alcoholism is a progressive disease. It's not like heroin or fentanyl, which you can develop an addiction to very quickly. But these days, people are drinking so much more that it's requiring less of a progression.",

And I have to say not too long ago, the second gentleman and senior White House officials convened a high level meeting actually inside the White House together with leaders of American Jewish organizations, and in that room, we discussed some of the trends as well as interesting ideas to monitor and combat that. The State Department elevated the special envoy to Senate confirmed status. The fact that we have representation from the administration issignificant. We also will have the secretary of interior, Deb Haaland, who is the, I guess, host on this park, the entire National Park Service. You asked about the significance of the attorney general specifically and having those that formulate the laws and policies and those that implement them. If we're not going to have people looking for and identifying and then exposing those who wish people of the Jewish faith ill through the anti-Semitism and then implement strong policies to combat that and in order to eradicate it then I don't think any meeting can be effective. But if the attorney general shows up and participates in the lighting of something like a menorah on the White House lawn it sends a message across America that Jews are welcome and we will be here and as long as we want to be the United States leadership expressed the willingness to reinforce the notion. Just a few days ago we were inside the Pentagon and the assistant commandant general smith joined us in the lighting of a menorah to go to the men and women serving stateside and abroad so that they should know that even if we are a small percentage of the American population, we are as welcome here as any other part of the population. We helped found the country, we have defended it, we have a fair share of those who gave their lives for it, we have Jews serving in the armed forces today, all over the world, and we're not going anywhere for now.",
