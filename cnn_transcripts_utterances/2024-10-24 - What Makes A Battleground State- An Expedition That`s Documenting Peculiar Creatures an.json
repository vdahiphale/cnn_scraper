Nothing solidified the electoral importance of the state ofFlorida like those three words on late, great Tim Russert`s dry erase board at about 1 a.m. the morning after Election Day in 2000. Nothing, that is, except for the seismic events that transpired in the state in the weeks that followed. A tenth of a percentage point, 537 votes, separated George W. Bush from Al Gore in the state that for the next 16 years became an intensely contested presidential battleground. 2004, George W. Bush holding on to it. 2008, Barack Obama putting it into Democratic hands, holding on to it just narrowly in 2012. What about today? Well, Florida is a swing state no more. Let`s just look back to the last election. 2022, Marco Rubio reelected to the U.S. Senate by 16 points. Ron DeSantis reelected to the governor`s mansion by 19 points. Republicans captured a super majority in the state legislature. What happened? Well, let`s start here. Voter registration. As far back as the 1970s, the number of registered Democrats in the state handily outnumbered Republicans. By 2021, Republicans caught up and then flipped the script entirely. That`s in part a powerful and well-run state party operation in full effect. But it`s also a shift fueled by two groups, older white voters, a cornerstone of the GOP base. Ever hear the term snowboard snowbirds? Well, the migration, it`s very real. Florida, actually, if you pull back, it is one of the oldest states in the nation where you see dark purple. That is an older population, 27% of the population in Florida over the age of 60. Second, and this is critical as we go into this cycle. Once considered a Democratic pillar, Hispanic voters, they`re not monolithic. And in Florida, more conservative Latino voters, Cuban-Americans in particular, have changed the face of the southern part of the state. Take 2020 when Donald Trump won the state by 370,000 votes. Now, compare the exit polls when it comes to the Latino vote in Florida. National, 65% went to Biden. In Florida, 53%. Yes, Biden won a majority. That`s a dramatic divergence. If you really want to know whether or not a swing state is a swing state anymore, what you really need to do is look at where the campaigns are spending money. In the state of Florida, this is what`s being spent right now. Democrats, about $2 million. Republicans, about $1 million. Yeah, let`s tick up a little bit to the neighbor to the north. That`s Georgia. Yeah, that`s a battleground. What`s the spending there? $133 million for Democrats. Republicans, $108 million. One state is a battleground. One is not. The money makes clear that this year, that battleground is Georgia. Georgia. Georgia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Angel Falls, Victoria Falls, Kalambo Falls or Lisbon Falls? Hail to the victors who said Victoria Falls. The falls in Africa are twice as high and one and a half times wider than Niagara Falls. This week on Call to Earth, we embark on an epic mission with South African explorer Steve Boyes as part of the Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative. He`s on a multi-year expedition across Africa to scientifically document the continent`s massive inland river basins. Today, Steve visits a remote region in Zambia to meet up with a scientist who`s looking after one of the world`s most peculiar creatures. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And we then go into the swamps, we verify that nest, and we get data through those reports. The shoebills typically lay two eggs, not always but typically, and almost always. If they lay two eggs, one of the chicks kills the other. It`s just competition. We can capitalize on that, and we take one of the eggs or one of the chicks off the nest. We bring it into our facility, and we raise it without human contact, and then we release them back into Bengweulu. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
