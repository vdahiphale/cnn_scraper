But as you just heard from members of the community that those are -- assurances are doing little to actually calm any of their concerns. That's because of the long list of chemicals at the site. And it's one of the reasons why officials still want more to be done. You just read them for yourself here. And it's not just the concerns there in East Palestine, but also downriver and other surrounding communities. Officials there, rather, people there are concerned that not enough is being done to guarantee their safety. Now, in terms of what we expect, officials recently announcing that not only FEMA is headed to the ground, but as they consider that as they continue with the cleanup efforts, they will also be sending medical personnel at the federal level, as well as experts in the field of toxicology, to set up clinics in the coming days, to meet with some of these individuals that have recently reported symptoms including experiencing rashes, sore throats, headaches, feeling nauseous as well, to hear their concerns, and to examine them. To see if they're potentially linked to this toxic chemical spill. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, explaining more about we expect in the coming days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

And these are dark, windy roads. There are a lot of deer. So the prosecution again suggesting that that was odd and perhaps, maybe he was in some rush. Randi Kaye, CNN, Walterboro, South Carolina.

They did not have the blood flutter, they did not have any DNA, they didn't have anything that you would expect to see in this case, especially in the age of CSI, right, where juries are really hungry for that really scientific data.So their case is very circumstantial and they said that right from the get go. A lot of testimony, you know, like 20 days of trial, countless witnesses, lots of really granular, difficult to digest evidence coming in relating to different time frames. But I have to say, this last day of testimony was really, really strong for prosecution because they're really pinning down that timeline, really pinning it down. And I think that the prosecution also had a couple of victories in rulings in that. They got this financial misdeeds in all of these crimes that Murdaugh committed on the finance side, which speaks to their motive. They also had a victory getting in this murder for hire plot and Murdaugh's confession to that, to investigators. So, all of that paints Murdaugh as this liar who's willing to do anything to save his own skin. So on that front, I think the prosecution really got of the benefit of all of that evidence coming in. Without that, I'm not sure they would have had as strong of a case. It all comes down to this timeline.",

But they're estimating the time of death both using the coroner and the medical examiner's testimony and their findings. But they're also saying that Paul and Maggie never use their cellphones again at 8:49 p.m., that puts Murdaugh there four minutes before their time of death. So the prosecutors are really putting together the pieces here in order to narrow when Paul and Maggie were murdered. Now keep in mind, defense witness yesterday put the coroner on the stand who says from his examination there's a three hour time span. It's an estimate 9:00 p.m. So to your point, that cellphone data and that lack of cellphone activity is absolutely critical to the prosecution's case.",

People should be able to just walk in and get it without asking the pharmacist. This could really increase access to naloxone because it's a very important antidote to an opioid overdose. That means that if the FDA commissioner says OK to this, then you would be able to get Narcan or naloxone just on the shelf, whether it's a supermarket or a drugstore or even, say, a gas station. Now this would be for the no spray version of naloxone. Experts say that being able to buy it in this way would increase access. But they also said there's another impediment. If you don't have health insurance, this drug can be expensive. And they said that bringing the price down would also increase access. The FDA commissioner is expected to sign off on this, but it's not exactly clear when.",
