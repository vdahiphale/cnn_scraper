And we begin this hour with a new glimpse at where Americans are leaning with just 51 days until the presidential election. A new ABC News/Ipsos poll released today shows Vice President Kamala Harris with 52 percent support among leading, likely voters to former president Donald Trump's 46 percent. That margin unchanged from the last ABC News poll taken at the end of August before their debate. with roughly seven weeks until the general election. Campaigns are racing to secure undecided voters in several key battleground states. But while these events will focus on voters, Trump's mind seems to be elsewhere at this critical moment in the race. The former president posting to his Truth Social account today, \"I hate Taylor Swift\", following the pop singers endorsement of Harris last week. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty is at the White House for us. Sunlen, what more are these latest polls telling us about the state of the race.",

And those numbers are largely similar to when this was tested back in August before the early September debate. Now still the poll does show that most Americans believe that Kamala Harris was the one to win the debate; 58 to 36 percent said that she was the one that did a better job on that debate stage. And the poll largely finds that the issues, the central issues of each candidate is also unchanged. Trump continues to be more widely trusted to handle the economy and immigration. While Harris is broadly more trusted on abortion and protecting American democracy. Now meantime, President Biden himself got in the mix on the campaign trail at an awards dinner here last night in D.C. where he blasted former president Trump in his peddling of baseless conspiracy theories, notably that conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign has been pushing that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio have been stealing people's pets and eating them.

Let's start from there. DANIEL DALE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes. What stood out to me most more than any individual claim was something I think as the \"I got caught\" shuffle and it's something I've seen over and over again in about eight years of fact-checking former President Trump and his allies. And it's one false claim, a lie and unsubstantiated claim called out by fact-checkers and others. And then the person who makes it tries to use the attention generated by that factcheck to pivot to some larger issue on which they think they have the advantage. And so, for example, when Trump will claim, you know, New York is at record high crime, people like Kamala point out, its nowhere close to record high crime. And then Trump and his supporters well you don't -- obviously you don't care about the people who were killed this year in New York. Well, that's -- that's not what we said. And similarly, in this case you know, Vance and others were pushing this claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were abducting and eating cats. Former president Trump added dogs. Those claims have been fact-checked repeatedly at this point. And now Vance is saying, well, no, no, no. Let's talk about the broader issue of, you know, the extent to which Haitians in Springfield are affecting health systems, the education system committing other crimes. And that's, that's not what we're talking about here. We're attempting to bring focus to the specific facts on the specific claims that they're making and they're trying to pivot.",

So there are a lot of examples, some kind of silly, some quite substantive, but I'll give you one easy one, and you can read the rest on CNN.com. The easy one is there was a rally in Pennsylvania where former president Trump, he gave kind of a shoutout to North Carolina. The Harris campaign used this social media account to make it seem like he had been confused about what state he was in. In fact, if you watched the full video, he was not confused. What happened was that he had earlier in the rally spoken to a group of supporters from North Carolina who were attending that Pennsylvania rally. And then later in the rally in the moment shown by KamalaHQ, he again refer to that group of North Carolina supporters as North Carolina. So he was not confused. He was not mixed up. But the Harris campaign attempted to make him seem like he was. They also did that with another clip more recently and there are a whole bunch of other examples of, you know, misleading cuts, snipping out parts of quotes to make Trump, Vance and others make it seem to make it seem like they said stuff that they didn't actually say.",

Now does Kamala Harris sort of still need to be little bit more cautious, you know, not really sit for national interviews. And what happens if there's not a second debate?

We are still trying to figure out exactly what's going on. Now, if you want to be clear, what I had been told was that this was in the vicinity of Palm Beach, not at his Doral resort, which is closer to Miami. However, again, this is still unfolding. So far, the only thing that we have confirmation of it time is that the Trump campaign has said that Trump is, quote, safe following gunshots in his vicinity, does -- the entire statement essentially says President Trump is safe following gunshots in his facility. No further details at this time. These came from a campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung. Again, obviously, this is incorrect out of remarkable given what we know, the assassination attempt that happened just recently over the summer in Butler, Pennsylvania. We have no details as to whether or not these shots fired were aimed at former President Trump. We have no details as to whether or not he was in danger at any time, but what we do know is that there were shots fired again, confirmed here by the campaign around the vicinity of Donald Trump. And he has been -- he's currently safe and appears on affected if you are looking at the statement right now. So again, we're trying to figure out the details of where exactly did he was. We know again, as you said, he was in south Florida. He was there for the weekend, but we're not sure entirely which of his properties she may have been at, at the time. We have reached out to local law enforcement in the area. We have reached out to multiple campaign officials, which was the results here, this statement.
