It's a race that has been completely altered in the last week since President Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Over the past seven days, she has moved at lightning speed to unite and energize the Democratic Party. Today, the Harris campaign announced that she has already raised a staggering $200 million and signed up 170,000 new volunteers in the past week. She has also made gains with voters as several polls show her tightening the race with Trump. Both candidates have spent the weekend on the campaign trail. Trump trying out new attack lines at trying to define his rival. Harris highlighting her record and calling out her opponent's, quote, \"wild lies.\" We have a team coverage rather of this fast-moving a presidential race. Let's begin with CNN's Julia Benbrook at the White House. Julia, good to see you again. What can you tell us about the Harris campaign strategy over the final 100 days now?",

They've also added 170,000 new volunteers and hosted over 2,000 campaign events in battleground states just this weekend.Now Trump has been trying out some new lines of attacks since he has a new opponent. In recent days, he's called Harris evil. He has made front of her laugh and he's even gone as far as to say that the American dream is dead if she wins in November. She's responding, she's calling those comments wild lies and saying that those statements coming from the top of the GOP ticket are just plain weird. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just back from his trip to the U.S. is meeting with senior near members of his government. They are weighing rather Israel's next move. Israeli war planes have already struck the Iran-backed group deep inside Lebanon. The incident is fueling fears that an all-out war could break out on Israel's northern border. All of this providing a tense backdrop for a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Rome today. We've got full coverage for you.

Today Middle East Airlines, the flag carrier for Lebanon, announced that several flights to Beirut had been delayed. They were supposed to arrive overnight. They've been delayed until tomorrow morning. We've just heard that Turkish Airlines, Air France, KLM have canceled all remaining flights to Beirut this evening and that all flights from Egypt to Lebanon have been canceled until further notice. Now, the U.S. embassy put out an announcement sort of restating their strong advice to Americans to reconsider any travel plans to Lebanon. Now, this afternoon I arrived in Beirut and the airport was full of people coming to Lebanon, not leaving. And many of those who were in the line waiting for passport control, they have American passports. Now today, we also had an opportunity, Fredricka, to speak to the caretaker foreign minister of Lebanon, Abdallah Bou Habib, who stressed that when it comes to Hezbollah, the Lebanese government is basically helpless.

Of course, things are drastically different today when they did meet here in Rome. This was the head of the CIA meeting, his counterparts from Israel, Egypt, and Qatar. And the meeting did not last all day. In fact, the Israeli head of Mossad flew back to Tel Aviv immediately after the lunch hour and was meeting with the prime minister there. That's the only on the record information we actually have about what happened in this meeting. That came from the Israeli prime minister's office saying that in fact they talked about the document with some, quote-unquote, \"clarifications\" that came from Israel but that the talks will be convened in a later date.

It's heartbreaking for the people of this community. And what I'm being told is that the fire is still very active at its center. It is an areas where it is very steep, it is difficult to access that fire. But there is some progress and two things that have helped over the weekend. Lower temperatures and also the addition of more resources, more people on the ground. That number actually about doubling. We now have almost 4,000 firefighters on the ground. And when you put those boots on the ground, there are a couple of things that they can do. We were told that some of them were able to come and assess the damage. And so as they were making those assessments, they were able to bring down the number of structures that were destroyed. That number is now at 66. And the other thing they were able to do is what they've called a direct aggressive attack on that fire that helped the containment essentially in this fire. And so what you're seeing too is a priority for the people of this county. That's what fire officials told me. This is a county that went through the deadliest fire in California history in 2018 when a lot of people died and thousands of homes were destroyed.

The latest twist comes from the attorney for Ismael El Mayo Zambada, the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, who now says his clients neither surrendered or negotiated any terms with the U.S. government but was, instead, kidnapped.I spoke earlier on the phone with Frank Perez, Zambada's attorney, who told me his 76-year-old client was kidnapped by Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, the other co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel. Joaquin Guzman Lopez forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied and a black bag was placed over his head, Perez said in a statement sent to CNN. He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane. His legs tied to the seat by Joaquin and brought to the U.S. against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquin and my client, Perez added. U.S. law enforcement officials had previously told CNN that Joaquin Guzman Lopez had duped Zambada and orchestrated the arrest by making him believe they were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate. Instead, the official said their small, private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where U.S. authorities were waiting on the tarmac. Former D.A. agent, Jack Riley, told CNN that Zambada managed to elude law enforcement for decades. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I see that highly unlikely, given where he was in the organization.But this it is a tremendous blow to Sinaloa. And I think it's important to understand that this guy has been around. Mayo Zambada has been around for 40 years. That's really unheard of for someone in his position. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
