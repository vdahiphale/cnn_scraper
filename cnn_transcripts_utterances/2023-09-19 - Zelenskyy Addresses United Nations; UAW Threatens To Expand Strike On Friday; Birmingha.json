It's about what else we're going to do at home. It's about wind, it's about solar.

It's also though, Richard facing some other issues as well that is common to local governments. One is a massive cut from government spending in terms of grants that they've received over the last well, since the Conservatives frankly, were empowered in 2010 and remained in government.

That is also likely to happen here in Canada.Think about it, Richard, Canada just put on hold what they wanted to be a very expansive trade deal with India. India is part and parcel of the Indo Pacific Strategy that is not just a White House project right now, but also a Canadian one. And Richard, there you have your answer, right? Trudeau was sure -- to make sure that he spoke with US President Biden about what he was about to disclose, before he disclosed it. He knows the White House is looking to India to really try and be a counterbalance to China's weight militarily, economically and this poses huge problems. Basically, Trudeau is accusing Modi of being nothing more than a rogue actor, and by basically carrying out state terrorism on Canadian soil. This also I should add, Richard, does bring in so contentious Indian politics on Canadian shores and that's something that no one wants.",

The thing though, during the G-20, which Canadian officials say a really made them wonder if Narendra Modi was committed to trying to solve this crime was the fact that they were given absolutely no agency whatsoever, not in pull asides, behind-the-scenes, not in public, nowhere know how. Modi pushed back hard saying that it was Canada that was harboring terrorists, that were intent on breaking up India and he did not want to see any evidence and would not give it any credence whatsoever. And that's why Canada decided to take this step. You also wonder, Richard about the kind of intelligence that Canada has in its hands. We have seen intelligence at times be mistaken. So there are a lot of pressure right now on the Trudeau government to disclose something that it likely cannot disclose. And that's going back to your original point, who ordered this and how do you know who was involved in this?",

It said the grocery market is worth $1.1 trillion. And only about 12 percent of sales are happening online so the company is saying there's a big runway for it going forward. It is interesting, you know, the grocery delivery market has changed in the past two years since that big $39 billion valuation market. People during the pandemic were ordering groceries online a whole lot more than they are now. But one of the things that I think investors are probably picking up on in this IPO is the fact that the company is now profitable. Instacart reported in the first half of this year net income of $242 million compared to a $74 million loss the same time last year. And that's due in part to the company moving in other directions beyond just grocery delivery. One of those is advertising. The company is using all the customer data that it has from those grocery orders to sell advertising to grocery stories, for example. So, I think that's some of the things that investors are probably looking at, not just the grocery delivery market but where else the company might go in the future.",
