And we are open to having that conversation and to hearing other opinions as well. But I think it's important to have that moral clarity to say that what happened that -- what Israel is doing currently is a just war and it is a defensive war.Our core work is just -- is also just to support students. Students are having many different types of feelings. We want to process with them. We have rabbis on our staff. We have educators on our staff. And we're there at Hillel to support Jewish students right now. Over the last three weeks, we've come together several times. Over 1,000 people cumulatively to hold a vigil for Jewish students and to hold a rally to demand that the hostages come home.",

Now it's going to be up to a judge to figure out Trump's ballot fate in a case that could have major implications for other states where similar challenges have been filed.Let's bring in CNN's Marshall Cohen, who's been following the latest details.

So, you're looking at some pictures from that courtroom. There is a camera in there, and right now is some witness testimony.But earlier today, opening statements from both sides. I'll play a clip for you from the challengers. The Group of Republican and independent voters that are trying to get Trump off the ballot. Their argument was essentially that this in the 14th Amendment, this is the law of the land we need to uphold the law and maintain a fair election. Listen to what they had to say.

She really wasn't willing to answer any of the questions concerning the investigation. Her concerns over the fact that maybe law enforcement here missed items of information that could have prevented this from happening. I know from talking to law enforcement officials here in Maine and outside of Maine that are aware of this, that there is so much concern over the fact that there was enough evidence here, they believe, enough information to warrant further investigation, perhaps more action by the local police department and it just wasn't taken. And we just want the governor's reaction to it. Look, she is the governor of this state. She's in -- for all purposes, she's in charge of this investigation. She runs the state police. They report to her. So all we simply want to know is what does she know? And you know, really this is about getting some answers, right, for this community, for people who have been affected by this. But also law enforcement wants to know. Folks that are not living here outside of here, they want to know what steps were missed. Where were the mistakes made and if there were no mistakes then that's fine. But someone needs to talk about it. And this has been something that they've not wanted to answer for days now. You know, the day after this incident, there were questions about this, about the law enforcement contact with the shooter. They basically ignored those questions. And now as we see from the governor, all the way to the top of this state, continuing to ignore the questions and refusing to answer the them.",

      "sentences": "Yes, two huge developments this afternoon in the push that tried to get this Israel aid package moving. The new speaker, Mike Johnson, just revealed text that the Republicans plan to pursue a built tax that includes $14.3 billion in aid to Ukraine. But notable -- the aid to Israel does not have aid to Ukraine as part of this package. But notably it includes spending cuts to offset the cost of the price tag. What it would do is cut spending for the IRS. Spending that was authorized through the Democrats Inflation Reduction Act, a law the Republicans opposed. But it would cut $14.3 billion in spending from the IRS in order to pay for the package.That is a no go for Democrats. In fact, I just talked to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on his way back from the White House. He told me that obviously a pay for like that makes it much harder to pass. He was referring to that spending cut that the Republicans are pushing. Also, he said we believe our Democratic caucus, we should be doing it all together -- Israel, Ukraine, the South Pacific. That tees up a huge fight. Remember, the White House had asked for $105 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, the South Pacific, to deal with the problems at the border. The new speaker wants to focus just on Israel and also to include those spending cuts that are going to be a huge issue for Democrats. So where does that leave everything? Unclear. Can Congress pass an aid package for Israel at this critical time? Can it do so for Ukraine? Also, lots of doubt about whether that could pass the Republican House. So even as Johnson is making Israel's first priority, can it become law? A major question is whether he pursues this approach. And the Senate Majority Leader telling me moments ago that approach won't fly in the United States Senate.",
