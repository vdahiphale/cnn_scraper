It's now the fourth day of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas and the militant group says it wants to extend the pause in the fighting beyond the four-day deal.A source tells CNN Israel's war cabinet also discussed that possibility Sunday night. More hostages are expected to be released in the hours ahead and on day three of the truce, 17 hostages were freed including Israelis and foreign nationals. The group included mothers and children and ranged in age from 84 to four-years-old. Other hostages released by Hamas over the weekend, including this mother and daughter have already been reunited with their families. And as part of the deal an additional 39 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were released from Israeli jails on Sunday. All were teenage boys 18 years old and younger. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments and joins us now live from a London. A very good morning, Clare. It's the fourth and final agreed day of this temporary truce. Let's first reflect on what happened during day three.",

If you wait for news of what will unfold today on Monday, Sunday's released as you say included 17 people the youngest that were two four-year olds, among them, Israeli American Abigail Edan, whose parents were killed in that massacre on October 7, two siblings those survived.There was a lot of anticipation certainly on the U.S. side that she would be released as part of this four-day hostage deal that has now happened. In other news, the oldest among those released on Sunday was Alma Abraham, she is said to be in a critical condition in ICU in hospital her life in danger. According to doctors there this is the first time that we've heard of a hostage being released being that in that level of medical distress, so that is worth noting. Separately, Sunday's exchange appeared to go smoother than Saturdays where there was some hitches 39 Palestinian prisoners, as you say, mainly males under 18 were released and aid trucks were seen in large numbers entering Gaza. This is critical because we know one of the reasons why Ham has delayed the release of hostages on Saturday was because they accused Israel of not keeping up their end of the bargain of not sending enough aid trucks, specifically into northern Gaza. Now there was another issue on Saturday that we're continuing to see the fallout of and that is that a 13-year-old girl was released without her mother. This is something that we're learning from Israeli officials that they fought to include her mother. They're not exactly sure why she wasn't included. And they still don't exactly know the status of her mother. Listen to Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus speaking to CNN as Kaitlan Collins about why he thinks that Hamas did this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: They're preying on the feelings of Israelis, as simple as that they want to manipulate. They want to create more suffering. They want to leverage each and every Israeli in their captivity for political pressure. They think that they can buy their way out of this situation that they have forced upon us this war, and that they want to use the civilian hostages in order to try to survive and see yet another day. This will fail. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Crowds of well- wishers in Ramallah waved Palestinian and Hamas flags and gathered around a bus which was carrying some of the freed prisoners.Celebrations were more subdued in Jerusalem, where Israeli police have specifically warned against them. The Israeli Prison Service says 39 prisoners and detainees all teenage boys were released Sunday from seven prisons. The Palestinian prisoners released on Sunday were all 18 years old or younger, the youngest 14 years old. According to information from the Israeli Prison Service and the Palestinian Prisoners Society, some of them were detained without knowing the charges they faced and as CNN's Nada Bashir reports, many of those released say they were abused while in custody. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Carried through the crowds, celebrated by thousands of Palestinians. These boys are among 33 teenagers released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. This is for many here in the occupied West Bank, a moment of hope. And for those now freed, a moment of utter relief. I'm so happy. I can't believe this is real. Ibrahim says. I don't even know what to say. This scene a product of a delicate four-day truce agreement between Israel and Hamas set to see 150 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released and at least 50 Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. There are many Palestinian families who will still be waiting anxiously to hear if their loved ones will to be freed. The Tamimi family scene here on Saturday has rallied for months calling for the release of 17-year-old Wissam. He was seriously injured by Israeli forces and later arrested in June, accused by Israel of offenses including possessing a weapon, but he was never charged. Now, he and his family are finally together again. I can't describe to you how I'm feeling right now. I honestly can't believe it. I feel like I'm in a dream, Wissam's mother Hunaida says. My son is finally with me. I thank God and pray that every mother will be able to feel this joy. I pray God grants Palestinian people this happiness. We just want to be able to smile and laugh together. Many of those now released are among the over 3,000 Palestinians held under administrative detention, meaning no charges have been made against them, and no ongoing legal process. Israel says some of those released were being held on terror or weapons charges. But in a list published by Israeli authorities of 300 women and children eligible for release, throwing stones and harming regional security were among the most common charges. DR. MUSTAFA BARGHOUD, PALESTINIAN POLITICIAN AND ACTIVIST: There are children here who have been in use in jail for eight years, five years, six years. It's unacceptable. Many of them have now huge psychological problems, because of the torture, at least psychological torture because of the way they were interrogated. It is a terrible atrocity that is practiced against these children. BASHIR (voice-over): For the crowds gathered here in the occupied West Bank, this celebration, they say is a symbol of justice. Bringing thousands of Palestinians together to share in the joy of now reunited families. But for many that joy is coupled with grief, with pain felt deeply here for the people of Gaza.",

They kind of said that they don't know where they are, the whereabouts are. That looks to us totally false, because they've been controlling Gaza to the last aorta for the last 20 odd years in a very cruel regime that didn't let anybody move without their permission.

But obviously their challenges is that they can't keep reservists on duty forever. That hurts the economy. So if they're going to prosecute the war in Gaza, they can't have ceasefires forever. But I think the combination of pressure has been enough to make them think that this pause makes sense, and that they can get out more hostages -- all to the good.",

Eaton who lived in an apartment building near where the shooting took place.CNN's Carlos Suarez has details of the attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Authorities in Vermont are looking into the possibility this was a hate crime. According to police in Burlington, the three Palestinian students were walking on a street on their way to visit a relative on Saturday when they were confronted by a man armed with a gun. All three students were shot. Now, at the time of the shooting we are told two of the three victims were wearing a keffiyeh, that's a traditional Palestinian scarf. We are told the photo of the three students were taken earlier in the day on Saturday. All three victims are being treated at Vermont medical center. Two of them we are told are in stable condition. The third suffered more serious injuries. Now according to the Institute for Middle East Understanding, that is an organization that is in contact with the victims' families, the students were identified as 20-year-old Tahseen Ali Ahmad, Kinnan Abdalhamid, and Hisham Awartani. We're told all three graduated from a private school in West Bank before coming to the U.S. to attend different colleges. Awartani's great uncle, a former Palestinian minister of education said Awartani was visiting his grandmother. Here now is an attorney representing one of the victims' family on why they're certain this was a hate-motivated crime. ABED AYOUB, LAWYER FOR VICTIM'S FAMILY: The suspect walked up to them and shot them. They weren't robbed. They weren't robbed. It was a targeted shooting and a targeted crime. And they were wearing the keffiyeh. They are known in the area, you know, for being Palestinian. You know, that is a very well-known symbol. It's a very well-known cloth that is very symbolic of the Palestinian tribe, the Palestinian culture and history. So the fact that they were wearing this, and then fell victim to a shooter leads us to believe that that played a role. Their identity played a role in them being targeted.",

This year, it's officially moved the holiday to December 25th when many Christian denominations celebrate it, instead of following the Russian Orthodox calendar which observes it on January 7th. Last year, there were some reservations about putting up a tree in Kyiv's city center. But a 12-meter-high artificial tree was lit up in the colors of Ukraine's flag. The lights, powered by a generator, because of repeated Russian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. Kyiv's mayor called it a tree of invincibility.
