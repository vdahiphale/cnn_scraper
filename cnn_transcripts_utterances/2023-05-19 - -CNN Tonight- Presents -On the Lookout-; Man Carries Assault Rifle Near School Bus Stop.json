Key announcements from Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Tim Scott are expected next week. Our panel is going to tell us what to look out for on the political horizon.And with the migrant crisis straining cities, we're going to tell you about a big story in the headlines this week that one of the men involved now calls a scam. The head of the Veterans Organization accused of rounding up homeless men and telling them to claim that they were veterans being displaced from their hotel lodgings to make room for migrants. She denies it. Tonight, we have the facts and the New York mayor is calling for an investigation. And AI feels like a runaway train headed our way. Tonight, we're going to talk to a former Google executive who worked in AI and tech for decades. His warnings ahead. But first, a segment we call \"On the Lookout,\" the stories that we see on the horizon. First, the 2024 GOP primary is heating up. South Carolina Senator Tim Scott filing papers today with the FEC to run for president. He is expected to make a formal announcement on Monday. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to file paperwork declaring his candidacy next week. He was in New Hampshire today taking a swipe at Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): It's easy to be a frontrunner. It's easy to go out and take positions that are really popular at the time. It's harder to dig in and really cut against the grain. It's not going to be easy. But I honestly believe that we have an opportunity to right the ship and to get this whole country going. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm not sure.Donald Trump is going to be really, really tough to beat at this point. He's ahead in the polls, depending on which one you look at, between 30 and 40 points. That is a huge, huge lead. So, he -- Tim Scott would have to have a really, really solid message, one that would really transcend anything that we are seeing right now. Right now, he's way down in the single digits.

But I think, again, one thing you're not hearing from a lot of the candidates jumping in is that they are the best choice, that they are the only choice, that they can win. And I think it speaks to the fact that President Trump does have a stranglehold on that base, that it is this bizarre kind of quirk in our politics where he is a de facto incumbent with all in many ways the power of an incumbent without the actual kind of downside of incumbency.

So, it doesn't look like anything is going to happen over the weekend.The sticking point, we're told, is that Republicans want budget cuts with this. So, put aside for a moment the hypocrisy that when Trump was president, they weren't interested -- they didn't care that much about the debt ceiling or deficit spending. Let's put that aside.

No one forced them to do that. They said they wanted to see Title 42 go away. No one forced them to do that. And so, at the end of two years, when they've been suing states to not do their own business on the border, now we've reached the conclusion they wanted and surprise, surprise, they don't have a plan.
