Luckily, no one was harmed.Meanwhile, beachgoers in New York are on high alert after at least four suspected shark attacks were reported in just the past two days. Among them, a man who was swimming at the beach on Long Island yesterday. Police say he was chest-deep in water when he was bitten by a, quote, \"large marine animal.\" We're told he suffered cuts to his knee but will be OK. Now, Monday, a 15-year-old boy was attacked off the coast of Fire Island. Authorities say a shark bit his toes and heel but he was still able to swim to the shore. As a result, officials across Long Island say they are stepping up patrols at beaches, including using drones for an aerial view of the water. And joining us now is Gavin Naylor. He's the director of the Florida program for shark research. Gavin, thanks so much for joining us. I guess what I always try and figure out with stories like this is is this an increase. Is there an acceleration of sharks moving closer, or do we just like watching the videos and are kind of fascinated by the animals themselves? GAVIN NAYLOR, PH.D., DIRECTOR, FLORIDA PROGRAM FOR SHARK RESEARCH (VIA Webex by Cisco):  Good morning. A little bit of all three, actually. So a lot more documentation occurs because everyone has got their cell phone so we see more of these things, so they come into our living rooms really quickly.",

Juveniles that are basically protected from predation and they hang behind the sand bars and sometimes come out to feed on the bunker. And if visibility is low and there's a lot of people in the water then it can happen. That said, I haven't seen any identification that they are sand tigers responsible this year. I saw some videos of a lot of dark aggregate offshore and it's not immediately clear what species they are. And different species, as you can imagine, respond differently.

Now, this did prompt a temporary evacuation on Sunday evening. And now sources tell CNN that this, in a field test, was determined to possibly be cocaine. Now, that is not conclusive -- the result of that test -- but the Secret Service has said that there is going to be ongoing tests and evaluation as to what exactly this is. So this is an ongoing investigation, again, into what exactly the substance is and also how it entered the White House.

The singer suffered a black eye and needed stitches. According to a criminal complaint, the man said he did it because he thought, quote, \"it would be funny.\" Soon after, pop singer Ava Max was slapped by a man who rushed to the stage in Los Angeles before he was swept away by security. Max later posted that the man, quote, \"...slapped me so hard that the scratched the inside of my eye.\" And country star Kelsea Ballerini was struck in the face by an object thrown at her during a performance.
