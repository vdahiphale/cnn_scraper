It indicates I think, to some degree, that there may be some disagreement in the jury's recollection of what those instructions are, and they could essentially be kind of having camps in there. And it might just be one person or groups of people -- one side saying oh, well, this instruction -- I think I heard it this way, which would be beneficial perhaps to the state, and another side saying oh, I heard that instruction and I heard it to be essentially more beneficial to Donald Trump. And so, you start to see some evidence of potential division as opposed to them all going back to the jury deliberation room and saying just kind of square away. We've listened to the evidence. We're looking at these basic elements. We can't convict or we're all going to convict. It shows that there's ongoing deliberations and likely, some camps of thought divided amongst the jury.",

The hung jury creates an automatic mistrial.Now, if the jury comes back and they say that they're hopelessly deadlocked, the judge is going to send them back at least once -- maybe two or three more times -- ordering them to reattempt to deliberate on those charges. And only after two or three attempts would he declare a hung jury, which would result in a mistrial. And then, the most important question at that point, if there was a mistrial to all charges, would Alvin Bragg bring this case back again? He could bring it back even within a couple of weeks. The main issue would be the schedules of the court and the schedules of the counsel because all of the pretrial things like motions and discovery -- that's all been done.

And then, from there, go ahead and vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. But that is still a risk and polling has shown that many voters across the country care about other issues more than abortion right now.
