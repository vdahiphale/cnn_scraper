A significant announcement from the Russian president. We're joined now by former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, CNN military analyst Spider Marks, CNN contributor Jill Dougherty. So we have got essentially everything covered here. Ambassador, I'd like to start with you, though, on what your takeaways were from Putin's speech, and if you think you'll -- we will see Biden directly respond to that when he himself speaks in just a few hours from now. BILL TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: So, Kaitlan, I'm sure that President Biden has a strong measure to give. It is not directed at President Putin, but President Putin will hear him. President Biden's message is going to be, we're supporting Ukraine against this invasion from the Russians, and it will continue. It will continue as long as it takes.
