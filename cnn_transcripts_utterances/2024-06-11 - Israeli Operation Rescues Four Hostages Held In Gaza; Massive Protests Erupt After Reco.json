But whether Israel and Hamas will move forward remains unclear. Here's some of their reaction from the U.N. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Colleagues, today this council sent a clear message to Hamas, accept the ceasefire deal on the table. Israeli -- Israel has already agreed to this deal and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same. RIYAD MANSOUR, PALESTINIAN OBSERVER TO THE UNITED NATIONS: The proof is in the pudding. We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become the reality and those who are obstructing it and they want to continue the war of genocide against our people.

Thousands of protesters turned out in Paris Monday, with some holding signs that read no fascists in power.After four days of voting in all 27 E.U. countries, far-right parties are expected to win a record number of seats in the next European Parliament. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A landslide defeat for French President Emmanuel Macron's party in the European elections. Macron immediately dissolving French parliament and calling for snap elections in France. The decision is serious, a hard one, he said, but it is above all an act of confidence, confidence in you, my fellow citizens. The call came as the far-right La Rassemblement National won around twice as many votes in the election as Macron's party. Sluggish economies in many European countries and the migration crisis similar to the southern border in the U.S. where the top issues for voters across Europe. Many of the right-wing parties gaining ground also sympathetic to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, like Marine Le Pen of the La Rassemblement National, who's been a Kremlin ally for years. The French have spoken and this historic election shows that when the people vote, the people win, she said. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party also suffered for a beat down coming in third behind the right-wing alternative for Germany, or AFD. The AFD with big gains even after their main candidate claimed there were decent people in Hitler's Waffen-SS and employed and accused Chinese spy in his office during the election campaign. We had a bumpy start to the election campaign and then really caught up in the final sprint, the party chairman said, after all the prophecies of doom, after the barrage of the last weeks, we are the second strongest force. Europe's far-right, often skeptical of relations with the U.S., will be a strong force in Europe's parliament. And one of former President Donald Trump's strongest allies in Europe, Viktor Orban of Hungary, also an E.U. skeptic, at a strong showing. To sum up the results of the European parliamentary election, we can send in a telegram to Brussels saying, migration stopped, gender stopped, the war stopped, Soros (ph) stopped, Brussels stopped, he said.

On the other hand, of course, this could potentially backfire by further legitimizing and rendering this far-right party palatable in France. And this is certainly a pattern that we have seen in other areas of the European Union, where traditional parties have been increasingly entertaining, coalitions with these -- with these particular groups.

What could that mean for Donald Trump given his American first policies anti-immigrant, anti-institution, is this potentially a positive signal for him? THOMASAnd on the other hand, you have political groups, parties and leaders who are determined to undermine the judiciary, the freedom of the press, and the legislative process. And right now, certainly, when it comes to the European Union context, they see in the words of President Biden, a deep commitment to democratic institutions, that the European E.U. landscape, as we have seen, is divided. And there are many leaders and many political groups who see in President Trump's track record, actions and words, a potential ally. And they also see in him somebody who is not committed to the multilateral order to the strength of the European Union or to NATO. And so, to that extent, this particular election in the E.U. is an indication as to where things are potentially heading in the United States, and the impact that this will have on further solidifying and consolidating those parties that performed very well in this recent election in the European Union.",

And at the same time, these right-wing xenophobic arguments around immigration, threats to the identity of the European Union have captured the focus of the electorate.

I got an ESPN push alert the other day and nearly fell off my chair.(LAUGH) So, this is the sort of exposure you crave for as a sport. And I think the guys have got a really good chance of going through to the next round if they beat Ireland on Friday. They are playing India on Wednesday as well. So, who knows?
