At least 36 people have lost their lives; dozens are injured after a head on train collision near the City of Larissa. One person has been arrested. Leaders from around the world are expressing their condolences. We'll bring you the latest on just how that tragedy may have occurred. Plus, celebration and recrimination in Nigeria Ruling Party Candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu is declared the winner of the hotly contested presidential election. Opposition parties though calling the whole process tented and demanding a fresh vote. We'll discuss to the numerous social and economic challenges facing Nigeria post-election, including the physical cash supply crisis with the CEO of the Nigerian mobile payments company Paga later in the show. And in Asia today, China's economic rebound catching economists off guard manufacturing, especially bouncing back after the lifting of COVID restrictions in fact, output from Chinese factories hitting its best levels in more than a decade last month. The services and construction sectors are seeing strong growth too and better numbers to from the hard hit property sector. As you can imagine investors applauding the news the HANG SENG spiking more than 4 percent on the first day of March trade, the SHANGHAI COMPOSITE also as you can see that up some 1 percent. The data giving an early session boost to U.S. stock market futures too, but it's looking like a firmly lower open now as you can see two tenths of 1 percent across the board. However, Europe still managing to hold in the green, plenty more on this and on China's charge later on in the program but first, the latest from Northern Greece where as I mentioned, at least 36 people have lost their lives. Dozens more have been injured after a passenger train collided with a freight train last night. Just listen to the words of this passenger who was on board that train. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

OK, interesting. We will discuss shortly on the show for now, the long battle for Bakhmut appears to be reaching a crescendo as Ukraine's Military says Russian forces have intensified their assault on the city. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy says Bakhmut represents the most difficult challenge across the front lines with soldiers describing the situation as hellish. Beyond this battle, Moscow is accusing Kyiv of attempting multiple drone strikes on infrastructure deep within Russia. Meanwhile, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is in Beijing meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It comes amid growing speculation that China might consider sending lethal aid to Moscow for its war effort. Marc Stewart joins us now with the latest, though I think the context here is important. This is a leader of a country that allowed Russian troops to use his nation as a stage in their initial incursion into Ukraine last year. He talked about intensifying relations between Belarus and China. What does that mean in practice, Marc?",

Yet it is having a very powerful its top leadership is having a very powerful face to face meeting with the President of Belarus. This is a nation that not only has a longtime relationship with China, but also with Vladimir Putin, and as you rightly said, has been serving almost as a staging point for troops from Russia to enter Ukraine yet Belarus says it is supporting a neutral peace plan from China. It is only fair to ask questions about the sincerity of that pledge. As far as this peace plan that Russia is proposing. It is very vague on details. It doesn't even call for the withdrawal of Russian troops that is from Ukraine. So with all of that said, with all of that laid out the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko is showing his support for China's so called peace proposal.

Meanwhile, our Christiane Amanpour sat down with Iran's Foreign Minister for an exclusive interview covering a whole range of topics, including the alleged sexual abuse of anti-government protesters, while in the custody of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Listen in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (on camera): When you say the Islamic Republic of Iran respects human rights, one female protester says that she was detained inside a Revolutionary Guard facility for more than a month and raped by three different men. She went to a cleric - afterwards, because she was having suicidal thoughts. She was so upset. CNN spoke with that cleric. Is that acceptable? Is it acceptable for a woman, whatever she's done, to be arrested and raped? And there are many, many, many reports of sexual abuse in this situation against women and men. HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Firstly, in the peaceful demonstrations in the fall, no one was arrested. AMANPOUR (on camera): So you're just denying that? AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN: However, in those protests that have become violent, some individuals, some of whom had entered around from the outside, and were using firearms and killing the police were arrested. You do know that the Supreme Leader actually issued an amnesty and all those who were imprisoned were released, with the exception of those who had killed someone or being sued. Regarding the Iranian woman that I mentioned, I cannot confirm it. There have been so many such baseless claims made on social media and in media. AMANPOUR (on camera): OK, these are not baseless and they weren't on the internet is CNN spoke to a cleric a religious person inside your country and got this. AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN: We have seen some of CNN reports that are targeted and false. AMANPOUR (on camera): That's not true. We report the facts and we report the truth and that's why you're sitting here with me, Mr. Foreign Minister. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I do think and hope that the next government continues and actually strengthens this policy direction. Have they been some things that could have been done differently? Absolutely, what we have experienced on our platform is over 3X growth, year over year on transactions digitally, and I think the banks have seen that they also need to improve their platforms and their technology and infrastructure. On our side, we have had really high uptime, and we've been able to see people coming in to look for using our platform, whether it's at our retail agents, or directly on their mobile phone. So for us, it's been really about driving the move to digital. When we spoke last, I think we spoke last Q2 of 2020, where we started seeing that room with people signing up. And today and then when we spoke we were processing I think about. I think we were processing just about 30 million transactions in the year or something like that now last year, we did 65 million transactions worth over 3.2 trillion Naira, that's about 10 percent of the total estimated consumer spend in Nigeria, which is 40 trillion. So that growth is continuing into this year. And I think this move to digital from the Central Bank is only going to further spirit. And I expect that will continue to drive additional growth, whether it's from individuals trying to figure out ways to transact digitally and make everyday payments, or businesses who want to collect payments, as well. And the recent partnership that we have with one of the big banks here, the United Bank for Africa, is going to further help this because we've partnered together working to issue for them to issue Visa cards to our customers. So UVA issues a Visa card to our customers with a physical card. So now wherever Visa is accepted, you can use it where the merchant accepts Paga or not also online, you can now use the Visa card to shop online and to receive remittances into Nigeria, which is a big deal for Nigeria. As you know, over the last three years, a lot of people have also left the country. So this is a big opportunity. So we're really excited about the push to digital, I think it's going to stay.",

And we've seen satellite cost performance increase about 1000 X with basically the shrinking of satellites. And it's like the desktop, the mainframe to desktop revolution in IT a few decades ago, but having in space and the upshot of that we're having vast new data sets about the planet, helping us to take care of it in real time.",

And by monitoring the whole earth every day, as we do, we canliterally tell for every part of every field, how well is the crop doing? What type of crop is it? Is it wheat, or soy or what have you? And then help the farmer determine when to add more fertilizer or when it doesn't, isn't necessary, reduce use of fertilizer, which is good for the environment, and increased yields so very tactical help despite being coming in from a long way away. And that's just one of many applications. Another 25 percent of the landmass of the Earth is forests. And we can help with tracking deforestation. So we help governments track deforestation. We help with mapping. We help with many other areas. You can imagine the use of these datasets is quite profound. It's mainly about helping people make smarter day to day decisions with more up to date information about the changing planet.",

Tracking the illegal shipmentsand as some journalist found illegal shipments to Turkey and Syria against the sanctions and so on. And so help get to the bottom of that, so we can undo it. And finally, to your point about building damage, we worked with Microsoft to do a building damage report for the United Nations Secretary General of the building damage of all the buildings across Ukraine, to help them determine how and when they can bring the displaced people back into their homes? Are their homes still there? If they're damaged how much damage is there? And that's super important. And that's the power of also our data plus AI coming into the fore.

I mean, it's quite big balloon 70 meters across about 200 feet. So we can see that for sure in our imagery. So we looked and, and we had some colleagues at synthetic accompany doing AI, that we quickly built a little algorithm that looked for the balloon, and then we're able to search for it in our imagery. And they did that in just a couple of days. And so within a couple of days, we would already know it may have not been able to find it. But we had found it. And we found it crossing the country in a number of places where people hadn't yet found it. And even some journalist managed to find out where it had been launched from in Mongolia, using our data and, and so yes, I mean, I guess one of the exciting things out of that we can now go back in time and find when they were previously crossing the U.S., when did they do that last year, the year before? Because we always keep this snapshot and record it. We never delete those data. And similarly, across the other parts of the world, if you said, hey, I'm in Europe, can you tell me when it if it was crossing our country, and last summer? We can go and have a look.

We're trying to help - we sell it to governments for intelligence. We sell it to mapping companies. We sell it to agriculture companies. And in fact those margins on the business are quite high because when we sell our imagery, once the second time we sell it the incremental cost of serving them, that image is very low. So we have good growth rates over 40 percent this year, and so on.

So I had the opportunity to work with all these amazing cosmetic companies, skincare companies, and then experts and seeing that space between super you know, traditional brands like Ayurvedic and Indian brands, and then Western brands. And no brand really had the ability to appeal to all women and really make Indian beauty accessible. So one thing I really talk about is accessibility and just having these rituals and these ingredients and even like techniques like I mean Ayurveda runs deep so it's like you know massage techniques, hair oiling it goes on. But just having those is able to relate to all women and also make it easy and fun. And you know, for my generation because there are this you know, preconceived notion of Indian beauty being very traditional and quiet and also a little bit more like older feeling.

And then I came up with this hybrid concept really based off of just like who I am because I'm, I'm you know my Indian heritage and I've been born and raised in America and I'm very proud of my cultural duality. So this hybrid concept really represents women today because we're hybrids of mixed cultures and races and backgrounds and goals and dreams.
