Just over a day from a federal government shutdown. We'll look at the real world cost for millions of Americans. Then Vladimir Putin asserts his authority over Wagner's elite mercenary unit. What we know about his meeting with the top commander. Plus, an election in Slovakia could spell trouble for Ukraine. We'll have all the details just ahead. Well, the U.S. government remains on track right now to shut down this weekend. Just moments ago, a stopgap spending extension put forward by the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, failed. He was hoping provisions on border security could win over the right-wing hard-liners, but it appears that wasn't enough. And if nothing changes, millions of federal employees, including the military, will go without pay, starting Sunday. Earlier McCarthy was pressed by CNN's Manu Raju on why he won't try to cut a deal with the Democrats instead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Take a look at this video from a normally-busy Brooklyn subway station. Rainwater just pouring down the stairs into the station below. Ten train lines are suspended, and that's just in Brooklyn alone. Subway service around the famous Rockefeller Plaza also had to be shut down. And flooding has also shut down traffic on major roads such as the Brooklyn Queens expressway and portions of the Interstate 87 in the Bronx. A month's worth of rain fell in just three hours in some areas. Incredible scenes. Well, the flooding comes as workers prepare for more impending trouble chaos caused by a government shutdown. Essential federal employees at airports are expected to show up for work, but they won't be paid if the government closes, something that's much more likely after a key vote in the house failed a short time ago. And that raises the very real dilemma that some may even quit, others will be furloughed if a deal can't be reached. Well, for more on what this means for the travel industry, I'm joined by CNN business editor-at-large, Richard Quest, always good to have you with us, Richard. So the consequences of a government shutdown are far and wide. It will affect workers that work for U.S. Customs like the TSA workers, Federal Aviation Administration as well as air traffic control workers. They are considered essential, so they should be going to work, but they won't be paid, right? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Right, so, there are three types of work. There is the exempt, there's the accepted and there are the furloughed, just looking at that. Now, the exempt are the ones you were talking about, they work in safety, they're the essential services. They still have to go to work. They don't get paid while the shutdown continues, although, what happens is a resolution is passed afterwards to give them back-pay. The problem is, some of them may not turn up. And if you're talking about air traffic controllers, TSA and border guards, they may find all sorts of reasons. Illness, sickouts, whatever, that they just don't turn up and the numbers of delays increase. This is a system that is already under strain. It is at almost capacity on many days and many hours. And so to put this extra additional pressure on such a vital part of the U.S. economy is very damaging. And one other thing, various fees that the FAA would receive from airlines, from passenger duties and all those sort of things, that money won't be -- it'll be collected by the airlines, but there won't be the transmission mechanism to give it to the FAA, which will be losing tens of millions of dollars every day.",

But, yes,of course it could be worse for the very simple reason, the system is straining already. You saw what happened recently when there was an FAA meltdown. What is going to, I think, invariably take place is that the airlines themselves will designate which flights they're going to get out. Which ones are they going to run? Which are the flights that they're absolutely essential you're going to get out? But there's no question. It's -- look, this is going to be everywhere. You're looking at a picture just there of the Capitol, but you're going to have national parks that'll be closed, or at least in, say, in many cases, close -- some cases, though they will be open if it's like the Washington Mall. Well, there'll be no toilets, there'll be no park rangers, there'll be no wardens, there'll be nothing like that. You're going to have Social Security checks could be delayed. You're going to have the entire panel be an infrastructure of the U.S. federal government literally going to a skeleton staff. And I have to say tonight, Lynda, that this is now more likely than not. The procedural gymnastics that would have to take place both in Senate and House to circumnavigate are too great. The only thing that would happen would be if the recalcitrant Republicans came on board, about 15 or 20 of them, but there's no evidence tonight that that's what they would do.",

Good to have you with us.Human created climate change is damaging the coral reefs off the coast of Cuba when our scientists believe they found a way to not only preserve the vulnerable environment but also improve the island's economy. CNN's Patrick Oppmann explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Porpoises swim off the coast of Cuba. The waters here may seem pristine, but like seemingly everywhere else, this Caribbean island nation is grappling with the threats from a rapidly changing climate. Now in the first research expedition of its kind, 24 Cuban scientists and crew circumnavigated the entire island to carry out what they say is the most comprehensive study ever done on climate change and the impact it's had on Cuba. Researchers dive from coral reef to coral reef and say what they have found is even more dire than they expected. \"We've seen a bleaching of corals, which is something that is worrying and that is massive.\" She says, \"The majority of coral is bleached and this is because of the high temperatures.\" The scientists say it's not too late to reverse the damage, but that we have to dramatically reduce human-caused pollution that is heating oceans to record levels, killing off coral reefs and filling the seas with microplastics. With this study, these scientists say they will be able to measure much more accurately how much harm is being inflicted on Cuba's unique natural environments. \"We are going to have a baseline,\" she says. \"We hope to identify the spots along the coast where the pollution is and how concentrated it is.\" For two months, the scientists carried out dozens of dives, taking hundreds of samples from the bottom of the ocean. Scientists are barely out of their wetsuits before running tests in their makeshift laboratory. They hope what they learn can change how resources on this island are used.",
