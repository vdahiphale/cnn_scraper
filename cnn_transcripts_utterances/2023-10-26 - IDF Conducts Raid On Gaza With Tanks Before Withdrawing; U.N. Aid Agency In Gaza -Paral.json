The IDF said this is part of preparations for the \"next stages of combat.\" The tanks fired artillery before eventually leaving the area. Let's take you to Sderot with CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. Nic, what more do we know about the raid and what's to come?",

She's a communications director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. It's been caring for some 600,000 people at its shelters in Gaza. Juliette, thank you so much for being with us. You said if you don't get fuel by tonight, you will be forced to halt operations altogether. What is the status? How are you managing that situation? JULIETTE TOUMA, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, UNITED NATIONS RELIEF &amp; WORKS AGENCY: We would be pushed to the very edge. We're being pushed to the brink. We had to start rationing the very little amounts of fuel. So, for example, today, we stopped the delivery of fuel to medical facilities and to bakeries that we support in the Gaza Strip. And we are running out. And we're still hopeful that an urgent shipment of fuel does come in, in Gaza, so we're not forced to make the decision that no humanitarian worker should do, and that's stop humanitarian services and assistance to people in need.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden says that, once again, the country is in mourning in the wake of this mass shooting that killed at least 18 people in Lewiston, Maine.Just behind me here at the White House, flags have been lowered to half-staff. In a statement a little while ago, the president said that this is a situation that should not become normal in the country, that action needs to, quote, \"address the epidemic of gun violence\" as White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre here addressed earlier in the briefing. President Biden last night was at the White House, hosting the Australian state dinner. He was actually pulled out of that dinner to receive a briefing after the shooting took place last night. He also spoke with the governor of Maine as well as the state's two Senators and congressman. And the president this morning was also briefed by his senior advisers. One thing that the president has stressed and the White House has stressed as well from the podium is that people in the area need to listen to local law enforcement officials as there is still that search underway for the suspect. But the president also used the statement as another attempt to renew calls for further action when it comes to gun safety in this country. The president has said he's exhausted many of the options available to him, via executive order. You'll remember there was some legislation passed after that horrific shooting in Uvalde, Texas. And the president did recently establish an office that is focused on gun violence prevention. In his statement today, the president once again renewed his calls for an assault weapons ban, a ban on high-capacity magazines and also calling for state storage laws for firearms and trying to end the immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. The president, in his statement saying, quote, \"This is the very least we owe every American who will now bear the scars, physical and mental, of this latest attack.\" As you heard Karine Jean-Pierre say it's the time for Congress to act. She specifically called on the new House speaker, Mike Johnson, to try to take some steps to address this issue of gun violence. But so far, there's been very little appetite on Capitol Hill for passing more meaningful reforms. So it remains to be seen what exact actions could be taken in the wake of yet another horrific mass shooting.",

And that is because, in this third quarter GDP report, we also saw that household income dropped a bit. So you're going to see less disposable income going into the fourth quarter.You're also going to be seeing people feeling their student loan payments again, and that started up. And also interest rates continuing to climb. People may start pulling back because of that. And, Boris, despite the fact that consumers are still spending, they're putting a lot of their purchases on credit cards. And that contributes to consumer debt. So, not as much of a rosier picture for the fourth quarter GDP report as we've been expecting -- Boris?",
