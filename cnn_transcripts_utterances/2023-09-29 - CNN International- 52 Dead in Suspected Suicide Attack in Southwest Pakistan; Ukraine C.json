      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead Pakistan has been hit by two suicide attacks, one in the south and one other in the north of the country. The death toll is rising as rescuers try to help the injured there.The clock is ticking, U.S. lawmakers are scrambling to find a deal with the U.S. government hurtling towards a shutdown this weekend. And high hopes, high risks for many migrants. The road to America starts much further away than Mexico. CNN follows one group as it heads north. Investigators in Pakistan are trying to find out who was behind the suspected suicide blasts that claimed at least 52 lives. It happened in the province of Balochistan during a religious procession the region has seen a decade's long insurgency by separatists. So far there's been no claim of responsibility for the explosion. Meanwhile, four people were killed in a double suicide attack at the mosque in northwestern Pakistan. Let's bring in CNN Sofia Saifi joining us from Islamabad and the target for one of the attacks is believed to have been a policeman.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, I mean at the moment there haven't been any more details. There's one police officer who said that there was a policeman who was targeted but generally the actual target of this attack was a religious procession. Today is a public holiday across Pakistan.It is the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad in the Islamic calendar. It's a day of processions of special prayers, people take out special religious processions across the country from morning to dusk. And it is at one of these processions in the south of the country where a suicide bomber detonated his explosives which is why we're seeing such a high death toll. We're also being told that there was another double suicide attack actually, in the north of Pakistan in Hangzhou, where a mosque was attacked and a lot of people apparently managed to flee. And there isn't a high death toll. But again, rescue and relief of efforts are still underway. And this has been a very deadly year for Pakistan in terms of militant attacks. There are many separatist groups that are operating within the country, along with many militant groups as well as Islamist groups. So you've got the Islamic State, which has previously claimed responsibility. The Pakistani Taliban who have been responsible with previous deadly attacks in the country have come out and said that they have nothing to do with both the attacks either in Mastung in the south of the country and either the mosque that was attacked in the north of the country. So again, there is a lot of investigation concerning who is behind the attack. That's usually a quick claim of responsibility. But that is not the case at the moment so, a day of mourning and distress across the country on what has been a public holiday and should have been a time of rejoicing, Max.",

Meanwhile, back in the U.S., House lawmakers overwhelmingly approved $300 million in new aid Ukraine after Republican leaders removed the funding for a defense spending bill.

Slovakia going to the polls on Saturday in an election that's causing concern in the West, the NATO country has been a staunch ally of Ukraine, but this could change if Former Prime Minister Robert Fico returns to power. His opposition party is leading in the polls and the Kremlin sympathizer, especially to stop supplying weapons to Kyiv.According to one survey, only 40 percent of Slovaks believe that Russia was responsible for the war in Ukraine and 50 percent believe the U.S. is a security threat. CNN's Scott McLean is tracking the story joins us now. I mean, this guy is been Prime Minister twice before to explain what's going on in the chaotic world of Slovakian politics.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Slovakia is a small country, but it's not unimportant. It's an EU member, it's a NATO member of borders, Ukraine, and it's been sending helicopters, howitzers, air defense systems, you name it to Ukraine, but as you said, maybe not for long.And it's all because of this man named Robert Fico. He is a known quantity, as you pointed out in this country. He's been Prime Minister twice before and he's also openly sympathetic to Moscow. He says that the reason that there's war is because Ukrainian Nazis and fascists in his words provoked Russia into war. And his view is that sending more weapons into Ukraine only prolongs this conflict. And so if he gets into office, he says he won't send any more now he wouldn't also send them to Moscow. He's sort of framing all of this as a Peace Initiative. And all of this looks pretty appealing to slow Slovaks, who right now, like much of Europe are going through a cost of living crisis. They have rising energy costs, inflation, and also the country has taken in 100,000, Ukrainian refugees, and a country of only 5.5 million, that's a lot. And so all of this taken together is sort of straining the public purse and making peace look pretty good right now. No matter how you have to get there. What I find especially fascinating, though, about Robert Fico is that he was actually forced out of office back in 2018, after the killing of a journalist and his fiancee who was investigating corruption linked to, you know, elites in the country, some with links to Fico's own party. How do you come back from that?",

On Friday, McCarthy will try to get a stopgap spending bill through Congress, though he likely lacks the votes in his own party to pass it. The House and Senate must both pass spending measures by Saturday to avoid a shutdown. Let's get to CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox for the latest.
