Israel says it launched a strike in Beirut Lebanon targeting a Hezbollah commander that it blames for a rocket attack on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children.This is new video of the aftermath of that attack. You can see rubble on the ground, debris there strewn across the street. We also have new video showing a cloud of smoke in the air, this as Lebanese state media is reporting that the attack was conducted by a drone that fired three missiles. Though the IDF has not provided details about exactly how this strike was conducted.",

Several people -- other people were injured. Now, we have yet to hear official comment from the Hezbollah. But we understand that from reports in Israel that the target was Fuad Shukr, his nom de guerre is al-Hajj Mohsin, who apparently runs some of the military operations of Hezbollah. Certainly, now, this was a strike, not necessarily unanticipated since Saturday Lebanon has barely been very much on edge. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that the response would be in his words severe. So far, this is the second strike on Beirut since the beginning of hostilities in October. Back in January, the second of January, a senior Hamas official was killed also in that part of Beirut. Now we've heard time and time again from Hezbollah, as it strikes on Beirut, particularly the southern suburbs, where many of Hezbollah leaders operate would represent a crossing of a red line. We don't know what kind of response is going to come from Hezbollah but certainly raised tensions. Now I'm hearing that, for instance, people are lining up outside petrol stations of fueling up in anticipation of far worse to come. We've seen over the last few days cancellations by airlines coming in to Beirut, advisories from various embassies for their nationals to leave Lebanon as quickly as possible. So, we'll just have to see at this point, Brianna, what sort of response Hezbollah will have to this strike this evening on Beirut.",

Jim, to you first on this. Israel was particularly quick to confirm, sometimes they haven't been but they did here.

But they're striking inside Beirut, which Hezbollah had said is a red line.Listen, in this region, folks are setting red lines all the time. And sometimes they're not. And it's hard to read what those red lines are. But from Hezbollah's perspective, this is striking very close to home here. And in the realm of options that Israel had, this one is certainly at the higher end, right? It's a direct shot at their home base in effect here, that's extremely risky in this environment. It is our understanding that they gave the U.S. a heads up here, they haven't always given the U.S. a heads up before the strike. That doesn't mean that the U.S. wanted this to happen. The U.S. read as I understand it has been that they do not expect this current back and forth to lead to a broader regional war. They don't believe the parties want it. But the trouble is, the U.S. cannot control the response of any of the parties or their reads of what is a step too far. And this is certainly pushing the envelope with Hezbollah, which is something that, as we've talked about many times, Netanyahu has not been shy to do, right? I mean, you had another decapitation operation inside Beirut prior. And you saw a reaction to that. So, this is a dicey time. This is not an insignificant attack. And now you're going to be looking at how Hezbollah responds. And I should note that, that Hezbollah has often said, if you strike Beirut, we'll strike Tel Aviv, you know whether they can pull that off given the defenses. But you have to imagine that in Hezbollah's range of reactions, there are significant options as well.",

That's not Israeli. These were not Israeli citizens, they had citizenship cards, but not citizenship. So, they had identity cards. And so, there had to be some sort of military response.The target seems to have been very carefully chosen. Now there are a lot of names that can be similar, but supposedly the target hit was Fuad Shukr, and there is a Fuad Shukr listed in the U.S. State Department Rewards for Justice Program with a bounty on his head of $5 million. He's listed as Hezbollah's highest adviser to Hassan Nasrallah. So, this could be a target that was chosen very carefully, knowing that, how can the White House criticize hitting someone that is high on their terrorist wanted list?",

You know, this is a president you've watched in the last 3-1/2 years, he believes in diplomacy, diplomatic solutions, especially as we're talking in this moment along the blue line, that that is true, as well. And so, and that will end these attacks if we have some diplomatic kind of solution from Hezbollah once and for all, and allow Israel and Lebanese citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes and live -- and live -- and live in safety. And that's what we want to see. So, we -- that's what we believe that there's a diplomatic solution here and that's what we're trying to get to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But many experts have pointed out that any solution without a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is likely not going to last. How critical are those two components to actually moving forward with a stable situation on the northern border of Israel with Lebanon? [14:20:20] LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, anytime you're talking about a conflict, Boris, you have to have some kind of political end state. In this case for Israel, the political end state is getting rid of Hamas, protecting their citizens from strikes from various terrorist organizations, getting their hostages back and finding a forward solution in Hamas -- or in Gaza, rather. So, all of those things are part of a potential political solution. And I know that's what the United States has been working harder in doing. When you're talking about the shift from a focus of attention on Hamas to Hezbollah. What I suggest today, we've been talking about this one strike in the southern boundaries of the city of Beirut. I'm looking at it from the standpoint of a military analysis of what was the time of the strike, it was early in the evening, you know, about 1900 or so hours. So, 7:00 in the evening. The target was a terrorist leader who had allegedly used his power under the shadows of the Beirut government to strike an area within Israel, the weapon system that Israel used tonight was a drone in a very precise attack. And the effects were the killing of that individual, according to what's been reported so far. The message that's being sent, though, I think, is critically important. Israel wants to maintain security for its citizens, there have been multiple strikes from southern Lebanon into Israeli territory, and in fact, probably more in the last few months from southern Lebanon than we've even seen in the last few months from Hamas out of Gaza. So, repeated rocket attacks, repeated attempts at killing civilians, all that which had been defended by the Israeli Defense Forces, the message being sent right now, I believe to Hezbollah is, first of all, we knew where that target was, we knew we had to come after him, because he was a terrorist who had struck inside of our country, the effects were we hit that target wherever he was going, it was it -- it was a pattern of life, if you will of that target that caused them to strike early in the evening, as opposed to 2:00 in the morning, like most kinetic strikes are done when there's less population in the area. So, all of those things tell me that Israel, at least now is attempting to prevent a future expansion of this conflict into Lebanon. And that's a good thing. So, is the -- is the expansion inevitable like so many people have been questioning? I believe that it is not. But it takes some very careful not only political messages, but also some military approaches. And I think today, if this was the only strike that Israel uses, they have sent the message, and it's a limited proportional response to the killing of Israeli citizens over the weekend.",

      "sentences": "Right. There has been this tit for tat as Kim says, since October 8th. You know, it's been a lower simmer compared to Gaza. But the nightmare scenario guys has been that one of these Hezbollah rockets would take out a large number of children. That's exactly what happened.This is a slightly different situation in that it hit kids playing on a soccer field in the occupied Golan Heights. These are -- this are a Druze community that in a large way rejects Israel and rejects Israeli citizenship. But of course, Israel sees this as a strike on Israeli territory. But officials I've spoken with do acknowledge that this was a mistake by Hezbollah. Nevertheless, this was a mistake that has now precipitated a response. Major questions, of course, whether this military commander as the IDF said they targeted was actually taken out, that remains to be seen, major questions about whether they will expand those strikes. I think Kim is probably right, this is what we're going to see I think it for now. There is furious diplomacy going on behind the scenes. So often we talk about the Gaza ceasefire deal. There's a parallel diplomatic track that is being led by Amos Hochstein out of the White House to try to broker not just peace on that northern Israeli border, but a way in which those tens of thousands of Israeli civilians can actually go home so that what they're looking for -- what the U.S. and Israel are hoping for is that Hezbollah would actually pull back from that southern border at least six miles or 10 kilometers. There are a lot of people who think American officials included that this is very much linked to a Gaza ceasefire deal to your point, Boris, that without the fighting stopping in Gaza, you're never going to have peace on the northern border. Israel sees those two things as separate. But of course, when you look at the damage that was done in downtown Beirut tonight, big questions about what comes next.",
