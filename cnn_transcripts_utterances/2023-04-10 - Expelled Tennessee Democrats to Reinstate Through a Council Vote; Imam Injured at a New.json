For instance, the people who sued in the Texas case, the doctors who sued and the medical associations who sued, I think there's a real legal question as to whether or not they have something called standing to walk into federal courthouse doors. I don't think that they proved that they have enough of an injury in order to be the plaintiffs, and that could provide the Supreme Court, again, with kind of a safety valve. The other thing for people to remember is that, yes, this is a very conservative court. But if this Texas ruling stands, it also means that a single judge can essentially undermine approval by the FDA for other drugs as well, and that's a precedent that even this court might not want to set.

GORMLEY-HEENANnew Belfast campus really is a perfect symbol of the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. And let me explain why that is. During the conflict, the central area of business, Belfast City Center, was effectively isolated and protected by security fencing, and the areas that surrounded the city center where largely left derelict and the neighborhoods were very physically separated from the city center. So, the relocation of our university campus right into the heart of the city center has dramatically altered this picture. We've brought 15,000 staff and students, which is the equivalent size of a small time, to work and study in the city center. The increased number of international students has really very visibly changed the face of Belfast, and most importantly of all, the erection of a landmark building that's constructed in both local stone and a million square feet of glass is a huge expression of the confidence in a city that has been infamous for destruction of lives and property and the sound of breaking glass. So, the visit really symbolically couldn't be more important for us as a demonstration of just how far we've come over the last 25 years.",

It's not an event. So, 25 years ago was a momentous occasion for us in terms of the peace process. It was the moment at which we decided as a -- as a place to work in a different way together. But as I say, it's a process and it's not an event. It's a marathon, and it's not a sprint. And most importantly, it's a relay race, and it's not a single person track event. So, over the period of time, since then, until now, the baton has had to be passed on to successive U.S. presidents who have retained that interest in Northern Ireland and on two successive leaders in Northern Ireland, who have taken us inch by inch further towards peace and prosperity, and a brighter future for everyone that that lives here. But I think the reason why it takes a length of time is really that there's no moment where people just suddenly change how they feel, how they think, how they perceive the future to be. It's certainly something that is built piece by piece and brick by brick, and that's what we've done in building our new campus in the city center.",

We have now seen that but the fact that they are now in a way normalizing these exercises and refining them and even increasing technical complexity in these exercises according to experts we talked to, that is really injecting a new element of instability, even potential danger, especially with Chinese assets, continuing to cross the medium line in the Taiwan strait, something both sides had observed for four decades until recently. That is where the potential miscalculation may come in, because as you just said, it's not just the Taiwanese, but also Americans and their allies sending their warships and warplanes to this region. And that, of course, could potentially lead to not just confrontation but even conflict between the superpower -- two superpowers of the world.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALLY GOODSIR, CURATOR OF DECORATIVE ARTS, ROYAL COLLECTION TRUST: The coach is huge. You might be able to tell that from how I'm standing beside it. It's nearly four meters tall. It's over seven meters long. It weighs four tons. Because of that, it can only be used at a walking pace, which really adds to the majesty and the stateliness of this great royal procession.

But after another fragile departure, we can only wonder how many more major tournaments he has in him.However, the age of 52, his greatest rival, Phil Mickelson has roared back into the spotlight. Who could ever have imagined that lefty, he was mired in controversy this time last year, and who didn't even play here at Augusta, could shoot a 65 to finish in a tie for second. It's the lowest round by a 50-something player ever at the Masters. And with three live golfers, finishing in the top six with Mickelson and Koepka contending for the green jacket, there is renewed focus on the strength and validity of the Saudi-backed rebel tour. Perhaps, it's not the golfing graveyard that some establishment figures had come to believe. We leave Augusta with more questions than answers, but this compelling tournament has only served to heighten the excitement for the rest of the golf season. Back to you.",
