Let's get right to CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House and Priscilla Alvarez in Wilmington, Delaware, just outside Campaign HQ, what they're calling Kamala HQ.Priscilla, Vice President Harris just arrived in Wilmington to meet with the staff there. You have new reporting about the mood. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake, there are certainly mixed emotions over the course of the day here at the campaign headquarters. Of course, there was a seismic shift for the campaign over the last 24 hours, and sources tell me there was a feeling of grief, of relief, and also excitement.And that is what you heard as soon as the Vice President walked into headquarters, was that cheering and applause. But Jake, if you also notice in those images, while there is new signage of Kamala for president, there is also still Biden-Harris signage. That's how quickly all of this happened, that they still haven't been able to replace everything, though they did also hang up the California state flag. And only moments before she walked into campaign headquarters, they also debuted a new website. Up until this point, the website was JoeBiden.com. It is now Kamalaharris.com. Now, of course, the campaign is celebrating a big fundraising haul over the last 24 hours, a whopping $81 million over the last 24 hours, the highest of any candidate in history, according to the campaign. This, of course, welcomed news after the campaign had been struggling with donors because of all of the questions circling around President Joe Biden's candidacy. Well, now they are seeing that money flow right back in. Now, the Vice President, before coming here, had been working the phones yesterday, 10 hours on the phones, talking to more than 100 Democratic officials while she was in Washington, D.C., essentially telling them that she wanted to earn the nomination and also earn their support. Now, Jake, I think it's also worth noting there's so much new here and there's so many questions as to how this campaign will take shape with her as the lead of the party's ticket. Well, the campaign manager has a long history with the vice president. She, Julia Chavez Rodriguez, had served as the state director when Kamala Harris was senator of California. And so there are already some relationships here that they will be leaning on and that allies of the vice president have pointed to as she starts to take this role on. And we'll also hear directly from the vice president here at campaign headquarters later this hour, where she will deliver remarks to staff. And that, too, will be a moment to get a sense of where her head is at and how she rallies the staffers who, over the last 24 hours, have just been through a really remarkable and pivotal moment in this campaign, a lot of them finding out with the rest of the American public when the president said he wasn't going to seek reelection. So all eyes on her remarks later this hour.",

And it's very clear that Harris is well on her way to securing the Democratic nomination. Those two leaders, Jeffries and Schumer, have made it very clear that they are almost certain going to endorse her imminently. It may not happen today, but they want to have a meeting with her first. They said that will happen probably in the next day, maybe a couple of days before they actually sit down and meet with her and then at that point issue their formal endorsement. But the Democratic Party is in a much different place than they were just a couple of days ago when this party was distraught, when Schumer and Jeffries themselves made the case to Joe Biden that there was widespread concern within their respective caucuses to Biden continuing on as a Democratic nominee. Now there is a much upbeat tone and there's a belief that this campaign could turn around and it's been going Donald Trump's way for so long. And that is a view among Democratic leaders themselves, as we expect an endorsement to come, maybe not today, but as soon as tomorrow, maybe the day after, Jake.",

And we've seen what's happened at the border and Republicans want tohammer that issue home, some of them criticizing her more liberal policies.

That led to what they believe to be a turnout gap in November. And they just don't know what this means in terms of actual enthusiasm. Are people going to rally around her? Is she going to be able to bring out different groups that President Joe Biden wasn't going to be able to bring out? Now, there is some confidence in the fact that one of the things that Donald Trump's team likes about it being Kamala Harris, rather than being somebody who's not part of the administration, is that they still believe that they can run on three issues, crime, immigration and inflation. And they believe that they can tie Kamala Harris to all of those policies because she is the vice president of the United States. So that gives them some hope in that way. But really, right now, it's not so much that they even know what this looks like exactly.
