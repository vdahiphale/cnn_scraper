I'm Christine Romans.We begin this morning with dramatic testimony expected today in a New York courtroom. E. Jean Carroll will take the stand in a civil case against Donald Trump. Carroll says the former president raped her in a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. She also accuses him of later defaming her in comments he made about that rape allegation. Now, Trump denies any wrongdoing. Our Randi Kaye has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) E. JEAN CARROLL, SUING DONALD TRUMP:  I proceeded into the dressing room. The minute he closed that door, I was banged up against the wall. RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Author and columnist, E. Jean Carroll, sharing her story of an alleged assault by Donald Trump. Carol now 79 is suing Trump for battery, stemming from the attack she says took place in late 1995 or early 1996 in a dressing room of the department store, Bergdorf Goodman in New York City. She is also suing him for defamation for comments Trump made about her last October. On his Truth Social platform last fall, Trump posted: It is a hoax and a lie, just like all the other hoaxes that have been played on me for the past seven years. And while I'm not supposed to say it, I will. This woman is not my type. He also posted: I don't know this woman. Have no idea who she is. She completely made up a story that I met her at the doors of this crowded New York City department store and within minutes, swooned her. In his October deposition for this case, Trump called Carroll a nut job. Carroll filed what is now her second lawsuit against Trump last November, after a new law called the Adult Survivors Act was passed in New York. That law allows adults alleging sexual assault to bring claims years after the attack. Carroll claims Trump forced her up against a dressing room wall, pinned her in place with his shoulder and raped her.",

He also had for many, many months said that he wouldn't concede, right, at the time. So the authorities are closing in, and one particular post of fake news that he shared on his social media, and that was a few days after the January 8 attacks, that was on January 10th, where he called again into question the integrity of voting machines and the results of the elections. Now, that doesn't mean that this is the only thing they're looking at. We understand that there is a full picture that authorities are trying to draw, to see if there are further steps to be taken. He's now being looked at as someone who is one of the instigators -- alleged instigators of the January 8 attacks. Of course, him being out of the country, Christine, it's hard to put a very clear action based here. But he is in this investigation, along with 1300 other people that were arrested and then released but will be coming in little by little to the Supreme Court in Brasilia to have their cases heard on whether or not they were part of those rights that put a mark on Brazilian democracy -- Christine.",

First, the RNC put out a video that they said was AI generated that hit him on a number of issues, after him on the border, talked about inflation, crime rates, essentially said that if Joe Biden won presidency in 2024, that the financial institutions will completely fall apart. We also saw Republicans hitting Biden on a number of other issues that included crime waves. Again, inflation several different buckets that weren't not similar to what we saw in 2022. That playbook strategy there, but again, in order for a firm plan to come together, they're going to actually have to have a nominee, and that process is looking more and more messy by the day. Right now, those Republicans are focused on hitting each other, and we even heard from former President Trump today who suggested that he might not participate in the primary debates.

And I think, because Joe Biden is so old and Republicans are expected to make her a centerpiece of the campaign, essentially by reelecting Joe Biden, you are there is a significant chance you're making Kamala Harris president.I think the White House finally realizes that they need to get her numbers up in order for the ticket to be successful because at the moment, she's a drag on the ticket.
