      "sentences": "Florida's top doctor, the state's Surgeon General, is calling on health professionals to stop using mRNA COVID vaccines. In a letter to the FDA, Dr. Joseph Ladapo raised concerns about Pfizer and Moderna shots, citing debunked claims, one in particular, that contaminants in them can integrate into DNA, causing healthy cells to become cancerous. Again, these claims are bunk. They've been debunked.The FDA responded by saying it is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the vaccines, rebuking Ladapo's claims as implausible and also misleading. Let's talk about it now with Dr. Paul Offit. He is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's also a member of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, and he's the author of the soon-to-be-released book, \"Tell Me When It's Over,\" an insider's guide to deciphering COVID myths and navigating our post- pandemic world. Clearly the person to talk with us about this. Dr. Offit, what do you think about what he's saying here? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA: Well, it's nonsense. What he's arguing is that these small quantities of fragmented DNA, and by small I mean nanogram levels, which is billionths of a gram, which is contained actually in many biological products, are able to enter our nucleus, integrate itself into DNA, and cause things like cancers and autoimmune diseases. That's impossible, and here's why. If you think about a cell as like a sunny-side-up egg, and the white part is the cytoplasm, and then the nucleus is the yolk, if these fragmented DNAs get into your cytoplasm, they would be instantly eliminated, because our cytoplasm hates foreign DNA. Even if it got past that, entered the nucleus, which is impossible because it doesn't have a nuclear access signal, and then gets into the nucleus, it would have to integrate into DNA, which means it would have to cut DNA, and then use enzymes like integrase to do that. None of that is contained in these fragments, so it's just nonsense. Let's also remember, assuming you live on this planet, and you eat any food that's made from animal or plants on this planet, you're always ingesting foreign DNA, which can enter your circulation. And so, the notion that that hurts you just shows how much, I think, this particular foreign surgeon general doesn't understand how constantly we're exposed to small fragmented pieces of DNA. We have trillions of bacteria that live on the surface of our body that have foreign DNA, so it's just nonsense.",

But consistently, he has been on the wrong side of issues relating to masks and vaccines and has been a purveyor of COVID vaccine myths.I don't know why he does that. This seems to be more sort of a phenomenon of the right than the left, and, you know, as they say, when you mix politics with science, you get politics, and I think that's what's happened here.",

Meaning we're going to do the things that we think are best for Floridians while ignoring or at least pushing back on things that come out of Washington or things that come out of Atlanta through the CDC. It's this sort of we're not going to be pushed around by institutions in the government, and I think that's sort of his platform, and I think Dr. Ladapo sort of fits into that.But it's a shame because I think what he's done is he's made science political, and I think Floridians will suffer that. You know, the notion, as he said previously, that ironically, he said, well, so don't use mRNA vaccines. Well, so if you're not going to use mRNA vaccines, the only other licensed vaccine in this country is Novavax, which is also made using cells at some point and also likely contains small fragments of DNA. So it just shows, I think, his utter lack of understanding of how this process works.",

As for his engagement in insurrection, we saw that play out on national television, and the news that's come out, and the revelations from the January 6th committee report and in the Colorado trial only add to what Americans were able to see with their own eyes. Where he invited a violent armed crowd to Washington, D.C., told them to be wild, and then sent them to the Capitol, where they nearly assassinated the vice president and for the first time in our nation's history, disrupted the peaceful transfer of power.",

PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR AUTO WRITER: Well, actually, Hyundai and Kia, both of them are doing everything they can, I think, to try to get people on top of this. They're putting out -- giving people steering wheel locks, doing software updates. They have new software that should make the vehicles harder to steal. They're trying to get people to come into dealers. They're even working with outside agencies to distribute some of these simpler devices like steering wheel locks to owners of these older Hyundai models that are particularly vulnerable to being stolen using a USB cord like that one.",
