He was there for a private visit with the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and we're told that the meeting lasted for about one hour and covered a range of topics, including artificial intelligence. Former Trump advisor Peter Navarro must report to a federal prison in Miami today after the Supreme Court rejected his request for a last- minute reprieve. Navarro is set to become the first former White House official ever jailed for contempt of Congress. And these are the images of a volcanic eruption in Iceland that began this weekend. Officials say the fissure is about two miles long. The towns in Iceland were evacuated just after the eruption was first detected, two of them. Authorities set up barriers to direct the flow of lava.

CNN's Ed Lavandera has that story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. Supreme Court has once again decided to continue blocking, at least temporarily, the controversial Texas law known as Senate Bill 4. SB 4, as it's also known, gives local law enforcement officers the ability to arrest people they suspect entered Texas illegally. And it also gives judges here in the state the ability to deport people to Mexico who have entered the country illegally. This law has been tied up in the court since it was signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott back in December. Critics say that it creates a nightmare scenario for immigration law here, not only here in Texas, but across the country. Those critics say that enforcing federal immigration law is the sole duty of the federal law enforcement agencies in the country, should not be left up to the states. Texas officials, meanwhile, also argue that it has the sovereign right to defend itself from what it has described as an invasion of drugs and migrants into the state over the last few years. So these are the forces playing out as these legal arguments are being hashed out in court. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court essentially ruled that it will continue blocking this Texas law from going into effect while it continues to deliberate the merits of the arguments on both sides. Incidentally, there's also another court hearing expected in early April in the lower court where both sides are expected to hash out their arguments in this ongoing lawsuit over Senate Bill 4 here in Texas.

And two, because wages are also finally going up.So right now, the rate of inflation for core consumer prices in Japan that includes everything besides food and fuel is hovering at about two percent, that healthy number you want to see to indicate that the economy is growing in the right direction.

Now, this is a historic moment for Japanese workers in the country because they haven't seen their wages grow in the same way that they've seen in other OECD countries like the United States, the U.K., Germany, for example. It's seen a lot of stagnated growth. So for these two key components to be met, it encouraged the Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda to finally end negative interest rates, which will now set the economic agenda for the months to come. Now, it still remains to be seen what exactly will happen with the yen. Some experts I spoke to said that we could potentially see a stronger yen riding on the back of higher inflation rates. But we saw today the yen actually fell. So it does again remain to be seen. But if we do see a stronger yen in the coming months, not immediately, but in the coming months, it would mean that input prices go down for Japan. And Japan is a very resourceful country. It imports more than 90 percent of its fuel, of its energy, about 60 percent of its food. So if this yen does get higher, if it gets stronger and import prices do go down, it means the cost of living for people in Japan will go down. Of course, it does mean for tourists visiting the country, Bianca and Max, it could mean that their vacation is slightly more expensive, but probably still within an affordable price range.",
