But those orders or those recommendations by the Israeli military have been very hard for Palestinian civilians to follow.The evacuation routes have been very dangerous. Sometimes they have been struck by the Israeli Air Force. And in addition to that, people don't have the resources sometimes to flee. But now as the humanitarian situation is worsening very rapidly in northern Gaza, 10s of 1000s of these civilians are taking advantage, 50,000 people yesterday 80,000 people today, as we were watching in northern Gaza, as food, water and medicine is becoming increasingly scarce.

And I would argue, this make -- is in Israel's best interest. They're going to need to keep American support and world support to go after the Hamas leaders, the terrorist who created the atrocities on October 7.But it's also important in terms of not opening up a second front on this war. I have been concerned, I contacted with a number of senators, the administration and they have put pressure, I think, finally on the Israeli government to try to stop some of the settler violence in the West Bank against Palestinians. Because if the West Bank security services, the Palestinian security services, all quit, that would create the possibility of a huge conflict on the West Bank.

But these folks who are working in and around Mar-a-Lago are the eyes and ears of the resort and they could provide the public and the jury with new insight into the environment at the club, and just how vulnerable our nation's secrets were during this time.Now let's look at some of the testimony they may be able to provide. Let's take the woodworker. We've learned that this individual was installing crown molding in Trump's bedroom in February 2022 and saw some papers. Now we don't know if they were in fact classified documents. But we know he's been interviewed by federal investigators multiple times. And we've also learned from our sources that Trump was increasingly frustrated as investigators got deeper and deeper into Mar-a-Lago. We're told that when he found out that the maid who cleans his bedroom was speaking with investigators, he, quote, \"went ballistic.\" Now, the other thing about witnesses like this is these are real people, these are not political actors, these are not politicians, they're really going to resonate with a jury if they are called to testify. Now, of course, in order for them to be called to testify, there has to be a trial. And right now the trial is scheduled for May 2024.
