So this is the case that's existed for a year in federal court in Washington, DC, and was on hold as the Supreme Court looked at questions of presidential immunity. They said that Trump couldn't be prosecuted or taken to trial on things he was doing while he was president officially after the election, while he was still serving, even on January 6th.And so the Justice Department has now responded by going to the federal grand jury in Washington and cutting down the charges against him. They've cut out things like what Donald Trump was saying to the Justice Department and officials there about spreading allegations of election fraud across the country. And instead, they are making the focus be about Donald Trump and what he was told by his campaign and what he was telling private advisors of his to do to try and spread this idea of election fraud, especially in battleground states, and to block Congress from certifying his loss of the election. One of the things, though, that is very important going forward in the coming days, we're going to see a lot of discussion about this is the role of Mike Pence as the vice president. Pence is still in this charging document against Donald Trump, the rewritten pared down version. And Pence is very likely to be a witness both in the coming weeks, in upcoming proceedings that have yet to be scheduled. And then if the Justice Department is allowed to bring him in as a trial witness before a jury, that's because the Justice Department now says Mike Pence was not always just in the executive branch under the Constitution. He was working for the Congress or he was presiding over Congress as president of the Senate on January 6th. And that's how Trump was trying to pressure him to block the election result.

We have been seeing for months that there have been these limited operations by the Israeli military into the occupied West Bank. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed over recent months since October 7th of last year.But this is definitely something more significant that we are seeing. Now, we did hear from the governor of Jenin that he said just after midnight. So in the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli military surrounded the refugee camp and Jenin itself. He says that he can still hear gunfire ongoing in the area. So it is believed this operation is still going. And he says a third of the city is without electricity at this point. Now, as you say, we know that nine Palestinians have been killed. [04:20:00] We hear from the Red Crescent Society, from the Ministry of Health, that those deaths happened from airstrikes, also from strikes on the ground. We hear drones are in the air as well. And when it comes to the Israeli response, so far, we understand there are hundreds, at least hundreds of personnel involved. We've been told that there are four battalions of the border police alone, including undercover border police. And that doesn't include the military and the intelligence element. So this is a large operation. Now, one thing I wanted to mention was a tweet we had from the Israeli foreign minister, which was interesting. He gave a reason for this operation, saying that it was to thwart what he called Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure, saying that Iran is funding and arming terrorists in the West Bank as trying to create a situation similar to Gaza and Lebanon. And he said, quote: We must address this threat, just like we're handling terror infrastructure in Gaza, including temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and any step necessary. This is a war like any other, and we must win it. Now, that is significant. The fact that he's suggesting there could be evacuations in the occupied West Bank, just as there are and have been in Gaza, putting really a connection between those two areas and the potential Israeli reaction to those areas. Now, we've also heard from the Ministry of Health in the West Bank that at least two hospitals have been blocked by the Israeli military, saying that there have been mounds of dirt, for example, pushed towards those areas. We have seen and obtained video that would back up some of those claims. We've seen some very heavy Israeli military assets in those areas, bulldozers, for example, pushing up infrastructure and pavements and roads in those areas. And we are still getting information and video coming in, showing the extent of this operation. But what we're hearing from the Israeli side is that they are trying to end the Iranian terrorist infrastructure, as they put it, in this area. From the Palestinian side and certainly from those in Jenin, one of the key areas that has been targeted, certainly from the governor, they are concerned about access to hospitals, about hundreds within those hospitals itself, given that they're claiming that Israel has restricted all access there. We heard from the Red Crescent Society as well, saying that their maneuvering of ambulances has been heavily restricted by the Israeli military as well -- Max, Christina.",

Now, if that were to be replicated in the West Bank, it would be very significant, very devastating. When you're talking about these refugee camps in Nur Shams, for example, in Jenin, they are densely populated, a very similar situation to what we see in Gaza, where it would be difficult for them to be evacuated. And of course, there would be a concern if this operation were to be significantly increased by the Israelis, that there would be civilian casualties within that as well.

He himself doesn't believe that he is back alive. He told me when I saw him that my wish was to see you and say hello to you and then I can die. ROBERTSON (voice-over): His younger brother telling me al-Qadi and the families road back to full recovery could be a long one. ABU MOHAMMAD AL-QADI (through translator): It is impossible to erase the memories that he saw there. I personally will not go back to who I was before. I am completely changed. ROBERTSON (voice-over): As they await al-Qadi's return, they pray. Grateful, they say, no blood was spilt in his rescue, that the war and the suffering may end and all the hostages come home.
