Overnight, Iran denied any involvement or responsibility for this attack, according to Iran's state news agency, and it really speaks to one of the challenges facing President Biden going forward, as he and his team have really tried to sought to prevent this conflict from widening into an even broader conflict in the Middle East. Now, while more than 100 -- while U.S. and coalition forces have been attacked more than 150 times since the October 7th attack, this is the first incident that marked and included the deaths of U.S. service members, which is really raising the stakes for President Biden as he is charting the course of action as he is vowing to respond.",

I think what you should present is a range of options that begin with striking Iranian targets outside Iran and now escalating up a ladder toward targets within Iran.And my view at this point, the starting point is attacking IRGC, that's the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel and sites in Iraq and Syria. And I would start there, because I do think this demands a really tough response directly targeted at Iran, which is supporting, inspiring, funding all of these attacks throughout the region. As your reporter said, there have been over 150 attacks against U.S. forces, and we've only responded fewer than ten times. So, regrettably, this incident was inevitable.",

Tehran is funding, supporting, supplying arms, training all these elements. So, you have to go back to where this is all coming from. It's Tehran. And we've reached a point that it's now we have to attack them directly. And, frankly, I think that our response over the last few months has not been sufficient, and I've said that several times.",

The IRGC is the actually Iranian force that supplies, trains, helps plan these attacks. I would start them. I would target their personnel and their sites in Iraq and Syria. I'd hit them fairly hard, and I'd see how that works. If the attacks continue, then I'd work my way up those options and eventually work your way into striking targets within Iran.At the same time, though, I think you have to balance that with diplomacy. You have to begin getting your allies on board in the region to include the Europeans and the Arab states, because, look, everybody is going to watch very closely what we're doing, and they're going to see whether the United States will respond forcefully. This affects not just the U.S.-Iran relationship, but how the Arab states view it, how other countries in the region view this, because they know, look, Iran has been sponsoring this bad behavior in the region for four-plus decades.",

We need to be prepared. We need to get our allies on board, et cetera.But I do think it's possible to do that. Iran doesn't want a regional war either. But we have to take it to them, because otherwise -- look, the proxy militia groups don't care. They're not deterred in the sense that they like this conflict. It was notable that the Islamic resistance in Iraq quickly took credit for these attacks. But Iran likes to keep it at arm's length, and so they don't want a broader war. So, that's why I think at this point, starting with the IRGC in Iraq and Syria, and then working your way up that escalation ladder to include targets in Iran, if necessary, I think that's the way we need to go.",

Donald Trump's economy, lost jobs, was just tax cuts for the very wealthy.

Let me just read you some of the reasoning why, Congressman. The Reverend Frederick Haynes says, what they're witnessing from the administration in Gaza is a glaring contradiction to what we thought the president and his administration was about. Reverend Cynthia Hale from Georgia says, we see them, Palestinian civilians in Gaza, as part of us. They are oppressed people. We are oppressed people.
