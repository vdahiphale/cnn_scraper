These returns would expose information Trump has worked to keep secret for years, despite the fact that sharing this information is something major presidential candidates had done before him for decades. Remember this?

It is going to be a critical meeting. They will come out of the executive session and finally vote on what decision they want to make. There's a lot we could learn still, Ana, about the former president's tax returns. Despite the fact that there was so much reporting back in 2020 from \"The New York Times\" about what they found in his tax returns, there are still a lot of questions that Democrats have.

That was one of the takeaways from that report. The other big takeaway was that there were many years in the decades of tax returns that they analyzed that the former president did not pay any federal income tax.

County and local officials are saying that they're focused on building shelter space, which includes possible warehouses and unused school buildings to house the influx of migrants that could be coming here through the El Paso area, as well as building up obviously the food and medical systems that would be needed to support all of that. So, that's really their main concern. But, Ana, today, we're also seeing where the politics of border security is really taking over. This morning in the early morning hours before sunrise, Texas National Guard soldiers in the area where migrants have been crossing in the last week put up nearly a mile-long fence covered in razor wire. This is really much to the consternation of local officials, who are extremely frustrated that this is, by the admission of the Texas Military Department, not done in coordination with Border Patrol agents, as well as local officials. One county judge, the county judge here in El Paso says that this is not their responsibility. And it wasn't really the expectation that city and county officials here had when they declared a state of emergency and some 400 National Guard members were brought in. This is not the kind of support that they were expecting. They thought they were going to get more help with the housing and food and transportation kind of concerns that many officials here in El Paso have.

RON VITIELLO, FORMER ACTING U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT DIRECTOR:  Well, the Border Patrol, my former colleagues in DHS, they're up against it, right? We're seeing the largest surge on the Southwest border that's ever occurred in the history of that border. Between 6,000 and 8,000 people are coming across the border every 24 hours. And now, with the ending of Title 42, you're going to see upwards of -- they're talking with numbers above 14,000 in 24 hours. The system is already overwhelmed. All of the facilities, the workstations, the workflow, the Border Patrol has been up against it for the last two years. We have never seen anything like this. And Title 42, it was always going to sunset. It was always based on conditions as it relates to COVID. But what it's doing now, it's sort of a stopgap that they can expel people quickly. They can handle that process in less than a half-hour. Once they have to enroll everybody into immigration docket, that's going to take up to three hours, and so add to the increasing overburdened Border Patrol now. You're going to have more traffic.

These are the toughest of the criminal cases facing Trump, the Mar-a-Lago documents case, the Georgia DA's criminal case for the alleged election denial. Those are easier cases. So, DOJ can use a little bit of a lift from the committee, and the committee is giving them one.",

The referrals, as Norm said, they're not legally binding.But this actual underlying evidence, the words that people said to the committee, that's what the Justice Department really wants. I'm going to be looking, as we get the transcripts, for anything more we can glean from some of these very high-profile witnesses. Cassidy Hutchinson, who was, of course, a top aide to Mark Meadows, Tony Ornato, who was a White House aide, those both come to mind, but also more information about what the committee sort of alluded to as potential obstruction, maybe potential witness tampering when it came to their investigation. If there is evidence of that, if DOJ does see evidence of that, either in the committee's report or in the transcripts that follow, that is the kind of thing the Justice Department will prosecute. And we saw that when it came to Roger Stone lying to Congress a couple years ago. The committee set out at that time why they felt Roger Stone had lied, the evidence for that, and the Justice Department did prosecute in that case.",
