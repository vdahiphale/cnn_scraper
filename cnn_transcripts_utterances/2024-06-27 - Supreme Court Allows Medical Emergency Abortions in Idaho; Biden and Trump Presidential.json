It's still going to be a lot of confusion in other states, particularly in Texas, where the Biden administration has asked the Supreme Court to look at their abortion ban. And so, we are potentially going to see this come back. But what a lot of folks have been pointing out today is that on both of the abortion cases before the court this term, mifepristone, the abortion pill, they dismissed that based on standing. They didn't consider the merits of that case. Now, with this emergency abortion case, sending it back down to the lower courts. So, there is a thought that this pushes this off until after the election, potentially when, depending on who wins, this could come back in myriad ways, either through the courts or through other methods. And so, this doesn't really settle any of these cases about abortion through the courts. This just sort of says that the courts aren't going to really issue decisions on the merits right now. Guys.",

And just to sort of preview what we're still looking for, there's a few biggies.There's, first of all, immunity. Of course, we've been talking about it. Does the president -- does a former president have any form of criminal immunity? That's, I think, the big one. There's another January 6th related case that's really important. Donald Trump's not a party to this one, but it could impact him. It's a case involving a guy named Joseph Fisher. He stormed the Capitol. He was charged with various crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding. He's now challenging whether you can apply that law, obstruction of an official proceeding, to a physical effort to interfere with Congress or a court. You would think it would, but there's a sort of nuanced way you can read the law to say that it does not apply. I think it's quite likely the Supreme Court actually says that obstruction law does not apply to the physical assault on the Capitol, which will have implications for over 300 January 6th related cases and potentially implications for Donald Trump's case because two of the four charges against him are that obstruction charge. So, those are the two biggies that we're looking for.",

Now, the biggest case is still outstanding, but I want to review, over the past few weeks here they won a big gun, trying to keep guns from folks who have either a conviction or a citation for domestic violence. Also, social media case yesterday, they won the fact that they can continue to flag for social media companies, disinformation or misinformation. In Idaho, the Biden administration also winning. And in that Purdue Pharma case, they also won their argument that the Sackler family should not be protected from future liability.But I want to caution that a lot of these victories are temporary because in abortion, right, they kind of sidestep the issue. They decided it for now in Idaho, but we fully expect that issue will come back up. Same with social media. They also sort of sidestep that issue. Yes, technically, the Biden administration won. They can continue, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI can continue to flag misinformation, disinformation, but that was mostly a standing issue. So, I would expect that that's going to come back up. And then, the gun rights case is interesting because there were so many concurrences. Everybody wanted to put their spin that you've really opened the flood gates for additional litigation. So, even though the Biden administration does appear to be doing really well before the court, many of these victories appear to be temporary and these cases are going to emerge likely in a different form in a year or two.",

We saw in the EPA case earlier sort of restricting the power of the Environmental Protection Agency, also restricting some power from the SEC.So, we expect that that big so-called Chevron case will probably be the last case they release because of its enormous impact. With the Trump immunity case, that's going to be one big one for the ages. Certainly, it will have an impact on future presidents, at least one former president. But this other case about federal power, this could really change the face of American government. And we're already seeing clues that they're already trying to restrict government power and it is widely expected that they might decide that way there, which would basically take a lot of the power from federal agencies and turn it over to the courts, which of course, make courts even more important in American life.

Dr. Pernell, your reaction to this abortion decision in Idaho. Is this a kick the can kind of moment for the court? DR. CHRIS T. PERNELL, REGENT AT LARGE, COLLEGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND DIRECTOR, NAACP CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY:  It most certainly is a kick the can kind of moment. While a technical win, this is not a victory for reproductive justice, and it's not a victory for health equity. Why? Because it does not change. It doesn't change the fact that there are maternity care deserts in Idaho and 36 percent of counties across the United States. So, what that means is that women's health continues to be imperiled. It means that the federal law is imperiled. And as long as that is true, the stats that we know that one in four Native American babies are born under these types of conditions where there is a lack of appropriate care. One in six black babies are born under these conditions where there isn't a lack of appropriate care. The Supreme Court missed an opportunity.

Now, this is one thing that certainly will be a conversation of the abortion rights conversation, it was not nearly as overwhelming of a topic in the debates four years ago. Just one example, of course, immigration has changed. Inflation also has changed. So, look for President Biden to try and draw this contrast with Former President Donald Trump.

This is more in keeping in their rhetoric over the past several months, painting Joe Biden as this weak and feeble candidate. However, they're trying to use these ads to do that criticism for him, even though tonight they're trying to raise those expectations and raise the bar for how they think Biden will perform. Jim.",

All right. Alayna, thanks.And let me go to Kayla Tausche. She's following President Biden. Kayla, how are the Biden folks going to handle this and respond to this tonight, do you think?",
