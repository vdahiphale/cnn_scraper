Five fires are burning across Los Angeles County. One of them is now the most destructive LA has ever seen.While firefighting and rescues are underway, President-Elect Donald Trump takes aim at California's Governor, saying he is to blame. Also happening, these are live pictures from Washington, D.C., where the funeral for Jimmy Carter, the 39th U.S. President begins in less than an hour. The scenes of devastation seem to go on and on as another day of red flag wind warnings fuels wildfires across Los Angeles County. Five major wildfires are currently burning the two largest blazes still at 0 percent containment. The latest fire broke out in the Hollywood Hills late yesterday, now putting some of Los Angeles's most famed landmarks in harm's way. So far, at least five people have lost their lives in these fires. Here's where the fires are burning at the moment. Los Angeles public schools are closed today, and shell-shocked residents are trying to come to terms with the immense damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)NICK WATT, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Everybody knew this was going to be bad with the Santa Ana winds, with the drought we've had for so long, no real rain since the spring, when those winds were forecast, we knew it was going to be bad. Everyone got ready, but they were prepared for maybe one or two fires, as you say now, they were like six fires. How do you prioritize? How do you fight those flames? It is terrible. Thankfully, the wind, as I say, is dropping, but it's not over. We -- you know the Santa Ana winds are going to pick up again in a couple of days, and just the devastation. And just as I say -- you know when you've got fires like this that are just -- they're just having to leave them to burn, that's going to set something else on fire. It's a chain reaction. I have never seen anything like downtown Palisades. After I finish speaking to you, I'm probably going to go. I've got texts from more friends to check on their house over here. Before I even go to check on their house I know it's not going to be there because I've driven past that area and there's nothing left. I'm going to go to my house. I'm going to hose the whole thing down, just hoping that if everything is wet, if an ember lands on it, it won't Ignite. And then I think I'm going to go with my family up to West Hollywood, although now we're hearing more fires up there. So, let's see. Yeah, it's extraordinary to cover something like this in your own community. I've been covering fires for a long time. You have sympathy for people now I have empathy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's the major difference between fighting these fires this morning compared to 24 hours ago, when the winds were so strong they were not able to fly these very effective firefighting tools in the sky because the winds were too strong and too erratic.So that's some promising news, but the danger is by far, by far over. We have calmer winds than 24 hours ago right now, but things will change going forward. So, I want to show you this map. This is the current, well, more or less the forecast wind conditions within the next hour or so. But as I advance this through the course of the morning and into the early afternoon notice a lot of orange and red being replaced into the hardest hit areas of Western LA County, into Ventura County. Winds anticipated to pick up out of the Northeast. [08:15:00] That's an offshore component that is a drying wind that is the Santa Ana wind, that can funnel down these valleys and canyons to the hardest impacted areas. We have to look to Friday before we start to see words like calm appear on this forecast wind graphic. That's what we want to see. The firefighters need that desperately. I want to show you just a quick map of the five active fires that we are currently monitoring, the largest of which is the Palisades fire burning over 17,000 acres. The burned area indicated with the shading of red. There's the famed Santa Monica Pier and Beach. And notice this burn area encroaching on such a heavily populated, very densely packed area of Western LA County. Now let's hop over to the Eaton fire. This is another one of the major fires that we're monitoring. There is some containment with this, but it is still encroaching on such a large number of structures, that is why we are seeing the videos and the social media elements that are popping up on our phones and on our TV screens as well. It is bone dry in Southern California, the driest start to a calendar year, or to a wet year, which begins in October that we've ever seen in Southern California that's saying something. Critical fire danger today elevated tomorrow, and then we think about the smoke that these wildfires are producing, toxic, toxic, toxic smoke that is really just descended on the Greater Los Angeles region. In fact, Pasadena has had some of the most dangerous, most hazardous air quality in the entire planet at one stage, just a level six out of six in terms of the air quality alert index. You can see the current indices there across Los Angeles County. And then as we go forward in time, as the winds relax, we'll still have the smoldering embers on the ground that produces additional smoke, and eventually that will drift right back into Southern California, impacting Los Angeles and the surrounding communities. This is going to be a difficult long haul through the course of the weekend, as we try to contain the fires, but also deal with the quality of the air within this area.",

And as you noted that they've had a decades long friendship. Biden himself likes to talk a lot about how he was a young U.S. Senator. And he was the first sitting senator to endorse Carter in his long shot bid to take the White House in 1976. So, this is a decades long friendship that will certainly be on full display when he delivers his eulogy later this morning. Also, we will be hearing from Ted Mondale, who is the son of Walter Mondale, Carter's Former Vice President, of course, who passed away. He had written a eulogy to deliver when Carter passed away. So, we'll be hearing from that that's certainly notable. Also, Steve Ford, the grandson of President Gerald Ford, who, of course, died in 2006 also wrote a eulogy so notable that we'll be hearing from two other close confidants and friends. Of course, Carter went on to defeat Ford. So that notable. Also in attendance, as you noted that there will be the gathering of the President's Club, all five sitting U.S. President, all five presidents, former presidents, will be gathering today, including incoming President Trump. So that certainly will be interesting to watch the dynamics as they pay their respects to Jimmy Carter. After today's services at the Cathedral, his body will be flown to Georgia. He will be having a private ceremony, private funeral at the Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, that's where he taught Sunday school. So certainly, a poignant moment there, and he'll be laid to rest and buried in a plot next to his wife at the family home, Fred.",

In the era of Watergate, post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, when Americans were tired, divided and a bit angry, this was a breath of fresh air.And in some ways, his passing comes at an equally contentious time. And so, I think it will be solemn, but it's also a good moment where we reflect on the commonality and on a person who really whether people liked him or disliked him, most agree he devoted himself to the nation.

It was just such as -- it's kind of a guttural pain and disbelief and shock and fear as I was approaching my property and not seeing the house. But anyway, yes, it was early in the morning, and I was asleep, and I was woken up at five because they were covering. I saw in the news that they were covering there the reporters were on our block showing the houses around my neighborhood burning. And I recognize these houses, these are my neighbors. And I couldn't see from this camera angles, whether my house was spared or what it wasn't, and look and so I just couldn't take it anymore, pretty much. And I just -- I got in the car and weaved my way up into the neighborhood. And it was still obviously, as maybe you could see from that video, just houses were burning all around, and it was tons of smoke, and roads were closed, but I made it up. I made it up to my street, and then when it kind of came into our stretch of the houses, it was just totally decimated, like there was many, as you saw in the video, houses and then fires and houses and fires, but our street, in particular our block, I should say, was pretty much nothing left. It looked like in many cases, there was no houses ever built there. It was just decimated to nothing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
