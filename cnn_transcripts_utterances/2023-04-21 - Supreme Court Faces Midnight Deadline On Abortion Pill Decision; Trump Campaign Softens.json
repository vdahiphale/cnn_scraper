So what they could do is just grant that request first day, and nothing changes, while the merits of this controversy play out in a lower Regional Court, the Fifth Circuit, which is scheduled a hearing for May 17. And then as it plays out with -- at the U.S. Supreme Court, on the actual, as I say, merits of the controversy. Or they could deny it, and these restrictions that will mention would immediately go into effect.That's -- that goes to the availability of the drug. Would women be able to get it as they can now at 10 weeks of pregnancy? Or would that be rolled back to seven weeks of pregnancy? Would they be able to get it by mail after consulting with medical personnel physician or others, and then be able to get it by mail rather than pick it up in person, which is another thing that would go into play if things were rolled back? Or they could, you know, what's before us now or, you know, kind of a hybrid of what the Fifth Circuit Regional Court did with the original judge's orders. The original judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas had negated all of the FDA authorization back to the year 2000.
