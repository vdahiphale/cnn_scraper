Security Council is finally expected to vote on a resolution on Gaza and the U.S. does appear at this point in time to be ready to support it. That resolution calls for an increase in desperately needed humanitarian aid. And the normally quiet city of Prague is waking up in mourning today after a deadly and rare shooting that left 14 people dead. We'll have new details for you from the police just ahead. And with so many humanitarian crises around the world, we're going to be speaking with the International Rescue Committee about the challenging year ahead for the world's refugees. All right, welcome, everybody. The U.N. Security Council is set to convene the next hour or so for a likely vote on a Gaza resolution. There have been so many delays to this after concern over the language. The resolution is calling for a halt to the fighting in Gaza ended increase in desperately needed humanitarian aid. A source familiar with the text is telling CNN that the language in this resolution has been softened quite a bit. It has been changed quite a bit in order to win approval from the U.S. who has previously vetoed earlier drafts. Any new pause in fighting certainly cannot come soon enough for the besieged people of Gaza. New CNN analysis finds that the IDF actually gave Gaza residents imprecise and oftentimes contradictory messages about where they should flee in order to be safe from bombardment and that the Israeli military struck at least three locations this month where it had told people to seek shelter. There's also a troubling report out today by a U.N. group that monitors food security. It says the entire population of Gaza is hungry and that there is an increasing risk right now of famine with virtually all households across the enclave skipping meals for sometimes days at a time. And the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says that the death toll right now in Gaza has reached about 20,000, with many of those killed being women and children, and that Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals and morgues simply cannot keep up with the crush of victims. Nima Elbagir has more on that and I do want to warn you that some of the images you're about to see in her report are indeed very disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But our CNN team actually went and examined the specific evacuation order that the Israeli military gave to Palestinian civilians living in the Khan Younis -- city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza on December 1st, and in the three days after that evacuation order, CNN was actually able to confirm through photos and videos posted online, satellite imagery, and local news reports, that three locations were actually struck in the area where they were told to evacuate to. And that is the city of Rafah. In the three days after that order, there was a strike on the El-Geneina neighborhood on December 3rd in which at least 17 people were killed. Later that night, an airstrike in another neighborhood of Rafah killed 18 people. And then on December 4th, an airstrike hit a public water tower also in the city of Rafah. And that's despite the fact that the Israeli military had directed residents to evacuate to that very same city. Now in response to this, the Israeli military says that it struck these areas after intelligence indicated that these places were safe houses for Hamas commanders, effectively going on to say that they will continue to strike at Hamas targets wherever they are. And that is ultimately the key problem with these evacuation orders is that even as the Israeli military focuses on these evacuation orders as a way that they say they are trying to minimize civilian casualties, they are also saying in the same breath that they will continue to target Hamas anywhere they are including in those safe evacuation areas. And so obviously the result of that, we have seen in these three incidents in particular, but many more which we have not yet fully confirmed, is that civilians are dying as a result.",

There you will find brand-new CNN analysis that shows that in the first month of the war, Israel's military dropped hundreds of massive bombs on Gaza, at a level that one analyst says has not been seen since the Vietnam War. Weapons experts blame these heavy bombs for the huge death toll which is right now approaching or has topped, rather, 20,000. You can find all of that and more on CNN.com. All right. We are getting a look at those terrifying moments that police in the Czech capital roamed the halls of Charles University searching for a killer. This body cam footage shows officers going through the school, looking for the student who shot and killed 14 staff and fellow students, and then also wounded, by the way, 25 others. Police now confirmed the gunman is dead. He shot himself, he died by suicide. His father was also found dead and now the police are linking the shooter to a double murder in Prague just last week. The attack sent students running for their lives. Melissa Bell joins us live now with more. So the attacker, Melissa, the shooter here was a 24-year-old student. He was a philosophy student.

He calls it an economic plan to rebuild the country after decades of poor policy and poverty. The main idea of this plan is to essentially take the government out of economy. Argentina has of course had a very poor economy in recent years. It's contending with one of the highest rates of inflation in the world. Let me walk you through a few of these policies that he outlined in this Wednesday emergency session. He says he's going to privatize the country's state-run companies, which include a national airline and some energy groups. He's also planning to eliminate export limits and deregulate around the country's rental housing market. And importantly he said that he'll rollback some employee benefits. Now that's certain to be a flash point in Argentina, where poverty rates are very high and there are some powerful unions. But none of this should come as a surprise. Javier Milei is a libertarian economist himself. He ran for president at campaign rallies literally holding a chainsaw in his hand in a not-so-subtle reference to what he planned to do to government spending in office. And then just a few days ago in his inaugural speech, he outlined his vision, calling it, basically, shock therapy for the country. He said, it's going to hurt but it will work in the long run. Take a listen to Milei on the radio Thursday morning explaining a bit more of his rationale around these new policies. PRES. JAVIER MILEI, ARGENTINA (through translator): People benefit from lower inflation. They will benefit with the economy recovering. They will find a better job, a better quality of life. What's the alternative? I do nothing and we go into hyperinflation? And profits will not drop 10 percent, 20 percent, but will drop 90 percent.",

People are stumbling across an international border into the middle of nowhere, only being received by organizations like the IRC, helping them settle, giving them aid to help them survive.

In a new letter to Harvard's highest governing body, the committee's chair cites Harvard's honor code that states members of the college community must themselves to producing academic work of integrity and asks, does Harvard hold its faculty and academic leadership to the same standards? Last week, Gay submitted corrections to a pair of papers she wrote as a professional academic in 2001 and 2017. But a CNN analysis of her writings documented other examples of plagiarism from the '90s when Gay was studying for her Ph.D. at Harvard.
