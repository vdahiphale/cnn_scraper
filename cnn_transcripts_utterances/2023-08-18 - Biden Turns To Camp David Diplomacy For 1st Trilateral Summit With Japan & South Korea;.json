      "sentences": "Also overseas, Russia is blaming Ukraine for another attempted drone strike on Moscow today, calling it a terrorist attack. A bit of irony there, given the number of missiles Russia has lobbed at Ukraine.Moscow's mayor says the drone damaged a nonresidential building after they say it was shot down by Russian air defenses. The strike forced four Moscow airports to close. It marks the third time in the past month that the Moscow district has been struck by a Ukrainian drone. These alleged attacks in the Russian capital come as we learn U.S. officials are growing skeptical of another piece of Ukraine's strategy, and that is the decision to ramp up missile strikes specifically on Russian-occupied Crimea in southern Ukraine. CNN's chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, is in Dnipro, Ukraine, for us. Katie Bo Lillis is here in Washington. So, Katie, explain the U.S. skepticism about this piece of the Ukrainian plan.",

      "sentences": "See how they make that argument to the Ukrainians. They very much view Crimea as Ukrainian territory. It goes back to the 2014 invasion.Nick Paton Walsh, you are in Ukraine. As you know, Crimea's something of a bone of contention between the West and Ukraine because there are some in the West who think that may be a bridge too far, even if they do not recognize it as Russian-annexed territory. From the Ukrainian perspective, how do they view these strikes that they've been able to carry out on Crimea and other places behind enemy lines, as it were?",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, I think it's very true that there are concerns in the West that Crimea is a deep red-button issue for Vladimir Putin.And that could potentially cause a ration of responses if they felt that significant part of Russia's, I think, pride in what they've tried to do in occupying parts of Ukraine were, indeed, threatened. But I don't really get some of the skepticism about why hitting Crimea doesn't assist the counteroffensive. A lot of Russia's occupying military forces are in Crimea. A lot of the supply route to the parts of the counteroffensive that the Russians are trying to hold back come up from Crimea and a function on that western part of the southern counteroffensive where a lot of Ukraine's push is happening right now. So the strikes we've been seeing on ammo depots in northern Crimea, the northern bridges heading up from Crimea, around that area, certainly could have an impact on Russia's ability to hold Ukraine back south of Orakiv, an important part near that region where I'm standing. Plus, also, too, the Kerch Bridge is another supply route that doesn't involve bringing weapons all the way across the Azov Sea, along that land corridor, also in peril potentially, too. So I think a lot of what we're seeing here are concerns by the West about Crimea becoming the focus of Ukraine's energies. But, at the moment, that's pretty farfetched. They're desperately trying to cut off the land corridor from Russian mainland that heads down to Crimea. In an ideal world, they might be able to push the Russians back to their 2014-2015 boundaries. But they're still struggling to get towards the Azov Sea in the first stage of this counteroffensive. And I think it's fair to say the Ukrainians see hitting these military infrastructure targets in Crimea as most certainly impacting Russia's ability to defend itself in that key part of the southern front -- Jim?",

According to a recent CNN analysis, soccer players at the 2023 women's World Cup are going to average -- on average, earn just 25 cents for every dollar earned by the men at their World Cup last year. May want to pick his words a little bit more carefully. Also, in a sharp break from an Arkansas state order, the Little Rock school district says it will offer an A.P. African-American studies course that will count towards graduation. Earlier this month, Arkansas state education officials said the course would not receive graduation credits, citing an executive order signed in January by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. That order prohibited what she described as indoctrination and critical race theory in schools. We also want to share this with you, a frightening video captured on board a Southwest Airlines flight in the skies over Houston. Not what you want to see coming out of your plane engine. Flames bursting out, forcing the distressed flight to quickly return to the Houston airport shortly after takeoff. Southwest says the plane landed safely and was taken out of service for review.

Traffic on that one highway, as you mentioned, traffic has calmed there. The route out is so far safe. And I want to point out, Jim, how harrowing this can be. That route out actually goes right through the forest fire. Smoke has been thick there for several weeks. And that is another reason why officials weren't taking any chances. I mean, look, Jim, we just saw what happened in Maui, right? And they did not want this community, this large but, again, isolated community, to actually be left at the mercy of a wildfire where they just could not predict where it was going next, largely because of the wind. What does that entail, Jim? As you can imagine, the most vulnerable are the concern right now. There is an unprecedented air lift going on right now that involves commercial airplanes but also the military. I want you to listen now to Canada's minister of defense as he was just telling us how they are getting the most vulnerable out of the city. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
