As you can imagine, this happened at 1.30 a.m. with limited visibility.So we are working aggressively considering, you know, the environmental temperatures as well as the water temperatures to try and rescue and perhaps recover individuals. We understand that it could have potentially been a vehicle, a tractor trailer or a vehicle as large as a tractor trailer on the bridge at the time that it collapsed. So we anticipate, you know, being here for some days to come.",

So information will be developing, you know, by the hour as we continue into this incident.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so again, it's very, very early. And we will need to be in contact with the operators of that vessel to, you know, assess what their manifest was, what they may have been carrying, importing or exporting, identifying where, you know, their destination may have been. And again, identify whether or not anybody was actually injured on that vessel.So the key bridge, as you indicated, is very, very highly frequented on a daily basis by commuters throughout the Baltimore metropolitan region. So at that hour, we understand that there were, you know, some vehicles on the bridge at the time of the collapse. So this is still lots of pieces that we still have to put together. And it's going to take some time to accurately do that. So we don't want to speculate too much, but, you know, methodically work to identify exactly what happened and how we can mitigate this incident.",

I presume that there are divers in the water as we speak or preparing to get in the water.[04:40:00] CARTWRIGHT: Well, we have Baltimore City Fire Department dive rescue team as well as assets and dive team members rescue vessels from our jurisdictional partners from Anne Arundel County Fire Department, Baltimore County Fire Department. And many others. And the Baltimore City Fire Department is simply leading this incident and the management of it in collaboration with our jurisdictional partners.",

You have their lights flashing and almost a perimeter around this land base here. And we have our dive team members that are off at a distance, probably, you know, as far as 300 yards, actively looking for individuals as well as vehicles in the water.And again, considering that it's early in the morning hours, visibility is quite challenging. So they're doing the best they can at this moment. And as the light avails itself to us, we will engage even further in this rescue, potentially recovery incident.",

      "sentences": "Kevin, I think what is just so striking looking at the video is how quickly this this bridge just collapses. And it's not just a partial collapse. It's it appears to be the entire bridge. So you would have to assume the ship has, has hit that column with some force.",

And again, this bridge has been in place for, you know, quite some time and has served many, many commuters in the Baltimore metropolitan area.So we will be, again, as the investigation ensues, there will be structure engineers involved to try and assess, you know, what the condition of the bridge is right now, which we know is unsafe conditions, but as well what the condition was prior to the actual collapse of it. So this is a very devastating incident in which these individuals have encountered. So our hearts go out to each and every one of them. And we will be working valiantly throughout the early morning to address this.",

I can't tell you exactly what, but I'm sure it's much colder than where I am standing on the land. And that can pose, you know, a concern and a risk for our divers.So, again, we're doing things methodically and safely to assure that while our divers and everyone operating here on the scene is safe and that we're able to make progress without, you know, causing adverse harm to anyone else.",

      "sentences": "Well, Shohei Ohtani came out and spoke hoping to lay to bed all the rumors and the stories that have been circulating since this story first broke nearly a week ago. Ohtani spoke through a new interpreter and basically said that his longtime interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara is basically a liar, a gambler and a thief. Take a little listen to what he had to say through that interpreter.SHOHEI OHTANI, LOS ANGELES DODGERS DESIGNATED HITTER (through translator): I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to do it on my behalf. And I have never went through a bookmaker to bet on sports. Up until a couple of days ago, I didn't know that this was happening. Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has told lies. WATT: Now, some suspicion had fallen on Ohtani because of dueling narratives and also because the bookmaker at the center of all this, he had apparently been telling people that Shohei Ohtani was his client, not Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter. Now, I spoke to the lawyer for that bookie. The bookie is Matthew Bowyer. The lawyer is Diane Bass. She said, listen, Bowyer, sure, he might have said that, but he was just bragging, boasting. You know, it was a good marketing ploy to say that Shohei Ohtani, perhaps the greatest baseball player to ever live, was your client. But she reiterated that Ohtani and the bookie had zero direct contact whatsoever. Now, why this is such a big story? Well, this is Shohei Ohtani's opening week here at the L.A. Dodgers. He came on a $700 million, 10- year contract. He's a two-way player. He pitches. He hits. He is spoken of in the same breaths as Babe Ruth. And, you know, there was a poll of MLB players asked who's the best player right now. Two-thirds of them said it was Ohtani. So Ohtani and the Dodgers clearly trying to put this to bed so that the focus can be on him at the Dodgers and opening day Thursday. Nick Watt, CNN, inside Dodger Stadium. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
