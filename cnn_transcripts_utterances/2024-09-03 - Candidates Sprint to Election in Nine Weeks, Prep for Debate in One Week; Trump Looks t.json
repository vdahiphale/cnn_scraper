And some ballots, though, will start hitting the mail in North Carolina this week. In Pennsylvania, early voting starts there in two weeks. So, calling it a sprint, no exaggeration.And one thing the presidential candidates are sprinting to do right now is to get ready for their big debate. Ahead of their first face- to-face, CNN has new reporting on how the candidates are preparing. And maybe no surprise, they are taking very different approaches. One major focus for both campaigns is, and will continue to be, the economy. On that, Kamala Harris is set to roll out more of her economic agenda tomorrow, and is already rolling out a major new ad buy to go with it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they are going aggressive on the airwaves. But she's also hitting the campaign trail to also woo those working class voters and those labor groups that boosted President Joe Biden in 2020. Now, yesterday, we saw her in Pennsylvania alongside President Joe Biden. It was the first campaign event that they have done together and, of course, in a place where he only beat the former president by less than two percentage points in 2020, so clearly an important place for them to appeal to those voters. You see the images there. Now, the president will be hitting the campaign trail to help her as he shifts from candidate to surrogate. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress and she's going to build on it.

She will be going to New Hampshire tomorrow, where she will unveil more of her economic proposals, especially focusing on innovation and entrepreneurship. Remember last week, she previewed that one of the things that she wants to propose is tax credits for small business startups, so more on that tomorrow. But certainly, she is hitting the trail trying to get ahead on this issue ahead of that critical debate next week, where she and the campaign knows it will bring in large audiences and allow them to hear from her directly more about her policies against former President Donald Trump.

It was during that time that she actually coined the term, Trump abortion ban, something that we'll be hearing about a lot on this tour.Now, this tour starts today in Florida. Of course, that is a place where abortion is on the ballot and where former President Donald Trump said that he would vote no on overturning their current six-week ban. Now, the vice president, despite all of this, has been maintaining that she is the underdog in the race. So, she is certainly trying to capitalize on these issues to appeal to voters.

So, let's not pay too much attention to those polls, because as unions and labor knows best, we know what it's like to be the underdog. And we are the underdog in this race.

And in 2016, that was a very much attack and insult-driven campaign. If we look at just the past few weeks, he has questioned Vice President Harris' racial identity, shared a sexist social media post describing Harris and a lewd sex ass. He is calling her an extremist and a communist right out of the 2016 GOP playbook, refusing to say if he will accept the election results and also digging in and counterpunching in the face of controversies, which is what he's done over this dust-up about what happened at Arlington National Cemetery. So, that's one way we're seeing sort of this reprise of 2016.Another way is his focus on immigration. You know, it's an issue that he clearly wants to talk about the most, just as he did in 2016. I was at an event on Friday for Moms for Liberty. This is a group that is focused on education and school issues and young children. And he was turning almost every question into an immigration topic. We've also seen him bring back some of the people who helped him win in 2016, for example, Corey Lewandowski, one of his top advisers in 2016, is now back in the fold. So, this is all just further evidence that as this race has gotten closer, Donald Trump is leaning on what has worked for him in the past.",

There is a recent poll from ABC that showed her lead at 52 percent.But the Trump campaign would tell you, and certainly Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton know this very well. This race is fought not in the national not in a national poll, but in these tight battlegrounds. And if Donald Trump can't effectively you know, blunt some of this enthusiasm for Harris by going on the attack in these key battlegrounds, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, some of these Sun Belt states, that is more important to the Trump campaign at this point than how he is doing in some national poll.",

For the third day in a row, they are planning to organize protests, not only here in Tel Aviv, but across the country, to raise their voices and demand that this Israeli government prioritize a hostage release deal over all else.But so far, the Israeli prime minister does not seem to be heeding those cries from those families and the hundreds of thousands of Israelis who we've seen carrying out protests over the last couple of days. Last night in a press conference and said he doubled down on one of the core demands that has become a major sticking point in these negotiations, and that is his belief that Israeli troops need to remain along that Philadelphia corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. That's despite the fact that Hamas is insisting that Israeli troops must withdraw from that area in order to get to a deal. And so that leaves us with a lot of uncertainty about how these hostage and ceasefire negotiations can move forward. There was a lot of hope over the last couple of days that perhaps this moment, the deaths of these six Israeli hostages who were killed by their Hamas captors that perhaps this could be the moments that would be a turning point in these negotiations. And yet what we are seeing instead is the Israeli prime minister doubling down, showing no signs of changing his position, even as his defense and security establishment. They are privately saying that they could leave that Philadelphia corridor in order to get a hostage release deal. And meanwhile, there is heightened concern for the lives of these hostages as Hamas says that it will -- admits that it killed executed those six hostages and warns that more hostages will return in coffins if the Israeli government tries to rescue more hostages through military operations rather than through a deal, John?

A crowd, a small crowd that you can see in the video there, assaults two of these Marines, holds onto them and essentially grapples them so they can't get away, puts a bag over one of their heads. In the video, you can hear one of the Marines repeatedly calling for help. And then a short time later, the crowd starts chanting over and over again, Yankee, go home. According to the Navy, several other Marines in the area came to help out, got these Marines out of there, and were able to go to a local hospital to get checked out. According to the Navy, they are doing well and are back on the USS Wasp. The Navy is now investigating along with NCIS and local authorities. Local governorship says 15 people were taken into custody as a result of this incident, including two women and 13 men. So, again these Marines assigned to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
