It's been a big controversial question in the West, and it came to a head this week at the G7 meeting. I'll talk to the \"FT's\" Gillian Tett about it all. And Bill Gates digs nuclear power. In fact, he thinks we need much more of it, and he's putting his money where his mouth is. Breaking ground this week on a new reactor in Wyoming.

Yahya Sinwar is oftentimes seen to be miscalculating because he's not putting the lives of Palestinians at the forefront and pushing for this ceasefire. Instead, what Sinwar is doing, he has three objectives. His personal survival, the survival of Hamas, as well as elevating the issue of Palestine back on the international stage.He has succeeded in elevating the issue of Palestine for now. What he has also succeeded is keeping Hamas somewhat intact, right? And he continues to survive. But to guarantee those three goals to move forward, he also needs a permanent ceasefire, and that's what he's pushing for in terms of the changes with the Biden administration's deal.",

And so what they've essentially done is a very clever compromise where they've said we're not going to seize all the assets permanently. We're going to use the interest on the assets and back alone with that interest.So that means that there will be money going to Ukraine not until the end of the year, but there will be money go to Ukraine. But it also means that if the situation changes again in the future, then essentially those assets are still sitting there frozen and they can be given back to Russia in the future if there is indeed a peace deal or a change of government. So they're trying to thread the needle and if you like, have it both ways with optionality, but also the money flowing to Ukraine. Obviously, Ukraine would prefer to have the $300 billion rather than just the $50 billion loan. Obviously, that will be a lot cleaner. But this is an attempt to, as so often in international politics and finance, create a compromise that keeps almost everyone happy.

And the other thing to bear in mind is that the history of wars show that in many, many cases, when a country falls into war, it ends up having hyperinflation and a collapse in the economy because it runs out of money.

In Russia, inflation is around 20 percent. And in many ways, the Russian economy is showing a lot of stress and strain.The reasons why its survived so far is that firstly, the Kremlin has reorientated the economy towards industrial production and in particular, war production. And that's given quite a boost. And it has enough control of the economy that really can redirect assets when it gets itself organized. The other reason of course is the oil price has not collapsed. And so Russia is still getting revenues from the oil price in spite of Western sanctions. But the other big, highly controversial reason is China. China is providing all kinds of support to the Russian economy at the moment in a way that many Russians feel quite uneasy about because they don't like being dependent on China. Many Americans and Europeans are furious about. But as long as that flow and that support happens, it's going to be tough for the allies to crush the Russian economy as they had hoped, although what I would stress is if you look into the weeds of the data coming out of Russia right now insofar as they're accurate, it does indicate that the Russian economy is facing growing stress and those stresses will almost certainly get worse and worse as the year rolls on.",

This week, he broke ground on a new facility in Wyoming that he says will do just that. It is a nuclear power plant with a reactor that is about one- third the size of a traditional reactor. And it's cooled by liquid sodium instead of water.Gates says that makes it safer and simpler to build out. It's the latest initiative from his company, TerraPower. The project faces hurdles. Most prominently the Nuclear Regulatory Commission hasn't yet approved the plan for the reactor. In the past, nuclear projects have been plagued by delays and high costs. But proponents of these new reactors say that they are the key to a future with an abundance of clean energy. I spoke to Gates this week about the initiative and the future of nuclear power.
