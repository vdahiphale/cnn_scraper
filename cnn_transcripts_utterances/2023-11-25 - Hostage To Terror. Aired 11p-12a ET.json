What that means for the more than 200 people held hostage in Gaza is unclear. Most of those hostages were taken on October 7th from Israeli communities or kibbutzim close to the Gaza border. On a kibbutz called Nir Oz, it's estimated a quarter of the 400 or so people who lived there were either killed or captured. The whole story of what happened is only now really coming to light. Tonight, we want you to meet those who survived the attack and are now fighting for answers about what happened to their missing loved ones and neighbors.",
