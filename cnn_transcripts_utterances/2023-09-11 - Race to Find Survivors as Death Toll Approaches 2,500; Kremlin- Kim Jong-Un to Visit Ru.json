And coming up a desperate searchfor survivors, rescuers in Morocco continue to battle both the terrain and the elements, searching the rubble after Friday's powerful earthquake, the latest number of lost lives 2497. We'll take you there for the very latest. Plus, Kim's trip to Russia, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un believed to be headed for the Eastern City of Vladivostok aboard his armored train what might come of that trip coming up too and diplomatic dance in Asia. President Biden returns from his whirlwind tour of India and Vietnam. As he looks to bolster diplomatic ties and counter China's influence in the region, the details up next. It's also the first trading day of the week. U.S. stock futures are pushing higher as you can see there as investors await the latest U.S. inflation report. Wall Street is certainly hoping I think. Wednesday's Consumer Price Index will continue its path of easing and not further complicate the outlook for the Federal Reserve in November. No rate change, of course expected in September, but potential moves too, over at the Bank of Japan after its chief hinted a policy shift away from negative interest rates. The Japanese Yen jumping against the U.S. dollar by the most in two months on that news. The dollar index though has had its best run in fact, since the winter of 2014. It registered an eighth straight week of gains against major currencies up 5 percent even just since mid-July. Boosted of course by a slew of stronger U.S. data which of course, in hand complicating the picture for the Fed. But that's the performance. All right lots to get to you as always, but first to the desperate search for survivors entering a third day in Morocco. It follows Friday's 6.8 magnitude earthquake. The quake was the strongest to hit the central part of the country in more than a century, with the epicenter not far from the busy city of Marrakech. But the situation is especially dire in remote mountain villages where families have been left without food, water and medicine and with roads blocked by landslides. Sam Kiley joins us now from a newly established camp at the base of the Atlas Mountain. Sam, they've certainly pulled this together incredibly quickly. What can you tell us about what those facilities are now offering? I knew the bigger issues of course a higher up.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice-over): Another victim buried returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years.

KILEY (voice-over): The house is now abandoned. The Fatima led a team of local women to find food and shelter for the homeless before any aid arrived. All the food here, they result to private donations. Many villages here remain isolated roads cut by landslides, relief operations will focus on getting to them. Firefighters consider searching for bodies beneath the hotel. Their conclusion is disappointing. Amidst shocks and shattered masonry, it's just too dangerous to rescue the dead.

But the statement that was issued that makes no mention of that historic World Cup winning side, no mention of a journey and most so. No apology, no admission of any wrongdoing and begs the question from a lot of people, why now? Was it pressure or was it actually football politics? But so many people, the pressure that has mounted over the last few weeks would have just been too much, but that could very much have been the case, you know, a day or two after the events of August the 20th. He was suspended by World football's governing body they were all the calls from the Spanish Federation for him to resign. He was investigated by the Spanish sporting tribunals and then as you rightly mentioned that Spanish prosecutor opening their criminal case into allegations of sexual assaults and coercion. But interestingly, the only real reason mentioned in Luis Rubiales' statement was a World Cup bid for 2030. Which we have talked about before a joint bed between Spain, Portugal and Morocco, which means so much not only for Spain, but for European football, and African football as well. Our colleague, Atika Shubert was really saying the view from Spain up to this point has been one of relief. Because this is something that has so overshadowed that incredible achievement of the Women's World Cup winning side, but it's by no means the end of the story, is it the criminal prosecution investigation is ongoing that will not be brought to an end by the resignation. And the players, the women's players involved in all of this have been talking about real structural and institutional change. That is what they want to see. The removal of one individual is not going to do that and really, the talk or the reference to that to the World Cup absolutely plays that out, doesn't it? You know, there are much bigger footballing structures and politics at play. An interesting one to watch from this point is whether the resignation of Rubiales on top of the sacking of Coach Jorge Vilda will be enough to encourage the Spanish women's team to play. They are -- to be representing their country in a nation's league encounter on September the 22nd against Sweden. They of course up to this point have refused to do that with the structures in place from what we're hearing from the Federation negotiations and discussions are very much ongoing.",

Well, the answer is they all rely on magnets to work. But there's a problem. The rare earths that make up magnets will come under increasing demand as the world's population grows. According to our next guest, demand is expected to outpace supply by 2025. And the United States is heavily dependent on China for production and that causes volatility in pricing and of course, concerns about the supply chain. Plus, traditional mining methods aren't so good for the environment too. But one company has found a way to recycle used magnets, stripping them out of discarded products, melting them down and remanufacturing them. Texas based Noveon says less than 1 percent of rare earth magnets are recovered and recycled. But it's aiming to tap into a 600,000 ton supply. To tell us more, Scott Dunn is the CEO of Noveon Magnetics. And he joins us now, Scott, great to have you on the show. I think what's clear is that we're all surrounded by these rare earth magnets.

We like to usually try to create some sort ofdirect connection between folks and magnets in their lives, their magnets are everywhere. They're all around us all the time, from your home, to your car, to your workplace, to the factories, and industrial processes that make our standard of living possible. So magnets are really how we use energy. Magnets, power electric motors, generators, and other are the most energy efficient technology in the world today. You want to think of magnets in terms of how electrical energy actually becomes mechanical motion, or otherwise, how we harnessed mechanical motion, and it becomes electrical energy. So this is really how we use energy. I like to think of magnets as a really, really important piece of the energy tripod, so to speak, you have energy generation and transmission, you have energy and energy storage, so think batteries. And then think about magnets as important as batteries as playing the energy conversion role in our lives and in society. And what's really unique about this, and kind of the inflection point that we set out today is that magnets are, after many decades now playing an even more increasingly important role in electric vehicle technology, clean energy technology. And so magnets are playing an even more important role, really, in the future and in our society and especially as we move towards energy transition, and what I'll call kind of clean, low carbon, high tech, future technology.

And maybe you can tell me how you're achieving that. Or it might be too complicated. But I think what you said about supply, I think what you said about supply actually overrides that, because this is the important thing. It's got to be scalable, or it's no use to us. And we've already got the U.S. government saying due to strategic security concerns that U.S. defense contractors, I believe, actually can't use China produced magnets.

But you know, in a, given some of thegeopolitical tension, and given a little bit of what I'll call the post COVID world and the way that we've observed supply chain risk, beginning with semiconductor on down, it's critical that we do have a secure supply chain for these materials. What's unique about our business is, in a lot of ways, the only way that you can recycle elements are to get back to the elements. You have to go through typically, long chain of chemical and energy intensive process. You have to sort of, you know, create the elements all over again, before you can move into finished products, which is what the market needs, which is what the customer needs. In our case, we are taking these recycled materials, and we're moving those directly into a manufacturing process. And, you know, targeting, you know, what I'll call the OEM requirement or the OEM spec, you know, direct to OEM, direct to the automotive, direct to the wind turbine manufacturer, direct to the electric motor manufacturer, and providing that finished product to them, which is many, many, many steps and series of value chain. And as long as we can, as long as we can do that effectively, while in parallel as we grow, also develop the supply chain for recycled material, we believe we should be able to significantly offset what I'll call traditional demand for primary resources in the case of rare earths, and that should help us to alleviate what I'll call supply chain risk, but also foreign dependency.
