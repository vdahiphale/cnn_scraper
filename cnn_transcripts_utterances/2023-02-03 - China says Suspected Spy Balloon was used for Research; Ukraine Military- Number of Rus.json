All of this had a U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to Beijing. We'll have the latest in just a moment. Plus, called to account reports say that Gautam Adani will sign off on a big four accounting firm audit of his empire all of this coming after another volatile day of trade for Adani shares the latest on the Indian conglomerate stock market meltdown, just ahead. But first, it is another jobs Friday in America in the U.S. The U.S. jobs report is out. Quick look at how American jobs market is doing in the New Year. And we have a blockbuster number buy Oh, buy, suddenly much better than expected 517,000 jobs added to the economy last month. Analysts were actually expecting half of that they're expecting just under 200,000 jobs added. So this is a massive surprise. Today's numbers certainly represent the best month for jobs growth since last July the U.S. unemployment rate easing as well to 3.4 percent and wage growth ticking higher too. The big question, what does all this great news for workers, I mean for the Fed and its fine to bring down inflation. U.S. futures had been trading lower all of this morning and they are still looking, let's see here a bit soft. Europe trading mix tech stocks set to pull back after disappointing set of earnings from three big cap heavyweights, shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet all of those guys falling premarket trading, but tech still up strongly on the week. We'll break it down for you later on in the show. But first new developments on a suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over the Northern United States right now China now says the balloon was used for research. Oren Liebermann is live for us at the Pentagon with the very latest. So Oren, just walk us through what the U.S. thinks the Chinese were looking for in terms of surveillance here? And be one of Biden's options right now, in terms of possibly shooting it down? I know that it's off the table. Are there any other military options on the table?",

      "sentences": "Well, that hasn't been taken off the table entirely. The Pentagon has just said they're not going toshoot this down right now, because of a threat to what are below it potentially facilities and people. But that option does remain possible depending on the risk. They view from what they see as a Chinese spy satellite, not as the Chinese just said, a Chinese weather balloon. Now the Pentagon has acknowledged that have traveled over several sensitive sites. And they have said it's over Montana. They haven't specified what those sites are. But we know that Montana houses some of the U.S. is ballistic missile fields. So perhaps that's the sensitive side that this balloon was traveling over. It came over from Canada, and is now drifting, or at least was drifting over Montana. We're waiting to see if they give an update on where this is now. The Pentagon has been tracking this for several days. The decision was made by President Joe Biden with the recommendations of top military leaders not to shoot it down at this time. But again, that remains a possibility as the Pentagon keeps on tracking this. We just learned from a U.S. official that there have been previous instances of this over Hawaii and Guam, sometime in previous years. Yesterday, the Pentagon said that this had happened before, including in the previous administration. And the administration views this very seriously, especially ahead of a planned trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China, with tensions already high between Beijing and Washington. So does the Pentagon by the explanation? Does the U.S. by the explanation that it's a weather balloon? We'll get a sense of that today and find out if the thinking has shifted at all on whether to shoot this thing out of the sky, Zain.",

But there are so many issues that he will have to confront, especially with Chinese leadership. I mean, we have this case, but we also have the buildup of U.S. forces in the Philippines. We have the question of Taiwan, we have trade, we have microchips. The list goes on and on. The key really here is for Blinken, to establish some kind of feeling of diplomacy where if there is some heightened event, such as with this balloon. That he will have a counterpart with whom he can pick up the phone and have an immediate discussion to eliminate some kind of scramble or potential misunderstanding as this case made?

This looks like a boom, as you mentioned, 517,000 jobs added that is more than twice the expectation best in nearly a year 100,000 jobs better than the average last year. You know, and despite this almost unprecedented war on inflation by the Federal Reserve, the unemployment rate going down, this is a new post COVID low, you have to go all the way back to 1969 to get an unemployment rate like this. And really, the strength in the jobs market was basically across the board. I mean, leisure and hospitality added 128,000 jobs. Those are restaurants, hotels; professional business services added over 80,000 everywhere almost added jobs, government, health care, retail, construction, manufacturing. The only sectors that were negative were utilities slightly, and tech and that was only slightly negative. So really impressive across the board and Zain I think one of the keys here though, is the fact that hiring continued, hiring actually accelerated, but wages didn't wages cooled off, as expected. And I think that is encouraging, because that does sort of give hope to the idea that maybe this jobs more could continue going without having it fresher inflation.

Shares of Gautam Adani's businesses have been plunging since U.S. short seller Hindenburg researcher's fraud allegations. So far the sell-off has wiped off about $100 billion off of the value of Mr. Adani's empire. His personal net worth has now fallen to about 60 billion for about $100 billion just last week.

I mean, you talk about his net worth is gone down from $120 billion within nine days to $61 billion. You've just spoken about how you know a huge amount of staggering amount has been wiped off the conglomerate in terms of its values? And clearly now you do have a lot of people watching Adani very closely. A lot of institutes and institutions watching Adani very closely you have opposition lawmakers in India in parliament for three consecutive days disrupting proceedings, demanding an explanation from the Modi government from the Indian government. They want an independent probe into this controversy. And it's not only going to stop at this, there's going to be a lot of scrutiny along the way for the Adani group. By far they themselves have said this is an unprecedented situation. You had the share, sell off a $2.5 billion share sell off that was abandoned last minute because of the reds in the market. So clearly this is not going to abate anytime soon for the Adani group. However, for the first time, during an interview with affiliate CNN News 18, the Finance Minister did not directly talk of Adani or the controversy.

And certainly, some of these factors came into play the factory shutdown, and this economic uncertainty that's probably causing consumers to think differently about how they're spending their money, whether they want to upgrade to the latest iPhone or invest in Apple TV plus.

Right, let's talk about Amazon, Amazon finished out 2022 strong but it doesn'texpect to start 2023 on the same foot recession, fears and rising prices, of course, consumers and businesses to cut back on spending. Let's discuss all of this with Paul R LA Monica. So, Amazon surprising lost about $2.7 billion last year such a stark change from the boon days for them during the pandemic. Part of the issue is their investment in electric car company. Just walk us through that Paul. PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, obviously Amazon having some issues with that investment in Rivian, Zain. But I think that a bigger issue for Amazon right now we're seeing this with other big tech companies that have a major cloud presence, Amazon Web Services, their massive cloud infrastructure hosting division that generates a big bulk of the company's profits. Since the retail business has very thin margins, growth is slowing there was only about 20 percent year-over-year. That's a pretty dramatic slowdown. And I think we're seeing that it's consistent with what other tech companies have reported as well. Microsoft's cloud business is slowing Alphabet, which reported last night also, we saw Google Cloud revenue starting to decelerate as well, the growth at least. So, I think that is a big concern right now Zain, that corporations that had been spending a lot of money on cloud infrastructure, they're not doing it as much as they were during the pandemic. And that's going to be a problem for these big tech giants.",

But I think a bigger concern, as you pointed out, Zain is YouTube, a lot of people had hopes that YouTube growth would be pretty strong. But I think what we've seen now with Meta having very strong earnings just a few days ago, it's possible that Meta, the owner of Facebook is really eating into YouTube shorts with things like Instagram, and Reels. And that's probably a problem for not just Alphabet and YouTube, but we saw SnapChats results were pretty disastrous. So, this might be an example of TikTok and Meta is the big winners in social media right now. Whether or not TikTok remains on top given all of the regulatory concerns remains to be seen, of course but Meta had a great quarter and you know, Alphabet did not.",

EC President Ursula vonder Leyen says that Russia must be held accountable in court for what she calls odious crimes in Ukraine. Meantime, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pushing for EU integration talks this year. Earlier in the show we mentioned that Ukraine's warning about Russia beefing up its presence in the Black Sea comes as the U.S. is poised to offer Kyiv a new $2.2 billion aid package, which includes longer range missiles. Scott McLean joins us live now. So just in terms of what's top of Zelenskyy's mind here, it's going to be membership in terms of the EU. That is what Zelenskyy wants. And he's also going to talk about the progress that Ukraine has made towards that goal, especially when it comes to rooting out corruption, Scott.",

Even just today, Zain, police announcedthat there were charges against the heads of two companies accused of defrauding the ministry out of defense out of more than $3 million. And so yes, Ukraine has a lot to prove to show that it's trying to clean up its reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. And that is one of the conditions that the EU has set out for it. If there's really any realistic possibility of Ukraine actually joining the bloc at some point, you have to remember that countries like North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, they've been waiting as EU candidate states for a decade, more than a decade in some cases, and they're still not quite there yet. So, this is not generally a quick process. But Ukraine is pushing for it to be fast tracked. We've just gotten some new comments from President Zelenskyy. You're see him there speaking he said that Ukraine is completing the recommendations of the European Commission which had been outlined for our country, and we expect the Commission's assessment this spring on our process on our progress, excuse me, so they're obviously hoping for the best. But really, nothing happens overnight when it comes to getting into the EU Zain.",

So learning isn't just passive consumption of facts, learning is installing in people new beliefs, new behaviors, new attitudes, new habits, it's a slow gradual accumulation of wisdom that you are then putting into practice. Now we deliver this not just through content and teacher, but through our app itself, which does micro lessons every single day that get you hope that get you engaged.

And the results you want to create. It is an active application of the mind towards changing your future, but also creating emotional balance. So, the six face looks at three methods to create this incredible, juicy emotional balance within you. And then three methods to get your mind focused on the future.
