Not happening? FBI background checks for some of the most highly sensitive roles Trump is filling right now. Instead, Trump has bucked the decades-long tradition for a less traditional route. The reason why possibly just as alarming as the action itself, especially after making some of the most controversial picks in modern history, a so- called cabinet in waiting, as The Washington Post calls it this morning, that has Washington on edge.CNN Zachary Cohen is leading us off. Zachary, you know, forget about all these norms. It appears to be the only normal thing right now is that, well, I don't know what. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "(INAUDIBLE) conventional approach when it comes to how it's vetting its top picks for Donald Trump's incoming administration. And that includes bypassing the traditional FBI background checks for some of these cabinet nominees.Now, look, Donald Trump is no fan of the national security establishment here in Washington D.C. he's railed against the FBI and against the intelligence community since he was president the first time. But, look, this is bucking a trend and bucking a protocol that's been in place since the aftermath of World War II. It's intended to make sure that cabinet nominees and people for top administration jobs with access to sensitive information don't have any unknown foreign ties or other issues that could create national security problems. But, look, Donald Trump's team instead opting to go with private researchers to vet their candidates and their cabinet picks so far. So, this is definitely a shift from the norm so to speak. There's nothing that is legally binding as far as Donald Trump having to opt into the FBI background checks, but it does speak to this deeper level of mistrust that Donald Trump has towards the FBI and towards the national security establishment, but also sort of this disregard for the need for some of these institutional safeguards that do exist. And the reason is because Donald Trump things that the FBI process is slow, and it could present some problems in terms of getting his agenda implemented quickly. Obviously, this coming though as Trump has named several very controversial figures to top administration jobs, including attorney general and the director of National Intelligence. So, ultimately, it is Donald Trump's who has the final say over who he appoints and who he gives access to classified information. But, again, this is another divergent from the norm from Donald Trump and really a bucking of a trend that was intended to safeguard our nation's secrets.",

He also laid out what his plans are for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in his new role as health secretary, saying, quote, we want you to come up with things and ideas and what you've been talking about for a long time.Of course, one of the things RFK Jr. has been talking about for a long time is this debunked idea that vaccines have some sort of effect on children's health negatively in terms of autism and conspiracies like that. Also in attendance yesterday was Doug Collins, the former representative who will be leading Donald Trump's secretary -- will be secretary of Veteran Affairs. Doug Burgum, as you said, also made an appearance and he will be the interior secretary, Trump announced. Also in attendance was Elon Musk, who has been by Donald Trump's side nearly nonstop since the election night. And he had some -- or Trump had some words to say about his new confidant.

Now, Jose Antonio Ibarra is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela. He crossed the border illegally in 2022. He faces ten counts, including murder and aggravated assault with the intent to rape. The prosecution is seeking life in prison without parole. And as for the way the trial will be conducted now that it's going to be a bench trial, John, the judge will hear arguments by both the defense and the prosecution as we would normally. But the main difference here is that, ultimately, he is going to decide on a verdict and also on sentencing. According to the indictment, Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, was attacked by the defendant when she was out for a morning run in February. And the indictment also says that the defendant hit her in the head with a rock and asphyxiated her. Also, things were not going very good for the defense, John. For one thing, the defense was asking for a motion to have a phone fingerprint and DNA evidence thrown out. The judge said no. Also, they were asking for a change of venue.
