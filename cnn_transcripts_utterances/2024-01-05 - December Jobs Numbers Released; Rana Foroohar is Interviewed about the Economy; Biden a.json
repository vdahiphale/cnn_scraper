It has been giving now for 36 months of positive job growth with this newest report, you're absolutely right.So, let's go through the numbers. It's 216,000. As you said, that is stronger than expectations. Expectations, for perspective, were closer to 160,000 for the month of December. Unemployment sticking at 3.7 percent, guys. We have been in this range of really low unemployment of about 4 percent or below 4 percent for, John, as you said, about two years now. If you look at where we saw job growth over the last month, in the month of December, a part of this was a continuation of what we have been seeing. We continue to see government add jobs to the tune of about 52,000 jobs, health care adding 38,000 jobs, and construction adding 17,000 jobs. When we look at the prior months, guys, and look at the revisions, we actually saw two revisions lower. So, for the month of November, that number was actually revised lower by 26,000 jobs. The month of October was revised lower by 45,000 jobs. So, let's put this all in perspective. This is, as you said, John, a strong jobs report. This is a robust jobs report. Perhaps a little bit warmer than some would expect. That's part of the reason why you saw futures fall after this report was released. And the reason why is because it's pretty much inevitable at this point. The Fed has indicated that rate cuts are coming in 2024. And so the question becomes when. When are they coming? What meeting do we start to see rate cuts? And a report like this that is stronger than expected suggests that they may be coming later in the year, perhaps later spring, perhaps early summer, and so some patience might be required here. The hope, of course, was that if we saw a cooler labor market, not cold, but something a little bit softer, then maybe those rate cuts would come a bit earlier in the year. But this is not that. This is a strong report.",

So, this is one of those things, John, that sort of has two sides to it. So, this is - this is good news for American workers. Obviously, you want to see your paychecks go up. You want to see that nice little boost there. And, by the way, wages have started to outpace inflation, so that's some good news.The other side of this, however, is that the Fed watches this to sort of ensure that we're not seeing a wage price spiral, essentially that higher wages aren't fueling inflation. That's not what we have seen just yet, but it is something that they continue to watch. But, yes, as you said, certainly good news for American workers that their pay continues to move on up - move on up.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump's not willing to show up on the debate stage. Has he come to communities and answered questions? Has he gone to all 99 counties? Heck, has he even gone to nine counties? We need a change agent in Washington. We need somebody that's going to go in there, actually unwind the bureaucracy, which Trump promised to do and didn't do. We need a president that's going to stop the border invasion by building a wall, which Trump promised to do but didn't do. NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Chaos follows him. And we all know that's true. Chaos follows him. And we can't have a country in disarray, and a world on fire, and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. Everybody wants to talk about the economy they had under Trump. But at what cost? At what cost? $8 trillion in four years.

And that voting starts here, Sara, in ten days. So, we will see if any minds were changed. But the Trump campaign, from their point of view, they are saying that complacency among their own supporters is one of their biggest worries. If he looks like he's so far ahead in the polls, will they actually turn out and vote? That's why he is coming back to Iowa to have a couple events today and through the weekend.

You can walk and chew gum at the same time, or at least that should be your goal as a president or a candidate.And, look, I think there's also a challenge for Biden here. You talked earlier that this is an economy that keeps on giving. For a lot of voters, it's an economy that keeps on taking. When they spend money on a sandwich, when they go to a restaurant, when they spend money on anything that costs more than it did three years ago or they don't spend the money because they can't afford the financing on a car or a home, that's a problem for voters, and Biden has to deal with that. The other part of this, which he's going to address in Valley Forge today, to me sounds an awful lot like what we heard Nikki Haley say last night, comes down to one word, chaos. You know, you can couch it in the terms of democracy, Joe Biden is making a chaos argument. It's one that Nikki Haley, I think, made very effectively last night. But here's a reality of political communications and why we haven't seen really much change in the primaries yet. Saying something at a forum here or there or at a town hall or in a speech here or there, whether you're Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley, that doesn't break through. People may be watching a sporting event, they may be streaming something, they may be doing something else. You have to say that message over and over and over again and you have to put resources behind it on television, in digital, to make sure that voters don't hear it once, they hear it 10 times, 15 times so it absorbs. Having this nine days out from the New Hampshire primary may be too little and too late.",

But last night both Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, in different ways, drew the clear contrast with Donald Trump. I was particularly struck by Nikki Haley's contrast by saying that Donald Trump loves dictators and he contributed to a massive increase in the national debt, $8 trillion, which leads to a lot of those economic challenges we've seen - we see today, particularly high interest rates and inflation. Those are things Democrats need to play offense on, they need to play offense on the border as well. It's not simply enough to talk about democracy. But democracy's fundamental. Everything is based upon that. And I think we forget that (INAUDIBLE).",

Some folks who are Trump supporters are maybe looking for permission if they can find someone who meets their policy goals but doesn't bring that degree of destructive baggage. And that was an argument also aimed at evangelicals. An argument you hear a lot. You need a president who people can aspire to emulate. Who they can tell their children, be a little more like him. And it's hard to do that with Donald Trump. That's part of the Foustian (ph) bargain that's been made.
