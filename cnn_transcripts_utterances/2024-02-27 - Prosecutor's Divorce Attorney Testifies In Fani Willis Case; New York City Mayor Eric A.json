This messy business, this legal drama about this messy business is now threatening the future of District Attorney Willis' role at the helm of this important case.Let's bring in my colleague and friend, CNN anchor, senior legal analyst, Laura Coates. Laura, so bottom line, do you think the witness, Mr. Bradley, do you think his testimony has undermined Fani Willis' credibility? LAURA COATES, CNN HOST: I think it has undermined the credibility of the arguments made by both Nathan Willis -- Nathan Wade, excuse me, and also Fani Willis for these reasons: first of all, here's why were here. This person you may recall was already called to testify about a week-and-a-half ago. The reason he left is because of the attorney- client privilege. Now, you know, if you are actually communicating with your attorney, in furtherance of getting legal advice, it is privileged and that privilege belongs to the client, not the attorney. The judge, however, had what was called an in camera discussion. That's a fancy way of saying you and I are going to talk one-on-one with no one present. I'm going to determine whether or not your conversations that you had should fall within that privilege. The judge made a ruling. They said, look, as it relates to communications about whether there was a relationship between Fani Willis and Nathan Wade? That ain't privilege. You can testify to it. He doesn't want to be here for that reason. So, now, he's being asked questions about that, and now he's got to kind of convenient amnesia. He doesn't recall a lot of different details. He comes across as somebody who was gossiping with the attorney. That's bringing this disqualification proceeding, that he was aware that the motion it was about gathering information, and nonetheless, he disclosed that he says that they were engaged in in relationship earlier than they said. But now today, he said it was all speculation, all speculation. He had no personal knowledge and he kept using a phrase, anything I learned was from my client, which became synonymous with Nathan Wade was the one who told me. Now there was a really important moment with Sadow, that is the attorney for Donald Trump. Remember this is the one who is saying, look, I don't believe anything you have to say. He asked him, wait a second. You're speculating. You were asked by an attorney that you knew was representing a co-defendant in this case. And in return, you offer a speculation. Why not just say if you really didn't know, I don't know? He offered no sound explanation as to why. The judge seems throughout this entire proceeding a little impatient compared to the first time we saw this entire thing. Why? Because he wants them to focus on the specific nature of the testimony. And remember, Jake, we're all here not because this is a part of \"Real Housewives\" episode or we are just nosy. It is because they asked him to disqualify Fani Willis based on a conflict of interest that would make a defendant impossible to have a fair trial.",

He's testifying about events that are recent and important.And yet when it came to virtually anything of any substance, his response was, I don't recall or I was speculating. And let's understand how this person came onto the radar to begin with. He was asked by the defense lawyers in writing in a text, did the relationship between Nathan Wade and Fani Willis start before the D.A. hired Nathan Wade and his answer in writing was, quote, absolutely. And then on his own, he offered up specifics about when and how they met. He said they met at this particular CLE, Continuing Legal Education conference. And today he said, well, I was speculating. That's ridiculous. Why would you make up out of whole cloth some specific place where people met and when he was asked about, why did you speculate, you know what his answer was? I don't recall. There's no way you can credit that witness the question now though, and you are because getting to this is is there a concrete enough conflict of interests made out here? I agree with you. I agree with Laura. The waters are very muddy on that.

There was no pre-existing romantic relationship, but after he was hired, the relationship developed. These things happen. There was never any sort of plan or intentionality about it. So the question of when was an important issue to begin with. And now it's amplified many times over because the D.A. has taken a very strong under oath position that it did not start until after. And the question to me, Jake, is who will the judge credit? Will the judge credit that scene that we just saw from Mr. Bradley? I don't recall. I don't recall. It was speculation or will he credit the written specific texts that Mr. Bradley sent before when asked again if there was a relationship beforehand, his response was absolutely and then he gave details.

Mayor Ed Koch was mayor. But those changes were enshrined into law in 2014. And essentially what they say is that the NYPD cannot cooperate with federal authorities to enforce immigration law. One thing that its important that's gotten lost in the discussion here is that there are exceptions in the law where people who are convicted and that is the keyword there, convicted of certain crimes, including violent offenses, are eventually turned over to immigration enforcement. But the mayor appears to be suggesting he believes that change should happen, so that people are turned over when they are accused of a crime. That would be a significant change, something that supporters of sanctuary city policies say would put undocumented and immigrant communities at risk because they are usually more vulnerable to crime and often afraid to reach out to law enforcement.

There are many concerns among the Arab communities here, the Muslim American communities as well, but extends far beyond that.This is not just simply limited to Dearborn, which, of course, is where the concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans live, and extends to younger voters, progressive voters, Black voters, others. So, Jake, this is something that the White House is viewing as a warning sign. They've already gotten the message to some degree, the president was here earlier this month, he sent his advisers out a couple of times. The question is, will there be a policy change? And that's what this vote for uncommitted is about tonight. It's a protest vote for sure. They are trying to urge the administration to change their policy in the Middle East. Now the White House has been saying consistently, it's not going to be guided by a public opinion or political opinion. But, Jake, there is no doubt about it that Michigan is so central to either sides reelection here, those 15 electoral votes in November will be key to Joe Biden's reelection or to Donald Trumps election as well. He won in 2016, Joe Biden won in 2020, but the outcome of that uncommitted tonight, the strength of that the court certainly is going to show how deep those cracks are in the coalition.

One of the major questions hanging over the Democratic primary today is how many voting uncommitted.

JOCELYN BENSON (D), MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, thanks for having me and no, we don't see any results of any fronts until after the polls close. They're not even calculated by any machines. And so, no one knows until after the polls close what anything is going to look like. But I've been traveling the state today and visiting early voting sites in the 10 days prior, and what I've seen is a lot of enthusiasm, frankly, for the president and a lot of recognition of the importance of being heard and that some people feel he is hearing them, especially with the announcement of the call for attempts for a ceasefire next week. So my job is simply to just to make sure however, anyone expresses their vote that they've got the tools to do so. But we are seeing a lot of voter enthusiasm across the board and a lot of recognition that the eyes of the nation are on Michigan, not just in this election, but will be this fall.
