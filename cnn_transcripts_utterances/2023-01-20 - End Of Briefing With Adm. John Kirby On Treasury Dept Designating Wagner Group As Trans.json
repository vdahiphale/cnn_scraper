      "sentences": "Listening to John Kirby there. He's currently talking about the tanks and why he believes they're needed, saying it's time sensitive in Ukraine. That it's a relevant critical need.This comes though, if you're just joining us, on the heels of a briefing where Kirby was talking about the designation by the Treasury Department of the Wagner Group, which is this mercenary group, which has, as we know, been working on the part of Russia in Ukraine, they will be designated a transitional criminal organization. More sanctions could be coming next week. Why now? Kirby saying this basically opens up the avenue for sanctions. And also may have an impact on the group's ability to do business around the world. Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling is still with us. So, General Hertling, when we see this, you know, I think it's always a good question of, OK, so there's this designation, OK, there could be more sanctions next week. Practically, though, what is that impact? LT. GEN MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It was a great question by the reporter in the briefing room asking, well, what does this mean? When you talk about the Treasury Department opening up those kinds of investigations and sanctions, many people think the Treasury Department just handles money. But they look around the world to see how money is being transferred to different organizations through different people. So when you're talking about the Wagner Group attempting to buy weapons and literally becoming an international arms dealer with North Korea, I'm sure a lot of people that are in private organization, Prigozhin's Wagner Group, can be sanctioned. Bank accounts can be discovered. They can look for how they're paying the North Koreans for doing this as well as individuals in North Korea. That's just one example, Erica, but there are other examples. That you could garner more intelligence. You could find out more things that are going on between the relationship between North Korea and Russia. And it could negatively affect Russia's capability of fighting the war in Ukraine. So those are the kinds of things that happen. It's not just the ability to say, hey, we're going to call these people and classify them a certain group. It has to do with what legal, commercial, economic systems can then do against those organizations.",

But it's significant because it's the first time DOJ is going to be engaging withes new House Judiciary Committee, which, of course, is run by Republicans. And Jim Jordan, who is leading that committee, has signaled he is very interested in delving into ongoing investigations. And specifically pointed to the special counsel probe into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents and the special counsel probe into Joe Biden's handling of classified documents as areas he wants to look into. And this new subcommittee they authorized to look into the purported weaponization of the federal government, that subcommittee is authorized to look into ongoing criminal investigation.

If Congress wants to ask the attorney general, any Congress, any attorney general, what are your top priorities, where are you focusing resources, why are you emphasizing or de-emphasizing this area of enforcement? That's fair game. But there's no mystery here.By the way, House Republicans have said in their new subcommittee and statements, we are going to ask about specific ongoing investigations. They want to dig into the Trump probe and dig into the Biden probe. And those cases or United States versus unknown normal person should all be completely off-limits. Because once you open that door, if you're DOJ, you start testifying about ongoing cases, you jeopardize those case. Obviously, you jeopardize the presumption of innocence of the people who are being investigated.

And if they want to look into the purported weaponization, fine, you can do that in certain ways. What you cannot do is not go into pending ongoing cases. You want to ask about past cases, you want to dig into the history a little bit, you want to ask about policy, how do you do things in the Justice Department, how do you decide where your priorities sit, that's fine.

That was a Republican Congress but joined by 17 Democrats who voted to hold him in contempt. Then in 2019, Bill Barr was held in contempt over the attempt to include a citizenship question on the census. Now, nothing happened to either of them. But contempt is meaningful.

Pharmaceutical company, Merck, says it has finally found out how some of the diabetes drugs became contaminated with a cancer-causing compound and is now trying to reduce the levels. CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Tara Narula, joining us now. So the FDA said last August Merck found the potential carcinogens in some of the drugs. Now they know how it got there, but still really troubling. DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is definitely scary when you hear about this. But it does happen. And we talked a little bit about this in 2018 about these compounds being found in some heartburn medications and blood pressure medications. And you may remember that many of the drugs were recalled at the time. And in fact, in 2020, the FDA issued some guidance to the companies about how to keep the nitrosamines from becoming part of the drugs that they're creating. We know that can happen during the manufacturing process, those chemical reactions. But nitrosamines are naturally occurring compounds that we can found in the water, air and food, like cured or grilled meats or fish. So we are all exposed to them. The question is what level. It is when those levels are higher than acceptable for long periods of time that there's an increased risk of cancer. So some level is acceptable. And we don't know what level it is that Merck has found. But they are clearly working on it. One key thing is that if you are taking one of the type two diabetes drug -- and these are drugs that are based around a drug around Januvia, don't just stop the drug abruptly, but reach out to your doctor about the next steps. We have reached out to Merck, and they said the company \"has already instituted quality controls and expects to be able to consistently reduce NTTP levels to meet the long-term acceptable daily intake level this year.\" Erica, so that hopefully this is coming soon -- Erica?",
