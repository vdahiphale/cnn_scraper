While there was a rare show of bipartisan cooperation, Republican dysfunction in the House is ramping up this week. MAGA hardliners, they are expected to try to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his position. They're outraged over his deal with Democrats to keep the government funded.And from Capitol Hill to the White House, we're following all the latest developments and fallout from yesterday's dramatic turn of events with CNN's Melanie Zanona. She's on set with me here in Washington. And Arlette Saenz is over at the White House. Arlette, let me go to you first. President Biden came out and spoke on this deal today, and he commented on the ugly politics of it all, I guess sensing that there is a large measure of disgust across the country on the part of the American people after all of this. What was his message?",

Now, the White House had really maintained this hands-off approach when it came to negotiations.But what you saw the White House tried to do is exert this external pressure on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and that is something that President Biden repeated again today when he called on McCarthy and House Republicans to adhere to those budget agreements that they had come to a deal on back in the spring as they averted that debt default. But one thing that the president did do is talk about how the American public is tired of the brinksmanship that has been occurring up on Capitol Hill and that Congress needs to avert a quote, manufactured crisis another time.

I mean, if it -- jumping off of what Melanie was talking about a few moments ago, if it comes down to Democrats having to save Kevin McCarthy and keep him in his job as House Speaker, what's going to happen? Will you vote for that? Are Democrats going to vote for that? REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): Jim, if there's anything that is certain after Kevin McCarthy broke his word about the debt ceiling deal in the spring, after putting a bill on the floor that would have had 30 percent cuts that a million seniors would have gone without nutrition, 250,000 children, would have lost their child care, what -- you can definitely conclude is that the American people will be done owning the Republican Party and having Republicans lead the House of Representatives. We have to make sure that we can govern and govern responsibly and giving the Republicans any power, which is the only thing that Kevin McCarthy and Republicans care about, that's very evident, that would be irresponsible on our part. So, I'm going to make a decision based on knowing that I have to be able to effectively represent my constituents and make sure we can take care of them and the Republicans could care less about that.",
