Now, cause can be anything from you don't speak or comprehend English sufficiently to you have some sort of immovable conflict. Also that you just cannot be impartial because you feel so strongly either way about former President Trump. And the Trump team had a big win a few hours ago when prosecutors and the judge agreed that they would separate out how many people are going to be dismissed for cause because they just can't be impartial. That's a win for the Trump team because they want that information to preserve it for appeal. If he's convicted, that's going to be part of their appeal.",

He absolutely did not have to be. But felt egregious on some level, sometimes. But it was to make a point. It was to continue to draw attention to something that had been very effective from a political perspective for months on end. This is different. He has to be here unless he gets a waiver not to be here. And I think the stakes here are also dramatically different. And I think what's difficult coming into this is, when you've got 88 charges in four different indictments and other cases, particularly coming from the special counsel, that I think I've gotten a lot more attention, they felt like there are much higher stakes, felt like the gravity, not just for the individual as the former president, but also for the country, may be more significant. But people were kind of not necessarily remembering that this was the case. This now maybe the only case that we see go to trial.",

I'm joined now by retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks. General, thanks so much for joining us. What do you think? What might a military response from Israel look like? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, certainly could assume any number of forms. First and foremost, if you're talking about what I would call it kinetic response, certainly Israel could decide to cross into Iranian strike research facilities, enrichment facilities, go after the oil fields. In some particular case, which would have a significant economic challenge to Iran, but also would have an amazing downside in terms of the flow of oil, impact to Russia, impact to China. Those are some pretty significant efforts that they could take on. I think, asymmetrically, you know, they could go after Iranian economic interests. But as indicated earlier on your show, those economic interests would have to be very painful for the mullahs, for the senior leadership in Iran itself. You could go after Iranian naval capacity and certainly there could be attacks against the Iranian proxies in Lebanon, a full-force attack into Lebanon, both ground and air. And there could be efforts against what I call the other cats and dogs that exist within the region that they could go after. Look what we're not talking about though. We're not talking about Hamas right now.",

A murder attempt. It's just the sentencing that has to be determined. So a number of nations could get on board and make it very painful for the Iranians. But let's be frank, this is a political year. That's going to have a downside in any type of political campaign there is, if this becomes incredibly inflationary, and if the price of oil starts to get well beyond 100 bucks a barrel.",

What does that say to you about Iran's intentions with this strike?[14:50:00] MARKS: I think their intentions were very clear. This was a swarm not only of drones, very slow-moving drones, low-priced rounds, but also cruise missiles. This was an integrated attack that was, as you indicated, thwarted as a result of Israeli, U.S., Brit. All of those capabilities were stitched together so incredibly well. But what it tells you is Iran's military probably is not as capable as everybody thinks it might be. But for Iran to say it was not intended to be, that it was not intended did to achieve some damage on the ground, and that they knew it might be thwarted, I think as a fairy tale. I think they actually thought -- it's more than just messaging. I think Iran actually thought they'd do some damage.",

Joining me now is former Trump White House lawyer, James Schultz. And, Jim, really appreciate your time. So here's the latest that we have from reporters who are in the room, sort of a pool report of what's happening. So as I said, we know the 96 jurors are there. We know they've been sworn in. So what is the room like as they're starting to go through this process? We understand that the jurors are really staring at the form for president. And you can imagine, right, their jurors called in Manhattan, they show up. And the former president of the United States sitting in the room all day with you. I mean, that's -- that's something. Right? They're all going to go home and talk about it. So there staring at him and he is sort of looking with a tight-lipped smirk, is the description should right now. So, Jim, to the best of your ability, take us inside what's going on here right now. What do you think the stakes are for his legal team going through this first group of 96 jurors?

You know, Donald Trump's going to be able to be at the sidebar. That's going to be something that's going to be compelling. And he's going to be able to look at these jurors in the face.
