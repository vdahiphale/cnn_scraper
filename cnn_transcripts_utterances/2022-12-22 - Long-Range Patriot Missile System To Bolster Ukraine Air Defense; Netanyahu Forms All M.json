Missile experts say a Patriot battery with missiles costs about a billion dollars, so Ukraine shouldn't use these to take out relatively inexpensive Iranian drones. The system itself has six major parts, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- a control station, a radar set, a generator, an antenna, and, of course, the launcher and missiles. It takes about 100 personnel to operate a full system. Nearly 20 countries have Patriot missile batteries. Israel has used them to intercept drones and even Syrian aircraft. Saudi Arabia has effectively used Patriots to intercept ballistic missiles and more from Yemen.",

This is by far the most complicated system that we have given to the Ukrainians.LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  But complete training on Patriot batteries takes weeks, if not more, and time is one luxury Ukraine does not have. LIEBERMANN (on camera):  Pentagon officials say it will take several months to train up the Ukrainians on how to operate the Patriots. They'll try to compress that timeline as much as they can but it is a complex system. And I think we're about to find out if it's even possible to compress it beyond several months. I also wouldn't overlook the other capabilities in this $1.8 billion Ukraine assistance package. More of the HIMARS ammunition that they've used so effectively, more vehicles, precision-guided bomb kits -- JDAMs, in military terminology -- that will allow the Ukrainians to carry out bomb emissions from fighter jets. They'll have some technical know-how that they'll have to implement to make that work on their Soviet-era fighters. But they've done that before and I think there's no doubt they'll do it again. One final note on this package. There is a lot of non-NATO-standard artillery ammunition in here. Why is that significant? The U.S. doesn't produce that, so that's being sourced from elsewhere. That would go to the tubes and the artillery, the ammunition, the weapons that Ukraine already has that will help them with the systems with which they are already familiar for what is still a punishing ground battle.

Research shows a bigger increase was needed every month to keep up with surging inflation this year. We'll talk more about retirement and your 401(k) in just a moment. But looking at markets around the world right now, Hong Kong's Hang Seng up nearly three percent. China signaling more pro-growth measures to help stimulate an economy strangled by COVID-19 lockdowns. In the U.K., the economy shrank again in the third quarter -- the worst performer in the G7.

Also, strong quarterly earnings from Walgreens and Nike. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 finishing the day up more than one percent. But home sales in the -- in the U.S. fell again -- 10 months in a row -- because mortgage rates are scaring prospective buyers. On inflation watch, gas prices fell a penny overnight, now at $3.10 a gallon. Jobless claims and a revision to GDP in the U.S. due out later this morning.

And then it takes about 10 years to let it go to 75 before they have to take withdrawals.But what also happens is most people need the money before those ages. So, while it's nice if you don't need the money, the vast majority of people actually do need the money and begin taking it before this.

Not your retirement account statements. Those are long-term. But your non-tax -- your non- deferred statements. Chances are you have some gains, perhaps, in there and you might have some losses on some of the investments that you have. And what you need to do -- before the end of the year you have to do this -- is if you have any losses, just move them from what you have as a loss into something else. Keep it invested, but just move it. Book that loss. It will help you in your taxes that you're going to have to pay, either if you're paying quarterlies in January or certainly, when you're filing taxes. A lot of people are ignoring that. One of the things you want to do is get in there. Look, if you have losses, you have losses, but book them and turn them into a positive by booking that capital loss and that will offset some of the gains.

It's a painless way to kind of do that every year to try to get up to that maximum contribution level. Those raises -- those amounts that you can put away that have been raised and a lot of people are nowhere near enough, as we talked about, that they need to put away. So it's an easy way to do that.
