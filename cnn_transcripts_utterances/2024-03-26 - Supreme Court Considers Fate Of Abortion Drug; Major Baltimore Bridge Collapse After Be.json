We will, of course, keep an eye on the situation, not only at the bridge, but also with federal investigators and what their update might be. And we'll bring you the very latest as we get it.Meantime, the fate of a widely used abortion medication is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. Soon, the justices are going to decide whether to limit access to the abortion pill, Mifepristone, even in states where the procedure is still allowed. Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in reproductive health care, including for medication abortions and treatments for miscarriage. Research has shown that it is highly safe and effective. It is the most common method of abortion, making up 63 percent of all abortions in the United States last year. Let's take you live outside the Supreme Court now with CNN's Paula Reid. And, Paula, demonstrators on both sides of the debate had -- have been gathering there since arguments got underway. Walk us through what we heard from the high court.",

      "sentences": "It's interesting, Boris. I mean, this is the most significant abortion-related case that the justices have heard since they overturned Roe two years ago.But most of the hearing focusing on a procedural issue, the question of standing or the right to sue. And it appears that the majority of justices appeared skeptical that this conservative group, anti- abortion doctors, medical professionals and advocates have the right to file this lawsuit. Now this group has argued that, at some point, they could be asked to render medical treatment to someone who has had complications from using the Mifepristone and that's something that they would object to. Well, the government says, look, you haven't actually suffered any harm. There's no imminent harm. And there were already federal exemptions if you object to having to offer this kind of treatment. So they're asking the justices to, quote, \"put an end to this case.\" The justices across the political spectrum pressed the lawyers on this question of standing throughout the hearing today. Let's take a listen to what Justice Alito wanted to know. (BEGIN AUDIO FEED) SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: Could you provide a more specific answer to the first question that Justice Thomas asked you? Is there anybody who could challenge in court the lawfulness of what the FDA did here? ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR, SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: in this particular case, I think the answer is no.",

And instead, decide this based on standing. But, Boris, we also heard from a lawyer for a drug company that makes Mifepristone because the stakes here are incredibly high, not just for people who may want access to this drug, but also for the FDA, for its regulatory authority and, of course, the drug that is already approved. So certainly, one of the most significant cases of the term.",

And that is, of course, going to be at the heart of a presidential campaign season.And while, for decades, Republicans have successfully rallied a lot of their supporters around the idea of overturning Roe. Now that that has happened, in the past two years, Democrats have been very successful in galvanizing their supporters around the issue of protecting abortion rights.

The vast majority of our patients are already parenting and they understand exactly what's at hand with their bodies and their health.And they choose medication abortion, for many reasons. One, because it's very acceptable. They can pass the pregnancy at home with their loved ones. it's very safe. It's very affordable. And medication abortion is chosen by over 63 percent of our patients at Whole Woman's Health. And we offer that medication in our clinics as well as abortion pills by mail in the states where we're allowed to do that. And almost a third of the medication abortions we provide are provided via mail in states where people can have a telemedicine visit.

It's about a small group of people's feelings and beliefs being applied to the majority of Americans who don't -- who don't agree with those beliefs. It's radical. It's extreme. And we can't stand for this on our watch. Mifepristone has been available to people in this country for decades and people have chosen it and they prefer it. And not just Democrats. All people, Republicans, people who are parenting, people who are young, people who are managing family and work all over the country, all kinds of people need access to the safe abortion. And we all know somebody and love somebody who's needed access to abortion. And what we need to do when we hear about restrictions like this is really think, how would we want somebody we know and we love to get information? How would we want them to be treated? With kindness and respect and compassion and accurate medical information. And that's what we need to expect in this country.",

      "sentences": "Yes, these were massive searches that these large estates, both, as you mentioned, in Miami and here where I am in Los Angeles. Dozens of federal agents descending on these properties yesterday, owned by Sean Combs.We're told from a law enforcement source that agents were looking for phones, laptops, any type of removable storage media that can store pictures, that can store videos. And again, as you mentioned, we know from a law enforcement source telling her colleague, John Miller, that Combs himself is the target of this federal investigation. A separate law enforcement source telling me this pertains to sex trafficking. Now, the lead agency here is HIS, Homeland Security Investigations. That was a telltale sign yesterday as we saw all of these vehicles rolling in, all of these federal agents with uniforms and vehicles emblazoned with the letters \"HSI.\" That was important because this is a federal agency that specializes in human trafficking. And so a very serious investigation that is now underway. We, of course, have reached out to representatives of Combs. We have not yet heard back any comment on the searches that took place yesterday. But, of course, Boris, Combs himself has come under legal scrutiny in recent months. In December, there was a woman referred to as John Doe in a civil lawsuit, who claims that she was 17 at the time, back in 2003, when she was allegedly sexually assaulted. She indicated that Combs -- accusing him of sex trafficking and gang rape. And Combs had denied that. But then, just last month, a former employee of Combs also filed a suit claiming harassment, saying that he was forced to procure and interact with sex workers, accusing Combs' son of bringing underage girls to parties. So again, as you look at all of this together, it seems to make sense that when you have those types of allegations from individuals, the feds likely launched their own investigation. The result of that being the search that we saw yesterday. Of course, we're waiting to see what specifically investigators found at either location and whether that will result in any the type of prosecution --Boris? SANCHEZ: Josh, you mentioned the HSI logo on the side of these large, armored trucks and other vehicles. I'm wondering, what does this kind of response tell you? Because aesthetically, it looks like something out of a war zone.",

A law enforcement source tells us that's because Combs had private armed security at those locations.And so now I can tell you, having done a number of these searches in a previous life, you obviously want to bring whatever resources that you need in order to potentially be on standby should there be any potential issues. Obviously, yesterday, there were no issues. But you had those tactical agents that were there. And I can tell you that there's a separate psychological aspect as well. If someone finds themselves under a federal investigation, particularly one as serious as sex trafficking, as human trafficking, you can imagine that people in that type of situation may do things that could potentially be violent if it feels as though their life is caving in on them with federal prosecutors and federal agents at the door. So a lot of this could be just psychological. Look, the best result here, if someone inside that home was thinking about doing something that they shouldn't, don't. You're outmatched. You're outgunned. Obviously, none of that was needed. But certainly, you can imagine federal agents bring every resource that they need to a situation like that. Again, the topic here, Sex trafficking, very serious.",
