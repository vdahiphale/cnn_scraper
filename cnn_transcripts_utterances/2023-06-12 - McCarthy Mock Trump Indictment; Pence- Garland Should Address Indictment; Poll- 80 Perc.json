Look, the documents were unlawfully in Donald Trump's possession, which is bad enough, which is a violation of the law.

You could argue that they have no choice, but I think we just have to be clear-eyed that that is what is happening right now. This is going to be a candidate who's going to be running for the nomination with not one, not two, but possibly three and more indictments against him.

They're just talking more generally about it. And that's a comfortable place to be within the Republican electorate.
