      "sentences": "Yes. We can expect this to be drawn out in court just almost immediately after this news broke. Judge Robert McBurney, the superior court judge here in Georgia, issuing his opinion. It was almost immediately after that that the attorney general reached out here in the state of Georgia and they that they're going to file a notice of appeal.But as of right now, effective immediately, the procedure is now legal up to 20 weeks. And this ruling by Judge McBurney was in responsible to a lawsuit by pro-abortion rights groups that move to ban or move to strike down rather the so-called heartbeat bill, which they said was unconstitutional. It's officially known as the life act and it banned, with some exceptions, abortion when early cardiac activity could be detected, which is as early as six weeks, at a time when many women do not know that they're pregnant. Judge Robert McBurney here in Georgia is saying that when this law was voted on, passed and enacted, it was unconstitutional because the law of the land protected pre-viability abortion. So, this is part in his ruling, saying, quote, everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments, federal, state or local to ban abortions before viability. If the courts have spoken clearly and directly as to what the law is, as to what is and is not constitutional, legislatures and legislators are not at liberty to pass laws contrary to such pronouncements. So, I mentioned that appeal already being launched. We did reach out to the governor's office here. Georgia Governor Kemp, he campaigned in part on his stance on abortion. And they're not happy with the judge's ruling, saying almost immediately after it that today's ruling places the personal beliefs of a judge over the will of a legislature and the people of Georgia. The state has already filed a notice of appeal and we will continue to fight for the lives of Georgia's unborn children. But as for now, effective immediately, abortion, the procedure is now allowed and legal again up to 20 weeks in Georgia. Guys?",

So, this was a study that basically looked at 20 countries, they reviewed over 33 studies and put them all together for over 20 years worth of data. And they found that 1 billion individuals ages 12 to 34 are at risk for hearing loss and this is due to unsafe listening, either from personal listening devices, things like phones, MP3 players or entertainment venues, so concerts, clubs, discos, all of that.And it is a public health issue. We know that 40 million American adults have some form of hearing loss. It has an economic impact, about a trillion dollars a year. It impacts us in other ways, our academics, our income, our cognitive function, our social well-being. So, it's really important to pay attention to hearing. We take it for granted.",

And we don't really know what it does when we're starting so early, right? Does that accelerate the risk for hearing loss when you start young?But we're talking about both the intensity, the duration, the frequency of exposure, all of that matters. And those inner ear structures, as you mentioned in the lead are very sensitive. We have hair cells that were born with very tiny, very delicate, or born with a certain amount. If you damage them, they are not going to regenerate. You also have nerves and fibers that can get damaged. And so just to kind of give you a perspective on what types of sounds can be damaging, in general, under 70 decibels is relatively safe. So, our conversation would be 60 decibels. Anything that's sustained over 85 decibels is considered putting you at risk. And when you look at those personal listening devices, those can be up to 105 decibels, and actually entertainment venues up 112. So important turn the volume down, please.",

You get the code, you'd have access to be able to get these presale tickets.Well, what ends up happening is there was unprecedented demand, Ticketmaster's word, unprecedented demand for these tickets. And so what some people saw was that they were in line for hours and then couldn't get the ticket because they were sort of kicked off the website or the tickets disappeared or they had to wait for hours to get it. And so it's just a really unpleasant experience for a lot of people. And so people are still on Twitter outraged, some have said, heartbroken, because either they weren't able to get these tickets or it was just such an awful experience being able to get it.
