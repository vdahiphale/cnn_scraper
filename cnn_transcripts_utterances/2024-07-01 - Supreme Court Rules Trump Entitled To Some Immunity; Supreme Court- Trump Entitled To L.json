And of course, the powers of the presidency itself. It is a ruling that could very well redefine those powers possible outcomes include granting the former president full immunity from criminal prosecution, effectively ending the election subversion case against him, to allowing him some degree of immunity to rejecting his immunity claim outright, therefore thereby green lighting the criminal case against him for attempting to overturn the election.

It was so important that during the Watergate case, the court unanimously rejected the idea that the president is completely immune from subpoena related to Watergate. And the reason that this case is arising is because President Trump tried to overturn the election, just as he was leaving office, and the line between his official and unofficial acts were blurred for the first time. But what's so striking about this case is before the oral argument, no one expected any broad immunity to exist, because the court had so repeatedly said that the president is not above the law. But all of a sudden, the question of distinguishing between official and unofficial acts is present. The bottom line is, no one wants a political rival to be able to prosecute a president because they disagree with his policy decisions, and want to make that criminal. And that's what the court is struggling with, how to distinguish between official and unofficial acts so you don't have that kind of political prosecutions. But it's hugely significant because a broad immunity argument could mean that, you know, a president could engage in criminal activity without being held accountable. And that's why everyone expects a kind of nuanced balancing test that will allow presidents to be prosecuted for stuff that is completely outside of their official actions.",

And thus, there are those things not being in the indictment. It cannot be argued that the president is being charged with those things, although they may be evidence of his criminality. So, I think there is a way for that indictment to go forward, or at least that case to go forward based upon a superseding indictment.

Julian Zelizer, would an originalist as the conservatives on this court say they , I know there have been some criticisms about whether they're originalist at times and not in others.

So, the idea that there would be unbound power written into the Constitution seems antithetical to what is called originalism, although I think even that term is misleading.

And Justice Gorsuch in particular, who seemed interested in creating a broad immunity argument. And not only the more liberal justices, but even Justice Barrett, who was focusing much more pragmatically on separating out the official from the unofficial act. So, for all those reasons, although predictions are dangerous idea, a very sweeping broad blanket immunity seems unlikely to get five justices.

And it is givingsome immunity around the presidency for official acts. There is a presumptive absolute immunity for official acts. But there is no immunity for unofficial acts. This is very much in line. But we thought the Supreme Court may be leaning toward doing drawing lines around the presidency. But where those lines are drawn, that's going to take us a little time to figure out, Jim, because of the depth of this. The number of pages, 119, to read right now. And so, we are getting a little bit more information on that what this does, though, procedurally, at the very top line is it wipes away what the D.C. Circuit had done, which said, Donald Trump doesn't get any immunity here. He is -- she should go on to trial. That is not necessarily what is going to happen next, there's going to need to be more proceedings, and this will go back down through the lower courts to interpret in the coming days.",

And the majoritydraws a very clear distinction between official and unofficial acts. And the crucial holding is that a president is entitled to presumption immunity not only for official acts, but for actions at the perimeter of his duties, because criminally prosecuting a president for official conduct poses a greater threat of intrusion on to the authority and functions of the executive branch than simply seeking evidence in his possession. To put this in context, the Court had held in the Nixon Fitzgerald case that there is a presumption of immunity for against civil prosecution for conduct related to the president's official acts, and at the perimeter of those acts. And for the first time in American history, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a similar immunity from criminal prosecution, both for official acts and those of the perimeters. I must emphasize the historic nature of this decision. Aaron Burr was prosecuted for treason and the Court ordered President Jefferson to turn over evidence. President Nixon was criminally investigated, and the Court ordered him to answer a subpoena. While citing the Burr and Nixon cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that for the first time in American history, that the president is presumptively immune for prosecution from his official acts, and over a vigorous dissent by three liberal justices, this is a historic day in American history, and it will have tremendous implications for the conduct of the presidency moving forward.",

Of course, historians have said that over the last several decades, there has been more power that has been provided to the person holding office and we are seeing some of some more of that today. The president himself has not weighed in on former President Donald Trump's legal troubles, since he took office, usually saying mum on the matter. But last December, he was asked by reporters if he believes any president is immune from criminal prosecution. And at the time, President Biden responded, \"I can't think of one.\" So, we are still waiting for the White House statement and the response from President Biden himself.
