I'm Becky Anderson. You are watching \"Connect the World\". We are following two major stories for you this hour. With only eight weeks ago, until a pivotal U.S. election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump face off in Philadelphia in front of tens of millions of voters. The last presidential debate was the death knell for Joe Biden's campaign. So how can Harris avoid a similar fate? We will be bringing you analysis and predictions later this hour. First, though, our main international story and a strike by Israeli forces on a safe zone has left scores of people dead, wounded or missing. It happened at a camp housing tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Southern Gaza, while people were sleeping in tents. The Israeli military says it struck Hamas terrorists operating a command center embedded in the humanitarian safe zone in Khan Yunis. Hamas denies its fighters were present. Witnesses say at least five missiles struck the Al-Mawasi area. Gaza, civil defense officials say some 20 to 40 tents were destroyed, and entire families have disappeared in the sand.

Well, the world will be watching as U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Former President Donald Trump face-off in what is their first Presidential Debate just hours from now. With only eight weeks to go until the election, the debate has the potential to be a defining moment as they battle it out in Philadelphia, in front of the eyes, as it were, of tens of millions of voters. National polls show the race remains extremely tight. So much is at stake for both candidates as they take to the debate stage tonight Tuesday. Well, I want to bring in Democratic Political Strategist and Consultant Simon Rosenberg and Republican CNN Political Commentator S.E. Cupp to both of you thank you. Very big day. Can you just explain, if you will, just how big it is? Just what's at stake here, Simon let's start with you. SIMON ROSENBERG, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST &amp; CONSULTANT: It's a big day. I mean, we have a very close, competitive election right now, so every day matters. I think this is an important day for both candidates. Kamala Harris is still not as well known to the American people as Donald Trump. She's got a story that she needs to be able to tell to the American people about who she is and where she wants to take the country? And also define do her work to define Donald Trump as being unfit and unwell and untethered to reality. She's going to -- so, I think both candidates are going to be trying to tell their story and define the other one. And I think that, you know, we feel good about where we are. I mean, we feel like -- you know we are where we need to be polling wise. We've got a superior ground and field operation that we think will make a big difference in the end. But this is a big day, and we need -- and Democrats need to have a good day today.",

CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yeah, we've seen Donald Trump debate a lot. You know, unlike Kamala Harris, Simon is right, she really has to sort of introduce herself to especially undecided voters. We talked to a lot of undecided voters in our seven swing states who say they don't know her enough. But Donald Trump is well known. We've seen him debate. We've seen several Donald Trump show up as you mentioned. We saw a pretty disciplined Donald Trump debate Joe Biden the last time, but we've also seen a very erratic, aggressive, unlikeable Donald Trump show up to debates, especially when he is debating a woman. And so, I think the task for him tonight is to not be too aggressive with Kamala Harris, because we know from polling our swing state voters, especially suburban women, really don't like when he attacks her personally. And those are the voters he needs to get. Those are the voters both of the candidates are going for tonight. So that's key and crucial.",

The problem is, he can't help himself from going personal. He didn't have to work that hard against Joe Biden, because Joe Biden was not a very good debater that night, as we all know. Kamala Harris is a good debater, and I don't think she'll be rattled by Donald Trump very much. However, she's got another task. She's really got to explain her policies and her policy shifts to voters. Voters are very forgiving. They understand people want to change their minds. Sometimes they want to know why, and I'm hearing from a lot of swing state voters who are undecided. They're concerned she's changing her mind just to get elected. They want to know that she's going to govern the way that she's running, and that she's not just saying what she has to, to win.

She's ready to do the job of being President of the United States. She's staring down -- she's done, I think a better job at talking about Donald Trump and all of his issues than any other Democrat over the last nine years. I think she's been very effective because she's coming at it. And I think the way that she's conveying this, which is, I have been in courtrooms with people like Donald Trump, with serial criminals like Donald Trump, people who abused women like Donald Trump, people who stole from the government and their -- and their colleagues like Donald Trump, and I've been successful at prosecuting and putting them in jail. And I think that what we've seen with her is this experience of her staring down bad people and people who've done bad things is really served her well in this race against this man who is a bad man. And I think that she's clearly not intimidated by him. And I think it's been core to her positioning and her strength in these early weeks of the campaign. And I think you're going to see that tonight. I mean, she introduced herself in her very first speech as somebody who was a career prosecutor and an attorney general, and somebody who has a history of dealing with people like Trump.

A lot of them were exploring independent candidates like Cornel West and RFK Jr. They were considering staying home. They just didn't like either of these candidates. She has brought a number of young voters back to the Democratic Party. And she's making up a lot of ground that Joe Biden had kind of lost with this core base, but she's got to exceed those expectations. She's got to win over more voters. And the war in Gaza is still a real sticking point for a lot of young voters. So, I expect that will be a question or -- tonight, she's got to explain what her point of view on that issue is, and while she doesn't want to pander to young voters on it. I think she does need to sound a little different than Joe Biden has sounded on it if she wants to win those voters over. Now again, the key constituents that both candidates need are undecided voters in seven key swing states. That's it. That's the whole ball game.

Just break it down for us, if you will? What's going on here? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: So, Becky, the real purpose of this mission. And it's not just one mission. It's going to be three separate missions, all part of the Polaris program, and the purpose of it is to advance SpaceX's ultimate goal of someday colonizing Mars. So, you have this billionaire American businessman and philanthropist Jared Isaacman, who first flew to space three years ago on the inspiration for mission. He came back and said, Look, I see what you guys, what SpaceX is trying to do, colonize Mars and land NASA astronauts back on the moon. But before you can do that, there's some certain key steps, key milestones, that you guys have to reach. Let me help fund it. And so that's what he's doing.

She has really leaned into this idea of an opportunity economy, that there needs to be an economy that works for everyday Americans. And that looks like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, expanding affordable housing, giving first time home buyers, $25,000 loans, for instance. And so, I think we will hear a lot more of this, and then her also lean into her personal biography as a mechanism to convey that she understands what it is like to struggle.
