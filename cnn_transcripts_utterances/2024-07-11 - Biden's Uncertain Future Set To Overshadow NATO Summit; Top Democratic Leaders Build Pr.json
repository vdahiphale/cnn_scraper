      "sentences": "Well, of course, there's certainly been a lot of confusion and anger and sadness inside the White House across the administration, the campaign and across the Democratic Party, more broadly, since the President's really halting and shocking debate performance.My colleagues and I have spoken over the course of the last two weeks to dozens of democratic sources, including I should note senior Democrats who have spent real time with the President and in some cases have known the president for years. And what has been striking is that none of them had ever seen this version of President Biden that we all saw on the debate stage that was so off altering, and days, and plenty of officials that we spoke with said look, of course, we've known that the President has age. He is certainly not the same person that we know from say a year ago. But what they had said and that was so noteworthy is that they said they couldn't have possibly known about the full extent of the President's decline. And what many of them blame at this point is this apparatus and daily operation that is built around the President that is so painfully choreographed, and stage managed, they said that is designed to prevent the president from being often out in these unscripted settings for an extended period of time. And that really what that meant was that only a small circle of inner circle of advisors and perhaps family members could have known about sort of this full picture of the President's condition. Just one example of that is in our story is that according to two sources, before cabinet meetings that the President attends, cabinet officials will submit their questions and talking points, key talking points and bullet points that they plan to present to the president in these closed door meetings. This is how one source described that they said the entire display is kind of an act, they would come and say, hey, the President is going to call on you about 25 minutes in and ask this question, what are the bullet points that you'll respond with? Now, the White House's defense has been that that is standard practice for any administration. They said, in a setting like this, you never want the president to be not aware of what is going to be discussed. They want to also just be mindful of the President's time. But we also spoke with sources from the Obama years who said in the cabinet meetings for former President Barack Obama, those were never this meticulously scripted. Now, more broadly, in response to our story and our reporting, the White House really defended the breadth of the President's travels, his engagements with the press, and certainly his record over the last three and a half years and provided comments from senior officials defending the President as being a sharp and engage and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates also said this as a part of his response. He said, Joe Biden has always said that it is fair for reporters to ask about his age, and as always confidently shown his values his agenda, intelligence and determined determination to the American people. Well, in just a few hours, we are of course about to see that play out the President taking questions from reporters, and we certainly expect many of those questions will be at precisely about these issues.",

      "sentences": "Jessica, we got a glimpse of the President just a few minutes ago when he held a bilateral meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Each leader spoke President Biden briefly he appeared steely, and serious as he pledged continued support for Ukraine and a desire to end the war as quickly as possible.The president according to the pool, ignoring a question that was shouted from reporters about the future of his candidacy, and whether he would answer those calls to step aside. But of course, that is the backdrop for this entire summit, an event that was supposed to celebrate the achievements that President Biden has set are a hallmark of his presidency of uniting and expanding this 75-year old alliance and standing up to aggression overseas. Now, the questions are about the President's own fitness and his capacity to continue serving in this leadership role in the United States and on the world stage. To that end, there have been many public proclamations of support for the president from his national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who said that the President simply had a bad night at the debate and said that world leaders had a drumbeat of praise for him here at the summit. The Finnish President, in particular, saying that after seeing the President this week, he has no doubts about his capacity. And then there is the campaign, which is coming out in response to many critics who have said if there is a path for President Biden to win reelection than the campaign needs to disclose exactly what that is in the campaign to that effect, putting out a memo on that very topic that says, that said that it was essentially a margin of error race in key battleground states, we maintain multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes. Right now winning the blue wall, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, is the clearest pathway, although the campaign does acknowledge a deterioration in the polling, specifically that many Democratic voters or voters who are identified as Democrats have moved to undecided. But the campaign suggested they could win those back. But that's coming as there are widespread concerns that perhaps many in the President's base or in the independent voters are too far gone and that they can't unsee what they saw on the debate stage. That's what we've heard from many lawmakers when they've been asked, can you hear anything from President Biden at this press conference that could change your mind? Many of those Democratic lawmakers who have already turned have told CNN? No.",

And it's -- that is the sentiment that is creating all this panic inside Democratic circles with members with donors, and the like.I understand the Biden operation is trying to shut that down. But as you noted, Jessica, the fact that the Democratic Leader in the House, he's not saying shut this down. He's saying this is an ongoing conversation. Nancy Pelosi is saying, this is a decision that Joe Biden still needs to make, despite him saying he's made his decision. Those are senior Democratic leaders in the party telling the President they're not done discussing this yet. SANCHEZ: One of the factors in the initial reporting about Biden deciding to stay in that might sway him had to do with polling, and we actually got a new poll from ABC News in The Washington Post. And it shows that Trump and Biden at least nationally, are in a pretty close race well with us.",

You saw our poll last week shows her performing a bit better against Trump within the margin of error. But performing a bit better than Joe Biden is.I mean, here's the reality. Before the debate, Joe Biden's path to 270 was Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. And that was really the clearest path because we had already sort of assessed that Georgia was starting to lean away, Nevada was starting to lean away. These other Arizona is starting to lean away. And so that was the case before the debate, guys. He was already in a position that he had to sweep that so called blue wall. That's only gotten harder since the debate in those states. And the fact that the campaign is trying to sell the Senate Democrats today or publicly with this memo saying that is still our path doesn't acknowledge the reality that that path became tougher.

A Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. Is there anything that President Biden can do at this point, to change your position to change your mind? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): No, I mean, because he can't undo the debate, the 90 minutes of that debate. And you can't undo the response that came after the debate that, frankly, did little to quell the fears about Biden's ability to effectively communicate the message, and also to transparently explain any concerns about his health.

I know, Speaker Pelosi has a similar view, and maybe they'll have that conversation. But sadly, look, from the moment Joe Biden walked off that debate stage almost well, two weeks ago now, there was only one thing to do. But team Biden decided not to do it. They decided to hunker down and go forward. And, you know, I don't know what information could be provided to them. Because part of the problem is everybody's got a poll these days. You know, you can pick your favorite polls, like a Rorschach test. I mean, I don't think there's any question that when you have two- thirds of the country, saying that he shouldn't run when you have a majority of Democrats, saying that he shouldn't run in polls that the White House is touting as being a positive.
