On Sunday, Ukrainian forces liberated three villages in the Donetsk region, according to the country's deputy defense ministry.You can see here, fighters hanging the Ukrainian flag from a newly- recaptured frontline village. Ukraine also says it's making some counterattacks around the embattled city of Bakhmut. Meanwhile, we're seeing more repercussions from the destroyed dam in the Kherson region. Ukrainian officials say at least 14 people have died in the flooding and nearly 3,000 have been evacuated. Ukraine's president says the destruction of the dam is now being investigated as a possible war crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Recently, representatives of the International Criminal Court visited the Kherson region. It is very important that representatives of international justice saw with their own eyes the consequences of this Russian terrorist attack and hear personally that Russian terror continues. And it continues with the most cynical and brutal shelling of the flooded territory, the evacuation territory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Ukrainians, on Sunday say that they took back several villages from the Russians.Most of that happening in the sort of Southeastern part of the very long frontline here in this country. And that, of course, also comes after things seemed to get up off a rocky start at the end of last week, with the Russians hosting a couple of videos claiming to have destroyed a lot of armor, a lot of Western armor, in what they said were failed operations by the Ukrainians to try and gain territory in the Southern part of Ukraine. Now, the Ukrainians are still not calling this the big counteroffensive. There were some indications by the Ukrainian president this weekend, saying that the Ukrainians have now gone to defensive counteroffensive operations. Then on Sunday, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, he came out and he posted a video of himself, just sitting in his chair being silent at the end of what the Ukrainians said plans love silence. Obviously, once again, saying that they don't talk by the big counteroffensive, if, indeed, it is already underway. But one of the things that is clear is that right now, in this country, the Ukrainians certainly have the initiative. There is no place where the Russians seem to be making gains. But a lot of places where the Ukrainians certainly are trying to make gains. One of those places is Bakhmut, where on Sunday, the Ukrainians once again said that they have won back territory. And this comes after several days of gains which the Ukrainians say have been significant. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So that's one side of it. The other part including the Wagner Group and other paramilitary organizations, mercenary organizations. And the tension between the mercenary organizations and the Russian ministry of defense and the regular armed forces is really exceptionally notable. And what that does is it gives the Russian war effort -- makes it very hard for them to coordinate their operations.

She was arrested Sunday morning, held for more than seven hours of questioning, and then released without charge pending further investigation, according to police. Now, a spokesperson for Sturgeon initially said that she went voluntarily and will cooperate with the investigation. We've now also heard from Sturgeon herself, who said, in part, \"To find myself in the situation I did today, when I am certain I have committed no offense is both a shock and deeply distressing. Innocence is not just a presumption I am entitled to in law. I know beyond doubt that I am, in fact, innocent of any wrongdoing.\" Now, she went on to say that she will continue to sit as a member of the Scottish Parliament. She stepped down as party leader in February, citing the brutality of frontline politics. And at that time, it came as a pretty big shock to British politics, because she had been one of the most successful and effective political leaders in the U.K. over the past eight years.

Because this indictment is so explicit in the evidence that it has, because of the photos of documents in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago; photos of boxes of documents spilled in a storage room; and then those 31 charges, each representing a document that Donald Trump is accused of willfully retaining outside of the protected area of the federal government, top-secret documents. Classified documents, national security information.Here's more of what Bill Barr had to say on Sunday on FOX News. BILL BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: If even half of it is true, then he's toast. I mean, it's a pretty -- it's a very detailed indictment, and it's very, very damning. And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is ridiculous. He's not a victim here. He was totally wrong that he had the right to have those documents.

So there's the extent of what the president might have done beyond that, which is listed in the indictment. And trying to determine the full extent of the damages, as I said, is going to also include the use of sources and methods which you do not want to expose in a trial.

It can also have an effect, for example, on the ice sheet, melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It can contribute to global sea level rise, or it is contributing to global sea level rise. And that will continue in the future.So certainly, will have a major effect on the residents.",

The ice-free season would be much longer in the higher emissions scenarios.And therefore, if we're able to reduce emissions, to get emissions down to net zero by the middle of the century, that will still limit the climate change in the Arctic. There's a certain amount we -- we're committed to already, but we -- the changes will be a lot worse if we're not able to reduce emissions.",
