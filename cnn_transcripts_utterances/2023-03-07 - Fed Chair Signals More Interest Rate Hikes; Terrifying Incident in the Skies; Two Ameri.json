Just a short time ago, all four were found, but two were dead. Authorities have not identified the victims. But we do know that a mother of six from South Carolina crossed the border from Texas with three of her friends for a medical procedure. But investigators believe that, once they were in the city of Matamoros, the group was mistakenly kidnapped by Mexican cartel members. We have disturbing footage of this incident. You can see here it shows the terrifying moments Friday when at least one of those Americans was shoved into the bed of a pickup truck at gunpoint in broad daylight, and not far from the United States border. Our correspondents are covering this from all angles. Josh Campbell, you are getting information from your law enforcement sources about the condition of the victims and where exactly they were found.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby.I have been talking to sources since this incident began on Friday. And to a person, they said, look, we're holding out hope that we will find these four. But the situation was very grim. And it's because of that video that you just showed. This was the dramatic aftermath of that incident, where you see a woman being shoved into the back of that truck in this graphic video. There are other people around that truck who don't appear to be moving. They were lifted on that vehicle as they drove away. And so because those people weren't moving, that obviously gave law enforcement great concern. We are learning today from a U.S. official familiar with this investigation that all four have been recovered, but, sadly, two of them are deceased. Now, the other two -- among the two that are alive, one of them, the source says, is severely injured. Now, we just learned a short time ago from a source that the two surviving victims are now in the care of FBI agents. They have crossed the port of entry back into the United States, where they will be receiving medical attention and medical care at a hospital there in Texas. And, of course, the FBI is still working this investigation to try to determine who was responsible. So those two surviving victims would be key to interview, to gather as much information as they can. Now, I'm told as far as the two deceased American victims, they will be processed, their remains, by the medical examiner's office there in Mexico to determine the cause of death. And then, after that is complete, a source tells me that they expect the remains to be promptly handed over to U.S. officials, where they will then be repatriated back to the United States. But, of course, just a tragic end to this, with two of them killed, one severely injured. As I mentioned, one of them is still alive. This, of course, happened Friday after this group was traveling in New Mexico for what a source says was to seek a medical treatment, some type of medical procedure, which, of course, Americans and Canadians do all the time, travel into Mexico for lower-cost prescription drugs, for low-price medical care. But, of course, this is a part of Mexico where the U.S. State Department has this travel warning citizens not to go there, this obviously ending in tragedy. And, finally, I will point out one source says that they appear -- that it appears, at least according to law enforcement, that these Americans were targeted by mistake, that it was a Gulf cartel group that thought that these Americans were part of some Haitian drug smuggling outfit, but targeting these Americans by mistake, leading to this extremely, extremely tragic event -- Abby.",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, we heard from the White House national security advisers, John Kirby expressing condolences to the families of those who were killed in this incident, not getting into the specifics of the circumstances surrounding that yet.He said that the Biden administration, U.S. officials are still working with Mexican authorities to learn more about really what happened here. And what they're focused on, of course, is trying to get home the bodies of all four Americans. Of course, as of now, we know that two of them will be dead and two alive, but trying to get all four of them back to the United States. The other thing that John Kirby told reporters is that the Biden administration is working to make sure that justice is served. And what that, of course, will involve is not just the State Department, but also the Department of Justice. And we heard from the attorney general earlier today, saying that he has been briefed with the FBI on this, and that the Justice Department is working closely with the State Department on this matter. And the next step for State Department officials will be notifying the families of these four Americans about their status, if they in fact, awfully, died in this instance, or if they're still alive, and what the next steps are in terms of getting them back to the United States. And then we're likely to hear more from the State Department. But, Abby, it's also important to note that it wasn't just the State Department that had very clear warnings to Americans to not travel to this area of Mexico because of the criminal activity, because of the violence there, because of the kidnappings in the murders, but it's also the CDC that had warned Americans against going there for exactly what this woman from South Carolina was there for, which is these medical procedures, warning that there can be complications that arise from these procedures that are carried out in this area of Mexico.",

      "sentences": "We don't know much about what happened there in terms of how they were recovered. We only know that they were found.The FBI is collaborating with Mexican officials. How do you think they were able to identify where these people were and get them back? And I should say, from what we know, so far, the two Americans who are alive are back in American custody, but the two bodies of the deceased, they will have to be recovered by their family members. D'AMICO:  Well, yes, ma'am. It's almost standard that they're going to process the dead within the country that they're killed, because their justice system may be the one that we use. So there's probably FBI or State Department people with those deceased, because, again, we want them in our care, even though they're in Mexican custody. We did this in Afghanistan and Iraq. We process them with the home country. We make sure that they're treated dignified. But we do let the home country do that. The ones that have come back, the FBI's victim assistance are unbelievable. They have a lot of experience. These people have gone through traumatic things. One, you want to get the injured to the right level care down in Texas, get that -- get him or her into the hospital. And then, the other one, that we do have a case, but again, the mental health of these people is the most important thing. So the agents are with them. Some of the victims like this want to tell the story. Some wait a little bit. And our agents are used to that. But we will have psychologists come down and help with those interviews. But the process is long. We have arrested people 20, 25 years after they have killed Americans around the world. I have been on those ops, and they're -- as bad as they are, it is justice served after a long time. PHILLIP:  Just bottom line here, I mean, would you recommend that Americans travel to Mexico right now, particularly this part of the country? D'AMICO:  No. People have to really pay attention to the warnings out there. Level 4 from the State Department is a drastic warning. And you really have to start looking. I think part of it, she went down there a couple years ago and had a procedure. So she I think felt like, hey, we have done this before, we will go down and do this. But things get worse. And, again, the cartels have been warring and other things are coming up. You really have to pay attention to where you're traveling, especially down there. I have four children. And I wouldn't recommend them, even though I think Mexico is going to go over the edge on showing the authority in the streets and everything else. And I think that's how we probably ended up getting them back. I think the cartels realized this was a mistake. There was so much heat from the Mexican government. They decided to get them out of their own hands because they just realized it's going to bring more heat down on what they're doing.",

At that point, it's -- it really says a lot about the passengers that helped subdue him, because there's only a couple of flight attendants, maybe three flight attendants, and trying to get them down to control this person would have been impossible.

So what they're saying is, if you have -- show them the numbers, and you can show safety in this amount of departures in a certain amount of time, then that's what they allow you to do. But the onus of responsibility really comes down to the airlines to say, when do we say enough is enough? Can we pack so much in tight that we start making mistakes? And I think that is one of the root causes for why we're seeing more and more of this right now, is that these -- they're under a lot of pressure to try to get more airplanes and make up for those losses that they had during the COVID era. And so they're really pushing things forward. I think, again, they need to step back and look at how long does it really take to move these airplanes? Do they have all the people necessary? Were they fully staffed to do it and be able to say no when it's time to make that airplane leave and say we're at our capacity, we have had delays and we're going to just accept what we have now, and just slow things down a little bit.",

We're talking about higher borrowing costs. As the Fed raises interest rates, it gets more expensive to borrow. Mortgage rates are quickly approaching 7 percent again. Credit card rates have never been higher, also more expensive to buy a car, student debt as well. Why the Fed chair is concerned, it's really about inflation. This is the Fed's preferred inflation metric. I think this chart shows two things. One, inflation has cooled off from the peak last summer. But also, more recently, it has picked up in January. And so that has been concerning to the Fed chair. That's why he's signaling more rate hikes ahead. Now, as you mentioned, this is not sitting well with investors.
