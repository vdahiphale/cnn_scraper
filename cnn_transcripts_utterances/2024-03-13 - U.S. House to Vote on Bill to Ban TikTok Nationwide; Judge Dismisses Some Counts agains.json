Welcome back wherever you are watching in the world. You are more than welcome. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is six in the evening, 10:00 am on the East Coast of America and these are live pictures from Capitol Hill, where we are expecting soon a vote in the House of Representatives about TikTok's future. There is bipartisan legislation which could force the Chinese-based parent to spin off or face a nationwide ban. Well, in Moscow, a defiant Vladimir Putin warned on state TV that Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if the country's safety is at stake. He also warned America against sending troops into Ukraine. And the court is back in session in the trial against James Crumbley, the father of high school mass shooter, Ethan Crumbley.

Now many of them are younger Americans who have made the app a daily part of their lives. The bill would give the Chinese owners, ByteDance, less than six months to divest TikTok or face a ban in the United States. Well, House lawmakers bringing it to vote are concerned over China's ability to access TikTok users' personal data and possibly use it, for example, to influence the November elections. The subject of Chinese ownership discussed by one of the bill's cosponsors in the debate today ahead of the vote. Have a listen (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL):  This bill is not a ban and it's not about TikTok. It's about ByteDance. Let me tell you about ByteDance. ByteDance is a 100 percent owner of TikTok. ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. In fact, the editor in chief of ByteDance is the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party cell, embedded at the very highest ranks of the company. And he has been charged with making sure that TikTok and all products of ByteDance adhere to quote, \"correct political direction.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Such practice of resorting to acts of bullying when one could not succeed in fair competition disrupts the normal operation of the market. It undermines the confidence of international investors and sabotages the global economic and trade order. This will eventually backfire on the U.S. itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we all know we're commoditized by these apps. These apps have our data. So what the American, what this legislation is saying is, this is about ultimately American companies owning the data, not Chinese companies, correct? What do you make of China's response to this? O'DONNELL:  Well, I find it rather ironic that China talks about U.S. trying to bully certain situations when, of course, we know that that's in fact exactly what they do in terms of the control they place over their own media and what have you. But I mean, look, yes, ultimately is about that data. And there are some -- there's already been some disconcerting things that have happened with regards to TikTok. There have been published reports in \"Forbes\" and other places that have shown that TikTok in fact spied on some of the U.S. journalists who reporting on some of the issues around TikTok. So now TikTok said, we've gotten rid of these people, those few bad actors. Fair enough, these things do happen. But there is a concern. Other people who've studied the trends in terms of the topics that trend on TikTok versus other social media platforms. And there is concern about what can be done. Unfortunately, we are living in a world where social media can be manipulated. It has been manipulated. And so there are huge geopolitical as well as local political concerns baked in around all of this. Yes, at the end of the day, it's about control that data as well as, to be honest with you (ph), to control the algorithm that helps feed that data to us in different ways.",

Now, the former president used to be against this and he wanted to ban TikTok then all of a sudden, you find out that one of his big donors was concerned with it. So now he's changed his mind. I mean, you know. So -- but that's typical with him and what we've seen from previous things that he's done. So -- but yes, the question around the blame is a serious one and Democrats have to think about that. Republicans have to think about it, too.

And we are beginning to see this as a creep in other places. Certainly the U.K. at present, considering legislation on foreign government ownership of media assets. I just wonder where you think this goes, going forward. O'DONNELL:  No, that's a great question, Becky. And you know, the thing to bear in mind now, not a lot of U.S. citizens may think about this, but this issue goes beyond the borders of the U.S., as you said, in the U.K., in Canada, in other parts of Europe. There's other calls to ban TikTok or to do something with TikTok because of the concern, of the influence and, again, how social media has so dramatically changed how people view and consume. Their news. So I think we're going to see a lot of efforts around the world. They're taking a serious look at this to say, hey, what is the right way to go? How do we think about media ownership? I don't think there's a clear answer, to be clear on to your question. I think that's a very sticky wicket. That's going to be difficult for people to unfold. But I think at the end of the day, you're going to see a lot more probing into ownership and influence and the kinds of things that can happen. And it needs to be more clarity honestly, in terms of how this technology is working. How does that algorithm promote certain things versus others? Those are big questions that could actually help answer some of these issues and address some of the concerns. It gets very complicated very quickly why it -- which makes it hard to really deal with it. But these are the questions I think of the modern era when it comes to media and technology and how the two are intertwined and what could happen down the road. Because, as you said, like right now it's TikTok; down the road it could be Twitter or X, it could be other platforms. And in other countries, platforms as well. So all of these things could potentially be influenced by this and this really is a trendsetting set of legislation, if indeed it passes, which is why I think there's so much attention and focus upon it.",

So if things remain as they stand at present, at least on the floor of the House, the vote will be for this company to be forced to divest its interest in TikTok or face a ban of the app in the United States of America.

I was scrolling through TikTok a little bit before this vote started, seeing some videos of people worrying that all of a sudden TikTok was going to get -- disappear tomorrow. That's not what's happening here. This bill, I think, still has a long way to go. It will head next if it passes in the House today to the Senate floor, where I think it faces a much more uncertain fate. I think a lot of these lawmakers are aware of just how politically fraught this vote is. You have so many young people, especially young voters, who are using TikTok, who love this platform, who will not be happy to see their representatives voting to ban it in the United States. I think it's interesting, you hear some of the representatives in the debate, ahead of this vote, really picking up on this and saying, you know? We're worried that we're going to lose young voters in November if we go ahead and pass this bill and move it along. And so I think that's something that certainly senators will be considering.

I want to pick up on one other thing that I think U.S. users are really talking about here. I'm seeing some frustration from U.S. TikTok users that this is what their lawmakers are focusing on. This is the thing that they're able to generate bipartisan support for. Users are saying this is a platform that's universally more or less loved among Americans and yet our lawmakers are focused on banning it instead of focusing on things like helping with health care costs or parental leave. I think that's an interesting trend that I've been picking up on among TikTok users is why is this the thing that our lawmakers are focused on today when there there's so many other things they could be thinking about and having bipartisan conversations and agreement on, Becky?",

I mean, look, you had TikTok users over the weekend and the past couple of days calling up their representatives and saying, if you vote to pass this bill, I won't vote for you in the next election. And so I think that is something that all the lawmakers here are considering. But in particular, the Senate will have to consider if this bill lands on the Senate floor. You also hear senators in the past couple of days talking about, specifically Democratic senators talking about the potential consequences again, of a vote for this bill for President Biden in November. It's interesting, Trump, president, former president Trump has changed his tune on TikTok and is now opposing this bill, opposing the ban of TikTok. When he was president, he tried to ban TikTok but now he's saying that he doesn't want this bill to pass. And so I think, again, we're seeing political stakes be set up here for President Biden.

That's what they want to avoid by trying to force TikTok to only keep user -- U.S. user data in the United States. This, of course, is something that TikTok says it's already doing. It has a partnership with Oracle. It says that all U.S. user data is stored in the U.S. But there's still is a concern among lawmakers and indeed among security experts that, because TikTok is owned by ByteDance, located in China, that there could be a situation where the Chinese government forces TikTok to hand over U.S. user data.

It's a nice state charge to bring against Trump. But the federal cases are the ones that matter most and the most important of them, from an accountability standpoint, is this January 6th case. We know that April 25th will be the day the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the former president has immunity. If he's found not to have immunity, that case should go to trial sometime in the early fall.",

The U.S. House of Representatives has just approved a bill to force TikTok to divest itself of its Chinese ownership or be banned in the United States. It will next go to the U.S. Senate. This vote coming as U.S. intelligence officials sound the alarm on possible election interference, saying they cannot rule out the possibility that the Chinese government will use TikTok to influence voters. The conceit of their argument being that ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, has significant Communist Party influence. Well, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking in the debate ahead of this, made the following statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  First of all, this is not a ban on TikTok. I'm a grandmother of teenagers. I understand the entertainment value, the educational value, communication value, the business value for some business on this. This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It's attempt to make TikTok better. Tic-tac-toe, a winner. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It seems that American intelligence knows very little about how the algorithm for TikTok works. And it is the algorithm for that social media app that sits behind its super success. Those who tried to hack the code can't. I wonder whether to some degree this is what that is about as well. I mean, this is this is an organization that has set itself up sort of with guardrails around its most important pillar, which is that algorithm. That is what makes this so successful, correct? O'DONNELL:  That is absolutely correct, Becky. And that's -- the secret sauce to TikTok, in fact, has been that algorithm and there have been all kinds of stories written and things said about how well it can direct you in certain directions from the moment that you start using it. It picks it up on the most subtle of clues, how long you pause on a certain piece of content, all these kinds of very subtle things that it's picked up on and has been refined over time, such that it's making changes to you without you even realizing what's going on. And I think that's ultimately where this concerns comes from. People don't even realize that they're being manipulated. And that's a scary thought. And unfortunately, a lot of the tech world, we're seeing some of these kind of -- this sort of idea happen. And ironically, it is that algorithm or the IP, the intellectual property of this algorithm, that's really the big question mark. That's why, of course, China has said we don't want to give this up because they recognize how powerful it is. At the same time, I think that's why people who are really deep into this issue are interested in this, because that's sort of a secret sauce that people would like to get access to.",

Most of the charges against Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who tried to overturn the results in Georgia, most of the case is intact. But the judge down there, Scott McAfee, has thrown out six of the charges in this sweeping indictment, including three charges against former president Donald Trump. What this means is that he was facing 13 charges. Now he's only facing 10. But that's still not a position that you want to be in if you're anybody, especially a presidential candidate running in this year's elections. What is still intact is most importantly the first count in this indictment, the racketeering charge against Trump and the other defendants. That still stands and that is incredibly important. Some of the other defendants that are the beneficiaries of today's decision that saw some but not all of their charges dropped include Rudy Giuliani, the president's former attorney; Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff to Donald Trump and the right-wing lawyer, John Eastman, who was involved in the attempts to -- (CROSSTALK)",

The six charges that are at issue concern violation of oath of office. Specifically, these defendants' attempts to get state officials to violate their oaths. The oath of office that state officials take say that they're going to uphold the Georgia and federal constitutions. The judge said this was just too broad. The indictment never specified what provisions of the Constitution that the officials were seeking to have the Georgia officials violate. As a result, he just said that these defendants didn't have sufficient notice. But I join Marshall comments. He did make sure that everyone understood that this didn't affect the main charge, the RICO charge, and that the case would go forward.",
