I'm Boris Sanchez in Washington, D.C.The Israeli military is now warning that there could be changes at any moment, just hours before 13 women and children are set to be released from Gaza. At midnight Eastern Time, a truce between Israel and Hamas is expected to go into effect. About nine hours later, Hamas is set to free that first group of hostages. Right now, the Israeli government has a list of those captives and says it has notified their families. This plan coming together after a one-day delay, but the Qatari government, which mediated the deal, says it is hopeful it will go as planned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN:  We are hopeful, I don't know if I should say confident, but I'm very hopeful, and as I said, the commitment we have seen from both sides leads us to be very positive to deal with this very positively. We are seeing a good level of commitment over the agreement itself, the details hashed out. The first, you know, glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, this crisis, and this is why we need it to succeed, and we are hoping and working towards it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And, Boris, all of those moving parts have to work in a very specific order for this to go through. It was meticulous discussions and planning that got to this point, and it was because there were still some questions essentially about the logistics of it, that we saw that 24-hour delay to get us to this point. It all starts about eight hours from now, when that pause in fighting goes into effect.Shortly after that, hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks lined up in Rafah outside of Gaza will begin making their way in. That aid desperately needed. Nine hours after the pause in fighting begins, around 4:00 in the afternoon, we expect to see the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, 13 women and children. That will work by transferring them from Hamas to the Red Cross, and then the Red Cross will bring them to the border crossings either through Egypt or directly into Israel. Then, that first batch of 13 women and children will be taken to hospitals, obviously, for evaluation and checkup. If they are younger than 12, they will meet their families as soon as possible. If they are older than 12, they will meet their families at the hospital. Then, according to an Israeli official, once it's confirmed that the hostages are in Israel, there will be a release of 39 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. They'll be released from two Israeli prisons, then transferred to an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank. At that point, they'll be allowed to head home and go to their families. This is the first day. This then needs to work out repeatedly over the course of four days, and it is so delicate, that's why the IDF was warning that it could essentially change at the last minute, until the process begins, and even after the process begins, it could still change. However, the Qatari foreign ministry in their press briefing earlier today said they see a commitment from both sides to make this work out. They were crucially asked, what happens if there's a violation of the cease-fire? There they said they would be in communication with both sides to walk them back from the ledge. The first two days of this are viewed as almost a testing period by U.S. officials. If those work out, then there becomes the possibility that the pause in fighting could be extended for the release of more than 50 Israeli women and children over a longer period of time, but as of right now, Boris, from where we're standing and how delicate this entire situation is, that is a very big if.",

In just the last hour, we heard and saw some very large explosions coming from the direction, it seemed, of the Jabalia refugee camp, where we know Israeli forces have been operating very heavily.I want you to listen and watch these explosions, and I'll pause for a moment, so you can hear the sound here.

You can hear there, the secondary -- second round of explosions there, going off.And so, these have been the scenes tonight, and we expect this to continue into the night. Israeli military officials have made very clear that they will continue fighting in the Gaza Strip up until they are given the order to stand down before that 7:00 a.m. truce. We will see whether or not that truce actually comes to be at 7:00 a.m., whether both sides respect it. There have been violations of cease- fires and truces in the past in previous wars between Israel and Hamas, but this is obviously a very, very delicate situation. And we also know that one thing Israeli officials have made clear is that this is merely a pause in fighting. It is not a permanent cease- fire, and they have made very clear that once these initial round of hostages get out, perhaps ten after that per day for extensions of that pause in fighting, at some point, the Israeli military will return to its mission in Gaza, which the Israeli prime minister laid out as retrieving all of the nearly 240 hostages, and also, of course, eliminating Hamas from its power in the Gaza Strip. Israeli officials indicating very strongly they intend to move south, deeper into Gaza.",

We will assume there are around 33 women. They are expected to be among them.There is disappointment, though, Boris, because initially Israel published a list that showed that 50 Palestinian prisoners would be released, and I think it's important to stress here, just picking up on what Jeremy said, the escalation of the bombardment of Gaza. It's very difficult for Palestinian families tonight to, you know, initially have believed that possibly there could be enough numbers that their loved ones could be amongst them, but then also to know that in the lead-up to this very -- to this point delicate, as Oren called it, truce, that the bombardment on Gaza continues, and let's not forget what that means. That means civilian deaths. And that's part of the reason that there has been so much international pressure, led by President Biden, to get Israel to this place. So, the fact that there is an escalation and the potential of deaths in the final hours towards the cease-fire is heartbreaking for so many of the Palestinian families to see, Boris.",

The difference is that the Israeli army has made very clear that the war will continue, and therefore, these hostages could potentially be rearrested. That's the difference between the view from the Palestinian side, the families waiting for the prisoners to come home, versus the joy and hope that I imagine the hostage families in Israel are feeling tonight, that there are no guarantees, even the trucks coming in from Rafah will be enough to staunch even the preliminary needs.This pause, if hopefully it goes through, and at the moment, right up until the final moments, that is not guaranteed, will be a brief respite that will not be sufficient to quell the concerns of the families of the remaining Palestinian prisoners, or at the very least, even give those in Gaza that desperately needed live-saving support, Boris.",

Colonel, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate you sharing part of your Thanksgiving with us. There are going to be nine hours between the truce starting, and the first hostages being released. I imagine that is an extremely precarious time. Why do you think the deal was structured that way, to allow for nine hours between the cessation of hostilities, and then the exchange of prisoners and hostages? COL. PETER MANSOOR, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  The word of the cease-fire and when it begins and enforcing it has to filter down through the chain of command on both sides, and it may be even more difficult on the side of Hamas where their fighters are in tunnels and maybe not in contact with their senior officials. So, the nine-hour gap there is to make sure the cease-fire is holding before the hostages are exchanged.",
