Good evening.Today, Palestinians in Rafah tell CNN they have nowhere to go, that's after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the Israeli military to evacuate the population of the last major city not occupied by the IDF, calling it \"Hamas last bastion.\" Tonight, the city is under siege after a series of Israeli airstrikes have reportedly killed dozens, including three Hamas militants. Here in the US, the attorney general is facing fresh scrutiny from his boss, President Biden privately lashing out against Merrick Garland after a searing special counsel report called him an elderly man with a poor memory. Biden is reportedly telling advisers that Garland did not do enough to rein in the report. And tonight in South Carolina, it is getting personal between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, despite his wide lead in the polls two weeks before the South Carolina Republican primary, the former president is taking shots at Haley, mocking her husband for being absent on the campaign trail while he is deployed overseas. Joining me now is Ron Brownstein, CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at \"The Atlantic.\" Ron, that's a long wind though it is not the reason why my throat is hurting, it is because I have got -- I'm batting a little bit of a cold.

I mean, he has talked -- you know, he said on Friday night, Jim, Friday afternoon at the NRA that \"within moments\" -- within moments of taking office, he would begin a mass deportation program. Stephen Miller has put out extraordinary detail about how they intend to do this with large-scale raids in major cities, moving people to internment camps in Texas and removing them from the country in constant flights. I talked to a former ICE chief-of-staff this week who said that would take a hundred to a hundred fifty thousand law enforcement personnel plus another 50,000 people to run these camps and one of the ways they are talking about doing this, openly and explicitly is requisitioning National Guard troops from red states and sending them into blue states whose governors won't cooperate. So you're talking about the National Guard from Texas or Arkansas going into the west side of Chicago, potentially, to deport people, and think about what that might -- how that may play out in practice. And I think this is -- could you imagine scenes of federal law enforcement and national guards from out-of-state in conflict with local police that are defending a church where migrants have kind of you know, rushed for safety? The question of what a second Trump term would mean, across the board, really has not been engaged by anyone, including Biden, but certainly not by the other Republicans, and it is an open question, how much a part of the debate that is going to be between now and November.",

And one of the reasons -- you know, he says he would settle the Ukraine war within 24 hours, and I think most people understand that to mean that he would force Zelenskyy and Ukraine to accept Russian control over a significant part of the country by threatening to cut off their aid, and I think that what many of the critics ultimately in the Republican Party envision. It is just one of many. You know, we could talk about tariffs. We could talk about using the Insurrection Act to send federal forces into blue cities to fight crime, or roundup the homeless.

We see Tom Suozzi with a small, tiny advantage over Mazi Pilip, a four-point advantage. I will note, of course, that this is a district that's a swing district. Joe Biden won it by eight points back in 2020. But in the midterm elections, the Republican candidate for the House, obviously George Santos, won it. He won it by about eight. You look at the Republican gubernatorial candidate. He won it by about 12. You look at the Republican Senate candidate, Joe Pinion, he won it by about four. So this is a district that has swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. And this, I think a lot of people are looking to this seat, giving you some indication, where are the political wins going? At this point, Tom Suozzi does lead in the limited polling data that is out.

So what we're going to start to see McDonald's do is they're going to be adding more items to their dollar menu. And, look, the dollar menu used to be just a dollar, but now it's $1, $2 and $3 items. So more hash browns, chicken McNuggets. So even the dollar menu has kind of changed.And this is a common tactic among restaurants and grocery stores to add more discounts, not necessarily to lower the prices, but to just bring back more of the discounts. So we're not necessarily going to see the price of a Big Mac meal drop or some of these other meals, but more discounts and specials, particularly on the dollar menu.",
