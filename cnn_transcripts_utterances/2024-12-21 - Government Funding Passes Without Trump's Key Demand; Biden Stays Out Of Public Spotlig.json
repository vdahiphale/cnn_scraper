While a deal was struck to avoid a government shutdown. The events over the last two days raise a few questions about what governing may look like during President-elect Donald Trump's second term. CNN's Steve Contorno joins us now from West Palm Beach with more on this. Steve, what did we glean from the last 48 hours or so?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, we saw that there are limitations to the electoral mandate that Donald Trump believes that he won just a month ago.We saw 38 Republicans on Thursday vote against a plan to raise the debt ceiling all the way through 2027, and then 170 Republicans siding with House Speaker Mike Johnson and the entire Democratic Caucus in support of a continuing resolution to fund the government without that debt ceiling extension that Trump desperately wanted and was pushing for. And this is not the first time that we have seen Trump suffer some defeats at the expense of his own party. In recent weeks, he had Senator Rick Scott, the Trump aligned candidate to lead the Senate as a Majority Leader, he lost his bid to Senator John Thune, who didn't even endorse Trump in the primary last go around. We also saw Matt Gaetz falter in his nomination to be the attorney general, a job that Donald Trump views as integral to his Cabinet. Now he is forced to go to a fallback option and also, he abandoned a push to get his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, named to the US Senate in Florida to replace Marco Rubio after it became clear that Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis did not want to go along with the plan to appoint her. So look, obviously, Donald Trump still has incredible command of his party, but it shows that in a very narrow majority in his House, there is little room for him to lose any support and that goes for the Senate as well. And so even though we will have a Republican House and Republican Senate and a Republican White House, and they will surely push through a lot of conservative and pro-Trump legislation, there are certain lines that maybe some Republicans aren't willing to cross and we have seen several individuals like House Representative Chip Roy of Texas, become targets of the MAGA right already for being willing to stand up to Trump. How far is Trump willing to take this now to challenge his own party? Will we see primary challenges? Last go around, Trump did threaten that for anyone who supported a bill that didn't raise the debt ceiling, well, 170 Republicans ultimately did in the House and dozens more in the Senate. Is he really going to primary all of those individuals? So it is just an interesting opening round in what was going to be a Republican House, Senate and White House and see how they govern going forward?",

They are fiscal hawks who are principled in their stance and they don't care if Donald Trump says jump, they're not going to respond with how high. They're going to vote the way they want to vote.The other reality is this sweeping mandate that is being claimed is being misread. And I am a Republican, but I am a realistic Republican. It is being misread and cannot be misconstrued. The margins will be incredibly tight for John Thune in the Senate and Mike Johnson in the House. There is not a lot of room for error and rank and file want to be at the table. They don't want leadership negotiating behind the scenes. They want to be part of this process.

And then as he wagged the dog and Trump followed suit, everything fell apart.But I think Hakeem Jeffries, what you saw was somebody who actually knows how to legislate, who actually knows how the government works, who actually can keep his caucus together. Democrats were unified for the most part in this. And frankly, at the 11th hour, Johnson had to come to Democrats for help to make sure that the government wasn't shut down, to essentially save his skin. And Democrats, of course, did not want the government to shut down, but also was not going to give Donald Trump and Elon Musk a blank check in getting rid of the debt ceiling when the timing wasn't even right, when, as you know, debt ceiling negotiations take months and all of this came at the 11th hour when no one was expecting it. And so Democrats are going to move forward into this new Congress, strong, unified, and Pete is absolutely right, the mandate that Donald Trump thinks he has is not the mandate that Donald Trump thinks he has.

Everyone has got to play ball, but I would say with President Biden, my sense and I think the sense of a lot of Americans is he didn't really care if the government shut down at midnight last night.

Now we'll see what happens over the final month, but that's actually lower than Donald Trump was in January of 2021.I remember back then, right, it was COVID and I remember writing about how we had a historically low approval rating going out after just one term. Obviously, he's coming back. But Joe Biden actually beats that, but in a bad way. He's even lower than Donald Trump was. And, of course, Jimmy Carter, when you talk about presidents with low approval ratings, he is normally, you know, the historical person you look to. But he was at 44 percent by the end of his presidency in January of '81. And then George H. W. Bush completely, whoops, completely on the other end there, right at 56 percent in January of 1993.

Durbin an Illinois Democrat and as you said the chairman of the committee. Many of the luxury trips, private flights and other gifts in question have been publicly known for months but this report provides more detail. Some of that detail coming from information gained by subpoenas of some of the wealthy donors of the gifts. One of those trips according to the report was a 2008 Alaskan fishing expedition taken by Justice Alito where the report puts the private flight alone at a value of nearly $24,000 per passenger. The report also digs into the past accusing the late Justice Antonin Scalia of improperly accepting gifts during his time on the High Court. The report's authors use those and other examples to conclude that the court quote has demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to police its own ethical conduct. It's not just the gifts that the report calls unethical behavior by justices on the court though, it also asserts that justices at times have violated their duty to recuse themselves from certain cases where there's a conflict of interest including Justice Thomas staying on cases involving the 2020 presidential election despite political advocacy by his wife Ginni Thomas in support of then-President Donald Trump. Federal law gives justices wide latitude to make their own recusal decisions. It requires them to bow out when a spouse has an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of a case. Now, Durbin has long called for ethical reform on the Supreme Court saying this back in September on the Senate floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): ... get that, Supreme Court justice, highest court in the land, life and death decisions every day and he's receiving $4 million in gifts that he doesn't disclose. Justice Thomas has failed to disclose the vast majority of these gifts in clear violation of financial disclosure requirements under federal law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A Supreme Court spokesperson has yet to respond to a request for comments about the findings of this report and it does come at a peculiar time released the day after lawmakers pass a budget and left for the year. When Sen. Durbin returns he will be in the minority of his chamber and ethics proposals that he and other Senate Democrats have supported recently will likely be shelved, Jessica.",
