And Trump's attorneys are now asking for a mistrial based on what Ellie just laid out there, the two hours or so of testimony that we just got from Stormy Daniels, saying that she went too far in that testimony. And Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, arguing there is no way for them to remedy that testimony that the jury has already just heard. I should note Trump is writing it on his notepad as Todd Blanche, his attorney, is making this argument in front of the judge. And Blanche is talking about that testimony, saying that there was no other reason for prosecutors to elicit that beyond to cause Trump embarrassment.Now, this is a very important point. I think it's important for us to know that there is no other reason for prosecutors to elicit that testimony. And this was a concern that started out this morning before Stormy Daniels even took the witness stand. And prosecutors and the defense were arguing about the parameters of her testimony. Paula Reid, Phil Mattingly, back here with me. And Paula, I mean, this is coming from Trump's team. Maybe not a total surprise that they are asking for this and not clear that they'll get it. But even the judge was noticeably uncomfortable with where certain parts of her testimony was going and on two occasions asked her to directly answer the question and not meander. And also, you know, scolded the prosecution when the jury was not in the room, that they were asking her to go into details that weren't relevant to why she was on the witness stand.",

And the Trump aligned folks this morning have been pushing for a while this idea that they would move for a mistrial. Now, he's saying he's going to say she, Stormy Daniels, talked about a consensual encounter with President Trump, that she was trying to sell. And that's not the story she told today, Blanche said. So Trump writing notes, pushing them to Blanche even right now as he's talking. So it's clear their client is unhappy and they have to do this, even if they're not successful. This will preserve the issue for their appeal. And remember, that is the overarching strategy. We've said from day one, assert every objection, preserve every single option. So if this doesn't go your way, if your client is convicted, try to overturn this on appeal through death by a thousand cuts.",

And they're saying that's not relevant and that she did that just to embarrass him. And where she was talking about points where she was saying that she blacked out, she meant that figuratively speaking, she was saying she hadn't had anything to drink or had not taken any drugs.

The judge let her continue to testify and allow this in open court. But there was everything from the salacious details about condoms, the missionary position to sort of mundane details about meeting a football player at a nightclub, with Trump and trying on his ring. I mean, time is of the essence. The judge had already told him to move it along. Why was all of this coming in? Do I think it's going to prompt a mistrial? No, but it's a legitimate thing for the defense to bring up.",

And they've been very effective in some of their cross-examinations up to this point. One of my big questions is whether or not prosecutors will actually leave any time for them today or whether or not they're going to try and stretch this all the way out until the end of the day, today in court, because they know tomorrow is off, leave the jury with it entirely. What Blanche is saying right now is, one, reiterating there was an actual discussion about the guardrails here. It was very clear that the prosecution pushed up to the line and potentially over those guardrails throughout the course of the morning's testimony. And Blanche is saying, I think the direct quote was, you can't unring that bell. The jury heard it. Whether or not the objections were sustained or not, the jury heard it. So where does this actually go from here? And I think, I mean, Paul and Kaitlan, you were in the room. It seems strategic. At least the way it was coming out from our teams in the room by the prosecutors. They were intentionally pushing as close as they could over to the line or past the line.",

Again, I don't think that this is going to trip the wires and create a mistrial. They're also asking potentially for her testimony here to be limited. Here, Blanche is saying, we believe regrettably that there should be a mistrial and that Daniel's testimony in any new trial should be excluded or limited. Again, unlikely that they're going to be successful in their request for a mistrial. But this is important as defense attorneys to preserve this issue for their client, should they need to appeal.",

She says, well, the story wasn't new. That's not the point. The point isn't was the story new or not. The point is they elicited all sorts of details, including it's not just the fact that it was details. It was details about consent. It was details suggesting that there was some element of force here, which is not part of this case and which, Judge Merchan, has correctly said, he did not want that to become part of the case.Now, one thing to watch for, the DA said we'd be okay with a limiting instruction, which the judge may give to the jury. Now, here's what that means. Sometimes the judge will turn to the jury and say, ladies and gentlemen, earlier this morning, you heard certain testimony. I instruct you that that testimony was not relevant. It's stricken from the record and you are to disregard it. That could, if you get that kind of limiting instruction, it's damaging to the credibility of the prosecutors in the jury's eyes. I see we're getting a bunch of updates, too.",

And I think Paula had talked about it a little bit earlier. Now, the whole idea here behind a mistrial is that the proceedings are declared void because of such a fundamental error in judgment by a party, by the judge, by a prosecutor that the defendant did not get a fair trial. And I think, you know, to put all of this in perspective, the prosecutors had a balance to strike here of getting enough detail on the record to establish the existence of this encounter such that the defense couldn't rebut it.

But to have this happen, I can only imagine, you guys would have better insight than me, but like what this was like during the lunch break, which obviously his lawyers came right out of and made clear to start moving forward on this.
