Quote, \"All four steps of the rebalancing process needed to tame inflation are now underway: demand growth is below potential, the jobs-workers gap has shrunk, wage growth has fallen, and inflation has slowed.\" Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished mixed. European markets are higher. Eurozone GDP growth slowed in the last three months of 2022 expanding 0.1 percent for the quarter. On Wall Street, stock index futures leaning a little bit higher after a rally yesterday ahead of today's main event, the Consumer Price Index. The Dow, the S&amp;P, and the Nasdaq all finishing the day up more than one percent. Investors are expecting a moderation in consumer prices -- a sign inflation is easing. Year-over-year readings are forecast to come in at 6.2 percent inflation. That would be the lowest reading since October 2021. Meantime, Ford has announced it will slash 3,800 jobs in Europe as it aims to lower costs and boost profit. On inflation watch, gas prices fell a penny overnight, now at $3.41 a gallon. All right, today we'll get that Consumer Price Index report. It's a key inflation gauge critical for the Fed. It helps determine whether the Fed will continue to raise interest rates aggressively.

And a French journalist pointed out Saturday that their uniforms are similar to those of French troops who were in Mali for nearly 10 years. France's defense minister says it's a false representation but they are not asking the studio to remove the movie.All right, two back-to-back storm systems set to bring severe weather to much of the country. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the forecast for us. Chad, is it possible these storms could overlap for some people?",

The second brings a cold front that could interact with it and certainly, by tomorrow the chance of severe weather.Some very beneficial rainfall coming down right now though in a place that has the level three and even level four of four drought here across parts of Oklahoma and Texas. The only real threat of any severe weather would be about here later on today. That moves to the east and gets a little bit closer to the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow to interact with that humidity. The wind though may be knocking down some branches and some power lines. Look at this area. Hundreds of miles -- hundreds of thousands of square miles here when we're talking about the wind advisories. And the snow in the mountains -- the skiers will take it and so will Lake Mead later on this year when all of that snow melts. So yes, there will be snow today in the Rockies. Great skiing here. It moves into the Plains for tomorrow. Notice that big stripe across parts of the Corn Belt for Omaha, back just to the south into Lincoln, and even into Des Moines. Now, the potential for severe weather is in the Deep South tomorrow but it does move farther to the east by the time we talk about Thursday. There will be some significant thunderstorms with the potential for tornados here. I mean, this is still almost a spring- type storm as we move our way into the end of the week. Here is tomorrow with the severe weather and here is Thursday. All the way up even to the Ohio Valley and Cleveland.",
