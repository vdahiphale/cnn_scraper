We hear from U.S. intelligence, a number of intelligence sources telling CNN that an attack on Iranian soil itself is highly unlikely.But at this point, we're waiting to see what that response is. Now, the intelligence sources that spoke to CNN also gave an interesting assessment of what they believe is happening in Iran at this point. The U.S. believes that it was the Islamic resistance in Iraq that was responsible for this attack. It's an Iranian-funded, equipped, trained group, an umbrella group, which has a number of different groups beneath it. And there's a belief in the intelligence community that Tehran may have been caught by surprise by this attack and that they may be worried about the control they have over their own proxies. Now, these intelligence officials do also say they don't believe that Iran and Tehran will be changing its tactics anytime soon. The official U.S. line has been that Tehran welcomes this distraction to U.S. and coalition troops. But there is also an assumption that Tehran does not want direct combatants with the United States and certainly that's something we have heard consistently from Washington as well. They do not want direct contact militarily with Tehran. But when it comes to these proxy groups, these Iranian-funded groups, there's been more than 160 attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and in Syria since October, so since the war in Gaza. And certainly, there was a concern that there could be loss of life given the sheer number of these attacks and that's exactly what we saw last Sunday when three U.S. personnel were killed and dozens more were injured.
