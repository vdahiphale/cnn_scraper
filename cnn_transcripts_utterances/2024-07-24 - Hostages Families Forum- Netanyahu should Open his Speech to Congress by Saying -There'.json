We're going to start in Washington D.C. where protesters right now aregathering ahead of a controversial speech to Congress by the Israeli Prime Minister scheduled just hours from now. And next hour the FBI Director will face questions on Capitol Hill about the investigation into the assassination attempt on Former President and Candidate Donald Trump. And tonight, the sitting U.S. President will address the nation for the first time since bowing out of the race for the White House. It's 09:00 a.m. in the U.S. capital and here in New York. I'm Omar Jimenez. This is \"Connect the World\". We're going to bring you all that and more over the next two hours. All right, first, a quick check of the futures markets as the DOW, S&amp;P and NASDAQ will open in about 30 minutes from now. Not so great stuff, but quick check there. As I mentioned, we're following a lot of stories here. In particular, Israel's Prime Minister is poised to address the U.S. Congress in the coming hours amid a high stakes and controversial visit to Washington. Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to face protesters when he arrives ahead of his speech, which dozens of Democrats are expected to skip as the party remains divided over his handling of the war in Gaza. Now, Vice President Kamala Harris won't attend but is set to meet him Thursday. Mr. Netanyahu is also scheduled to meet President Biden on Thursday and Former President Trump on Friday. All of this as Israel says negotiators are heading back to Cairo for hostage ceasefire talks. Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv, and CNN is Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. Lauren, I want to start with you. So instead of attending Netanyahu's addressed to Congress, a number of Democratic lawmakers are attending counter programming events Wednesday today. How divided are the Democrats over the war in Gaza here?",

There are nowmore than 80 House Democrats who have publicly said that they will not attend Netanyahu addressed to Congress later. Today, you also have six senators who have said that they will not be in attendance. This also comes as many of them have other engagements where they hope to distract and to focus on the issues that they say actually need to be dealt with Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the progressive movement up here on Capitol Hill. She is going to be in a panel at the Center for American Progress where she says they're going to be talking about a peace plan. And the plan ahead between Israel and Gaza as this war continues to rage on. Meanwhile, you have Speaker Mike Johnson, who initially invited Netanyahu to address Congress who will be meeting one on one with him just before the Joint Congressional meeting. Another interesting split screen that you're going to be seeing today is a photo opportunity with Democratic and Republican leadership. And Chuck Schumer, the majority leader and someone who has called on Benjamin Netanyahu to step aside or for Israel to hold new elections to push him aside. He will also be in that photo op. So, a really interesting moment politically here on Capitol Hill. And last night, several Democrats and others went to the Senate floor to talk about their own concerns with this speech. Here's independent Senator Bernie Sanders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Frankly, this invitation to Netanyahu is a disgrace and something that we will look back on with regret. I hope that for one second, the members who attend will focus just for a second on the starving children in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're certainly going to turn now to a big day ahead in the race for U.S. President. The new presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris will hold a rally in Indiana while the Republican nominee Donald Trump will campaign in North Carolina. This will be his first rally since President Joe Biden announced that he's leaving the race. Mr. Biden will address the nation tonight from the Oval Office. They will be his first former remarks since ending his re-election bid and endorsing his vice president. Let's bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz and Alayna Treene who are both covering the story from Washington. Arlette, I want to start with you out of the White House.

The President started drafting this speech shortly after he went public with his decision to bail out of the 2024 race. He's been working with one of his longtime advisors, Mike Donilon to craft the message. And aids really say that this will give President Biden an opportunity to fully explain his decision to not seek re-election. This will be the first time Americans are hearing from him in a more fulsome setting to hear the president explain his decision. But also, the president will use this speech to talk about the path forward and how he views his coming months in office. Of course, Biden right now is heading into a period called to the lame duck in a presidency. It's something that has frustrated many presidents before he has pledged though, that he does want to still continue to get work done on both domestic and foreign policy. The conflict in Gaza is one area that he said that he believes that he can make some progress on, but then there are also domestic issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs, lowering the cost of child care and elder care and also addressing issues like guns and climate. Those are all things President Biden has indicated he does want to focus on in these closing months. But surely this will also be an opportunity for him to be reflective about what has happened and accomplished in this administration, while also explaining why he decided to drop out of this race. In that letter he wrote on Sunday, he said that he was doing it in the best interest of this country. And of course, one thing that President Biden will be working towards in the coming weeks and months is trying to ensure that Vice President Kamala Harris is elected as the Democratic or in the race against Donald Trump in November, he will be hitting the campaign trail at some point. But many will be closely watching this as the president is now heading into those final months that will cap off a very lengthy career here in Washington D.C.",

Now, that the race of course, has changed entirely with Biden stepping aside over the weekend. And I also just want to point out, Omar, that when I talked to the campaign, they argue that the issues they're going to go after Harris on are the same issues they were attacking Joe Biden on, which includes crime, the border, immigration, economy. All issues that Republicans think they do better on in the polls. However, of course, when I also talked to people close to the former president, they will privately acknowledge that there's so much uncertainty right now about what this looks like that.

Now FBI Director Christopher Wray is set to testify about the FBI's investigation into the shooting at a Pennsylvania rally. Now, lawmakers are expected to press him for new details on a potential motive. It's the third straight day of hearings demanding answers on how is sniper was able to get on a rooftop, wound the former president and kill a bystander. CNN's U.S. National Security Reporter Zachary Cohen has the latest from Washington. All right, the third hearing on the Trump assassination attempt and as many days today, the focus is on the oversight of the FBI. What are we watching for? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Omar, we've gradually gotten more information from these various witnesses. And we expect that Christopher Wray, the FBI Director today will be pressed for even more details about what happened in the security failures that led up to the assassination attempt and allow the assassination attempt on Donald Trump's live to take place. And look, yesterday we had the Pennsylvania Police Commissioner, the State Police Commissioner testify providing some details about what local officers were grappling with in the immediate lead up and then aftermath of the shooting and corroborating some key timeline details that we've reported since July 13 when the assassination attempt took place. And obviously, the first hearing to happen on the assassination attempt featured then Director of the U.S. Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle. Cheatle has since resigned from her job after bipartisan call for her to step down. So, we'll see how it goes with Christopher Wray today. Obviously, anytime the FBI Director goes on to Capitol Hill, especially to the House side of the capital, there are it does invite some political and opportunity for political attacks or political grandstanding at the end of the day. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle do want details about this assassination attempt in the security failures around it. They also want Christopher Wray to elaborate and talk about the FBI's assessment of political violence in the state and the threat posed by political violence writ large. That's something we've heard from lawmakers and other committees during these hearings as well. They really want Christopher Wray to establish where the threat -- what the threat environment is at this moment. And what that assassination attempt on Donald Trump tells you about those the heightened threat level there. Look, I'm also told that there will be some questions about maybe semi adjacent issues. I know Democrats may press Christopher Wray to address some claims from Republicans that the FBI should be defunded. They want Christopher Wray to explain what the impact of something like that would be. Also, the question of DEI Chairman of House Judiciary, Jim Jordan has raised questions about the FBI's hiring practices. You can expect Democrats to give Wray an opportunity to address that as well. And then like you said, the main focus today to the FBI is kind of core challenge has been to -- trying to establish a motive building a profile of the shooter himself. That's something that Wray told lawmakers during a briefing last week on the assassination attempt. And that's something we know lawmakers will be asking for an update on today.",
