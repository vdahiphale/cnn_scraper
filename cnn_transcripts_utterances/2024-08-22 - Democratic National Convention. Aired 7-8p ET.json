What happens in this arena tonight is pivotal for Kamala Harris and her presidential campaign. Delegates, the American people, they will all have a chance to hear the vice president speak at length tonight on a national stage for the first time since her meteoric rise to the top of the ticket literally just one month ago.And we are coming to you tonight from inside the convention hall on this special edition of OUTFRONT. We are told the vice president, when she speaks soon, will be sharing the story of her upbringing, a middle-class upbringing, talking about her parents and her sister, talking about that background, fueling her decision to become a prosecutor. And they campaign official tells us she will also lay out what she believes are the dangers posed by Donald Trump agenda if he wins.

As attorney general, she held big banks accountable for their role in the foreclosure crisis, and won billions of dollars for California homeowners. As vice president, she and President Biden helped over 400,000 homeowners at the risk of foreclosure during the pandemic. And as president, she will build 3 million new homes and rentals, limit unfair rent increases, and offer down payment support for first-time homebuyers.It's personal. Kamala remembers her mothers pride at buying their first home after saving for 10 years. She knows housing is a human right, and a pathway to the middle class. Where you live determines what schools your children go to, what healthcare you receive, and whether you can get a good job without spending hours commuting. Where you live, too often, determines how you live. Donald Trump has no idea how housing works for everyday Americans. He doesn't care. He started his career being sued for denying housing to Black families. As president, he sat by while the cost of housing skyrocketed. Now, we can hand the keys to our housing policy back to a negligent landlord, or we can elect a president who believes in safe, affordable housing for all. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

Let's listen in to Congressman Lieu. REP. TED LIEU (D-CA):  As a computer science major, I am so impressed with how large this A.I.-generated crowd looks tonight. I first got to know Kamala Harris during the Great Recession, when I was a California state legislator. Millions of hard-working families were facing foreclosure. My constituents told me stories about predatory and unfair loan terms, and about how hard they work fighting to keep their homes that they loved. Thankfully, they had someone fighting just as hard for them, Attorney General Kamala Harris. She led an investigation of the mortgage industry to root out fraud. She helped pass the homeowners bill of rights. And she held the big banks accountable, bringing back $20 billion to homeowners. Since those days, I've seen her continue to fight for affordable housing as vice president, and as president, she's going to cut red tape so we can build more houses, help new homeowners afford a down payment, and take on corporations and unfairly high cop rent. Kamala Harris fights for affordable housing because she gets it. You know, when her mom was raising two girls, she did what so many parents do, work early hours and work late nights, pay the bills and put on a brave face so her girls did not know how hard it really was. It shouldn't be this hard in America, and President Kamala Harris will make sure it's not. She'll fight to lower housing costs so that everyone, everywhere can find a place to call home. BURNETT:  Congressman Ted Lieu talking about Kamala Harris's background, which is an essential part of what they want to do tonight, and one of her essential goals in what we expect to be a more than hour-long speech where she's going to talk about her past and contrast with the future as she sees it with the future that Donald Trump wants to present. MJ Lee is learning more about what the vice president will be saying as we're following this program and getting ready to hear her speech. MJ, what are you learning?",

I asked the senior adviser to the vice president what her frame of mind has been heading into this big night tonight, and he said it is both excitement and seriousness, and that, really, few people, obviously, understand the gravity of accepting a party's presidential nomination, and she knows that when this party is over, she needs to run a race and win a race -- Erin.",

Well, it's because Kamala Harris believes that college can be a ticket to the middle class, and she has fought to make it more affordable her entire career. As California attorney general, she took down one of the biggest for-profit colleges, securing $1 billion, $1 billion for students who were defrauded.Alongside President Biden, she expanded Pell grants and secured record funding for HBCUs. And Kamala Harris made public service loan relief a reality for teachers and first responders and firefighters and nurses, and countless others across our land. Vice President Harris delivered before, and she will do it again. As president, she will build a brighter future, a more affordable future, a future where going to college doesn't break the bank. A future where my five-year-old daughter, Natalie, who's watching us back home in Colorado right now, a future where she can live her dreams. So those are the stakes. Let's make it happen, America.

They're the people who know her best.So, of course, they are best prepared to fill in her biography. I worked with her for years. I watched her do this. So it makes perfect sense for her to fill in the biography, it is also an opening for Republicans to say California Democrat, out of the mainstream of the country. That's what Trump -- that's what the Trump campaign says its going to try to do. Trump himself has been very uneven, because he focuses more on, you know, is she Indian or is she black, or a coup against Joe Biden. He's lost away from how the campaign would like you to present the case. That's one of the things that are going to try to do. They're going to try to put her left, and California gives them an opportunity, because much of the country does think California is this, you know, utopia out west.",

My life in service began in New York City on September 11th. As the smoke cleared, I knew my career would be spent protecting the country we all love. I was recruited by the CIA and served three tours in Iraq alongside our military. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

America retreating from the world, or leading the world. Trump wants to take us backwards. He admires dictators, a lot. He treats our friends as adversaries and our adversaries as friends. But our vision is based on our values. The values that took us to the shores of Normandy and helped us win the Cold War. We believe America should inspire and lead at home and abroad. We recognize that it's not just about having a strong military, but about tackling global challenges, like A.I. and climate change, together. And guess what? That takes friends. You got to have friends to do that. Vice President Harris understands our strength abroad is inextricably linked to our strength here at home. Our schools, a strong middle class, and the health of our democracy. So for everyone here and everyone watching, I want you to proudly claim your patriotism. You are here because you love your country. Do not give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag, but spit in the face of freedoms it represents. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

We see every delegate in this room standing and dancing between speeches. There's an interlude of music.There is going to be a lot of music tonight from the Chicks and Pink as well, perhaps a surprise guest, we shall see. But I was just outside this hall talking to a few delegates who say they cannot get in. The floor has been closed. That happened at every convention, slightly earlier tonight. You can see across the hall, this is a party for Kamala Harris. I am told when she arrives in the coming hours, she is going to absorb this energy, and then tell these Democrats to get to work for the next 75 days of this campaign -- Erin.",

I see a candidate who, with Joe Biden, brought leaders to the White House to confront violent hatred, running against a man who said neo- Nazis in Charlottesville were fine people. (BOOING) SHARPTON:  I see a candidate who has sought to reform and uphold the law, and a man who wrongly assumes his mug shot appeals to Black Americans. I worked with Kamala Harris. In every job she's had, she has consistently committed to making government work for those of us who've been disadvantaged. All Donald Trump has been consistent about is making himself richer, and sowing division to get that done. This man sat right here in Chicago a few weeks ago, refusing to apologize for claims that migrants were taking Black jobs. Well, in November, we're going to show him when Blacks do they job!
