      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your very, very busy news day with us. Today, a suspected leaker who shook up the world by posting top secret U.S. intelligence documents online, sees the inside of a federal courtroom.Plus, new CNN reporting on an intriguing avenue of investigation for the special counsel. Jack Smith wants to know if Donald Trump is using an army of lawyers to intimidate potential witnesses into telling his version of events. And the Ron DeSantis just make himself unelectable. The Florida governor signs one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws, barring the procedure after just six weeks of pregnancy. It's a priority for the Republican base but it is very much at odds with where most Americans stand. Up first for us though, hiking boots and handcuffs. This morning, the 21-year-old allegedly behind a global intelligence disaster, appearing for the first time in front of a federal judge. Today, prosecutors leveling two charges against Jack Teixeira, unauthorized detention and transmission of national defense information, and unauthorized removal of classified information and defense materials. The unsealed affidavit spells out how the low-level Air National Guardsman supposedly stole classified materials and then posted some of the country's most sensitive secrets in an online gaming chat. We learned of the accused leaker's identity yesterday Thursday. And then watched, you see it there as a heavily armed federal agents descended on his Massachusetts home. The disclosure spilled the tea on Ukraine's depleting air defenses on Russian special forces losses in that war, the sour American outlook on the war and much more. So how this happened and stopping it from happening again, is a top line concern across the government. Questions of access are critical. Teixeira quite literally a cog in the military machine, a cyber transport engineer tasked with keeping the Pentagon's networks up and running. But Teixeira high tech job was paired with an alleged, you might call lo-fi scheme. The guardsman apparently printed the top-secret material and just walked out the door with it. We start in Boston, CNN's Jason Carroll who is outside the federal courthouse. Jason, tell us more?",

      "sentences": "Well, we're just outside federal court here just moments ago, John, when we saw Teixeira's family leaving the courthouse. They were surrounded by a mass of reporters, photographers, cameraman there and myself included asking repeatedly, if they had any sort of comment at all about what had just happened in court.As they walked down the street, again repeatedly asking them the question. They remained silent. Inside the court, it was packed. Inside the courtroom, as the judge laid out the charges that Teixeira is facing. At one point he asked him, if he understood the charges that he was facing, and he very softly answered, yes. Included in that unsealed affidavit new information, new allegations about Teixeira, including Teixeira held a top-secret security clearance that was granted back in 2021, apparently had access to classified programs since 2021. And began allegedly posting these classified documents back in December of 2022, including at one point using a government computer to search a database for the word leaked. This was on April 6, of course, after reports publicly went out that someone was leaking classified information. While inside court there was a row set up for his family members at one point during the proceeding, a woman who was sitting there, she was crying. She was praying during the proceeding. And once it was over, once the proceeding had concluded, a man there was sitting in the front row believed to be his father said, love you, Jack. And at that point, the defendant simply said, you too dad. The judge set another court proceeding. That will be next Wednesday. That is going to be when there is a detention hearing. So that's the next time we look for him to be in court, but a lot of drama inside and outside the courtroom today. John?",

I don't know. But you know, it is just as serious, but I don't think that the way the military indoctrinates people, and I don't think they talk about it, they don't think about it, because it's not their job. The weapons are their job, the executing is their job, not protecting the information. So, I don't want to go overboard and saying like, oh, it's the military's fault.

Egypt secretly planned to supply rockets to Russia, authority and a relationship are always problematic relationship with the current government of Egypt. Israeli spy chiefs led secret revolt against Netanyahu, complicates that relationship. Leaked documents suggest Ukrainian Air Defense in parallel if not reinforced.

Monitoring of searches made in classified databases, monitoring of printed or copy documents. So, the technology exists.

The Justice Department and the manufacture of an abortion pill asked the Supreme Court to intervene now in an emergency dispute.

So, it's expected here that the Supreme Court could act very quickly because, you know, if they don't, the entire way that this abortion pill is administered, it would change overnight tonight. Now to be clear, it would still be available but there would really be drastic changes that the FDA is plainly saying, they're unsure about how to handle all this. And they're saying it's a process that really demands a lot more than just the flip of a switch.So, the Justice Department and what they just filed with the Supreme Court, they're laying out all of these logistical hurdles. And they're saying that this abrupt shift in the regulatory landscape is just really proving impossible to comply with. So, here's what would happen if the Supreme Court does not step in. At 1 a.m., Saturday morning Eastern Time, so just about 13 hours from now, a Fifth Circuit ruling would actually take effect, and there are many things that the Fifth Circuit laid out here. They're saying that women beyond seven weeks pregnant, they wouldn't be able to take mifepristone. Even though up to now, women up to 10 weeks pregnant are allowed to take it. In addition, all telehealth and prescription by mail options would be eliminated. So up to this point, women have been able to get this prescribed online by their doctor and then get it in the mail. But that would all end overnight tonight if the Supreme Court does not step in here. And to really hammer home the stakes of this case, John, the DOJ in their filing to the Supreme Court right off the bat here. They say look, this is a drug that has been approved for more than 20 years since 2000 through five different presidential administrations. And on top of that, the World Health Organization has mifepristone listed on its list of essential medicines. So, John, there is a lot at stake here, a lot the DOJ is laying out about how consequential this would be if the Supreme Court doesn't step in. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. The Supreme Court has just about 13 hours from now to really act if they're going to. John?",

We know you've been busy throughout the day watching this. In this court fight over abortion access is just one piece of this debate. In Florida, a new law now bans abortions after only six weeks.The Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signing that bill. You see the picture late last night in his office saying, \"we are proud to support life and family in the state.\" This nearly a year to the day after he signed Florida's current 15 week ban on abortion. Then you see the pictures there, DeSantis holding last year signing ceremony in a church with an audience. With us to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Jeremy Diamond, NPR's Claudia Grisales, and Rhonda Colvin of The Washington Post. I want to start with you Jeremy, because it's interesting. You covered the Biden White House, and they were so quick, so quick to criticize a state governor Ron DeSantis in this case for this. Florida's extreme and dangerous new abortion ban, flies in the face of fundamental freedoms and is out of step with the views of the vast majority of people of Florida and of all of the United States. Look, it's an important issue to a Democratic president. But Ron DeSantis happens to be one of the top two candidates at the moment for the Republican nomination.",

One of many, in fact, where they believe that Republicans are overreaching, overstepping. We've seen this play out in Congress as well, where the White House believes that Republicans are overstepping with some of their oversight efforts, overstepping in several other realms.And so, you know, we have watched the politics of abortion really fundamentally swing since, not just the Dobbs decision, but shortly before the Dobbs decision, particularly when it leaked out. We saw the impact that it had in the 2022 midterms. And really, this is gone in terms of an enthusiasm factor. That is where we've seen the biggest swing, is that previously Republicans really used this as an issue to fire up their base. And now we're seeing Democrats much more able to do so themselves, and that there are risks for Republicans who come out with these more extreme abortion positions. And perhaps that's why whereas last year, when he signed the 15-week abortion, he did it with an audience in a church with a lot of pomp and circumstance. This year, he did it behind closed doors. He then released that picture hours after signing it but just a tweet in a picture. And today, in speaking at Liberty University, it seems like he made only passing reference to this abortion bill, which is notable.",

And they felt that it was just a step too far. A lot of the state legislatures passing bans, of course, right now in front of the Supreme Court is the question about abortion through pill.And if you look at the polling, it seems to be pretty stable that a lot of Americans do not want any more bands. They may feel if they have a conservative leaning that something should be done. But they aren't in agreement with a hard stance on abortion. You're seeing that over and over again, Pew, Gallup, all of polling places. So, it appears, we're seeing a lot of these Republican candidates in real time, try to strategize around this because it appears abortion will be a minefield out if they're going to really have to face moving forward into the primary season.",

Trump, for example, spent seven hours being deposed under oath in a high stakes New York civil case that alleges years of Trump business organization fraud. Also yesterday, two of his former top intelligence aide were facing questions from a federal grand jury. One, the former Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, testified before a grand jury investigating Trump's handling of classified documents. The former Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe was before the grand jury for another lane of the special counsel probe.Whether laws were broken as Trump from election day to the Capitol insurrection, tried to find ways to overturn or block certification of Joe Biden's election win. Ratcliffe is the latest senior Trump aide forced to testify because of court victories by the special counsel. And our new CNN reporting sheds new light on one area of Jack Smith's investigation. We are learning that Smith's investigators are pressing witnesses for details about their attorneys, including whether any of them, those attorneys have attempted to influence testimony to protect the former president. Joining me now to share the new reporting is CNN's Katelyn Polantz, also here with insights the former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. So let me read from some of this reporting. It's really fascinating. We know several avenues of Jack Smith. This one is quite fascinating. Investigators working for special counsel Jack Smith are exploring multiple facets of a possible obstruction case. And that could include whether testimony has been improperly influenced and coordinated within Trump's legal network. So, correct me if I'm wrong. A recommend go to attorney X. Attorney X is part of a conversation. They say, when you go before the grand jury, let us help you. Is that roughly what they're looking at?",
