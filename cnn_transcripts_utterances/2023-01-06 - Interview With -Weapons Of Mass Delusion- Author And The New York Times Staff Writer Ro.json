Welcome to the program, everyone. I am Bianna Golodryga sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The United States is marking the second anniversary of the attack on the Capital on January 6, 2021. It is a solemn occasion that President Biden is marking by awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to 12 individuals who have defended U.S. democracy. Many of them are Capitol police who faced the rioters two years ago. Meantime, Congress faces a new crisis as well. The kind that has not been seen in 164 years. After three, days, the House of Representatives remains speakerless as the Republican majority struggles to overcome bitter divides. Their leader, Kevin McCarthy, is trading away more and more power to garner the support of stubborn holdouts. But, even if the strategy pays off, what he is giving away could make Congress almost unmanageable. Well, there is a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it. I'm joined by Mondaire Jones, former Democratic congressman who was at the Capitol during the attack two years ago. And also with us is Robert Draper, he is the author of \"Weapons of Mass Delusion: When the Republican Party Lost Its Mind\" and has been reporting from the Capitol all week. Welcome, both of you. Robert, let me start with you. So, going into today's session, Kevin McCarthy said that he expects holdouts voting for him today, that some of those 20 will in fact turn. And that is what we saw in the first voting session of the day. Obviously, a better day for Kevin McCarthy than it has been in the days prior, but that is all relative. What do you expect to happen at the end of the day? Will he solidify leadership? ROBERT DRAPER, AUTHOR, \"WEAPONS OF MASS DELUSION\", STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Well, I don't know yet if it is going to happen by the end of the day, Bianna. It's certainly going to happen soon. I think that McCarthy faces a couple of problems in the immediate, obviously, he is chipping away at votes. But there is going to be a hard-core that will still prevent him from getting the speakership, and he's got to figure out a way to build some kind of off-ramp for them. Because some of them who are in this, like Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert, I do not think, were in it because they really want to change a procedure. They're in it for the fight club and there is a base that reward that kind of fighting behavior. The converse of that is that if they do give in, even if the -- is a very suitable compromise to them, it is still going to look like capitulation. So, they will have to figure that out. The second more long term concern is the one that you referenced earlier, Bianna, which is that this is going to make for an extremely weak speakership. And it is going to be very, very difficult to see how -- I mean, already with a razor thin majority of 222 or so, it's going to be hard to get to 218 on anything. But now, it is going to be difficult just to decide on what bills get moved into committee. What rules govern floor activity. It's going to a real mess.",

And that is allowing one member to vote to oust the speaker. A 72-hour rule to review bills. More freedom caucus members to be placed on the Rules Committee. And, just today, Bloomberg is reporting that he agreed to $75 billion in defense cuts. I am just curious, given these concessions, what impact do you think that would have on his speakership if he does in fact gain it at some point. And could we be here again, given some of these concessions, in just a week or two time?",

I think that, youknow, the idea of a snap vote for a motion to vacate has been present for some time. It was Speaker Pelosi who changed the rule on that after it had happened to Boehner. The problem, of course, is that this is a very rambunctious, arguably ungovernable, unmanageable group of Republicans who will chop at the bit for the possibility to do this. I think that some of the other changes were arguably welcome amongst mainstream Republicans. Even including allowing, say, more freedom caucus types to be on the Rules Committee. But the motion to vacate is, you know, essentially -- I mean, it's -- it could utter a very, very short speakership for McCarthy.",

I'm just wondering, given your perch, you are now not in Congress but you were. And you are there two years ago, and we're going to talk about the meaning and the symbolism of all of this happening today. What is your take on the issue at hand in how Democrats are responding in unison, right now, just watching this from the sidelines? FMR. REP. MONDAIRE JONES (D-NY):  Well, this is extraordinary, as you noted. The fact that the only precedence for this is or was the years leading up to the civil war, I think, is telling in and of itself. I was listening to my former colleague, (INAUDIBLE), in nominating Hakeem Jeffries as minority leader -- or as speaker, I should say, on the House floor yesterday. He talked about being sworn in in January of 2019 in the midst of a government shutdown. He talked about being sworn in in January of 2021 alongside folks like myself. And, of course, just a few days later we saw an attempted coup, the overthrow of the federal government itself incited by the leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump. And so, this is, in some ways, the natural progression of a party, a Republican Party, that increasingly is filled with people who do not want to govern. But rather, who want to incite anger among the American people. And when they finally do elect a speaker, which I do believe will happen. I don't know that it will be Kevin McCarthy, but it will be somebody. What will happen next? They're going to be investigating Hunter Biden. And, you know, giving a lot of money to other investigations that the American people did not elect them to do and that are distractions from the issues of inflation and crime and immigration. The other things that they ran on.",

And, again, putting aside those who are just doing this for chaos's sake, I am wondering if you think he has a point when he says this. Let's play. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT ROSENDALE (R-MO):  The debate and the discussion has been all but eliminated. And the balance of us are left to vote yes or no, those are our options.

So, we'll see if that doesend up transpiring at some point in terms of nominating a -- somebody there for speakership. Robert, as we noted, today is a solemn day. It marks the two-year mark of the attack at the Capitol. And, not all of these 200 that are behind McCarthy are election deniers, but a good portion are. And of the 20 that are the holdouts, I believe all of them are election deniers. So, yes, we can say two years later democracy prevailed, but I am just wondering given that these 20, at least, maybe the number has gone down a bit now are holding this process hostage.

Bianna, I just want to say that two years ago, at precisely this time, I was walking through the Capitol Rotunda and happen to see onmy left some Capitol policeman running up the steps of the west terrace. I went over there. And before -- in a matter of minutes, found myself being among ad hoc group that was helping to splash -- to set up a water station so that the police could remove the mace from their eyes. It was a really, really horrific day. And it's -- and it was interesting to see in the last couple of days when Democrats have stood up and denounced the Republicans for their behavior on January the 6th to see no effort at rebuttal on their part. And I do think that -- to your point, that the 20 holdouts were all election deniers. One thing that we can certainly see is far from any kind of -- oh, I don't know, repair or self-repudiation about what they did and didn't do that day. We will instead, likely, see among the investigations that takes place, the investigation of the January 6th Committee itself. That they will be burrowing through the evidence boxes to see if there's anything to suggest, for example. If Speaker Nancy Pelosi had played some role in the laxness of the security. That is certainly a conclusion that a lot of these Republicans have reached. And now they are going to find evidence to support that conclusion.",

But at some point, they were elected by the American public and voters to get things done in Washington. And at some point, I don't know how long this is going to last, but even once a speaker is announced they've got to deal with real serious issues like the debt ceiling, like funding for Ukraine, funding the government, et cetera. Is there a point where they're missing an opportunity by not stepping in, by not appealing or appearing to look like they are willing to work across the aisle for the sake of the country as a whole?",

      "sentences": "In fact, I think you see Democrats doing that. Every time there is a ballot cast and Hakeem Jeffries is the highest vote getter by a largemargin. It is the natural next step for any so-called moderate Republican, a good conscience, who cares about governing to go over to Democrats who are unified and say, hey, there are about five of us who are willing to vote for a Democratic leader. And no one, by the way, has, from my observation, been critical of Hakeem Jeffries as someone who would be a good speaker among those moderate Republicans who have been speaking to the press. And of course, they can negotiate the terms of a power sharing agreement. But it is not a natural next step, I think, for Democrats who are unified and who have been nominating someone who is getting more votes consistently to go over to the other side and empower Kevin McCarthy, for example. Who was one of the two thirds of House Republicans in January of 2021 to vote to overturn that free and fair presidential election. This is the problem. It is not just the first order of business of electing a Republican speaker, it is what happens afterwards when they are in the majority. The investigations, the inability to deal with the debt ceiling because they are not serious about making policy. They're -- that's why they are better off time in times running for office than actually governing. And I think, so long as the American people continue to see what is happening, they are going to come away with a better understanding of what happens when you put Republicans in charge of government.",

And so, the Biden administration, while doing, you know, other things will certainly take every opportunity to contrast their own performance and their own efforts at good governments with the chaos that presumably will surround Kevin McCarthy's Republicans. This will be the reminder that if you allow -- the American voter, if you allow Republicans to run the table to control the Senate, the House, and the executive branch, then you will see this pervasive dysfunctionality.

Mikhail, if I can start with you. There is some healthy skepticism over the motivation of Putin's unilateral move for Christmas time cease-fire as we are hearing sirens in the cities throughout Ukraine as well. There is an idea, perhaps, that he is doing this to buy more time and perhaps even conscript more Russian men. What is your take on this? MIKHAIL ZYGAR, RUSSIAN JOURNALIST, AUTHOR, \"ALL OF THE KREMLIN'S MEN\":  No, I personally think that is completely internal propaganda and that message is directed to Russian audience, like all the people who are watching Russian television at home, because there is still new year's holidays going on, and they are watching it. And they hear that Putin is the only person who wants peace, and they might sensified with that message. And that's -- they are the target of that message. Not Ukraine, not the United States.",

And I want to read from your piece about Herring. And you write about Herring in 2018. Had brought a drone and taught himself to locate schools of fish by tracking the whales and sharks that fed on them. When he realized the drones would play a role in Ukraine, he said, it was hard to sit on the sidelines knowing you can help. He added that he had grown up in Illinois, and as a Midwesterner, dude, I always hated Russia the, whole red dawn thing. Herring had flown drones for hundreds of hours in Donetsk, dropping explosives on Russian positions and identifying enemy coordinates for Ukrainian artillery.

When Doc first rotated to Donetsk, a Portuguese team ever whose parents were Ukrainian, would translate from Ukrainian to Portuguese, which a Brazilian member would translate to Spanish, which American member would translate to English.

A private military company, Wagner. And that -- and Wagner is not reporting to the minister of defense. That is not a part of the military bureaucracy. And it's fighting on its own. It's fighting near Ukrainian City of Bakhmut. And the chances of Wagner to take Bakhmut seem rather probable. So, probably, soon we are going to hear of Prigozhin as the only successful world leader on the Russian side. But at the same time, Prigozhin has become very politically important. He is the only guy to openly challenged the ministry of defense, different Russian governors. He's touring across Russia, recruiting convicts from Russian prisons. So, he can -- he has that power that is superior to the power of FSB or all other Russian security services. So, he can free anyone from prison and take him to his own personal army. So, a lot of people in Moscow say that the personal influence of Prigozhin that has become that impressive. And so, he's got his own clan, and many very influential oligarchs, bureaucrats, politicians, like the ideologists of Russian fascism, Dugin, or Konstantin Malofeev who used to be the sponsor of the invasion to Donbas in 2014, are now aligned with Prigozhin.

The fact that U.S. democracy, and indeed, the world's majordemocracies are not at our top risk list is a very important thing. This is a very strong flashing don't panic sign, because there is resilience in these institutions. And even when leaders try to do things that are truly disruptive and break the system, plenty of checks and balances that prevent them from doing that. The problem, Walter, is that we are facing a global environment where a small number of individual actors, some of which are aging dictators, some of which are tech pros, there's a little bit of overlap between those two groups, have an extraordinary amount of power. They have no checks and balances. They can make really bad decisions and they don't get a lot of great expertise in helping them formulate those decisions. Putin, of course, is the one who's made the worst decision of them. Literally the worst misjudgment of any leader on the global stage in decades, and he's going to be paying the consequences for that, and the world is a lot more unstable as a consequence. But it is not just that, it is also Xi Jinping, it's also Iran's supreme leader and it's also a small number of techno of billionaires who also have the ability to make decisions that are deeply disruptive for global democracies without a lot of ability to prevent them from doing that. So, that is really where the risks are. A very different from the kind of conversations we were having, say, on January 6th a couple of years ago. And, yet, in many ways, much more problematic for the world economy, for geopolitics, that what was happening in the nation's capital.",

It is about proxy war and terrorist attacks and cyberattacks and espionage and drone attacks and ballistic missile attacks. So, a Russia as a rogue state for NATO would be a country that is a perpetual threat for those countries the way that Iran is a threat to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, the UAE. That is a very serious problem. That's what happened when the peace dividend is over in Europe and you have a war. Remember, the war that is going on right now with Ukraine is a proxy war with NATO. NATO is fighting Russia. Now, they are fighting Russia using Western intelligence, Western weapons. They don't have soldiers on the ground in Ukraine. They are not doing a no- fly zone. So, you don't have American fighter jets knocking Russian jets out of the sky. But from the Russian perspective, this is a war. And it is a war that they are losing.

Biden's U.S. foreign policy for an American middle class, it is also a functional understanding that, if we are not getting that message through to main street in the United States, we don't want to be involved in wars around the world. Now, Ukraine has been the exception, and Walter, we have seen a lot of leadership from that United States on Ukraine, not just militarily, but diplomatically and economically. It has made the G7 stronger. It's made NATO stronger. But, your question, even fits there because the developing world looks at the West and says, you only care about Ukraine because it is a bunch of white people in Europe. If that was happening in Ethiopia, or the DRC, or Yemen, you wouldn't say boo. So, why are we going to take the food prices, fertilizer, and energy prices on the chin? Why should we support your sanctions and your votes when you don't care about us? And that also makes it harder to have global leadership when majority of the world's 8 billion people don't trust that the United States, Japan, Germany, other wealthy countries, are going to lift a finger for them. We are called donor countries. The wealthy democracies in the world. And yet, if you are sitting in a country like India or Sub-Saharan African countries, you think that you are the ones that are doing the donating. It is your human capital and labor, it is your resources that are getting exploited, and yet, you are the charity cases in the world? It really angers them.

It's a close election. Say he loses. But you have people in positions of power overseeing state elections, secretaries of state, governors that decide that they're going to help him try to steal the election. He can't overturn it, but he can break it. I think that the potential of that happening in 2024 is now virtually zero. Because -- not because Democrats, you know, were able to hold the Senate, or because there wasn't a red wave, no. Rather because truly incompetent people running for some core positions that would oversee state elections, those people lost. And so, you just don't have people in positions of power that are prepared to try to steal or break the election. Remember, when Trump tried to do that after January 6th, and in the run up to January 6th, when he was calling Republican Party members in Georgia and Arizona, find me some votes. I want to steal this election. That is basically what he did. We found that in the January 6th Committee investigations. Republican Party members, rank and file, said, no. And they said no because fundamentally, they may be conservative, they may be Republican, it doesn't matter, they are American. And first and foremost, they believe in the rule of law, just like the police do, just like the military does. And it turns out that that really matters in a country like the United States. The U.S. was tested and the U.S. responded.
