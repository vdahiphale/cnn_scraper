(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT):  I just think that the American people expect the Supreme Court to be above politics and to be above personal financial interests and anything of this nature puts that into question, and I think it needs to be addressed.

Guys, great to have all of you here. Okay. I barely know where to begin with the Supreme Court. There are so many things that have just been disclosed and revealed that are ethics problems. So, let's start with the billionaire GOP donor, Harlan Crow, who we know has already bankrolled Clarence Thomas' trips for 20 years, but now we know that he has also bank rolled Clarence Thomas' nephew. So, Clarence Thomas has raised his nephew from the time I think the boy was six, basically acting as his father, and he sent him to a private boarding school. And that boarding school costs about $54,000 a year, maybe $60,000 a year. And it turns out that Harlan Crow has been paying at least for it appears two years of that boy's tuition. And Clarence Thomas, Senator, never disclosed that. What are we to make of this? FMR. SEN. AL FRANKEN (D-MN):  Well, I think that Clarence Thomas has a problem, which is he doesn't report income he's getting from people or trying to trying to buy influence with him.

And I probably would if I could, not that I would know what to do with one, but the fact that you can actually do it is terrifying.When you think about what the court is and the amount of power that the court wields over the American people, the ability to legislate, to strike down laws, they are probably when you look at it orders of magnitude more powerful than legislators because they can just, by their decisions, do stuff. And to know that this type of corruption is happening while we're watching this court make decisions about the bodies of women that we share our communities with, it's pretty breathtaking, but it's also frustrating because there doesn't seem to be much that we can do about it without wholesale reform of the court.",

As part of his desire to perpetuate the American dream for all and believing education is the great equalizer, he and his wife have supported many young Americans through scholarship and other programs at a variety of schools, including his alma mater and, in fact, it was his alma mater, which is one of the schools he paid for Clarence Thomas' nephew.",

It's no longer something that you can force or require students to do at school, but students can still pray privately, right?So, this idea that, you know, we just don't have it in the culture, I don't actually think that's true.

The fact that he is the mayor of New York City, a black man, that's the power of many unanswered prayers, right? That we have the highest law officer, legal officer in the land as far as the attorney general, prayers being answered, right? You listen to all of these things that most of the leadership from the Senate majority leader in the state, to the leader in the assembly, all minorities, that many unanswered prayers. But then again to your point talking about that village, that at some point, this journey towards power has to culminate natural results for that village. Right, and so when we're talking about 75 percent of black children in New York City not doing Math at grade level, when we're talking about three out of five black children in the Bronx living in poverty, these are unanswered prayers on some basic level.

Also, we need to put back the child tax credit so there are fewer kids in poverty. The child tax credit reduced poverty tremendously in this country. And there was a study done saying that there was more brain activity for kids in homes where there's more money, that the child tax credit actually helped do that.
