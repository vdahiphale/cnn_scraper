Who in 2022 filed a lawsuit that said the Biden administration overstepped in communicating with social media companies during the pandemic, when it asked those social media companies to police speech on topics such as COVID-19, election integrity and the security of voting by mail.Now this judge said the agencies and officials are barred from, quote, specifically flagging content or post on social media platforms and/or forwarding such to social media companies urging, encouraging, pressuring or inducing in any manner for removal, deletion, suppression or reduction of content containing protected free speech. Now those affected include the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, the FBI and the Justice Department, as well as more than a dozen top officials including the U.S. Surgeon General and White House press secretary. By this order, they are prohibited from communicating with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, YouTube, Google and TikTok as well as another of other online platforms. Now we reached out to those social media companies for comment and have not heard back. Meta though, did declined to comment. There are a few exceptions, the Treasury Department, Commerce Department and FDA can still have contact with these social media companies. But the agency's names can communicate only with the social media companies if there is any illegal activity or national security threats. Judge Doughty, a Trump appointee, has not made a final ruling on this case. But this is a significant victory for the states that are suing the Biden administration in this matter.

It is there that these tanks of water, enough to fill 500 Olympic pools, has been filtered. It has been diluted. You mentioned these international standards for safe water release. This water still will contain a radioactive isotope known as (INAUDIBLE) but it is very much consistent with the levels that we have seen released from other nuclear facilities not only here in the world but around the entire globe.

President Biden, for his, part, he was not at the White House when this took place. Now, we should note that on the weekends here at the White House, there are often tour groups that go through the West Wing out of the White House.
