Jimmy Carter is being remembered by those who knew him best as a statesman and a humanitarian. Tributes pouring in from around the world for America's 39th President. Plus, South Korea in mourning after a deadly plane crash of what we're learning about more than 180 victims of the air disaster. And northern Gaza's last remaining major hospital now out of service, and its director reportedly detained in a notorious Israeli military detention center. We have the very latest for you. We begin this hour, though, with the life of the man who rose from peanut farmer to the White House, and whose extraordinary work as a humanitarian statesman post-presidency helped define his remarkable legacy. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter died on Sunday at his Plains, Georgia home, with his family there by his side. At 100 years old, he was the oldest living American President. Carter surprised many by beating out a crowded field of Democrats, then incumbent President Gerald Ford to win the 1976 election after the Vietnam war and Watergate, he vowed to heal a battered nation.

One of his signature White House legacies was the Torrijos-Carter treaties that returned the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. He also calmed Mid-East tensions, brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David Accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance, backed the Afghan Mujahideen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979 Islamic revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow, spiked oil prices and led to a humiliating failed raid -- Operation Eagle Claw in April 1980 to rescue Americans captured by the theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

But 1994 was his big year of high profile peacemaking. In September, he went to Haiti. Raoul Cedras, the Caribbean nation's unpopular leader, was holed up in Port-au-Prince. Carter convinced him to step down quite literally, as the U.S. 82nd Airborne troops were inbound aboard Black Hawk helicopters ready to remove Cedras by force. Carter won the day, saved lives. The U.S. troops landed as de facto peacekeepers. And later that year, Carter went to the dark heart of Bosnia's violent ethnic civil war, met the nationalist Serbs in their mountain stronghold parley, tried to stop their bloody, murderous siege and shelling of the capital, Sarajevo, to bring an end to the killing that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives during horrific ethnic cleansing. Success came slowly in steps. Carter helped initiate a short Christmas ceasefire, and by his presence, pushed the horrific conflict toward greater international attention.

Some of his biggest accomplishments in the White House include a treaty to eventually return control of the Panama Canal back to Panama, a move which helped counter growing hostility toward the United States throughout the Western Hemisphere. Carter also strengthened the normalization of ties between China and the United States. Formalizing an agreement to establish full diplomatic relations. But perhaps his most significant achievement as president was bringing together two longtime enemies. You're looking at video there. He helped broker peace between Israel and Egypt, ending decades of war between them. Our Christian Amanpour looks at what the landmark accords meant for his presidency, and indeed, the world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over):  Peace in the Middle East, the impossible dream. But President Jimmy Carter wasn't afraid to take it on, inviting two of the world's fiercest enemies to the White House retreat at Camp David in 1978. Jimmy Carter had been derided for his administration's foreign policy failures, partly because he's considered to have lost a U.S. friendly Iran to the Ayatollahs. But the Camp David Accords were his geopolitical triumph. He managed to strike a deal between Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat.

Begin, to agree with Sadat, had to give up territory for the first time, and to give up settlements.

But you see the police response to that, firing tear gas, arresting more than 50 people, which many in the human rights and civil society spaces believe is illegal under Kenyan law.

She had abdominal injury, and she had a near top amputated left leg, which we -- which I tried to save, but I couldn't. And her mother died that same evening due to her injuries.

I mean, we've mentioned Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal al Adwan Hospital, of course, the last remaining hospital, that's now out of service. Do you -- I mean, from on a personal level, and I know you won't -- want to focus on this. I mean, what are you hearing about the doctor and do you worry about the rest of your colleagues at this point? DR. TAHIR:  So, when I was in the north, Dr. Hussam was injured. I tried to make the attempt to go to Kamal Adwan hospital to treat him. This was flatly rejected. In fact, we had Indonesian colleagues who were trying to go to Kamal Adwan on several occasions, and which we were rejected repeatedly until one time. So, very surprisingly we're accepted. And then one or two days later, was sent back walking from Kamal Adwan to the public aid hospital, and having had all their medical kit confiscated. So, they were literally humiliated and sent back. I was -- when I was on my way to Kamal -- to -- sorry, to the north of Gaza, I was speaking to a U.N. security personnel. This was five or six weeks, maybe seven weeks ago now. And he told me that an IDF officer had told him that Kamal Adwan was no longer a hospital and that they had to make the plan to forget about it. So, this was a clear plan for several weeks beforehand that they wanted to wipe out Kamal Adwan Hospital and inflict a very significant injury to the healthcare system there. I would say mortal injury. Because now you have no function in hospital to serve the entire population of the north of Gaza. Bear in mind, these people have no way of connecting with the rest of the world. We don't know who gets hurt and when. We -- nobody can come to save them. They are being -- they are in and amongst a wipeout. We used to hear the thunderous sounds of these bands. They would shake our rooms, our operating rooms, our beds, and it was constant. I am afraid for them. Of course, I'm afraid for my colleagues. We've had colleagues killed. So, I'm very afraid for Dr. Hussam and for his wellbeing.",
