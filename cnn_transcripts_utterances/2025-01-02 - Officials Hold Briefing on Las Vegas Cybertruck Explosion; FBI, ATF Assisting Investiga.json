ATF is bringing our expertise in post blast investigations in our crime gun intelligence to specifically assist in this investigation. I will tell you that our special agent bomb techs are working with FBI and with Las Vegas Metro and sifting through that post blast debris to find components and investigative leads that will derive from that evidence process.We're too early into that investigation process to give any determination as far as how this device was initiated. I will say that we do know that the components primarily consist of fireworks, mortars, aerial shells, and are all consumer fireworks. Nothing commercial grade has been discovered at this point. And we've identified some fuel enhancers like the Coleman fuel and VP Racing fuel and some explosive targets that can be purchased at any sporting goods store. We've also, as you -- as the sheriff mentioned, we've identified two semiautomatic handguns recovered from the Tesla. We have successfully traced those firearms and I can tell you that Matthew Livelsberger lawfully purchased both of these firearms on December 30th, 2024. We have agents following up those investigative leads. We know exactly where those firearms were purchased and we will share any developments from those leads as they come in. Thank you.",

And so there's investigative activity taking place literally around the globe, trying to determine what the potential nexus is. But at this time, at this particular moment in time, as the sheriff aptly said, we have to focus on what we know and what we don't know. We know we have a bombing, absolutely.And it's a bombing that certainly has factors that raise concern. It's not lost on us that it's in front of, you know, of the Trump Building, that it's a Tesla vehicle. But we don't have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology or the, you know, any of the reasoning behind it.

We're looking to try to identify them because their vehicles would have also had cameras that would have taped anybody in and around them.

And so the explosion that was in that vehicle sort of vented out and up, but it didn't even damage the glass doors at the Trump. So I'm not sure what that means. I also know that there's a number of unexploded pieces of the things that he had inside of that vehicle. And so I just don't think that it was done as well as he was expecting it to be done.

Sir.MAN #4: Just quickly, you had mentioned a number of the components in the back of the truck that did not go off. Maybe this is a better suited question for ATF, but when it comes to the rudimentary nature of the bomb, I think we mostly think of a bomb that is connected. This seems like individual, kind of incendiary and combustible components put together. Can you speak to how you think this is a bomb, or was it just several pieces of things that might blow up and might explode that were just lit and gone off at the same time?",

Let's just go through, really, I think, the big headlines, which are the identification of the individual.They still have to do medical records, they still have to do DNA. That's very clear. But they have a lot of evidence indicating that this is an active duty Green Beret. So an elite Special Forces soldier currently serving in the U.S. Military. But, Evan, I know something that stood out to you was, look, this was quite a scene. There's questions about what kind of message is someone sending when they blow up a cybertruck in front of a Trump Hotel. And they're trying to figure out things about the motive here. EVAN PEREZ, SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right? The fact that nothing has been readily available to the FBI. Nothing is readily visible. You know, obviously we compare it to the New Orleans attacker. You know, that person plainly made clear what they were trying to do. They had an ISIS flag, they had writings about what they were intending to do. They had recorded videos. This person committed suicide, gunshot -- self-inflicted gunshot and then detonated a firework which exploded the cybertruck. Obviously, the fact that this was a cybertruck, it's an -- it's a Tesla. And given Elon Musk's proximity and support for Donald Trump and the fact that this is a Trump Hotel, that this happened at, it leads everyone to ask the obvious question. And the FBI is obviously saying, not yet. We don't know what exactly he was intending to do. And that makes a huge difference for the FBI because they need to know motivation to be able to say that this was a terrorist attack or this was an attempt to do a terrorist attack. Keep in mind, when he drives up into the entryway there for the -- the Trump, the Trump Hotel. I can't pronounce that, Porte-cochere? Is that what they -- they keep calling it --",

There does not appear to be any bollards in front of the Trump building. So he could have driven that vehicle directly into the lobby if he wanted to create a fire inside and more damage. This is a Special Forces individual, a guy who's a master sergeant in the Green Berets. He knows how to do this, and he did not do significant damage to other individuals.
