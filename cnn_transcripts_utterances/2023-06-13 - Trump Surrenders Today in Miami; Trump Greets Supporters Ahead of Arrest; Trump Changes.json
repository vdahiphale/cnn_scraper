We just learned intriguing, new information about the extent to which Trump seems to be keeping the other individual indicted, Walt Nauta, as close as he possibly can. He flew with him to Florida, even ate dinner with him last night.At this moment, Trump is at his resort in Doral, just a few miles from the court. CNN has exclusive video of the president last night greeting supporters there. Later, the former president will be taken by car to the court. It is expected he will drive under the building. He will enter the courthouse from there. His appearance is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. this afternoon. Once inside, Trump will officially be under arrest. It is expected he will be fingerprinted but not have a mug shot taken. Trump has maintained his innocence and is expected to plead not guilty to all 37 counts. Now, once this is finished today, Trump will head back to the airport and tonight he will speak at a fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is outside the court. It will be an eventful day there to say the least, Paula. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, John. It is also a solemn day. This is the first time a former president of the United States will be arraigned on federal criminal charges. This specific case, of course, having to do with national security. And as Special Counsel Jack Smith put it, this is potentially an issue of life or death connected to the alleged mishandling of classified information that could have put lives at risk. Now, this arraignment is still several hours away, but at this point the former president does not seem to have his full legal team in place after the departures of mostly all of the attorneys who have been representing him so far in this investigation. We know today he will be represented by one of his attorneys in another case, Todd Blanche, along with Chris Kise. He is the former Florida solicitor general. Kise is not expected to be too involved in this case but he has the right licenses, he knows the state of Florida, so he can help usher them through this initial proceeding until they settle on a final legal team. We know the former president has been talking to some local attorneys down here in Florida. But, historically, he has had difficulty recruiting new lawyers. There are concerns about him paying his bills. Firms have told us they worry about alienating clients and potential reputational damage. But this is just the first step. In fact, today's hearing is even before a magistrate judge. So they still have plenty of time to get the team assembled before this case goes before the trial judge, Judge Aileen Cannon. Now, she is a Trump-appointed federal judge. And that is significant because she has already made one decision in a matter related to this case. It was roundly criticized by legal scholars and eventually overturned. So, John, while usually the judge is not a big storyline in a trial, she likely will be. And every decision she makes will be scrutinized. But again, today, it's just the first step in what was expected to be a very long and truly historic case.",

He is someone that Trump only added to his legal team back in early April. Chris Kise was added several months ago. He was initially set to handle this investigation but was pretty quickly sidelined from a majority part of it. He is going to be a second attorney who is there in the courtroom with Trump Today. Whether or not he remains there remains to be seen. We know Randi and her team, and we've since confirmed, that one of he attorneys Trump is trying to add to his team, Ben Cooney (ph), who is a Miami-based attorney, was seen at Trump National Doral yesterday. It's not clear, though, that anything was finalized as of Trump is set to go into court today. He is looking to add another Florida-based attorney to his team. He has not had success in doing so yet. That doesn't seem to be a big concern for Trump's legal team as of today. But the bigger concern is that the top two attorneys who were handling this case resigned abruptly last week when they learned that Trump was trying to add another Florida-based attorney to the team, given they've been handling it ever since that search warrant was executed at Mar-a-Lago last August. So, big questions about what the team will look like going forward. We do know what it will look like today though.",

They like to have that locked down with, you know, barriers and so on. But the Miami PD says we have adequate personnel. There doesn't appear to be a giant threat to the former president from Trump supporters who are coming to support him. And they're very confident that their perimeter. They're going to shut down two blocks around the courthouse. Thepresident - the former president's motorcade is going to come in and go under the building into a garage. He is going to be brought up a freight elevator, which is the elevator that, a, you can get from the garage, but, b, that has enough room for the entire crew of people that are going to be moving with him in terms of Secret Service, FBI and so on. The FBI will arrest him. Then, at the U.S. Marshal's office, a United States Marshal, appointed by President Trump, who is still in office there, they will go through a booking process that's going to require fingerprints, if they follow procedure for federal arrestees, a DNA swab. The mug shot has been kind of the dicey item here, which is, if you take a mug shot, front and side, of a former president of the United States, the collateral value of that, the risk of it leaking out, the fact that that would be against DOJ guidelines, is something that they've really struggled with. So what they're going to do is, there are plenty of pictures of Donald J. Trump. They're going to upload them into the system, in place of a mugshot, so that they will have a photograph, just to check that box, but it won't be the formal mug shot that we're used to.",

That's what Donald Trump allegedly suggested to someone who could become a key witness in this state - in this case. A person described in the indictment as Trump Attorney 1.So, who is Trump Attorney 1? Federal prosecutors say this is the person Trump suggested to hide or destroy documents after a grand jury subpoena on May 11, 2022. And while Attorney 1 is not named in the indictment, their actions directly mirror those of Evan Corcoran. Corcoran's own notes show Trump asked Corcoran on May 11th if there was any way to fight the subpoena, but Corcoran told him he had to comply with it. Weeks later, in early June, Trump invites FBI officials to Mar-a-Lago to retrieve 38 classified documents Corcoran had found in a storage room. But according to the indictment, what Corcoran didn't know was that Trump had already directed Walt Nauta to move some boxes before he searched a storage room. When Corcoran was finished, the indictment says Trump asked Attorney 1, did you find anything? Is it bad? Good? Then they discussed what to do with a folder containing the 38 classified documents before handing that over to the FBI. Notes taken by Attorney 1 says that when Trump made a plucking motion, suggesting the attorney remove anything that was, quote, really bad from the folder. Fast forward to this year, on March 25th, Corcoran testified before a grand jury, this after a federal judge ordered him to answer questions from prosecutors ruling that attorney/client privilege didn't shield his discussions with Donald Trump because the ex-president may have been trying to commit a crime by using his attorneys. Corcoran's own notes now represent what \"The New York Times\" described as some of the most potentially damning evidence in this case. John.",
