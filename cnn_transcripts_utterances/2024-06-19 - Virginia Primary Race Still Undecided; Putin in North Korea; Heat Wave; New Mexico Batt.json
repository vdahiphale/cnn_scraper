There are two wildfires there trapping their town, one from the north, another coming from the south, and at least one person has died. CNN crews just sent in this new video showing the extensive damage there from the wildfires, the governor declaring a state of emergency and warning that the blazes are devastating and that they are enormous. They already scorched well over 20,000 acres so far, and one evacuee describes the fear like this: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Way out there in the distance, that is the South Fork Fire of out in the Sierra Blanca Mountains north of town. You can see in various spots the flames and the smoke shooting up. You can also see here one of the choppers that is flying over the area bringing in water to help fire crews on the ground get these flames and fires under control. And, as you move over to this side over here, just along the backside of this mountain ridge, you can see the smoke coming up from the other side of that fire. And that's why all of this area is under evacuation orders. More than 8,000 people have fled this area to towns like Roswell and Alamogordo about an hour away, 8,000 people; 1,400 structures, we are told, so far have been consumed and burned by these fires. So this is a very intense and frightening time for many of the residents who call this area home. And we spoke with one man that we met at a motel in Alamogordo about an hour away, and he's waiting to find out exactly what kind of condition his house is in and trying to get back to his home.

Here comes the wind. It's part of Tropical Storm Alberto, in fact. That's where the moisture is coming from as well, coming from the east. That's the push of the wind. That's the push. And we're still going to see winds of 20 to 30. So, even though rain comes, if it doesn't come early enough with the wind, that could certainly be more problems. Here's what the smoke forecast looks like. And you can see the town of Ruidoso there, and the smoke will eventually blow toward the west.

Kim hailed North Korea's alliance with Russia as a watershed moment. Earlier, Putin was met with a lavish celebration that included a military parade and a ride in an open limo while thousands of North Koreans lined the streets waving flags and chanting, \"Welcome, Putin.\" Let's get perspective now live from Moscow with CNN chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance.

And, again, the question was, what did it actually commit the United States to doing? And, as you read into the text, really not a huge amount beyond consultation if they got further attacked by Russia. Here, well, we also haven't seen the text, but I think the most interesting two elements of it, Boris, are this. The first is the possibility that the North Koreans are raising the price now for supplying the Russians with two things they really need, thousands and thousands of rounds of ammunition, mostly artillery, where the Russians have had sort of a 50,000-round-a-month deficit. And the North Koreans have stepped up with tens of thousands of rounds themselves. And the second is, if they are raising the price, is Putin now willing to give them some of the missile and nuclear technology that previously he wouldn't? Because, remember, the Russians for the past 25 to 30 years engaged with the United States in China in trying to restrain the North Korean nuclear program. And that's over now.",

I mean, they would be prohibited by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty from doing so, but North Korea exited that treaty many years ago.And that's part of the problem here. But Russia would still be under obligations not to spread nuclear weapons. But that's the big change that's taken place now with both Iran and North Korea. To think back just seven or eight years, when the Iran nuclear agreement was being negotiated, China and Russia were sitting on the U.S. and European side of the table facing the Iranians. If that was happening today, they'd be on the other side of the table with the Iranians. A number of years ago, China and Russia worked to organize something called the Six Party Talks to try to get North Korea to give up a good deal of its nuclear arsenal. They have now surrendered that. They are voting against sanctions on North Korea. And now Putin has signed, as you rightly call it, an ambiguous agreement that would give him plenty of running room to provide them with technology they need.",

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, if Donald Trump, I think, held tight to all of his grudges, then he maybe wouldn't have a V.P. pick that he could pick from or that long of a list, because, at some point, there are a lot of Republicans that have either endorsed another candidate or found themselves on the opposite sides of Donald Trump in a downballot race. That being said, this race right now, Bob Good's, which it looks like he may very well lose, is all about loyalty. And he is a Trumper. He is considered MAGA. He's someone who is an election denier as well, just like his challenger, McGuire. Despite all of that, because of the fact that he endorsed Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump is saying, no, you have to have ultimate loyalty to me across all fronts. And that's why he got involved in this race, despite the fact that sometimes those around him, his aides, don't like him to get involved in these Republican-on- Republican races, because they worry that he won't end up endorsing the winning candidate.",

I don't think he necessarily thinks it's in his own self-interest to forgive Good. And so he's out there against him. And if Good loses, it's not by a lot.

A lot of those candidates did not win across the board, Senate races, governor races, secretary of state races. And so we're going to see again whether or not these more extreme candidates are able to prevail. Now, in this race, in particular, the Republican is going to win. It's a safe Republican district.

He raised over $5 million, and that's a lot of money in a congressional race. And I think his name recognition helped him do that. However, this district is a tight district, and it's not an automatic win for a Democrat. Spanberger only won by 4.6 percent.
