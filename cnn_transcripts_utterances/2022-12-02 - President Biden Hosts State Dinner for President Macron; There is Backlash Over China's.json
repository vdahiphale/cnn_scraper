      "sentences": "Yeah, Kim, you know, the authorities have actually never acknowledged that protests even took place. There has been some coded language in state media about recent events that were instigated by hostile forces. So, they would really never admit that the protests prompted changes or adjustments in their COVID enforcement in recent days. That would obviously shake the very foundation of the infallibility of the party and its top leader.So, I think what is likely to happen here is a so-called two-pronged approach in terms of their reaction to the protest. On one hand, they're intensifying, they're continuing their clamp down on open dissent. As you heard in Selina's piece, she mentioned how police are now checking people on the streets and even on subway cars in terms of their phones and its contents. We have also talked to some other protesters, say they were visited or called on by police who geolocated their phones at protest sites. So, on the other hand, though, you know, you have seen these measures, you mentioned some of them, including the tweaking of policies of different locations, lifting of lockdowns, and the removal or at least reducing testing requirements for a lot of people in the population, not to mention some cities, including here in Beijing. For the first time, positive cases are being allowed to quarantine at home instead of being sent to those mass facilities often in horrific conditions. So, there is some noticeable change on the ground. But the problem here is a lack of consistency or lack of clarity. Nobody knows how long they are going to last if the surge of cases continues, which is very much expected. So, the underlying challenges facing the government very much remain in terms of the low vaccination rate among the elderly as well as the lack of preparation, medical preparation, to deal with a potential surge of severe cases. But one change we did notice that we really hadn't seen before, Kim, is for the first time in a long time, state media start to print and publish articles about how much milder and weaker the Omicron variant is, so it is causing so much less deaths and severe cases. So, really setting the stage for an eventual end of zero-COVID. Kim?",

Russian troops have apparently gained some ground near the city of Bakhmut where Ukraine is evacuating some civilians. A recent social media video suggests Russians are also taking major losses. One video shows dead Russian troops littering the countryside in the area. Some independent military analysts say Russian gains are relatively small compared to the price they are paying. And down south, Ukraine says that Russian troops have pulled out of at least three settlements near Zaporizhzhia. Some pro-Russian civilian governments are reportedly preparing to follow suit. That is happening after Ukrainian strikes on Russian supply lines and ammunition warehouses in the region.For more, Salma Abdelazis joins us from London.

They are spending a great deal of resources, great loss of life to try to make these very tiny gains on small settlements in Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces, of course, also trying to counter them there. But again, it is an indication from experts who have been looking at this battlefield that Russia has learned very little from its losses on the Ukrainian battlefield. Some experts saying that Russia simply spending too much energy on Bakhmut, which has very little strategic value. I also want to just take you further south to the Zaporizhzhia region as well, Kim. That is a very important flashpoint as well, home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant that is currently Russian- occupied. There, as well, Ukrainian forces appear to be pushing back Russian troops. Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces are withdrawing from some areas in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukrainian troops are pushing the same methods that we have seen in the past, trying to cut off supply lines to Moscow's forces, cutting off bridges as well, hitting Russian positions behind the frontlines, and it does appear to be working. Also, there is monitoring of the battlefield. We will tell you, Kim, that that very much is likely to be Ukraine's next focus, the southern region towards, if you will, that eastern bank, that major gain of the Kherson capital -- the provincial capital of Kherson, which happened just a few weeks ago. So, Ukrainian forces are really preparing to move towards that eastern bank, it appears, and fortifying their positions all along that southern region in anticipation of that.

Prince William and Catherine spent Thursday visiting environmental startups as well as at-risk youth groups. Also today, the royal couple will meet U.S. President Joe Biden.
