The Nashville Metro Council voted to put Justin Jones back in office. The expulsion of Jones and another black Democrat from the Republican- dominated House has triggered major protests at the state capitol. And in Louisville, Kentucky, an employee opened fire during a staff meeting on Monday before the bank opened to the public, killing at least five people. A law enforcement source says the 25-year-old gunman had been told he would be fired, and live streamed the attack. Afterwards, the U.S. president issued a statement on gun control, asking how many more Americans must die before Republicans in Congress will act to protect our communities. The Louisville attack marked the 145th mass shooting in the United States this year. That's according to the Gun Violence Archive. The fifth victim died hours after the incident. She has been identified as 57-year old Deanna Eckert. CNN's Omar Jimenez has further details.

Last week, of course, the Republican majority at the statehouse in Tennessee kicked out two of its members, Justin J. Pearson and Justin Jones. Justin Jones' case, he had the opportunity to go for the city council. They reappointed him and that vote was dramatic, you could see it in his face. In fact, take a look at this video, as you see just the exuberance of the crowd who was excited. They went from that moment and then marched to the state capital. On the capitol steps, he was back to getting red back in. He had his swearing-in service, right there on the steps. The crowd went crazy as he went back and definely addressed that state capitol assembly once again. REP.

They have to go through a process to get to that point.In this case, the Secretary of State had already come out and said that in his eyes Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained. So it was not unexpected. But now this means that his case is transferred to the office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. He, in the eyes of the U.S., is now essentially a political hostage, his case being handled at the highest levels of government. So that's certainly being welcomed certainly by his employer and presumably by his family and friends as well. He does there have a more immediate problem, which is that the U.S. has yet to be granted, it says, consular access to him, which means that they really have to take Russia's word for the fact that he is being treated fairly and humanely in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo prison, where he is now being held.

He likes to quote poets Yates (ph), Seamus Heaney in a lot of his remarks. And in fact, before his trip, the White House distributed quite an extensive genealogical table from the president dating all the way back to 1803.His great, great, great grandparents who left Ireland to come to the United States, and it really does form a lot of his political identity, this identity of a descendant of working-class Irish folks who came to the United States for a better life. But of course, this trip is about more than just sentiment. The president will be here in Belfast to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. That agreement came about with significant American investment, Democratic American investment in the form of President Bill Clinton and Senator George Mitchell. And that's certainly a legacy that the president, President Biden is very eager to highlight when he's here, particularly at a moment when America's role overseas is being questioned by some Republicans. This is the kind of engagement that President Biden really wants to point out, can yield very significant results that do have a real effect on people's lives. Now, the Good Friday Agreement, it is still being tested in some ways. Certainly, the specter of violence has never completely disappeared and you saw that a little bit in the marches and dairy yesterday, some of the violence you saw there. You also see a very significant police presence here in Belfast ahead of the president's arrival. Accordance of police around the president's hotel, and in fact, the threat level in Northern Ireland has recently been elevated after an assassination of a police officer. So, certainly the violence is never far from mind, but also the political solution in the Good Friday Agreement. This power sharing government here in Northern Ireland has been paralyzed due to some disputes over Brexit trade rules, and that's something that I think the president will want to get resolved as well. And certainly, he has been encouraging the two sides to come together and resolve that, but the president will only be here in Belfast for around 24 hours before he heads south to the Republic of Ireland for some of those more family style visits in the next coming days, Rosemary.",

Many thanks for that report.Well, simmering tensions in the Middle East boiling over as clashes break out between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the West Bank. The Palestinian Red Crescent says more than 200 people were injured near the town of Beita including 22 who were hit by rubber bullets. The Israel Defense Forces say they responded to a riot where rocks were thrown at soldiers, slightly injuring two. This clash happening as Israel's national security minister joined thousands of settlers Monday in a march to an abandoned Israeli outpost. The crowd called on Israel to legalize the outpost, which is on land the Palestinians say they own. So, let's go live now to Jerusalem and journalist Elliott Gotkine. So, Elliot what's the latest on this and also comments made by Prime Minister Netanyahu Monday about his decision to keep his defense minister in his post? A lot to cover there.",

      "sentences": "Plenty going on here, Rosemary. That's right. Well, the settlers and the marches who were there in Evyatar on Monday they have left. Evyatar remains an illegal outpost and the settlers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Givr will continue to push for its legalization, something that's actually the process of which has been going on for some time.Now, it wouldn't be unprecedented to legalize an illegal settler outpost. The Israeli government has already announced that it was doing so for nine such outposts in February it says, which were in response to violence from Palestinian militants against Israeli citizens. At the same time, though, it promised the Biden administration that it would not legalize any more secular outpost for the coming months. So, at some point, obviously, that somewhat ambiguous time clock will run out, and perhaps they will proceed with further legalization. But for now, that particular settlement of Evyatar remains an illegal outpost. But as you say, the other thing that we were watching very closely on Monday was a (inaudible) an unprecedented news conference from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which he did for three main reasons, I think. First of all was to show that his hands are still on the wheel. He is still in control and to reassure his supporters and also Israel's enemies, militants in the West Bank in Gaza, in Lebanon and Syria, who have been attacking Israel over the last few weeks that Israel will continue and it's still very able to defend itself, despite protests from hundreds of thousands of Israelis, including people who are saying that they won't do their military reserve duty, to show that Israel is still able to defend itself and attack when necessary. The other reason was to blame the last government, the opposition for the deteriorating security situation. That government, of course, was in power for a year. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, describing those comments from Netanyahu as un-leader-like and shameful. And the final reason, as you mentioned, Rosemary, was to officially rescind his firing of his defense minister Yoav Gallant. (BEGIN VIDEO BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translation): There have been disputes between us, even difficult disputes on certain subjects, but I have decided to leave these disputes behind us. Gallant remains in his post and we will continue to work together for the safety of the citizens of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "If this announcement is delivered as reported, it would be the most ambitious environmental regulation perhaps in American history and would have to completely reimagine the U.S. auto industry. Right now, electric vehicles make up less than 6 percent of U.S. sales. The ambition here is to get it to 66 percent in less than a decade starting with increasingly stringent pollution regulations on the 2027 model year and then ramping up to 2032.The state of California has already voted to ban the sale of new gasoline cars in 2035. Europe, Canada, the U.K. will probably match that and this might attach U.S. federal ambitions to California's usually more progressive environmental laws. [03:55:04] But this would demand an entire reimagining of auto assembly lines and charging stations and smart grids and power supplies. Right now, Tony Blinken, the State Department has forged deals recently with countries like the Congo and Zambia where cobalt is mined and needed for these new vehicles, and the amount of copper that needs to be mined to meet these goals is astronomical compared to that of human history. So, a lot of comments to happen before the EPA enacts any of these rules, probably a lot of pushbacks from industry groups as well. But it looks like the Biden administration is planting the flag to go all electric as soon as possible. Bill Weir, CNN, New York.",
