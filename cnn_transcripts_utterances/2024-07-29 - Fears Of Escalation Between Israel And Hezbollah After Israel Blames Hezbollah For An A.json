Tonight, fears of escalation along theIsrael-Lebanon border after Israel blames Hezbollah with attack killing 12 children. We are live in the region with the very latest. Then Venezuela's election results are met with skepticism as President Maduro faces calls to publish a transparent breakdown of the votes. Plus, uncertainty over pollution levels in the River Seine, canceling the Olympic triathlon training there for the second day with the very latest from Paris. Israel's Prime Minister vowing a severe response after a weekend rocket attack that killed 12 children, Benjamin Netanyahu issuing that warning during a visit to the site of the attack in the occupied Golan Heights. Israel, the U.S. and other western countries are blaming Hezbollah. Hezbollah for its part denies it is responsible for the strike that killed 12 children and injured scores more. The attack hit a football field in a largely Druze community under Israeli control. Lebanon's caretaker Foreign Minister telling CNN, he has been assured the Israeli response will be limited and will not lead to war. The U.S. and several European countries, however, are urging their citizens in Lebanon to leave the country immediately. Here's more from the Minister speaking with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, my sources tell me that we're looking at a multi-day event. We're looking at a multi-day concerted campaign by Israel to try and degrade Hezbollah's capabilities throughout Lebanon, not just in South Lebanon. The red lines that are being communicated from Washington, which is using all the pressure it has to try and avert an all-out Hezbollah- Lebanon war -- Hezbollah-Israel war that can drag in the region, is to try and keep Israel from targeting major population centers, namely Beirut, which would then force Hezbollah's hand into doing the same and targeting major cities in Israel. So, it seems from what we know and the analysis that we're looking at a multi-day military campaign that some hope will stop short of an all-out- war, or at least give Israel -- give Hezbollah the option of trying to start to bring this a notch down, so as to avert and to de-escalate.",

It would prefer to keep it as a line of defense should Israel decide to attack Iran's nuclear program.

And in fact, the exit polls from yesterday indicate that he did with, as you mentioned, 70 percent or so of the vote. The vote totals that were announced by the government's own Electoral Commission had the -- had Nicholas Maduro at just over 50 percent. In fact, 51.2 percent to be precise. And so, this is something that, again, is just on its face absurd. And so, many of the governments internationally have been prepared to say, at a minimum, well, wait a minute. This doesn't compute with what we understood was going to happen. We need to see some evidence for how the CNE or the Electoral Commission actually came to these conclusions. And so, you've had Secretary of State Tony Blinken say that in Tokyo, you've seen other government leaders. But then, you've also seen -- look, I mean, China and Cuba and Bolivia have come out to offer their strong congratulations for the re-elected Nicolas Maduro. So, this is not something where the International Community is completely unified. And in fact, that's part of the outcome that we expected as well. So, it's going to get increasingly murky. Having said that, the one thing I should add is that the longer this goes the more likely it is that you're going to have some real problems at the street level. In fact, we're already starting to see some street protests. Then the government will have to decide, do they put it down with force or not?",

This isn't the first time this has happened. This has been consistent across 25 years of Chavista (ph) governance in Venezuela. This is just the latest example. And it's probably the most blatant example because, yes, for the first time in memory, or at least in several years, the Venezuelan people had a true hope that this time could be different, that this time you could vote for meaningful change that would bring in a new democratically elected government. The Nicolas Maduro has said, no, that's not going to happen. And so, he's taken away that hope and in one fell swoop, that leads to frustration, that leads to people saying, well, wait a minute, I've got a choice. And those who will decide to fight will have to decide, and I'm not talking with arms or anything like that, in fact, they don't have arms, the government is the ones with the weapons, but will they go to the streets, will they protest, or will they choose to flee? And I think what we're going to see now is the potential for yet another wave of migration coming out Venezuela. The country has already left -- lost a quarter of its population, some 8 million people, many of those people heading to the United States and elsewhere.
