Secretary Austin also noting yesterday that, quote, right now, the conditions are not favorable to any kind of operation. Let's bring in Ben Wedeman. Ben, good morning to you.

On the one hand, he has said that the Rafah operation is going to go ahead with or without a deal.The problem with that is if a deal is reached, an essential part of a deal for the release of hostages is a pause in the fighting. Obviously, a Rafah operation which would be a major military operation can't happen under those circumstances. Now, as we heard, the United States has real profound reservations about any such operation in Rafah and they've made it very clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu and other members of his government that the United States believes that A -- there needs to be a humanitarian planning in place of four people if they have to be moved to provide for them elsewhere, shelter sanitation, food, some sort of basic health care. And we've heard Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, saying that no plan is in place as far as the United States is concerned. The United States has also made it clear that they don't believe a major military operation is the kind of thing that Israel should be doing in Rafah. They are suggesting much more targeted military operations to avoid civilian casualties, major civilian casualties. But at this point, if we go by the record of the last 210 days of that war, one thing the Israelis clearly do not excel out is avoiding civilian casualties.",

So there are people from all over China who have gathered here around the space center on the beaches of Hainan Island to watch this lift off in about 13 minutes or so from now. As you mentioned, its immediate priority is to collect some moon samples from the far side of the moon, but there is also this bigger goal of putting a human back on the moon sometime in the next decade by China, as well as creating some kind of lunar study station. But case as you know, this is not just about science, politics, and national pride certainly intervene. The Chinese government maintains that their view towards space, toward the moon is peaceful, but as we have heard in recent weeks, NASA officials, including the administrator of NASA, Bill Nelson, there has been concern that China perhaps is going to use its civilian program for military reasons, even suggesting a takeover of the moon. But nonetheless, all of that aside, there is a lot of excitement always seen as space launch is exciting, and that is the anticipation and the thrill that people here in China all over the nation are looking forward to in the minutes ahead, Kasie.",

But this part of the moon, the dark side of the moon, it just does not get a lot of exposure. I mean, that's why it's called that, it is just full of so much intrigue.
