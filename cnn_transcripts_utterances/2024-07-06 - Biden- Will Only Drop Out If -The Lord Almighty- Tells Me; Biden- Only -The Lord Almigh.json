And what neoliberals in my party did was gaslight progressives, and made it seem as though we were trying to be cheerleaders for Trump, when all we were trying to do is to make sure that this party upholds its Democratic values.And part of that, Victor, is to have a robust primary process, we wouldn't be here, but for those people, so they made the mess, and they need to clean it up.

But I'm speaking tactically here, the person who can take on the money that has been raised, the person -- position is the current Vice President.If they think they're going to skip over her, we know that race and gender is still, unfortunately, a component in the fabric of America. You can't just skip over her like that. And I would say that if the Vice President was of another ethnicity and gender, given that we only have four months, she is the best position. So there's no need to jump to a Buttigieg or Gavin Newsom, or anybody else who they might try to pull up. But if for sure they want to have a vote, then they can do that. But if it is the Vice President, we know goodwill that those delegates are going to go to the Vice President, so I'm not for sure and tell us any more, Victor, this is serious business. I am ashamed of my party for putting us in this position. If we firmly believe that Donald J. Trump is the biggest threat to democracy, which is he is a neo fascist, then Victor, why would my party play games like this? They're playing games.
