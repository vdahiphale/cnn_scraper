So that week in between is sort of the interesting time. Did he know at the time he was discharged from the hospital and then announced it a week later? If not, that might mean that some results of tests came back during that week. So you do a prostate operation, they may have collected some tissue, they examined that under the microscope, expected it to be normal looking, but instead they found some forms of cancer. Or when you have an operation, you do a workup. You get some blood work done. You get imaging tests. Again, that is pretty routine stuff, Anderson, but in that case, maybe they found something and worked it up and subsequently found that it was this other form of cancer.

An operating theatre was set up behind me, in Buckingham Palace, and even his daughter didn't know. So she went off on a tour to Kenya and he died while she was there. And the Queen, if she was ill, Elizabeth II, we didn't know until the day that she passed away. Charles is a very different monarch and he said in his statement, he wants to open and be open about his cancer to stop speculation, but also to aid public understanding of cancer across the world and this is a disease that one in two of us kind of have a cancer diagnosis, a thousand people in the UK are diagnosed every day, it was World Cancer Day yesterday.   The influence of Royals talking about conditions like this can be very significant. But there's only so far we're going to be told and this is what the Royals have been wrestling with throughout the 20th Century ever since they let cameras in to the coronation of the Queen, how much information to give. And these days, you can't just cash it all up. There are camera phones, there are leaks, there is social media. I think eventually, the King will tell us what cancer it is he's been suffering from perhaps via the charity or an event, but I certainly think we're going to see some updates in the next few weeks thanking people for their well-wishing, but also saying this is how long we can expect to see the King away from the public eye. And I think that when the King does say what kind of cancer he's had, it will really help people and it'll help this, as you were saying, you know, people getting checked, getting early checks, because this is key to diagnosis and key to saving lives.",

So if there's a situation if the King has to have an operation and have anesthetic, the councilors of state will step in for that moment, and we do expect about four of them. He's got about four of them to do it. So Harry, theoretically would be key in that role. He would be a counselor of state and that role if he is here, and so we don't know how long he's going to stay, but I do expect him to be coming, arriving tomorrow or the day after.

Also a live report from the flooding in southern California where new flood warnings are now up and new rain is falling. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:17:53]   COOPER:   Breaking news tonight, just a day after the public got its first look at it, key Republican senators are signaling tonight that a tough new bipartisan border deal could be dead. House Republican leaders went further saying in a statement today. \"Any consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time, it is dead on arrival in the House. We encourage the US Senate to reject it.\" Now, this is the bipartisan legislation negotiated by Democrat, Chris Murphy; Independent Kyrsten Sinema, and the staunchly conservative Oklahoma Republican James Lankford, who seems to have actually delivered on this, at least according to what used to be Republican priorities as recently as a month ago. It drastically shortens the asylum process, funds more immigration courts and judges, permits the president to close the border when officers encounter more than 4,000 asylum seekers a day and mandates it when they top 5,000, or as Senator Sinema put it today: \"If our law were in effect, this border would have been closed every single day this year.\" Today, the union representing Border Patrol officers endorsed the measure saying it would \"codify into law authorities that US Border Patrol agents never had in the past.\" That's the same Border Patrol Union by the way that endorsed Donald Trump in 2020. And as we've been reporting for weeks now, this is legislation that House Republicans demanded even refusing to consider aid to Ukraine and Israel without it. And as we've also been reporting, they began opposing it once the former president came out against it, despite not having seen it and now that they have, take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

In fact, James Lankford, he is the lead Republican negotiator on this package told our colleague, Ted Barrett that he does not expect the votes to be there for the procedural vote on Wednesday. Remember, the Senate needs 60 votes in order to advance any legislation. So this is a very ominous and damning sign for the prospects for this deal, and it is also a huge blow to Republicans, like Lankford, like Mitch McConnell, who have been trying and hoping to trade border security provisions in exchange for additional Ukraine aid.

He also really emphasizes that he did not engage in insurrection within the meaning of that term. And also that Section 3 is essentially not self-executing. That there needs to be some action by Congress that would authorize states to make these adjudications of whether or not he's disqualified. Those are the three primary arguments.
