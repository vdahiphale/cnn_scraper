So what's the latest, Arlette? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Pamela, this controversy centers around some radio interviews President Biden did a little bit earlier in the week. The president on Wednesday had taped two radio interviews with Black radio show hosts set to air for the Fourth of July. And today, one of those radio hosts revealed to our colleague, Victor Blackwell that the campaign had actually provided her with a list of recommended questions before the interview from which she chose four to ask the president.

      "sentences": "Now, the campaign in a statement did not deny providing these questions to that radio show host, but they did add that the interview was not conditioned on acceptance of those questions and added that any reporter can ask the questions they see fit.Now, today the campaign is also saying that they are changing their practices going forward and that they will no longer be recommending questions ahead of interviews. One source familiar with the Biden booking operation over at the campaign said, \"While interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions as they please, moving forward, we will refrain from offering suggested questions.\" It all comes at a very interesting time as the Biden campaign has said that President Biden will engage in more off-the-cuff unscripted moments. You saw some of that play out just yesterday in that 22-minute interview he did with ABC News where President Biden was quite defiant in insisting that he will remain in this race despite the pressure from within his own party for him to step aside at this moment. The president really has doubled down on the fact that he wants to stay in this race in November, but it is unclear at this time while the campaign is expressing optimism about that interview, believing that it will help assuage some of voters' concerns, it doesn't appear that it has completely convinced all of the Democratic officials within his party. So far, there have been five House Democratic lawmakers who have called for President Biden to step down. The most recent one being Congresswoman Angie Craig from a swing district in Minnesota. She said that after watching the debate and also what she viewed as a lack of a forceful response from Biden in the days after that she no longer feels he can run a winning campaign against Donald Trump in November. But the president and his team, while the president acknowledges that these coming days are critical to the future of his candidacy, so far, they have not shown any signs of backing down from this 2024 race. This morning, the president did speak with his national co-chairs on what I am told is more than an hour long call. One of the participants told me that President Biden sought honest input and advice from that team about the best path forward in his campaign. The expectation, one of those participants told me is that they think Biden will start to do more unscripted, directly engaging type of events such as town halls or press conference to show voters that he is up for a second term. Tomorrow, President Biden will be traveling to Pennsylvania to make two stops, one speaking out at church service in the morning and then traveling on to Harrisburg for a campaign event in the afternoon. But so many questions, even as President Biden is charging ahead with his campaign, so many questions still remain about the viability of his candidacy at a time when there is increasing pressure from within his own party for him to step aside at this moment.",

The same questions that have been raised about Biden need to be raised about Trump. He skips lines, he changes subjects right in the middle of a sentence, that is also not being observed by the media. However, the focus is on the president. The president had a bad night, no doubt about it. However, the next day, he was giving a very strong stump speech using a teleprompter, part of the time, also speaking adlib off the teleprompter and he followed that up yesterday in Minnesota and his interview, I thought was okay. He does not do a strong interview. He is always soft-spoken under spoken, if you would, when he does an interview, but he hit the subjects. I would refer you back to that debate. Trump did not answer one question, not one question. Biden did answer questions, some of them not well.

He knows what the situation is. He understands the risk to this nation if Trump gets elected. He has been very, very clear about that. As of now, it is clear in his mind and in mine that he can carry on and should carry on because he has been an extraordinary president in the first three-and-a-half years of his tenure, putting together a national industrial policy to rebuild the American economy, to rebuild our infrastructure, to address the issues of climate change -- all of those things he did.
