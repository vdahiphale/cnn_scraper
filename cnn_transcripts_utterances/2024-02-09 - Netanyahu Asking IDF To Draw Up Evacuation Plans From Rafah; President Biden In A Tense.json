An Israeli military operation in Gaza's southernmost city looks imminent, as I speak. The Israeli Prime Minister has just asked his military to draw up evacuation plans for the population of Rafah. Benjamin Netanyahu calls the city Hamas' last bastion. Aid groups and others have been sounding the alarm for weeks, saying that any Israeli ground incursion there could turn into a zone of bloodshed and destruction. This is what Rafah looks like right now, with no escape for people who are sheltering there. More than a million Palestinians have been crammed into overcrowded shelters. They're also living in tents. Displaced Palestinians have been fleeing to the city close to Egypt's border for weeks to escape the fighting elsewhere in Gaza. This, coming as the U.S. President has made one of his sharpest rebukes about Israel's military campaign in Gaza at a news conference on Thursday. Take a listen to what President Biden had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza -- in the Gaza Strip has been over the top. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nic joins us live now. So, let's just talk about first and foremost, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asking the IDF to draw up evacuation plans from Rafah.

An elderly man with a poor memory. What do we make of the Special Counsel, including that language in this report? Especially as M.J. just pointed out, there were no charges brought at the end. MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  There were no charges, but he did find a willful mishandling of classified information, which is a little different than the way the President himself characterized it in defending himself. But look, you know, as M.J. said, the President and his allies feel very aggrieved by this report. They feel it was gratuitous. They don't think it was justified. They see it as something of a partisan attack. But I don't think that the Special Counsel really laid out anything that the American people haven't seen with their own eyes. And that's why this is so potentially damaging for President Biden. These concerns about his age, his acuity, his memory lapses, they are not a media creation. They're not coming from the press. They're not coming principally from the Special Counsel. They're coming from the American public, from the electorate. And you see it in polls. You see it in focus groups.

This government, everyoneknows, is helping gangs, killing innocent people, kidnapping, and serving imperialism interests. SIDNER (voice-over):  The current Haitian government denies these allegations. Philippe brings a complicated history with him. In Haiti, the self-proclaimed former police chief rose to prominence after leading a coup that resulted in the ousting of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004, followed by an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2007. He was only recently repatriated to Haiti after serving six years in a U.S. federal prison after taking a plea deal, admitting to taking bribes from drug smugglers. Today, Philippe's words still galvanize a public frustrated by unabated gang violence, corruption and economic despair. For more than a decade, Haiti has suffered through an unrelenting wave of humanitarian crises. A catastrophic earthquake, where more than 200,000 people were believed killed, brought the island nation to its knees in 2010. Soon after, Haiti's misery only compounded as U.N. peacekeepers meant to bring stability, transmitted cholera, leading to a large-scale outbreak that killed more than 10,000 people. In the following years, Haiti was continually rocked by political instability. The situation finally reaching a fever pitch with the assassination of President Moise in 2021. Several people have been arrested and are in custody for their alleged roles in the murder. Warring gangs asserted their control over much of Port-au-Prince, disrupting the supply chain of basic necessities and displacing scores of civilians. Kidnappings and shootouts on the streets have become routine hazards of life. Gang violence has even stretched into the rural reaches of the island, the U.N. says. In 2023, the U.N. documented over 8400 direct victims of gang violence, up 122 percent from 2022. MARIA ISABEL SALVADOR, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HAITI:  I cannot overstress the severity of the situation in Haiti where multiple protracted crises have reached a critical point. SIDNER (voice-over):  The gangs operate with impunity as political deadlock renders the government toothless and the National Police Force struggles for control. JEAN VICTOR GENEUS, HAITIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (through translator):  The Haitian people can't take it anymore. I hope that this is the last time I speak before you, before the deployment of a multi-national security support force. The Haitian people has had enough of the armed gangs' savagery. SIDNER (voice-over):  But international efforts to restore security have also faltered. For now, demonstrations led by Philippe continue to gain traction. The protests fueled by despair over the state of their lives in a state barely able to function. Sara Sidner, CNN, New York.",

I want to take a moment now to look at our Earth, our climate, and a series ofstories this week that may have slipped under your radar but really shouldn't have. For the first time ever, we have breached the critical 1.5 degree increase in global temperatures over a 12-month period. Scientists have long feared what could happen if the Earth's warming surpassed that threshold over the longer term and what that would mean for us seeing more extreme and much more dangerous weather. Also, this week, scientists in England held their most successful nuclear fusion test. The experiment produced enough energy to power 12,000 households for just five seconds. That's a record for this type of power generation, and it brings us closer to a clean, limitless energy source. And, also noted climate scientist Michael Mann is celebrating a really important court verdict, as well. A jury awarded Mann more than a million dollar after he was defamed by a pair of climate change skeptics, one of whom was a journalist for a conservative magazine. Mann's lawyer said, \"Today's verdict vindicates Mike Mann's good name and reputation. It also is a big victory for truth and scientists everywhere who dedicate their lives to answering vital scientific questions impacting human health and the planet.\" To give you a little bit more about each of these stories I've just outlined there, we're joined now by CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. Bill, I want to start with this court verdict with Michael Mann. A, we can talk about what sort of precedent this sets, but B, I really want you to sort of explain to the audience just how critical and important Michael Mann's work is, especially when it comes to the hockey stick graph.

Then you have the El Nino contribution, the natural cycle. But a lot of the things that science is showing us now, even some drought in the Amazon wouldn't have happened even with El Nino. So, a lot of this forcing is a result of all that fossil fuel pollution right now. And if we stay in this territory, obviously that's really concerning. There's hope that as El Nino fades, switches over to La Nina, that it could come down a bit.

But this is an exciting breakthrough. It's a different machine in the United States. At Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, they've had several successful emissions they're called when they create basically they mimic the power of the sun, of the stars in a contained environment. It's hugely exciting, but a lot of folks I talk to in the space is, let's not confuse, get too excited over the new when we have the now.
