So, for the Justice Department, they have to -- I think they're moving very cautiously.

A look at the South Carolina state house floor right now live, where representatives are currently debating a bill that would ban abortion after six weeks. The Democratic representatives have filed 1,000 amendments in an attempt to delay the vote and a long shot attempt to possibly block the bill.Joining us now is Republican U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Congresswoman, thanks for joining us. So, this abortion bill being debated in your home state of South Carolina would ban abortion, essentially, after six weeks, with some exceptions after 12 weeks. What's your take on this legislation? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  Well, my understanding is this bill will pass the state house this week. They've gotten through just over half of those 1,000 amendments, and will make it to the governor's desk to be signed into law. I have grave concerns, as a rape victim, about the reporting requirements for rape victims within this legislation. One of the things that we have to do is show compassion to women who've been raped and girls who are victims of incest. And requiring reporting of their rapes to law enforcement doesn't do that. I can't imagine the horror a woman who's been raped would have to go through to relive that rape, relive that trauma, if it's reported to sheriffs or to other law enforcement agencies inside the state of South Carolina. The other thing that the bill does, it goes -- it's a six-week bill, the exceptions only go up to 12 weeks for rape and incest. I believe that those requirements should be further along to 15 weeks, or 20 weeks. We want to make sure that victims have enough time to process what they've been through. And see what -- and do what they feel needs to happen throughout their case and throughout the trauma that they've just experienced.",

When I dropped out of school, I was suicidal for months afterwards. It was a horrific experience. And we see a lot of stories about rape and rape victims, and whenever they come into the media, once those reports are made public, those women are dragged through the mud. The reputations tarnished forever. And so, reporting -- reporting it to police is the last thing many women want to do. And when you look at the ability to collect evidence, usually, there's not enough time to. There hardly ever any convictions for rape. We have over 100,000 rape kits on the shelves across states nationwide today that aren't in quotas, that have been processed. Those victims won't see their day in court anytime soon.",

That's really not going to fly with most people whether they're men or women. I saw this in our own district in a very purple district last year. I saw how the issues suede voters, it was the number to issue in a race. I ran -- I even ran TV ads talking about rape, I was probably the only recover Republican in the country who is willing to have that very uncomfortable conversation, because I wanted women to know, I was going to fight for them regardless of their circumstances, especially for the worse that is happening to those women, those children who are victims of incest.",
