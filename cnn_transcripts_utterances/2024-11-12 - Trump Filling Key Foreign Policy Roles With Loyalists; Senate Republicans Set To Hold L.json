Rubio is expected to be like Trump very pro-Israel; like Trump, very anti-Iran. Very similar to Trump on Ukraine, not believing that the financial support that Ukraine currently gets should continue in this fashion. He is on record not as long ago as saying, look, it is very clear that the war in Ukraine is going to have to end through, you know, a negotiation. I think everyone understands that. But it is the terms of the negotiation. Mike Waltz who is expected to be President-elect Donald Trump's pick for National Security, is also someone who takes a tough line you know, former Green Beret ranger.",

It forced the Biden administration to scramble to contain the diplomatic and military fallout. Let's turn to our top story, Donald Trump is reportedly going to ask Senator Rubio to be his Secretary of State. If it happens, Ukraine will be one of Rubio's top priorities. The critics are worried that the Trump victory could encourage Moscow to pursue its goals with Ukraine with more force. CNN's Fred Pleitgen on the Russian reaction to Donald Trump's win.
