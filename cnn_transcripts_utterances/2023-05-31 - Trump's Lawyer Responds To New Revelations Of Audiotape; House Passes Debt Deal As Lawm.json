We are watching Capitol Hill, where the House is set to vote, on the bipartisan deal, to raise the debt ceiling, and cut spending, so that the nation averts a default, next week. President Biden and Speaker McCarthy are defending the agreement, as some in their parties are also railing against it. So, we'll bring you the results of that vote, as soon as it happens. But first, to a CNN Exclusive, tonight, reporting, that federal prosecutors have Donald Trump, on tape, in his own words, acknowledging that he took a sensitive national security document with him, when he left the White House. That is what multiple sources tell CNN. And I'll speak with one of the former President's attorneys in just a moment. But we are told that Trump's comments, in the 2021 recording suggests that he knew that he kept classified material, and wanted to share it, but understood his limitations, post-presidency. In other words, he knew that this was likely false, when he said it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It did not take place at Mar-a- Lago, as well, where the other classified documents were found. But instead, they were at Trump's golf club, in Bedminster, New Jersey. Let me first bring in one of the journalists, who broke this story, CNN's Kaitlan Collins. So Kaitlan, a huge scoop here. What does this all tell us, about what Donald Trump knew, about the status, the classification status, of these documents? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's really a significant reporting, from our team. And it was a team effort on this. And I think the biggest take-away from it, and likely the biggest concern, for Trump's legal team, and Trump's allies, is the fact that it shows that he understood that he had retained classified information, long after he left office, but also had an acknowledgement that he could not declassify things, in this post- presidency period, as you have noted, that he has claimed many times, as this investigation has gone on, and as he has been asked questions about this. And that has been the main defenses that we have heard, from the former President, and his legal team, about this, which is why they've said that they don't believe he's facing any legal trouble, in this investigation. Now, it seems that that has changed potentially here, because we do have sources, telling us that they believe this is an important piece of evidence that Jack Smith's team now has in their hands. And the way this all got started was at a meeting in the summer of 2021. Trump is at Bedminster, so not Mar-a-Lago, where the raid happened, where the search warrant was executed, for those documents. But he's angry about the story that had been built published in \"The New Yorker,\" talking about General Milley's concerns that Trump may take military action, in his waning days of his presidency, as he was disputing the results of the election. Trump's angry about that. And what he's indicating to the people that he's speaking to, in this recorded audio, is that he has information that could undermine what Milley is saying, indicating that it is classified information, and says something on the tape, to the effect of \"If I could show you this, it would undermine these arguments,\" but making clear he doesn't believe he can show it to them. And I think that's a key part of the story.",
