Three U.S. soldiers were killed, dozens more were injured. U.S. officials blame Iran-backed militants, though Iran denies any involvement. Meantime, the most powerful Iran-backed militia in Iraq, Kataib Hezbollah, released this statement following the drone attack, saying, quote, \"we are announcing the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces, meaning U.S. troops, in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government.\" Well, journalist Elliott Gotkine is following developments and joins me now from London.

As your report indicated, days are going on since that attack and at some point, the U.S. does need to act.The question is how they act in a way that essentially degrades the abilities of Iranian-sponsored to attack the U.S. in the future, and at the same time sends the message to Iran to basically stop all future attacks. And in particular, I think the conduit for that message has to be the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. I don't think you're going to see attacks on Iranian soil. I think the president has made that quite clear. But the risk is that the U.S. will do these attacks. There might be a bit more intense or widespread than previous attacks. But if the Iranian-backed militias then launch more attacks, potentially injuring more US service people, then President Biden is under immense pressure to do something far more destructive and widespread.

You've got Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, both who have strong voices in this cabinet. And should they determine that there is a deal on the table and Mr. Netanyahu is conflating the best interests of his country with his own political interests and survival, they have capacity. They have the power not just to influence him, but perhaps even to leave the coalition. And you also have to factor in growing public pressure.

But because of GOP divisions, now it is entirely possible that this whole thing could collapse. That has caused concern within the ranks, particularly among supporters, Republican supporters of this bipartisan deal. One of them, Senator Kevin Kramer of North Dakota, strongly criticized the House Republicans and Donald Trump, especially since this deal has not yet been released yet.
