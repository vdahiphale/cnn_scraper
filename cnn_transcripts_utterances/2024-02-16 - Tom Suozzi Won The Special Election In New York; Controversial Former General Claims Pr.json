One of them Indonesia, it`s the third largest democracy in the world with more than 270 million people. It appears that 72-year-old Prabowo Subianto won the Southeast Asian country`s presidential elections with unofficial results, showing him winning nearly 60% of the vote. Subianto who`s eight former military general has a controversial pass. At one point, he was banned from entering the United States. Our international correspondent, Anna Coren provides more insight on who this new leader is and what it may mean for Indonesia and beyond? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He ran for president in 2014 and 2019, but lost both times to Joko Widodo and then falsely claimed the election had been stolen. The 72-year-old will be Indonesia`s next president. The quick count, a reliable pollster shows he won almost 60% of the vote, which means there will be no runoff. And as the votes were being counted, he addressed the media while doing laps in his indoor swing. Well, official results from the Electoral Commission won`t be revealed until next month. When he greeted supporters last night at a Jakarta sports stadium may as well have been a victory celebration. He received a rock star welcome where he said, this was a victory for all Indonesians. Take a listen. PRABOWO SUBIANTO, INDONESIA`S PRESUMED NEW PRESIDENT (through translator):  This victory must be the victory of the people of Indonesia. Prabowo, Gibran and all of the Indonesia forward coalition will embrace all elements and powers and become the president, vice president and government present for all the people of Indonesia.",

      "sentences": "But claims of vote rigging and massive fraud have been made from the other presidential candidates who`ve vowed to investigate. And therehave been a number of small protests staged in Jakarta today. Prabowo has an alarming history, a former general under the Suharto dictatorship. He`s been accused of human rights abuses, kidnapping, pro- democracy activists in the 1990s and ordering the massacre of independence fighters in East Timor in the 1980s, accusations he denies. At one point, he was banned from entering the United States and Australia. But Prabowo has had a dramatic image makeover. Thanks in part to a slick social media campaign, perhaps most importantly has been the endorsement by President Jokowi. He`s still wildly popular and credited for the country`s solid economic growth, but he`s reached his two-term limit and cannot run again. But his elder son, 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming Raka is Prabowo`s running. Now, it`s important to note that half of Indonesia`s voters are under the age of 40. Many weren`t born or too young to remember Prabowo`s alleged human rights abuses. And of course the narrative has been rewritten. Prabowo is now a statesman, cuddly grandfather. He loves to dance on stage and who`s campaigned as a continuity candidate. But critics are very concerned about what this means for the world`s third largest democracy. And if Prabowo, who has previously said that Indonesia needs an authoritarian leader under his reign, the country will slide back to its authoritarian past. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
