Norway, Spain, and Ireland will recognize a Palestinian State. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the move rewards terrorists. Passengers aboard the Singapore Airlines flight that hit severe turbulence describe the terrifying moments that left one person dead. And when seeing is no longer believing, the A.I. generated deepfakes peddling products and propaganda in China. All that and much more, coming up. But first, Israel is recalling its ambassadors from Spain, Norway, and Ireland after those countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian State. Only a few European nations recognize Palestinian statehood. And though most of the world already does, a source tells CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps. The recognition is largely symbolic, but it carries political weight. My colleague Richard Quest spoke with the Irish foreign minister earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israeli foreign ministry today recalling its ambassadors to those three countries. And then the ambassadors from those three countries here in Israel were brought in for a formal reprimand, wondering which the Israeli foreign minister said he would make them watch the video of women being kidnapped on October 7th. The Israeli prime minister, for his part, has said that this decision to recognize a Palestinian State is tantamount to offering a \"reward for terror.\" He also said that he believes that the establishment of a Palestinian State would be a terror state, one that would attempt to perpetrate the October 7th attack over and over again. That is obviously a notion that these three countries firmly reject. And it further amplifies the -- what is kind of the basis in some ways for this decision, which is the fact that the current Israeli government led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu absolutely rejects the establishment of a Palestinian State. Rejects it a two-state solution for the time being. And that is obviously at odds as well with what the United States has been trying to accomplish in what they hope will be the day after the war -- the current war in Gaza. They hope that that can lead to the establishment of a Palestinian State, to a pathway to a two-state solution. Now, in terms of how the Israeli government plans to formally react to this decision by these three countries, we've heard the Israeli foreign ministers say that there will be serious consequences. And earlier today, Israel's finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of Netanyahu's governing coalition, saying that he will seek the approval of tens of thousands of housing units and settlements in the occupied West Bank. He will also seek the approval of new settlements in the West Bank. And he is also seeking to withhold Palestinian tax revenues collected by the Israeli government meant for the Palestinian Authority, which is already severely cash strapped, and that could certainly have a very serious consequence.

That's out of a flight that had 211 passengers and around 18 crews. So, nearly a third of all people on that plane needed hospital treatment to give you a sense of that.

Well, we want to go straight to CNN's Kylie Atwood, who joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Kylie, from D.C. So, this was Nikki Haley's first public appearance in two months since dropping out of the presidential race. She's thrown her support behind Trump, but what else did she have to say? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, listen, as you said, this is the first time that she has explicitly said that she's going to vote for Trump in November. And she made the case quite clear, in her perspective, he is simply the better option when compared to President Biden. She is a conservative. She has been a Republican her entire career. So, in some ways, this is not altogether surprising. But, Lynda, you also have to consider, of course, the recent backdrop here that it got incredibly heated during the campaign. She, at one point, said she believed that Trump wasn't qualified to be president. She said that military families couldn't trust him not to put their loved ones into harm's way. It just -- it got really heated during the campaign. And when she ended the campaign, she did not endorse Former President Trump. Instead, she said that the onus would be on him to win over her voters, in her words, during that dropout speech saying he need to earn their support. And she reiterated that point today, which is significant, saying that Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of voters who have voted for her and continue to support me. And that's a key line there because she's making the case that not only are these people who have support her in the past, she believes that these are people who still support her to this day. So, we'll have to watch and see how this plays out, how the former president is going to receive this news that she says she's going to vote for him. If they're going to have a conversation, if she decides to do any campaigning on his behalf, those are questions that are yet to be answered.",

Making it quite clear that she's not really angling for a job in a second potential Trump administration. Now, things change, conversations change. Today, will certainly change the tone of the conversation around Nikki Haley. We know that it has been quite coarse between the two of them. So, we'll just have to watch and see how it plays out.

Cisco Systems was the NVIDIA of that time, and they produced the networking gear that made the internet possible to some degree. And their revenues went up about 15.5 times from about 400 million to 6.7 billion over that five-year period of time and the stock went up 4,000 percent. If you look at NVIDIA, their revenues are up about a little over four times, and the stock's up a little over 500 percent.

The internet advertising model didn't exist. So, you didn't know how to make money off of it. These big companies today that are spending on A.I., they already are highly profitable.

This was an EF3 and it just decimated this town. It ripped right through the center of what is a pretty small town, Lynda. It is 2,000 people in a less than a two-square mile area. And as you can see from the video, the destruction is just so vast. We went out to a couple of places around town. And at one point, I was actually standing on a slab of concrete and I looked over and I saw that there had been a house there. And what I realized was that I was standing where a garage had been, but it -- when you're out in these scenes, and there's so much destruction, it takes a few minutes to understand what you're looking at because the destruction is just so enormous. And then back to that hospital. There's an anecdote I think is important to share. That hospital was so hard hit that parts of it became inoperable. And so, what they did was they took patients out of the hospital and they triage them in the hospital basically a couple yards from where I was standing in the destruction. I mean, they went to a parking lot of a lumber company, and that's where they triage patients until they could get them to other places. For example, using flight to life to get patients out of Greenfield into hospitals that were in working order. That is how dire the situation is. I'm at the edge of Greenfield and the situation there is so dangerous that law enforcement has insisted and really insisted upon having police escorts to go in there because the situation is still a search and rescue mission. There is destruction everywhere. It is a dangerous and volatile situation because you just don't know how stable buildings are. So, let me give you a look over my shoulder. And you can see even from -- I'm about a mile away, even from about a mile away, Lynda, you can see what looks just like a massive heap. That was the town. That was Greenfield.
