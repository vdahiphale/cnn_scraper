And joining us, someone I don't well -- know well, yet to give a pet name, retired NYPD Detective Marq Claxton. Detective, thanks so much for being here with us. Thanks to all of you. Detective, I do want to start with you about the new information that we have about the Americans who were kidnapped in Mexico, because it turns out that one of them in the car was live streaming part of their road trip into Mexico. And so they crossed over the bridge from Brownsville into Matamoros, and let me play you a little portion of what they were seeing and saying. Basically, he is just -- he's taping what their seeing. He's saying, you all don't know what it's like in Mexico, to his friends or whoever's watching that livestream, and then what happens is that's at 9:18 in the morning because there's a timestamp in all of that and CNN has been able to geolocate that. That's at 9:18 A.M. Then there is a two-hour break in the time period when it looks like authorities don't know what was happening with them except that they were not going in the right direction of the doctor's office. And then we pick up again at 11:12 A.M. That's when a gray Volkswagen begins following their van and then half an hour later they are surrounded by the cartel.

One kilo can produce approximately 500,000 fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $1.5 million.In total, this seizure will undoubtedly save lives as it disrupted the distribution of around 3 million fentanyl-laced pills with a total street value of $9 million. Just incredible the amount of a routine traffic stop, L.Z. L.Z. GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  I mean, yes, but the good thing is that it was stopped.
