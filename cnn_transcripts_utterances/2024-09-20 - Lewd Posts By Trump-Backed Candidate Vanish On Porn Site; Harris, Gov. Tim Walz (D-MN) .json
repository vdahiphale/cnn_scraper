(END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. The list of shady characters in Donald Trump's entourage, it's getting a lot longer. And the question tonight is, will those characters ultimately cost him the election? Or, if he wins, would they show up in a season of the real West Wing? The latest is the Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina, Mark Robinson. The campaign is now grappling with the impact of Robinson's black Nazi porn scandal, which could hurt Trump in a key swing state. Those graphic posts suddenly have vanished from the Nude Africa porn site. Yes, those are real words I just said. Robinson hasn't yet been invited to Trump's North Carolina rally that's scheduled for tomorrow, but he is hardly the only character with recent guest appearances on the Trump show. There's 9/11 conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, ex-con Kwame Kilpatrick, the scandal-ridden Trump whisperer Cory Lewandowski, and the conspiracist- in-chief RFK Jr. Joining us in our fifth seat is Kierna Mayo, cultural commentator and executive editor of One World. This is, crazy that I have to say black Nazi, nude, porn scandal on T.V., but that's real life, like this is where we're at. And Trump, first of all, he attracts these people around him, but then never seems willing to say, get away from me, I don't want to be associated with you.",

I just think about the servant leaders, the fact that Donald Trump compared him to Martin Luther King, I mean, it's just so insensitive. It's really beyond words in many respects because it -- and I want us to feel that energy. I want us to feel what I feel because I think average Americans are encountering this person as an anomaly. He is not like us, right? He just isn't. And I don't want to pretend for a minute and give him space and the ways in which Donald Trump, again, the entire collective of misfits, because here we are with actual misfits, is threatening to our entire future, to my children's future, to their children's future.

I mean, yes, we're sitting here talking about it, right? It's been effective. Like I saw it before I got to CNN, right? It's spreading around. People are looking at it. People are talking about it. And that's the sort of thing where when you are looking at the Democratic ticket, which in 2020 had Joe Biden, who was specifically meant to target Rust Belt white guys who the Democrats freaked out about having lost in 2016, they lose that when Biden steps aside and then they gain it with Tim Walz. So, get Tim Walz back out there. He's from Minnesota. He can speak that language.

DAVISON: I think it shows us that Tim Walz can fix a car, but they've given us nothing about fixing the economy, and that's really what a lot of these Rust Belt white voters want to see. They want to know what -- they are hurting, their bills have gone skyrocketing, their energy bills have gone up. Kamala and Walz have given zero -- you know, Harris was asked again last night, what's your plan for the economy? I don't really know what the answer was. Can anyone here tell me what her response was for how we fix the economy? They can't articulate it. So, it's great. He's fixing cars.
