We'll have details on the foil terror plot and what Austrian officials say about the suspects. Back in the U.S., Kamala Harris and her vice presidential pick rally crowds in battleground states, while Team Trump tries to slow the Democratic momentum with what critics say is a trolling J.D. Vance. And despite ongoing efforts to achieve a cease fire in Gaza, Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, are said to be inching closer to a potential strike on Israel. The Taylor Swift, fans in Austria are heartbroken after her Vienna concerts had to be canceled over a suspected terrorist plot. Police say they have foiled the planned attack which had targeted a stadium where the pop star was set to perform. Starting tonight, all three of the singer's Vienna shows had to be canceled. Austrian officials say they have questioned three suspects, all of them teenagers. They also say they found chemicals at the home of one suspect. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is standing by in London. But first, let's -- let's get to Salma Abdelaziz in Vienna, with more on what's happening there and the investigation. So how was the suspected plot uncovered?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean let's dig a bit more into exactly what investigators are now saying happened with this plot in Austria. Strikingly, the three people detained are all teenagers, a 19-year-old who quit his job recently and changed his appearance, saying he was planning something big, according to investigators, an Austrian citizen who appears to have a North Macedonian heritage.At the same time, there was a 17-year-old who said he recently broke up with his girlfriend, Salma, referring to how he had a job at the stadium there. He was in contact, it seems, over the internet, planning part of this in encrypted messaging rooms say Austrian authorities that they weren't necessarily able to access themselves. And a third individual, a 15-year-old boy, also an Austrian citizen with perhaps Turkish or Croatian background here. I point this out because the issue often of heritage and immigration plays significantly into discussions of extremism in certain parts of the body politic here in Europe. But they were communicating. It's unclear if the 15-year-old was part of the plot. But it's the details of what they were planning and what they had at their disposal that's particularly shocking. The 19-year-old lived, it seems, about an hour's drive south of the venues. His home searched, chemical precursors found there, likely for explosives. And authorities saying he likely meant to bring the devices to the periphery around the concert, detonate them amongst the crowds. Remember, it's not just the 65,000 in this case, who would be at the capacity venue is the tens of thousands who often try and go for a free concert outside overhearing the event. You could potentially have detonated that device in those crowds. And chillingly, too, he had, it seems, 21,000 in counterfeit currency, knives and authorities say, intended to be a suicide bomber, possibly one, maybe two here. He also had a police blue flashing light in his possession, which they think may have been used to facilitate the ingress or egress of his car before or after likely access to the area, I would have thought, if indeed he intended to end his life, as well as those of his potential victims too. So startling details here of how advanced this plot indeed was. And the suggestion too, that others may have been aware. Now, police say they're not looking for anybody else in the investigation inside of Austria. So it would seem that these three teen -- teenagers are kind of it. But that would possibly point towards others being aware, and that might be what we've heard, I've heard many European intelligence officials warning about that the -- the notion of the directed attack, what we used to recall from al-Qaeda 20 years ago or so, is back, and that's essentially recruiters planners telling people to do things in Western countries. That's potentially the fear here, because the extraordinary complexity and resources that these 19, 17, and potentially 15-year-olds had at their disposal quite, quite shocking. Fredricka?",

So this campaign is looking to keep the sugar high going by keeping, essentially injecting sugar into the system as much as they can, getting people talking about things and -- and -- and talking about her and -- and the campaign in a positive way that had not been the case before she jumped into the race. And of course, the -- the -- the lock her up or lock him up part is something that the campaign is trying to move away from, because that gets them away from the things that they want to be talking about, and the energy, the sort of more positive, joyful energy that they are trying to project here from this campaign.",

But this is not the way that Joe Biden was being received on the trail, I can tell you all through the year, even long before the debate.

But it could be a number of things that they could stand to gain from this. One of course, is that we've seen Russia open a new front in the north in recent months, in the Kharkiv region, just a few hundred kilometers to the southeast of where we see the action happening.Now, it may be that Ukraine is trying to get ahead of another attempt like that, trying to do use attack, essentially, as a means of defense. They may also be trying to distract Russian forces who have been inching forward on the Eastern Front, to pull resources away from that. I -- I think you know that is potentially a risk for Ukraine, because it moves their own forces, which are, we know, in short supply, away from that eastern front as well. Could this also be a territorial play by Ukraine, there has been some speculation that they may want to actually capture and hold on to territory inside of Russia to use that as leverage in potential future negotiations. That really would be a new chapter in this conflict if they were trying to do that. Now, Russia, as you say, is claiming to have prevented Ukraine from moving forward, the Ministry of Defense saying that it has brought in new resources, reserves, missile forces, air strikes, things like that, to stop the advance. The Ministry of Defense has put out new video, which it claims shows this is it -- shows it targeting Ukrainian armored vehicles, including they -- they claim a U.S. made Bradley. We have geolocated this video to inside the Russian -- inside Russian territory in the Kursk Region, not far from the border. And so they are saying that they are in control of this. The video evidence that we have reviewed suggests that Ukrainian efforts to -- to push forward in this region are very much still ongoing.",

And the reason being that this data is better than expected, to your point, we were worried about what's going on in the jobs market. This is the first time since Friday. We've got any kind of hints about what's going on.And what we saw was less people claiming first time benefits than were as expected, it came in at 233,000 as you mentioned, that's down from 250,000 that we were expecting, there's actually a bit of an improvement as well on the number, the overall number of people that are continuing to claim benefits as well. And one of the things that stands out from this, in me is a 7,000 drop in the number of people that were asking for benefits in Texas. Why do we care about Texas? Well, that was because when the data was collected for that jobs number on Friday, Hurricane Beryl was impacting what was going on in that state. So it sort of hints that perhaps the weakness that we saw on Friday may also be tied to some of the weather related impact that we were seeing in states like Texas. So ordinarily, I would not be getting so excited about any kind of data point like this that we see on a weekly basis, but given the concerns about the jobs market, there is a lot of focus on this, and people are relieved it still, by the way, means that we've got a whole host of people that are asking for help and need unemployment benefits.

This tornado watch, which is valid for portions of North Carolina and Virginia until 1:00 p.m. eastern local time there. But you can see a lot of these rain bands continuing to push inland and northward. We've had often on tornado warnings throughout much of the day. Those could continue as we go through the afternoon hours, but the moisture too is also starting to spread into northern states like Virginia, Maryland, even starting to creep into portions of Delaware too. But again, the most widespread threat with this storm has certainly been the flooding all of these red counties you see here highlighted, those are flash flood warnings. This white one right here is a flash flood emergency. They've had up to eight inches of rain already fall in that location. And you can see pretty widespread areas of here of that six to 10 inches. But again, we're going to be adding on top of that, and so that's why you still have that potential for some of that flooding to occur, not only today, but also tomorrow, as more of that moisture spreads into the mid-Atlantic and even the northeast. Look at this, you've got that wide swath of yellow that's two to four inches. And then within that, you're going to have some areas that are embedded with five, six, even seven inches of rain. Again, for some areas, that's on top of what has already fallen. So that's why flooding is going to be a big concern. Now, the one thing to note, the piece of good news is this is really going to start to pick up in speed. So notice today, just 24 hours from now, notice that location well into the mid-Atlantic. So we're finally going to start to get a reprieve for some of those southeastern states. And then by Friday evening into Saturday, most of the moisture is even gone from much of the Northeast. You have maybe some of it lingering across maybe New Hampshire, Maine. That's about it. The bulk of it either goes out to sea or heads up into Canada.
