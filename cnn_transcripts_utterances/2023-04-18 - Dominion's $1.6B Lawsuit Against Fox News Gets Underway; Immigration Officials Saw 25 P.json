This just in to CNN, Southwest Airlines says, they're experiencing major delays due to a system outage. Yes.

We just got this from the FAA that Southwest has requested a nationwide ground stop for all of its flights, coast to coast. The FAA putting that out right now in a ground stop notice due to equipment issues, according to the FAA. We just found out about this from passengers initially and then also heard from this airline itself in a tweet saying, they were trying to restore their operation nationwide.Right now, Southwest Airlines according to FlightAware, let me check here, we've got about 800 cancelations so far nationwide, that is 20 percent of its entire schedule. And what we see with things like this is that there is typically a domino effect. Once the house of cards starts tumbling down, then it really lasts for days, in some cases. So, we will see. We are very early in the day here, the travel day, a Tuesday, which is typically good news because it's relatively low traffic, although less we forget, we're kind of in the middle of spring break right now. So, this is coming at a very bad time for a lot of travelers, jamming a very bad impact on an airline that's taken it on the chin when it comes to these equipment issues. Remember, Southwest canceled 17,000 flights over the Christmas holidays and in the New Year's because of equipment issues, and planes and crews were simply out of position all over the place. So, we are now seeing this happening once again. We'll see how big the impact here is, Sara. It is still very early right now.",

In video released by the Kremlin, Putin can be seen meeting with Russian commanders in the Kherson region. The area could be the focus of an expected Ukrainian offensive in coming months. Putin's visit came as new Russian missile attacks killed at least three Ukrainian civilians and injured several others. Ukrainian officials say that more than 100 settlements were hit with everything from artillery and mortars to cruise missiles and drones.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh live in Zaporizhzhia for us this morning.

Well, that's certainly altered and we recently -- just after he was indicted by the International Criminal Court, saw him walking around the streets of Mariupol, a Ukrainian city devastated by his country's invasion.And now, it seems on Monday he visited part of the Kherson region that's occupied by Russia. Very much, I think, it's fair to say a place which is in the line of sights of Ukraine's forthcoming counteroffensive, maybe beginning to start now or certainly expected imminently. And I think this is a bid by the Kremlin to show he is very much on the front lines, very much still invested in this fight, and perhaps trying to boost morale in that area ahead of a likely better equipped Ukrainian onslaught. It's important too to note one of the senior generals he seemed to have spent time talking to with there is somebody who was thought to have full not of favor but high ranking in the sort of elite paratrooping staff. And this may be a bid, perhaps, by the Kremlin to shore up support amongst the traditional army here who they want to try and use more on the front line after months of disarray over the winter, John.",

Now, sometimes, these are tanks that were first put into service before Vladimir Putin was even born, and he's 70. So, the T-54 models of which we saw as Ukrainian forces advanced in Kherson, they've been wheeled out.Why? Well, because at the very big start of this war, Russia massively underestimated the need for supply change, for refueling, got a lot of its best equipment stuck up front, wasn't able to refuel it. It got jammed up and significantly damaged by significant supplies too of western anti-tank missile, from the javelins being brought to the front lines there, the NLAWs as well. They took a lot of armor out, and that's continued over time. And so, Russia hit by sanctions, hit by, frankly, its own corrupted supply chains where a lot of stuff is taken rather than invested in weaponry is having to reach deep into its soviet era stocks to try and keep things going on the front line. That's a major problem for them in the months ahead, John.",
