And then other cases, they have videotape of boxes being moved, but then remarkably in that June 24th timeline, you have the attorney talks to Trump and says, you know, we're going to turn over these boxes. Trump knows that other boxes have been moved at this point. He talks to Walt Nauta and says, I'm going to Bedminster, you stay behind, and Walt then meet with the head of maintenance to look for this tunnel that leads to where the documents are hidden, and the cameras in the tunnel. And, you know, they have video of them with flashlights allegedly in the tunnel spotting the cameras. And what's the next thing that happens? They go to the head of I.T. for the Trump Mar-a-Lago resort, and they say, what does it take to delete these videotapes of the boxes being moved and us looking at the cameras and everything else? Ultimately, it takes more than they thought because the I.T. chief then sends that up to other management people in the Trump Organization to say we're not deleting anything, and that's why it was all turned over pursuant subpoenas.",

They didn't come forward with specific information under the Speedy Trial Act to push for the December date. The judge put it over to May. There's also the March trial date for the case. So May was probably the reasonable time to place the trial date, but there's a lot of give in there that really provides more than ample time to meet all of the milestones that the judge set forth in her order to make it to May.

There is little love lost between McConnell and Democrats. But the two sides, especially these two men, have a history. And they have been able to work together.How do you interpret these concerns? NAYYERA HAQ, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I'm glad to hear and say that President Biden and Senator McConnell were able to connect on a human level. They have served together for so long and been able to figure out a simple path forward, up until recent years, when political conversation has derailed quite a bit. But this also brings up, Bianna, this concern about our aging elected officials. The average age of a U.S. senator right now is 65 years old. But in a few years, the majority of the voting population will be between the ages of 18 and 45. So, there's a big disconnect between the people who are in office, running power, and those who are coming up and actually having to deal with the impacts of the policies. We saw Nancy Pelosi, as a leader, step aside, pass over the baton to a younger generation with Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. So this does raise the question of what is the plan for the future of the Republican Party in the Senate. At some point, Senator McConnell will have to have some kind of passing off the baton for the viability of the party.",

Why is Hunter Biden getting sweetheart deals, or trying to give him blanket immunity and Trump is being -- that's how the average Republican would say it. So, I would expect Kevin McCarthy to channel that feeling. But, obviously, the obstruction to me is the real differentiator on the Trump situation. HAQ:  Yeah, Bianna, this is where it gets important that Robert Bacon (ph) is the one with a Biden one district heading into the 2024 cycle. That he, as a messenger for the party that talks about law and order, it is very difficult for him to be in a position to then have to defend a potential nominee who is under multiple indictments and effectively disregards law and order.

That doesn't necessarily mean all of what they believe is true.

But until health or more than half of the party decides, okay, we can't do Trump anymore, there's not a ton you can do about it. I'm not sure there's a TV ad or a speech that you could make that would change someone's mind.What these candidates can do is put themselves in a position where they can possibly pick up the pieces if Trump were to somehow collapse among Republican voters, but right now, the polling, there is no evidence that that's happening, especially in Iowa, where he has quite a large lead. Although I will say, I think DeSantis has an organization there. I think Tim Scott has an organization there. And so, there are candidates who are waiting in the wings. If Trump were to falter -- will he, we don't know -- but if here, I do think there are numerous campaigns that are putting together an organization that could try to pick up those pieces.
