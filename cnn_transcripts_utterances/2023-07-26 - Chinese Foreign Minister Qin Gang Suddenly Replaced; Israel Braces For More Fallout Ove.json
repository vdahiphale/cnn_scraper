And Mark, just over a month ago this man was meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State. He was once one of President Xi Jinping's top aides. What happened?",

Good morning.Look, it has been about 24 hours since we were first alerted of Qin Gang's disappearance and his removal from office, I should say -- formally removed from office -- and there are still some big questions that linger, including where is he? Why was he removed from office? And then, what's next? Will he ever reemerge? Questions that the government is not very anxious to answer. However, it did make a point today during its briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the current state of the pivotal U.S.- China relationship despite Qin Gang's departure. And the government is maintaining it's business as usual, but the spokesperson saying, quote, \"Our position on U.S.-China relations has been consistent. We have always viewed and developed China-U.S. relations from the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.\" And this disappearance and departure isn't just physical; there is a virtual aspect to it. Qin Gang's references in social media has been completely scrubbed. If you look on the Chinese government website all of his references there have also disappeared -- a move that a government spokesperson said was in accord with regulation. So, Christine, the mystery very much continues.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and there's the -- excuse me -- Christine, there's also the economic fallout.And what's happening right now is earlier today this reasonableness bill came into effect. It was voted on, of course, earlier in the week and it has now come into force. And Israel's Supreme Court judges -- they are on an official visit to Germany. They have now flown back early in order to hear all these petitions against this bill. So the Supreme Court could impose some kind of injunction preventing this law from remaining in effect while it considers it more broadly. And it could ultimately strike it down. It could decline to do so. So those are some of the things in terms of the actual law. In terms of the protests, as you say, they've been going on for more than six months and they are set to continue. We expect big ones on Saturday evening. In terms of the reservists refusing to turn up for duty, we're expecting that to continue, too. The Israeli Parliament actually goes on recess -- a very long recess at the end of this week until October. And, of course, during that time there could be negotiations about the rest of its judicial overhaul. But this government is planning to continue with other parts of its judicial overhaul when they get back from this long summer recess. The other thing to watch out for is the economy. We saw yesterday -- on Tuesday, we saw Morgan Stanley downgrading its views on Israel. We saw -- we saw Moody's as well also saying that it -- that due to the unrest and due to this judicial overhaul that there could be negative ramifications for the Israeli economy and also its security situation. And the impact of that has been a very weak Israeli shekel. It's close to a three-year low against the U.S. dollar. We've also seen the impact on the Israeli stock market, which has been underperforming other markets. And we've seen the impact in terms of investment in Israel's much-fabled start-up scene. Now, investment from venture capital firms has declined globally. It declined even more in Israel and that's a big deal here, Christine because high-tech exports account for half of all Israeli exports.",

You know, after scoring that dramatic game-winning goal in his debut on Friday night, Messi's second game -- I mean, it certainly couldn't live up to the hype again, right? Wrong. I mean, Messi -- he's just incredible. Just eight minutes into this game last night, Messi -- he's going tobreak away from the Atlanta United defenders. He hits the post but then puts the rebound into the back of the net. Then, just moments later after a back-and-forth pass here with Robert Taylor, Messi's going to score his second goal of the game in the 22nd minute. That sent the sold-out crowd of more than 20,000 just into a frenzy. Messi -- he would also get an assist before leaving the game in his 78th minute to a standing ovation. The outcome would not doubt. Inter Miami won that game easily 4-nil. They now move on to the knockout round in the Leagues Cup. Their next game is going to be August second at home. All right. The U.S. Women's National Team, meanwhile -- they're going to be back on the pitch tonight for their second World Cup match. This is their toughest test in the group stage. They're going to face the Netherlands -- the team they beat in the 2019 championship game. Captain Alex Morgan says she's expecting this one to be a tough one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, though, today's pump prices are still much lower than the $5.00 records we saw last year.The jump is part of a broader rally in commodities after Russian attacks on port infrastructure in Ukraine and a refinery shutdown in the U.S., in Baton Rouge. All right, looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished the day lower here. European markets also down slightly at this hour. Paris down 1 1/2 percent. Global markets, frankly, are bracing for a rate decision from the Federal Reserve. On Wall Street, stock index futures this morning are also leaning lower. But markets cheered the latest round of strong corporate earnings yesterday. GE finishing six percent higher. It raised its profit outlook for the year. The Dow extending that 12-day winning streak -- a feat not seen since 2017. AT&amp;T, Boeing, and Meta all expected to report their earnings later today. But the big event -- the main event, the July Fed meeting. It wraps up today. No announcement made on Tuesday but we do expect one this afternoon raising rates to the highest level in 22 years. Joining us is Jeanna Smialek, Federal Reserve and economy reporter at The New York Times. And as it usually goes, it's two days of meetings and at the second day they will announce a statement, and then the Fed chief will give a press conference and talk to reporters like you about what he's seeing going forward. So what we're expecting here -- a 25 basis point rate hike. And the question is do they do another one after that?",
