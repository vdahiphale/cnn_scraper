I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Today we examine wars that the International Community is failing to contain and the man-made famines they are creating. In Haiti, aid groups say 4 million people need food desperately as armed gangs take control from the national police. In Gaza, the World Food Programme warns that mass starvation is inevitable in the north as Israel's war continues. And in Sudan, the collapse of its nascent democracy in a year of civil war have left 5 million people on the verge of catastrophic hunger. The Biden administration is trying to put out all these fires, which could end up defining its foreign policy.

Given this catastrophic situation that you have mentioned and that David Culver has very well reported on, it is our national security that is at stake here. So, we've had to reinforce our border.

And that is one of the main aspects that the U.N. resolutions, the Security Council's resolutions, in addition to the assistance of the multinational force, it was also an arms embargo, which is still the U.S. authorities are working on it, but most of the arms that are coming through Florida have flown into Haiti through ports, airports, and many Haitian ports and airports, not through Dominican ports or airports.

As U.S. and regional mediators continue negotiations for a ceasefire, the release ofremaining Israeli hostages and humanitarian relief for Gaza. We're joined now by leaders of an Israeli organization who are committed to their own local diplomacy between Israeli-Arab and Jewish citizens, trying to create a more equal society. Raghad Jaraisy and Ofer Dagan are joining me now from Jerusalem. Welcome to you both. Let me just state the obvious. Raghad, you are an Arab citizen of Israel. Ofer, you are a Jewish citizen of Israel. And we like to have these conversations across the sort of divide, if you like, the ethnic divide, to see where there can be bridges built. When you see a story like that, the real Sophie's choice that these people have to make, I wonder first, Raghad, how it affects you. RAGHAD JARAISY, CO-CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SIKKUY-AUFOQ:  Well, I think we all, people living here in Israel and Palestine, have been going through a very hard time since October 7th. And actually, since October 7 and the war in Gaza, during the whole period of the war in Gaza, we've been following very closely the public discourse, both domestically in Israel and also globally. And we've been noticing a very simple discourse where you're either with us or against us. You're either pro-Israel or pro-Palestine. And our lives, you know, the people -- the Palestinian community in Israel and people who work and believe in shared society, sometimes we think that we live in a parallel universe where our lives and our stories are much more complicated than the public discourse. We, the Palestinian citizens of Israel, for example, on the one hand live in Israel and are directly affected by the implications of the war on all the citizens of Israel. For example, if rockets are fired on Israel, we run to a shelter and we're very lucky if we can find one in our villages and townships. When the economy is affected, we also lose money and budgets and savings and sometimes lose our jobs. And we work with Jewish colleagues, we live next to Jewish neighbors, but at the same time we are Palestinians. We share with every other Palestinian in the world the language, the culture, the history, and the narrative. We wake up every day and see the testimonies about the deep humanitarian crisis in Gaza and we are deeply saddened. We are deeply saddened once for the humanitarian crisis and the other time for not being able to express our solidarity or empathy to this crisis because of the systematic policies of silencing and incitement against us from the level of the government, but also the level of the public institutions and the media. That's what we're dealing with. And that is much more complicated than the public discourse that they have going on today.",

So, one of the things that we are working on -- and Raghad mentioned the issue of personal security in public space. So, one of the things that we are working on is to create more inclusive environment, both in public spaces like public parks and also in museums and universities and in public transportation, environments that can reflect the collective identity of both people living here, both Arab and Jews, and create a feeling of home for both of them, and in that way, give them a bigger personal security and also bigger confidence in creating meaningful interactions with each other from a place of equality and feeling of belongingness -- equal belongingness to this place.",

The U.N. says as many as 5 million people there could face catastrophic food insecurity and starvation since democracy collapsed last year and again, warring factions are ruling. In this report, Correspondent Nima Elbagir finds that one of them, the Rapid Support Forces, the RSF, is forcing civilians, including children, into a deal with the devil, enlist or starve. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC PLAYING) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The heroes are everywhere in Al Jazira. NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Propaganda video from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the RSF. For much of the last year, they have slashed and burned their way through the country. This video shows them triumphant and entrenched in the very heart of Sudan, Al Jazira State. And they are recruiting local men in the hundreds. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I declare joining the RSF. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I declare joining the RSF. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I declare joining the RSF. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I declare joining the RSF. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  But it's impossible to tell who here is a willing soldier and who has been forcibly conscripted. Eyewitnesses have told CNN that RSF soldiers are giving civilians an ultimatum, enlist or starve. Our investigation shows how almost 700 men and 65 children have been forcibly recruited to swell RSF ranks. And that's just what we've been able to verify in Jazira. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  A lion cub. ELBAGIR (voice-over):  Across Sudan, reports and images like this one are emerging, children in RSF uniform. As across Sudan, millions forced from their homes by violence now face famine. CNN spoke to three dozen eyewitnesses, survivors and the families of victims. The RSF, they say, is weaponizing hunger, denying food to those who won't join. Aid groups say almost 4 million children in Sudan are already malnourished, as the country faces mass starvation. If aid agencies can't get food to those in need, almost a quarter of a million children could die. Jazira is Sudan's bread basket. It's heartland. To control this part of Sudan is to exert control over who lives and who dies. The RSF deny they are responsible for the hunger gripping the country, yet they control every aspect of farming this land. They control the warehouses of food and aid meant to support the most vulnerable. They control the seed supplies, fertilizer, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and irrigation channels. And it's not just the infrastructure. Farmers are being targeted, brutalized, degraded, and even killed. Not just to control food, but to force allegiance. You hear shots off camera as six of the men are executed according to survivors who spoke to CNN. Those who were spared say the RSF threatened to starve their families if they didn't join. The RSF sit in the heart of Sudan, hoarding food meant for millions. From here they can wait out, starve out Sudan's people and its army. Fear, uncertainty, despair, cascade as the months of war drag on and the world looks away. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if it comes up, we want to have our eyes glaze over. But it's the basis of (INAUDIBLE) our entire financial system. Insurance requires being able to predict risk. For a long time, that wasn't so hard. You look at the past, that would be a pretty good guess about the future. But climate change has upset that entire dynamic. Climate change has meant that every year, or over a course of a decade, things get noticeably worse. NOAA, which is the National Oceanic Administration, has said, look, these billion-dollar disasters, they keep happening more and more frequently. They would happen three times a year annually in the 1980s. Now, they're happening 18, 19 times a year. So, there's really been a change.",

Right now, insurance hasn't been enough todissuade people from buying in the riskiest areas. And part of the reason is that the state has stepped in and started to subsidize it. We've made it cheaper to live in those areas than it should be. And that's the case with coastal floodplains since the 1960s or '70s, really, when we created the National Flood Insurance Program. And now, what we're seeing with the states is they're beginning to do the same thing with wildfire and with hurricanes. They're saying, look, we understand it's too expensive to live there.

And that's not just property, that's your motorcycle, that's your home, that's your business. But consider this, if a category 5 hurricane was to hit Miami, they estimate it could cost 1.3 trillion in damages. That would be an assessment of roughly 60,000 per person in Florida. Now, some of that would be covered by insurance and reinsurance, but that could be a pretty stiff bill for every single person in the state.

And actually, it's a huge question for the insurance companies because in the end, they want to sellpolicies because that's how they make money. So, there are two basic tools. One is building codes, earthquake proof, wildfire proof, hurricane proof, wind proof, flood proof. For instance, in a wildfire zone, you can demand that the five feet around the house has no vegetation or anything flammable. You can demand that houses get put up on stilts. And those things do make a difference. And the two way you get there is you get through building codes and through insurance incentives. So, the insurance industry is very much pushing for hardening homes, saying they will reward people for doing those things. But the thing about insurance is they sell it to you every year.
