The threat of a government shutdown has House Republicans scrambling to find a path forward. And here's what one Republican Congressman told my colleague Brianna Keilar just a bit earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN MEUSER, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: I think the odds are that there will not be a shutdown. We will have a vote, it looks like soon as Manu was explaining on suspension, we would need two thirds on what largely was the bill from last night without the debt ceiling language or if that doesn't pass by the two thirds, we then go to rules. We have various procedures and there's a pretty good chance before midnight. We have a majority vote on another bill, CR into March, which would also include the disaster relief and economic assistance, but without some of the other things that were in the last yesterday's bill. So we have two shots at it here. Hopefully we get the first one done. I think we have a -- I think it might go by suspension. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For now, House Republicans are wanting to hold separate votes, one for that three month stopgap, one for $100 billion disaster package, another for $10 billion in aid for farmers, and then hold off on that debt limit vote.

And Johnson pulled that deal to try and put something on the floor that was more aligned with what Donald Trump wanted. So Democrats have been out of the negotiating room and table for a while since that first bipartisan deal was reneged on. So they're very frustrated that they are not involved in what discussions are being made now. But Democrats met this morning and sources tell me that Jeffries said that he is ready to reopen the lines of communication with Republicans because he feels like this new idea of separating all of these different issues is something that more Democrats can get behind. But there's still a lot of up in the air here, and it's unclear how many Democrats are behind this.

If you look at the pork that's been put into this bill at the end, a lot of health care policy, a lot of things have been done to sort of straddle President Trump's options as he comes into office. And that was intentional. And that was what it took to get some of the Democratic votes that Speaker Johnson needed. And it was a mistake. And so we're down this path primarily because we're doing the CR. We should have done an omnibus. He should have dealt with the criticism early rather than delay it.

These are senior diplomats, three of them from the U.S. State Department, meeting with someone who has until today had a $10 million bounty on his head. The group that he belongs to, HTS, is still a designated terrorist organization. But Ahmed al-Sharaa, which is how he's being referred to now, as opposed to the name -- as opposed to his jihadist name that the U.S. has been using for quite some time, did have this meeting with Barbara Leaf, Roger Carstens, who's in charge of hostage affairs, as well as Daniel Rubenstein, who is a newly named envoy for Syria. So by all accounts, this was a productive meeting. It lasted for quite some time at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It seems like they covered a lot of ground. Certainly al-Sharaa wants the Syrian economy to get up and running again, which means asking the U.S. to remove sanctions. Meanwhile, the U.S. is pushing for an inclusive representative government that will include women, minority, different sex. And that's why we're hearing Leaf talking about sort of moderate and pragmatic responses. Of course, another focus during this meeting, during this trip, Jessica, is the search for Austin Tice.

And suggested that it could be used in a sort of 21st century duel against Ukraine and its Western backers, saying that it could be test fired against that city and in a test of the capabilities of the air defenses that the U.S. and its allies have provided to Ukraine. Now, the Oreshnik was not used in Friday's strikes against the Ukrainian capital, but Ukrainians have become increasingly familiar with and of course hardened to these frequent missile attacks. And the capital has come under both missile and drone attack in recent weeks and months. But this comes at a time of escalating rhetoric and an increasing war of words between Putin and the west, with Putin basically positioning himself in the run up to a new administration coming in in Washington that has pledged on the part of President Elect Donald Trump to bring Ukraine and Russia to a peace agreement. And what we see here, both with this strike as well as with the escalating rhetoric from the Russian side, from the Kremlin leader, is an apparent effort to boost Russia's bargaining position, to make it appear stronger in the days and the weeks before Trump takes office. As well as following on a serious foreign policy setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose client in the Middle East, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was forced to flee to Russia after being ousted by Syrian rebels. So clearly what we see is not only just a very lethal display of force by Russian forces, but as well an attempt of Russia and by Russian President Putin to position himself on the world stage ahead of a possible negotiation over the war in Ukraine.

But there were a lot of things dropped that had been negotiated with the Republicans, and that was an agreement. They had all come to agreement until the bomb was thrown into this by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. So, as I say, nothing is certain until it's done. And we're not done yet.

It happened in the German city of Magdeburg. It's about two hours west of Berlin. Now, the driver of that car has reportedly been arrested. Fred Pleitgen is joining us now from Berlin.

And Fred, we're seeing what appeared to be so many people injured, laying on the ground. It is not a good scene there. And it is very interesting that you note that Germany takes security of these markets so seriously because of what happened in Berlin just a few years ago.

      "sentences": "Well, you're at risk and you're very much a soft target. And I think one of the things that we're seeing here on that video and that you -- we know from here in Germany, from being at Christmas markets quite frequently, is that very often, especially on a Friday evening, those Christmas markets, and of course it is the Friday evening before Christmas as well, that these markets are packed. They're absolutely packed. And the sort of aisles and gangways between the stalls are very, very narrow as well. So, you will have large crowds of people. And of course, those stalls, they're made of wood. They're not very sturdy. And if a car plows into that, then it is going to do a lot of damage and there really is no way for a lot of these people to try and jump out of the way and get into safety. And that's one of the reasons why the Germans had said that they'd been putting up these barriers around these Christmas markets in so many places. And I've looked at some of them in the Christmas season this year because this was such a big issue in Germany. And a lot of them are pretty high- tech with barriers that lower and come up. A lot of them electronic in some cases, also just really large pots that are put in the way to make sure that cars cannot get into there. So, this is definitely going to be someone where the authorities are going to have to explain and see what went wrong here and how it was possible that this could happen. And of course, at this point in time, we don't exactly know what was behind this. We don't know whether this was done deliberately or whether there was something else going on. We do know from the local media and the police that apparently the driver of the vehicle was arrested on the scene apparently. So, no doubt right now the police are going to wait for things to calm down, interrogate that driver, see what exactly -- what is going on, how this could happen. But then of course, the whole safety issue around Christmas markets is going to be very big in the coming days.",

We're going to make sure we take care of the disaster victims. We are not going to shut down government.

This happened in the German city of Magdeburg about two hours west of Berlin. We know the driver of the car has reportedly been arrested. I want to go now to the video that we're just getting in. This is the aftermath of this Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, about two hours west of Berlin. You see people on the ground clearly injured. At this point, we know one person has been killed. Clearly, many were injured in this car driving through a Christmas market in Germany. It's worth remembering a little bit of context here as we're looking at this new video that in 2016, a similar situation happened in Berlin where a car drove through a Christmas market there. In that case, it was ISIS and it was an act of terrorism. In this case, we currently don't know what the motivations were of this driver who has reportedly been arrested. But as you look at these videos, you can see how narrow a lot of these corridors are in between the actual little stands that are set up. And we also can tell you right now that the prime minister is on his way there to the site in Germany. Our Fred Pleitgen was reporting just a little bit ago that authorities there in Germany and the government, of course, trying to wrap their arms around the response, trying to figure out exactly what happened here, get there on scene. We know based on these videos that, of course, first responders are there helping tend to the injured. Again, reminding everyone at this point, we know one person was killed in this incident just five days before Christmas, the Friday before Christmas, as what appeared to be a very large crowd was walking through this Christmas market. And as Fred was explaining to us after that incident that I was talking about in Berlin back in 2016, more security measures were put into place at Christmas markets throughout the nation of Germany. So, this was something that they had really focused on trying to ensure that people could be safe. So, the fact that this has happened when they have put extra security measures in place is worth noting. And it is certainly a soft target with people jammed in there together, not a lot of space to get away should a car go through a market like this. So again, the top lines we are getting right now is that this happened Friday night in Magdeburg, Germany. This is about two hours west of Berlin. This car went through this Christmas market. You see the aftermath. This is video we're just getting into CNN with a number of people on the ground looking quite injured. We know at least one people were killed. We also know that local police have put in extensive police measures. We see them there on scene and that there have been extensive police measures now put up. This driver has been arrested. So, one hopes that at least they will begin to get some answers in the coming minutes and hours as to what exactly was the motivation here. But the bottom line is it was incredibly destructive and fatal for at least one person. And as we look at these images, you see that people do again appear to be quite injured after this car has driven through this Christmas market in Germany. Going back to that incident in 2016, as I mentioned, that at the time was an ISIS attack. We don't know at this point yet what was the motivation here. All we know is the destruction and the human toll that we are looking at as these images come in from this Christmas market in Germany. So, we're going to of course continue to follow this breaking news. There is more information coming out of Germany. The latest we know is that the prime minister is on his way to that location and we will continue to get updates on the injured and hoping for no more fatalities. But again, we will wait to see if that number goes out. We're going to go now to CNN domestic. Thank you for joining us. We'll continue our coverage there.",
