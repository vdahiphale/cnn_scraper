Several others are said to be wounded. The ministry claims more than 20,400 people have been killed since October 7th. It comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced intensifying operations inside Gaza.Israeli forces say, approximately 200 targets in the enclave were struck over the past day. The IDF says, its troops located a Hamas weapons compound inside what they described as a civilian structure near schools, a mosque and a clinic. Meanwhile, Jordan's military dropped supplies and aid to Gaza residents sheltering in two churches on Sunday. The country's foreign minister says more than 500 Palestinian Christians received aid via the airdrops. And as the fighting rages, Pope Francis says the message of Jesus's birth is being rejected by the war as he began Christmas celebrations at the Vatican on Sunday. Adding that, \"Our hearts are in Bethlehem.\" CNN's Will Ripley has the details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Palestinian Red Crescent and Hamas-controlled health ministry say, that a residential area was targeted and at least 70 people are dead.Pope Francis at the Vatican said that the message of Jesus' birth on this Christmas is being rejected by war. And in Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus, Christmas has essentially been cancelled. No tree, no decorations, no large crowds, largely in solidarity with Gaza. And also, because tourists and pilgrims just aren't going there this year. It's the first time in recent memory that there's been a Christmas like this. The wife of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sara Netanyahu, sent a letter to the Pope asking for his personal intervention to secure the unconditional release of the remaining more than 100 Israeli hostages believed to be alive in Gaza on this Christmas Day. Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to intensify his military operations inside Gaza just after a conversation with the U.S. President, Joe Biden, where they talked about the objectives and phasing of the war, hoping on the U.S. side that Israel will transition to a lower intensity, more targeted effort to root out Hamas leadership without piling onto the already sky-high civilian death toll of well over 20,000 people, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry. From the Israeli Defense Force, there's new information about an underground Hamas tunnel network that was destroyed. Before it was destroyed, Israel says, they recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages previously reported by CNN in mid-December. Three of those were IDF soldiers, two were civilians. And very dramatic scenes at the Rafah border crossing with Egypt when aid trucks that were coming in on Sunday were essentially ambushed by large crowds. Gunshots rang through the crowd as people grabbed whatever they could and ran in all directions. The chaos preventing that aid likely from getting to the people in Gaza who desperately needed it most, with most of the population there hungry. People being told to relocate now for a second or third or even fourth time. And the fighting continues. Will Ripley, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I see a moment very, soon where, the oil and gas companies are going to realize that producing renewable energy makes more sense for their bottom-line. Places like Exxon, Have activist investors now on their board. We see places like BP and Chevron starting to invest more in renewables.Now, renewables, in particular solar and wind are some of the cheapest forms of energy on the planet. And if we can make that business case, then that's the ballgame. But at the same time in 2023, we realized that 70 percent of people on the planet actually believe climate change is a problem, and they want governments to be doing more about it. That's a huge change. Now, that last 30 percent, we don't have to worry about them. They're probably never going to end up changing their mind. But in focusing on the 70 percent, if we take them and get them to that next rung on the ladder of active participation in the political process, then we'll be able to get real concrete change moving us in the right direction.",

They aren't going to bring new jobs to their district.So, slowly, over time with places like the conservative climate caucus, we're seeing more and more Republicans on board. That doesn't discount the fact that there are a lot of conservative members of the United States Congress that are still focused on drilling.

They're still very far away from being commercially viable and scalable.So, the things I am optimistic on a technological front are new ways of producing solar, new ways of capturing that electricity with battery storage. And there are a lot of companies that have come really close to rethinking the way the transmission grid works in the United States and around the world. Because not only do we need to focus on energy, we need to focus how we're getting that energy to people. I'm also seeing a lot, a lot of advancements in places like manufacturing, in places like construction, and in places as we're focusing on the day-to-day things we use from food to clothing.
