Those are the markets and these are the main events. President Biden put his focus on the chip wars as TSMC triples a plant investments in the US. Morocco shocking Spain securing a spot in the quarterfinals, and jubilation is in the air. And the global airlines industry looks to return to profit in 2023. Live from New York, it is Tuesday, December 6th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest and I too, mean business. Good evening. Tonight, the world's top computer chipmaker has announced a major new investment in the US. President Joe Biden is heading to a TMSC plant under construction in Phoenix, Arizona. He is set to meet with tech executives and also tout the benefits of the Chips Act passed earlier this year. TSMC started building its Arizona plant last year. Now it says, it is tripling its investment there to $40 billion. Mr. Biden's visit comes amid rising concerns over chip supply, including tensions between China and Taiwan. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Phoenix as is the President. So Jeremy, what more are we expecting to hear from the President?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, what we are getting here from President Biden is touting these investments and tyingthem directly, of course, to this Chips and Science Act, which has resulted already, we've seen in billions of dollars in planned investments from a whole slew of companies -- everyone from Intel to Micron to TSMC, where we are today -- all of them announcing billions of dollars in investments, hoping to get some of those $52 billion in subsidies aimed at incentivizing semiconductor chip manufacturing production here in the United States. And this plant is very much part of that effort, not only because of the amount of money that is being invested, but also because TSMC announced today that it plans to manufacture more advanced chips here in the United States. We just had Apple CEO Tim Cook here talking about this, and clearly this is being driven by National Security concerns related to Taiwan, but also the fact that we saw over this COVID pandemic, these supply chain issues with semiconductor chips, and so companies like Apple, for example, would like to see more production here in the United States to avoid those snags in the future. And also, of course, to avoid potential National Security issues getting in the way of them getting their chips for their products. So you'll hear President Biden touting these investments, talking about it, not only from an economic perspective, but also from a national security perspective. And then, of course, more broadly talking about his economic agenda, talking about investments that have happened here, thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law as well. So a lot for the President to discuss here in Phoenix -- Rahel.",

I mean, think about batteries, for example.We use smaller batteries for our watches, we have bigger devices that use AAA batteries. Well, it's kind of the same approach with chips. There are different chips for different products. The chips that you would maybe need for an Apple product, maybe a little bit more sophisticated than the one that you would use for your refrigerator, for other home appliances. So this facility that we're talking about in Arizona, at first is going to produce something a little bit more simple, starting in 2024, then looking at 2026, it's going to produce some of these more sophisticated chips that are categorized as N3 in the chips-sphere.

But as we have seen taking politics out of it, supply chain issues are really broad. I mean, there are so many different pieces in the pie.

And back home, the party has started -- the streets filling up with people. There is one more spot up for grabs in the final eight, and Portugal and Switzerland are right now battling it out. All eyes are on Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the game's greats and what is likely his last World Cup tournament was left out of the starting lineup. Let's go to Doha where Don Riddell is following every moment. Don, I want to start with Morocco. I mean, help me understand. Did they just play a better game? Or did Spain disappoint?

So you would expect from this position that Portugal will go on and book their place in the last state. What's really interesting about this game, though, is that they're so far doing it without Cristiano Ronaldo. First knockout match that Portugal have played in the last 20 years, where CR7 hasn't been in the starting 11. He has been watching on the bench, and of course, we all know how Ronaldo feels about being relegated to the bench. It's what led to his departure from Manchester United, his club team just a few weeks ago. Really, really interesting to watch the goals go in and gauge how excited he was. So it was actually the man that replaced him in the starting 11 that scored the opening goal, but by the time it was two nil, Ronaldo was off the bench and he was celebrating with the team. So, he seems to be enjoying it now. But it's a very difficult experience, I would imagine for Cristiano Ronaldo to be watching his team do so well at the World Cup, and to not be a part of it. Of course, he has played in the group stages. It's not like he hasn't contributed until this point. But a weird experience for him I would imagine and it is going to give the coach something to think about in the next round: Does he bench Ronaldo again? Because some people think that Portugal played better without him. It was kind of the same argument that Manchester United, they actually played better when he wasn't in the team. So this is going to be an interesting narrative to follow as the tournament continues.",

So indeed, we would expect multiple spikes in the oil price next year, perhaps, notably in February, when there will be an embargo on Russian energy exports in Europe. And other reasons too can cause this volatility. But I must say also that airlines are used to dealing with high energy prices and have been profitable, more profitable than what we are forecasting now, previously, with similarly high oil prices, notably between 2011 and 2019. So, it's not -- it doesn't necessarily mean that we cannot deliver a profit. The interesting thing is, of course, that we have an unusually high spread between the jet fuel that airlines use and the crude oil prices.

So that catch up phenomenon, I think, might have some more legs, but the unusual thing that we have also observed is a very seemingly low price sensitivity of this demand. So people are prepared to pay the price, and we haven't really seen any dampening effect, stemming from the higher ticket prices, which are, of course, related to the higher oil prices. But this price sensitivity can be expected to come back progressively into the market again, and I would put that around the labor market again, that as long as we have these phenomenal job creation numbers, and these low unemployment rates, people can get away with not being very price sensitive. But when that trend changes, I would assume that a greater price sensitivity in our demand for air transport is going to return probably somewhere towards -- during the second half of next year, it could be the time when those things start to shift.",

      "sentences": "It was not even a week ago that markets were in total celebration mode after Fed chair Jerome Powell, heseemed to endorse the idea of slower interest rate hikes from the Fed. But now, it looks like that celebration from markets was premature. In the last few days, we've gotten a series of economic reports that raise emphasis on some of the other parts of Powell's message. The Fed still has a lot more work to do here. Friday's jobs report was a lot hotter than expected, especially on wages. Numbers that were out yesterday showed that factory orders increased by more than expected. U.S. service sector activity is holding up and obviously holiday shopping has been pretty resilient. All of that is speaking to the idea that the Fed probably has to keep raising interest rates, not just at next week's meeting but going into next year, maybe going to 5 percent or even higher. That is where you get this recession concern, that the Fed is going to end up overdoing it and slowing the economy right into a downturn. You layer on top of that these cautious words from CEOs and it is a another bad day for the stock market, giving back all of those gains from last week after Jerome Powell spoke. R. SOLOMON:  It is interesting, Matt, you want a resilient economy to weather whatever is on its way. But you want a cooling economy as well to handle inflation. Matt, why are oil prices lower? We got that news yesterday about the E.U. oil cap and yet oil prices are solidly lower.",

      "sentences": "It is amazing what we are seeing in the oil market. If you told me six months ago that the war in Ukraine would be going on for almost a yearnow, that Europe was going to be banning most Russian oil and the G7 was going to impose this price cap on Russian oil, I would've said oil prices are not just at 100 but well above $100 a barrel. Instead, they keep going lower. U.S. oil prices just closed below $75 a barrel for the first time since just before Christmas. They are down by more than 40 percent from that peak in March, above $103 a barrel briefly. So it has been really incredible. I think that a lot of this has to do with why the market is down, why the stock market is down. People are concerned about a recession and a recession, of course, would hurt demand for energy. Right now, these concerns about the health of the economy, these concerns about an aggressive Fed, that is overshadowing anything that is happening in terms of punishing Russia. Another point here is that, for now, Russian oil keeps flowing. A lot of people were concerned that there would be these major supply chain disruptions due to the war in Ukraine, due to sanctions on Russia. For the most part, that really hasn't happened. That means that we've had a situation where supply has been able to keep up and catch up with demand. We have seen energy prices come down, gasoline prices in the United States down really sharply, back to pre-invasion levels. That, of course, is good news for consumers. It is also good news for central bankers who are battling inflation because gas prices have come down, inflation expectations have cooled off. So that is certainly helping a bit here. R. SOLOMON:  You think about the funnel effect of lower oil prices that funnels into all sorts of consumer prices that we as consumers pay. Matt Egan in New York, good to have you, thank you. Let's go to Georgia now, voting is underway in the U.S. state of Georgia, where senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, is facing Republican Herschel Walker. The runoff was required after neither won more than 50 percent of the vote last month. Democrats have already secured control of the Senate. But a Democratic win would mean that they do not need to rely on the vice president to break a 50-50 tie. Dianne Gallagher is with us now, she is in Atlanta. Set the scene for us. Even though the Democrats have necessarily the majority that they need, why are the stakes so high?",
