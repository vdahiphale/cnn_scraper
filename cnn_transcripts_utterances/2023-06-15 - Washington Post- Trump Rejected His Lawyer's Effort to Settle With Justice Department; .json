I'm Christine Romans.We begin with Donald Trump's arrest and arraignment in the classified documents case. \"The Washington Post\" reports that Trump rejected efforts by one of his lawyers to cut a deal with the Justice Department to return the documents and avoid indictment. \"The Post\" says attorney Chris Kise wanted to negotiate with the DOJ back in the fall after the FBI found more than 100 classified documents at Mar-a- Lago. However, CNN spoke to sources close to Trump's legal team, and they cast some doubt on whether that was a real opportunity to settle.

      "sentences": "That's right, Christine. These are the numbers that they have been giving. The survivors we have so far, 104 of them are housed in here, most of them housed in this makeshift warehouse at the port of Kalamata. And many of them will be transported to greater Athens later in the day, we understand.The nationalities that we have been given so far are Egyptian, Syrian, a couple of Palestinian and some Pakistanis included. Most of them are young men, under the age of 40. There are some miners in those 104. And what we have that's interesting, in this group there is not a single woman. Survivors saying there were women and children on board. And from their accounts, we understand that most of those were in the lower decks. In some cases even lock in those lower decks in order for the vote not to shift in weight, which is exactly what happened at some point. It seems people panic, possibly because of an engine failure. These are just first reports coming out as to what happened and led to the incident. But what happens is that the weight changed in the boat capsized. And then sank very quickly. So far, operations have been going forward. For more than 30 hours. We have been speaking to authorities here who say that by now, the chances of finding survivors in such deep waters are extremely unlikely. They have not told us how they are likely to proceed but we understand that even if they were to send divers, the depth is so great that they would not be able to get a very close, Christine.",
