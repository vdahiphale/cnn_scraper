I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.It is 2:00 a.m. in Turkey, and across that country, millions of people are still awake, waiting to learn the outcome of the country's crucial election. Right now Turkey's state-run media says that early results show that neither the current president, President Erdogan, nor his opposition rival got enough votes to avoid a runoff. It now seems increasingly likely that the two men will face off once again at the end of the month in the next stage of an election that has been viewed as a referendum on the now 20-year tenure of President Erdogan. Now Jomana Karadsheh is joining us now. Jomana, what would this runoff look like? And what's happening behind you? It's still a pretty boisterous scene even at 2:00 in the morning over there in Istanbul.",

You've got families who are out here. You've got people who are driving around on motorbikes and their cars waving the Turkish flag, and the flag of President Erdogan's party.I mean, this looks like a celebration, but there is no celebration yet. As you mentioned, this is still too close to call. We understand from the country's supreme election council that nearly 90 percent of the vote has been counted so far, but they haven't given any indication of what each of these candidates have gotten so far. What we are getting is different sets of data coming from the opposition, who believe that they are in the lead. They are also accusing President Erdogan's coalition, they say, of slowing down the system by making objections during the counting, that they are slowing down this process, telling them you cannot prevent this. This has to go on. And at the same time, you've also got the official data from the state news agency. As you mentioned, President Erdogan dropping below that 50 plus 1 percent that is needed, that threshold, to win. So right now it is very unclear where this is all headed. If the numbers are going to change in the next few hours as the counting is continuing, or is this country headed towards a runoff in two weeks from now. But the supporters of President Erdogan, Jim, are out here. They're out here in force. These are diehard Erdogan supporters who believe that only he can lead them and lead this country. They are repeating the government's line, President Erdogan's line about the achievements they say that he has done for this country. And they just can't imagine a Turkey without Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They say that even if this goes to a runoff -- still unclear if that will happen -- they will continue to support him, and they say they will come back and come back stronger. And you've got the opposition on the other side continuing to hold on to the hope that they can do this, that they can bring the change that they have been promising people. People they say could go back to a real democracy and reverse years and decades of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule that they say has turned it into an authoritarian state -- Jim.",

It is perhaps a moment where the system is resetting, right, especially with those numbers that you just shared, where you don't have that sheer volume of people going into the system. So what we're seeing here is at least this brief moment of recovery. All weekend long, the rate of release at DHS facilities, that is of course the number of people that are processed and then allowed to go on their way, in many cases, that has remained relatively steady, allowing the shelters here in El Paso also a moment of recovery.We actually spent some time in one of these shelters, heard from many people, including migrant moms. So it may have been Mother's Day last week in their home country. Today they say there's a reason to remain hopeful about what may come. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANDOVAL (voice-over): Step inside this shelter in the heart of El Paso, Texas, and you'll find people waiting in limbo. They're migrant families. Some single mothers who told us they were recently processed and released by border authorities. While some children visibly exhausted nap inside, others play in the courtyard. Their young minds spared the anguish of moms and dads trying to figure out when or even if they can continue the rest of the journey in what can easily become a hopeless space. It seems the migrant mothers keep hope alive here. Conny Barahona keeps it together for Daniella, her 9-year-old. She says two of her older daughters ages 18 and 20 remain in federal detention. It will be a sad Mother's Day, she tells me. My daughters won't be by my side. In the last three days Barahona turned down coveted opportunities to travel to Houston, refusing to go anywhere without all her daughters. We left Honduras together and that's how we must remain until God allows, the single mother says. She forged a friendship with fellow migrant mom, Yascadi Gonzalez (PH), who've left South America three months ago with her partner and their son Jason. We found another motherly bond in this corner of the shelter where (INAUDIBLE) Falcon receives help when caring for baby Yeremy just 2 weeks old. This mom tells me she carried him from Venezuela to Texas where she went into labor immediately after stepping on to U.S. soil. All of the migrant mothers we spoke to say maternal instinct to provide for their children is what drove them to make the perilous journey in the first place. A parent will do anything to see their children safe, says Barahona. A hug from Daniella seems to help ease any of mom's sorrows. We asked her what she wants to be when she grows up. A seamstress like mom. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
