So, what does that mean for civilian deaths in Gaza?Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton is over at the magic wall to help us understand this. Colonel Leighton, the Israeli Air Force, they posted some photos at the start of this war of planes being armed with unguided munitions. And CNN has an analysis that says that these may be M117 munitions. There is also other reporting that suggests that Israeli Air Force is dropping Mark 82 munitions. So, can you tell us about these two types? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, definitely, Abby. Good evening. And the photos that you're talking about from the Israeli Air Force are these right here. This is an Israeli Air Force F-16I. And you can see the munitions right here and here that they were loading up in this area. So, a Mark 82 is actually still in use by a lot of air forces, including the U.S. military. It's an unguided airdrop weapon, but it can be modified with something known as a JDAM, which I'll explain in just a little bit. But the basic idea here is this is about a 500-pound bomb, and it's loaded with an explosive known as tritonal. It's basically a mix of TNT, 80 percent TNT, and 20 percent aluminum. Now, the other bomb that we're talking about here is the M117. This is a bomb that dates all the way back to the Korean War, and it was discontinued in the U.S. in 2015. The last plane to drop it was a B- 52. It was used extensively in the Vietnam War. But the Israelis apparently used this at least in October of this year when they first went after Hamas in Gaza.",

So what this does is it basically attaches a pack to the weapon itself, to the bomb itself, and what that does is it has a GPS guidance system associated with it, plus other guidance systems. And what they can do is they can actually make it much more precise.These guidance systems can be programmed before flight or in flight, either manually by the crew or automatically depending on what the sensor system is on the aircraft. And what it does is it attaches to those unguided munitions and it's apparently been given to Israel about 3,000 of these packages since October the 7th, and that is what we know to be the case. And so the Israelis could have easily used the JDAM in order to prosecute the kind of targets that they've been looking at.",
