Two hours -- two hours of torture.When you think about having oil spilled on your body, eggs thrown at you while you recall the inward over and over for quite some time these men were trying to get someone to pay attention. Now look, this is the first time we've actually seen these men in court because that first case was a federal trial. And as you know, you can't get cameras in there. But this is the state court case. In fact, they can see it on another monitor. This is pretty much wrapped up. You can see the video there of these men walking into court. They call themselves the Goon Squad. And it was their job to go out and dispense justice the way they wanted to. In fact, at one point, they even tried to sexually assault these men, and they use their tasers over and over again to see who had the most powerful taser.

He's been banging on Ron DeSantis as having the wrong ideas for a long time now. And trying to figure out his own place in the political world, given that he's not running for president, as he said, probably will not have a chance to even think about running for president until 2028. Maybe beyond that.But he has been pushing this idea. And a couple of days ago, Ron DeSantis bid on it. DeSantis is in a situation of his own where his campaign, even people close to him admit has not been going as well as they wanted and is having trouble finding what one of his aides told us was enough oxygen without talking about Trump all the time. And so, they both have this interest in trying to find a way to go up against each other. And it creates this really weird thing where again, a guy who's not running for president, is running against a guy who -- are maybe debating against a guy who is not the nominee. And meanwhile, the Biden campaign has been looking at this and has been pleased to see Newsom landing some of the punches on DeSantis that they might have to land anyway. And generating a lot of money for them too. So, it's this weird situation that happens in politics where it might be that everybody kind of wins here, but it creates a strange situation along the way. BERMAN: What they ought to do is DeSantis and Newsom do a tag team wrestling match against Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Keep this going as long as they possibly could.",

Thank you so much for being here. And Washington bureau chief for the Chicago Sun-Times. Lynn Sweet. I'm going to start with you, Lynn. Donald Trump's team flew a banner over the State Fair saying be likable Ron. He brought Florida politicians with him who endorsed him as another jab at Ron DeSantis. But he wasn't there that long. Didn't do the traditional things. Does this go over well with Iowa voters? LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: Well, for the moment, yes, because his base is intensely loyal to him. What his rivals have not figured out how to do is to break this Trump favorite. Sara, no Republican who's running against Trump has any cure for this. They're doing their retail campaigning.

But the Republican base has been reshaped. And Trump controls that Republican base. And they support him wholeheartedly, despite these indictments, a big section of them. And so whether he shows up to the debate or not, I don't think he's going to impact his grip on the party or his standing in the polls. He could very well counter-program by holding a different event. He's demonstrated that he doesn't have to campaign the way the rest of the field is campaigning. That he can drop in hold one event, draw thousands compared to maybe 50 that go to a DeSantis event, or less than that that might go to a Nikki Haley event. So, it's not something that Trump himself necessarily has to do. And regardless of the pledge, the Fox executives have said that they want him to show up to the debate.",
