Here are today's top stories.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has struck a plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department over his role in one of the largest ever breaches of classified U.S. government material. In exchange for his expected guilty plea on Wednesday to a single charge, Assange will avoid spending any time in an American prison and return to Australia a free man. Lawyers for Hunter Biden are requesting a new trial in his federal gun case, disputing his conviction on a technicality. The U.S. president's son was found guilty earlier this month on three felony charges, all related to his lying about illegal drug use when he bought a handgun in 2018. Louisiana is being sued over a new law that requires all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. Some parents and civil rights groups say the state is violating the First Amendment and would pressure students into religious observance. President Joe Biden's team says he's getting ready to encounter any of the many incarnations of Donald Trump, including a very disciplined version. But Trump has a track record of being very undisciplined during debates. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

As you mentioned, this probe is supposed to be bringing back up to 2 kilograms of lunar soil collected from the moon's South Pole- Itkin Basin.That is an impact crater formed some 4 billion years ago on the side of the moon that is never visible to the Earth. Why is that important? Because unlike on Earth, where a lot of the evolutionary evidence has been destroyed by the movements of our plate tectonics, the moon's far side is often described by experts as a frozen record of what it was like in the early days of our solar system. So now, these samples will be studied first by Chinese researchers before the government here allows access to them by international scientists. But everybody will be looking very carefully at the results of the analysis of these samples to gain better understanding of the evolution, not only of the moon, but also of the Earth and our solar system. And that, of course, potentially could also help China further explore the utilization of resources on the moon, not to mention every progress they make from these sample return missions will help them get closer to putting their astronauts on the moon. As you mentioned, the goal is 2030 -- Max.",
