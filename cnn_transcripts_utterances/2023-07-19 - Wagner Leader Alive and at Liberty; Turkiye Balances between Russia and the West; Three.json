You may remember Prigozhin staged a brief mutiny against a criminal last month. Today MI-6 boss Richard Moore has been talking to our Nick Paton Walsh about Prigozhin, the Russian president and Ukraine. It is rare access and Nick joins us now live from Prague. Great to see you, Nick. But also a rare speech, frankly, by the MI-6 chief, saying that Prigozhin is floating about. We have just heard of this footage that has come through.

But it has emerged a matter of hours since the comments here in Prague by Sir Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service at MI-6. Now he said when asked by me whether Prigozhin was alive and healthy, remember until this apparent video, we've not seen Prigozhin since he was in Rostov during this failed mutiny. It ended on that Saturday in a June weekend at the end of June. And this video does appear to show him in Belarus going along with the deal. He appeared to agree with to move himself and his fighters to Belarus. Now for more here, I think expressing some of the shock and the bewilderment that intelligence services in the West felt as they watch the events, like all of us frankly in the Kremlin during that failed rebellion but also offering a separate kind of confirmation. What we have seen in public from the Kremlin is indeed what is happening behind closed doors. That is an important thing to point out, because so much of what we see emerging from the Kremlin's is smoke, mirrors and signals that are hard to verify. But essentially, confirming here their belief that indeed there was a deal brokered by the president of Belarus and a deal which Putin cut to save his own skin, showing extraordinary weakness. Here is one of the more colorful statement that we heard today about the loyalties and statements that we heard during that weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SIR RICHARD MOORE, CHIEF, MI-6:  If you look at Putin's behaviors on that day, Prigozhin started off I think as a traitor. He had been pardoned by supper and then a few days later he was invited for tea. There are some things now that even the chief of MI-6 finds a little bit difficult to try and interpret in terms of who is in and who is out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Turkish President Erdogan has said that he would speak to president Vladimir Putin about potentially reviving that grain deal. The last agreement was brokered by Turkiye and the U.N. in 2022. Now Russia has said that it would be prepared to return to the deal if Moscow's demands are met. Right now, Mr. Erdogan is on a tour of the Gulf region to boost foreign investment for Turkiye's struggling economy. He's currently here in the United Arab Emirates.

And so we are learning a little bit about his back story. What we are told is that he had been facing assault charges in South Korea for assaulting members of the public in September and October of 2022. And as a result of that, he actually ended up spending about 50 days in a South Korean detention facility, doing hard labor. Now he was released from that facility on July 10th and he was scheduled to board a flight back to the United States on July 17th, where he was going to be separated from the Army. He's going to face further disciplinary action as a result of the assault charges and actually be removed from the military altogether. Well, now we are learning that he actually never got on that flight. He was escorted to the airport by U.S. military officials but they could not accompany him all the way to the gate. So he did not end up boarding the plane. In the next day on July 18th is when we saw him taking the tour of the DMZ and he crossed over the border, again, voluntarily. And so now the U.S. military says that it has been in touch with North Korean military officials to try and resolve the situation. It is unclear at this point how productive those conversations have been. But we are also hearing from Travis King's mother, who spoke to ABC. And she said that she finds it very hard to believe that Travis would do something like this.

Tying those together is going to be a complicated affair, not just in the legal sense but he is also effectively going to have to make a public case for the American people just because of this extraordinary situation that we are in, where in the Justice Department of a sitting president is investigating his predecessor and that predecessor is running against him to win another term in the White House. It is an unprecedented sort of legal and constitutional collision. And it's causing a great deal of tension.

Now as you noted, the Israeli president largely ceremonial role. He's actually been trying to act as a mediator in the debate over the judicial reform. But it was a bit of an awkward split screen yesterday as president Herzog sat with President Biden in the Oval Office literally at the same time as tens of thousands of Israelis were on the streets across Israel protesting this judicial overhaul. There's now been 29 straight weeks of these massive protests against the overhaul and at the same time, president Herzog sitting in the Oval Office while prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is still technically waiting for his formal invitation there. There may have been an invitation in a phone call between President Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday before Herzog flew to the United States but there is a bit of a discrepancy whether this was a real invitation to the White House or just say, hey, let's meet when you are in the United States potentially in September during the U.N.
