So if, indeed, Kamala Harris were to win the presidency, and therefore, Tim Walz would have a tie-breaking vote, the Republicans would need two seats, a net gain of two seats to have control if Harris were to win the presidency. If Trump were to win the presidency, they just need one net gain seat, you know? And by the way, West Virginia, as you pointed out, that might be the seat that they need, right? Never mind the fact that Jon Tester in Montana, if you look, is running far behind Tim Sheehy right now, his Republican opponent there. So that right there may be the majority.
