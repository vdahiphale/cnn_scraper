LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Poppy, I think last night was a great reminder that when we hear President Biden giving a speech calling for legislative action, he's not necessarily always doing it because he thinks there's a good chance that this can happen. Look, President Biden and White House officials know very well just how difficult it would be for Congress to get through an assault weapons ban. They couldn't do it the last two years when Democrats controlled Congress. They know that it is going to be nearly impossible when they don't control both chambers come next Congress.

That is when government funding runs out and one of several things that needs to happen in order for the government to not shutdown. Congress needs to pass a spending bill. That's what normal Congress, government behavior would be, or it can pass a short-term resolution, that's a stop gap measure, or a longer term C.R. for about a year, for example.Now, what does the White House want? They want Congress to pass a spending bill. They are saying, even as of yesterday, there is plenty of time to get it done. Maybe not a lot of time but they can get this done. There is recognition that a short-term stop gap measure might be necessary just to buy Congress a little bit more time. But one thing I can tell you that the White House does not want is the one-year C.R. They are saying that would have disastrous consequences for key areas of funding. And then the last thing I will tell you is that any talk of a government shutdown, at least in the building behind me, they are just not even contemplating that right now, that is how unacceptable it is to White House officials. And I will tell you, there's a lot of lobbying going on right now on Capitol Hill by White House officials and that's only going to ramp up as we get closer to that deadline of next Friday.",

I don't think anybody is actually is seriously offering that right now.On the other side of the ledgers, at least the stuff was found by the Trump team, by his lawyers, and turned over, which is the proper way to handle it. It doesn't fix things. It doesn't sort of excuse things the misdeed on the front end, but at least that part of the process seems to be working well.

It's not the necessarily taking of documents but perhaps the certifying to the court or to the FBI that all the documents had been returned. That could be more problematic for the Trump team as you going forward. So, again, I think this is going through the proper procedures.

      "sentences": "He was a problem in a couple different places. I think more than anything in picking those candidates, Trump picked and selected and was a proxy for some really, really bad candidates, people who had not run for office before. It's not easy to run for Senate. It's not easy to run for governor. It's not easy to run for Congress.That being said, he also wasn't helpful in the general elections. He was able to get Herschel Walker, for example, across the line relatively easily in a primary in Georgia because Donald Trump still has tremendous sway amongst Republican primary voters. But he wasn't able to get Herschel Walker across the line with the general electorate in Georgia, which sends the message that Donald Trump is still weak with swing voters in swing states. He lost Georgia in 2020. The Republicans lost two Senate races there in 2020, and now they've lost yet another Senate race there in 2022 at the same time that statewide Republicans who are not being supported by Donald Trump or at least recruited by Donald Trump are doing extraordinarily well. So, it does expose a weakness that Donald Trump has in swing states that he's going to need to address if needs to be taken seriously in 2024. LEMON:  Well, the GOP is going to have to address it, because you make a distinction, you said, between primary voters and general election voters and swing voters. That's a problem then for the GOP if you have a candidate who is not viable. So, my question is, is he the right person to be at the top of the ticket going forward for the GOP nationwide? MULVANEY:  I think there's a growing group of Republicans, myself included -- listen, there's always been a group of Republicans who can't stand Donald Trump. And so the fact they don't like him now or they don't think he's the best candidate in 2024 really doesn't change anything, it doesn't move the needle. But there's a growing group of Republicans that supported Donald Trump in '16, supported him in 2020, like myself, worked with him in the administration, who think that he's actually our weakest candidate in 2024. He's the one most likely to lose, because if he runs in 2024 as the Republican nominee, that election becomes a referendum on Donald Trump. Either vote for Donald Trump or against Donald Trump. He lost that election under that sort of structure in 2020 and has shown no ability to sort of change that dynamic going into 2024. I believe that if he is the Republican nominee, he stands just as much losing two years from now as he did two years ago.",

If he runs against one person, he loses with 35 percent. If he runs against five, he wins with 35 percent. And as you know, most of the states, Republican states, are winner-take-all or some variation on that. You can win the nomination without winning a majority of the Republican primary vote.

That's a defensible thing. So, there's another side to the story if this was a one-off type of thing. It could also be explained on bad staff work, if it was a one-off type of thing. But it seems to happen with President Trump more and more.He needs to take the position more seriously. He's a candidate for president right now. He shouldn't be making these kinds of mistakes. And as I mentioned, all it does is divide his base. It doesn't add anybody to his voting base. There's nobody in the country who said, you know what, I wasn't supporting Donald Trump, but since he had dinner with a white supremacist, I think I'm on his team now. That's not how this works.

So, we've yet to see the probably more controversial part, which is the run-up to them leaving their royal roles.It has unruffled some feathers here, I have to say.

My sources are telling me that no one in the royal family was approached for comment nor in the palaces. So, that's one bit of response we've had, but I'm not expecting any mayor comment from Buckingham Palace officially today or indeed next week. But here are some the highlights from what we've seen so far.
