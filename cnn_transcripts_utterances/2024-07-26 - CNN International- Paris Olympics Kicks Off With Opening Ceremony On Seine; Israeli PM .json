A cloudy forecast could not eclipse a stunning opening ceremony still underway for the Paris Olympics. Thousands of athletes from all over the world parading in boats down the River Seine, waving as they pass France iconic landmarks from the Eiffel Tower to the Louvre. The star-studded performance, also playing homage to the city's history, romance, its literature, its fashion, kicks off two weeks of fierce athletic competition, and global sportsmanship. The show did go on even after what police are calling a coordinated sabotage on the Paris railways and arson attack that set off major travel disruptions this morning. Plus, here, in the U.S., former President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. This for the first time since Trump left office. We're going to have more on how the presidential race could reshape that relationship, U.S.-Israeli relations, as well as the war in Gaza later this program. First, I do want to go to Paris, begin there, senior correspondent, Melissa Bell. She is at the games for us. But following this attack, I imagine attempted to disrupt the games and the start here. What do authorities about it at this point?",

Now, here that's just behind me, train's traffic is slowly starting to resume and that is the case in parts of France while there has been seriously disrupted for much, they even impacting some of the athletes who are hoping to get here to take part in that opening ceremony that's already been spectacularly dampened by the rain that you can see around me. For the time being the investigators are trying to figure out exactly how it could have happened to people who organized Paris 2024 Games, Jim, felt that they had every base covered, the security is extremely tight as you'd imagine. But these attacks happening as they did so far away from Paris, in the middle of the night, were simply something that hasn't been anticipated. Its effect though has been serious, not just for those athletes who are trying to get to Paris for trains were carrying them, two of them failed to arrive but also for the many hundreds of thousands, millions of French people trying to get in and out of France for their annual holidays. Lots of speculation about who did it, but little question about the timing just hours ahead of an opening ceremony when the eyes of the world were on Paris, Jim.",

And so the story lines enter familiar to Americans. And I think even all the more compelling in terms of what we want to see and we know what they've been through. And here they are again no one bigger than Simone Biles, of course, 2016, the star where the stars the Rio Olympics and then had that incredibly difficult time. The Twisties, a mental health issues, but fought back for a bronze medal right at the end in Tokyo with, and the balance beam and then has come back, and now at 27-years-old is on top of her game again, the greatest of all time.

In this case, I go back to Cathy Freeman at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and I've never seen a stadium that just held his breath and in awe of a runner as she was winning her gold medal in Australia, you know, 24 years ago.So those stories are remarkable. You know, women, this is a women's Olympics. You know, the quality, the parity, same number of women as men. And so, a young U.S. women's soccer team that was reeling after last year and to see that team and how it will well perform without some of the big names we know from the past. I think some of the young swimmers and the -- you know, we'll see whether someone like Katie Ledecky, as we talked about, also 27 and years old, that she can hang on. Or if these young women who idolized her kids are now in a position that they might challenge her, especially course 400 meters, but maybe, which is tomorrow, and then the 800, and the 1,500 later. So I do love those stories, as you said, at both the, you know, and the essential upset of, say, men's -- U.S. men's basketball. There are so many things out there. It is certainly not a slam dunk by any means that the U.S. men or the U.S. women will win the gold medal in a basketball though we think it will.",
