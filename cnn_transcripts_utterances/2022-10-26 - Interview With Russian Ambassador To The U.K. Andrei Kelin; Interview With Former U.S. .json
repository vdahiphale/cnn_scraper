Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. A categoric denial from the Russian ambassador here in the U.K, Andrei Kelin tells me that Moscow using nuclear weapons is, \"Out of the question\", in a revealing interview at the embassy here. This, after the British, American, and French governments sent Moscow a stern warning this week. Fearing that Russia is now preparing for an escalation in Ukraine by planting false flag alarms. Though the ambassador's firm stance may not calm everyone's fears, after all Russian officials said all along that they were not going to invade Ukraine, and yet they did. Kelin is a veteran foreign service officer whose portfolio included arms control and NATO relations. Now, as ambassador, he's tasked with navigating the rocky relationship with the U.K. during this war. It is rare to hear from such a high-level Russian official these days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
