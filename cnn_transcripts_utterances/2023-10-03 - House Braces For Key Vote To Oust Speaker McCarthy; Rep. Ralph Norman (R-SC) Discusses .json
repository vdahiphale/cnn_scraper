      "sentences": "A high-stakes drama playing out right this minute on Capitol Hill. At any moment now, we will watch an historic vote on a motion aimed at removing the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, of California.He's hoping to defeat the effort to oust him, an effort spearheaded by Republican hardliner, Matt Gaetz, of Florida, who announced his intention to do so on CNN's \"STATE OF THE UNION\" on Sunday. But if McCarthy's unsuccessful in this key vote, he could be on his way to becoming the very first speaker of the House of Representatives to have his gavel taken away in more than a century. As we await the vote on the House floor, let's check in on the view from the White House down the street. CNN's M.J. Lee is there. M.J., what do we know about how President Biden is reacting to these fast-moving events on Capitol Hill? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, it is no surprise that White House officials and advisers to President Biden, they are very closely monitoring everything that is unfolding on Capitol Hill right now. And it is safe to say there is recognition here at the White House that the White House soon could be dealing with a new speaker of the House and a new leader of an unruly House Republican conference. Now, I don't have to tell you that President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, they have a complicated working relationship. At times, this relationship has been outright contentious. But there is, again, a recognition that a new speaker will mean a whole new potentially political landscape for Democrats and this White House to navigate. I think one urgent priority for this White House that is worth looking at is, of course, the question of Ukraine funding. This is something that got left out of the government funding bill that passed over the weekend. But we heard President Biden over the weekend seeming to suggest that he had received some new assurances from Speaker McCarthy that he would eventually bring up the Ukraine funding piece of this separately in the House. Obviously in a scenario where he is no longer the House speaker, all of those conversations, any potential assurances that the White House received, those all end up going out the window. I will also note, of course, publicly, White House officials, including the president himself, they have been very, very careful over the last couple of days to not publicly weigh in whenever they have been asked about potential leadership changes. They have said, look, all of this is for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to decide, this is not something that the White House is going to weigh in on. And there is just a general sense here at the White House, and we're seeing this play out among Democrats on Capitol Hill, that there certainly is no political upside for Democrats to weigh in, in a way that seems like they are helping out Speaker Kevin McCarthy.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I want to know what he will do if and when he loses these votes. That is really the big question at the moment.There seems to be no question that he does not have the votes to survive both the first procedural effort to stop Matt Gaetz's resolution to kick him out of the speakership. Then it would actually go on to the underlying resolution to actually vacate the speakership, something that's never been successfully executed on the House floor ever in American history. But at the moment, Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes, doesn't have Democrats who will help him, and has more than five Republicans who will vote to kick him out. He can only afford to lose four Republicans. So the big question right now is, what happens next? Because then it would go to a speaker's race. They'd have to elect a new speaker. Someone needs to get a majority of votes in the House. If there's no elected speaker, the House is in a state of paralysis. It can't move forward, it can't legislate. And they must elect a speaker. The question right now is, will McCarthy put himself up as a candidate for speaker in that situation? He has indicated for some time he's ready to fight. He keeps saying that he's never going to quit. But does that mean that he won't quit and continue to be a candidate and put his name up over and over again as we saw back in January? Those are major questions right now, Jake, as the speaker is recognizing he knows full well where the votes lie. But what is his next step? That's what a lot of members, a lot of his allies want to know, what he will do in the aftermath of this historic vote -- Jake?",

And so this is a test of his leadership also. Can he keep his caucus together? Can he make sure that some Democrats that might be more moderate don't actually support Kevin McCarthy? And they came out, it seems like as a Democratic caucus, to say we are going to vote as a unified bloc. The other thing is that, imagine some Democrats in the caucus that might be primaried in 2024, what their -- their Democratic opponent might do running an ad for someone who supported Kevin McCarthy in a moment like this. It's not good politics for the Dems to try to protect Kevin McCarthy. Leave it to the Republicans to figure it out.",

And it's every kid in America at this point.And part of why it's gotten so personal is I'd say two images that we saw yesterday. One was of Matt Gaetz on the capitol steps, surrounded by a bank of cameras. That's reason one. The other was an e-mail solicitation that Matt Gaetz sent out. \"Join me in my fight to oust Kevin McCarthy. Click here to give me money.\" That's reason number two that it's happening. And if we're having this conversation a year ago on what's going on in the campaign, we're talking about bad candidates that Republicans have nominated. Republicans have the small majority because Mitch McConnell was right. We nominated a lot of terrible candidates. A lot of them lost, which is why our majority's small. Some of them won and they're clearly not being helpful actors for McCarthy or the Republican majority. (CROSSTALK)",

I think Dana's right. They do have a working relationship. They're from the same generation. They have kids around the same age.
