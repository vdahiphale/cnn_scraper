I wanted to start with what I mentioned there, \"The Cook Political Report\", obviously, closely analyzes political races and we just got this update from them, making some changes to their electoral map and moving some key states away from Biden. I mentioned a few of them -- Minnesota, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and New Hampshire on the list. Does that concern you, Congresswoman? REP. JOYCE BEATTY (D-OH): Well, I think we're always concerned when we are this close or maybe I should say this far out from the race. We have time between now and November. I think we'll see an uptick. We're all out, his surrogates stumping for him. President Biden will also be out. So we're watching the numbers.  We're doing the same thing that you're doing, but we have a lot that we can say to those American people in those states, because President Biden has delivered and that's the good thing. We know that Vice President Harris is out on the stump campaigning today while the president is delivering or delivered an amazing speech for NATO. So things are on the uptick. We still have time. We're still going out. There are a number of members who are out on the stump for this president because what we do know is electing this president is better than what we'll have with the options that we have with former President Trump, who lies about everything, who's out for retribution and revenge.

And it is notable that he's going to be out there not only having endorsed him, but speaking. We obviously also have reported yesterday that celebrity TV star model Amber Rose was going to speak. But what I really am told by the campaign is that a lot of this convention is going to reflect every day Americans of what they say are Americans that are hurt by Biden's administration.

Ukraine accuses Russia of a deadly cruise missile strike here, a charge the Kremlin denies. It's a huge disappointment and a devastating blow, Ukraine's president announces, to see the leader of the worlds largest democracy hug the worlds most bloody criminal in Moscow. Moscow has been no close partner with India for generations, supplying the Indian military with weapons since the days of the Soviet Union. More recently, Russia has become an Indian gas station of sorts. India has been scooping up billions of dollars in Russian crude oil, which most Western countries stopped buying after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, blooming bilateral trade that's helping fund Russia's war machine. In Moscow, the two leaders announced plans to expand Russian energy deliveries. But on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his most critical public statement to date about the war in Ukraine, appearing to lecture Putin on the heartbreak of seeing innocent children killed.
