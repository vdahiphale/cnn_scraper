Officers then were able to get a hold of him. No shots fired. No one else injured, but Cavalcante who has a slight injury to his head from the dog. And here we are, he is now headed into custody yet again into another facility where he will likely be questioned. He will be processed and eventually be put back into prison, but not the same one he came from which was the jail into a state correctional facility.

The fact that he was actively attempting to crawl out. The fact that he was fighting the K-9, he was resisting arrest.It's -- your sense -- your senses are heightened. You're constantly looking for the threat. As they released the K-9, I'm sure that was part of their training as before they go out, they advise, they talk about it. They say, OK, if this happens, we'll release the dog. There are steps in preparation as they go out. If we encounter him, let's release the K-9. And if that happens, each one of these officers in their training is to get into position and to contain the threat. The fact that he was crawling away, it clearly was an attempt to escape, but the K-9 was able to subdue the fugitive. SIDNER:  Daniel Brunner, thank you so much for your analysis.
