I'm Rosemary Church.Well it is 10 in the morning across Israel and Gaza where the Israel Defense Forces say they are conducting more large-scale strikes against Hamas targets. Palestinian officials report Gaza's only power station is not working and hospitals are in danger of running out of fuel for generators. Nearly 1,200 people have been killed in Gaza since Saturday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Hamas militants continue to fire rockets into southern Israel. The Israeli military says at least 189 soldiers are among the 1,200 people killed in the terror attacks. And we are seeing more evidence that Israel may be planning a ground incursion into Gaza, as tanks and troops are massing at the border. That comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his political rivals have formed an emergency government and wartime cabinet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We are fighting a cruel enemy worse than ISIS. We saw girls and boys who were shot in the head, men and women who were burned alive, young women raped, fighters beheaded. BENNY GANTZ, NATIONAL UNITY PARTY LEADER (through translator): Our standing here together, shoulder to shoulder, is a message to our enemies. and most importantly, a message to all citizens of Israel. We are all together. We are all soldiers. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know that Israel has been carrying out retaliatory airstrikes, hundreds of them, ever since then. We know the death toll inside Israel is more than 1200 and inside Gaza is now more than 1100. And in fact there are still firefights, there are still skirmishes going on inside of Israel between soldiers and militants from Hamas. The IDF saying that the border with Gaza is almost sealed but it's not, in their words, hermetic. They're still seeing attempts to infiltrate into Israel, especially by sea, but for now there are still some skirmishes going on and they don't know how many, they say there could still be a few militants inside of Israel who could potentially carry out more attacks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Since the attack, the IDF has engaged on a widespread attack against Hamas. Indeed, we are currently focused on I would say two or three different components of the operation, but primarily those that conducted the special commando forces of Hamas, the Nukhba forces, has been our effort over the past night, and we are taking out their capabilities, we are striking them, and we are making sure that they can never be able to commit these atrocities ever again. Our air forces conducting these strikes against specific locations where we know they're hiding out, stockpiling weapons, using staging grounds, or preparing to launch rockets towards Israel. The IDF has recruited some 300,000 reservists, and we are making necessary preparations if the government instructs the military to go on a land ground force offensive. The situation is very dire and as these stories come out, the magnitude of the terrorism of Hamas that strategically decided to open a war with Israel is coming to surface.

And as Oren Liebermann reports, some officials believe U.S. military inventories could be stretched too thin.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Concern is growing within the Pentagon and the Defense Department about U.S. stockpiles of certain ammunition as it eyes the possibility of having to supply two wars, according to multiple U.S. officials. A war in Ukraine where the U.S. is supporting Kyiv, and a war in Gaza where the U.S. is supporting Israel. Now right now the two militaries are using very different types of ammunition. For example, in Ukraine it is artillery ammunition that is key, and the U.S. and other Western countries have been sending that for more than a year now. But in Israel the need is for precision guided aerial munitions and iron dome interceptors, which Israel has requested. The problem is, if Israel carries out a ground incursion, which seems to be what's being built up, according to statements from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then that Venn diagram of needs, what those militaries require for the ongoing fight, could very much overlap. Israel could need artillery ammunition or tank ammunition, which is exactly what Ukraine's military needs in the ongoing fight to push out Russian occupiers. And that's where the concern is. According to one U.S. official, the U.S. constantly looks at its weapons supplies, what it has, what's going in and what's coming out. But here is that concern about having to supply both countries. Now one key difference is that Israel has its own defense industrial base and that is able to crank out some very advanced weaponry. But with Netanyahu promising a prolonged campaign in Gaza and warning the country that it may have to be ready to grind out a war, the needs of that fight may simply outstrip what Israel's defense industrial base can provide, and that's where Israel will have to rely on the US, as it has done in the past. For example, back in 2014, in an ongoing 50-day war, Israel very much needed to pull from U.S. reserve stockpiles that are actually in Israel to maintain its ongoing fight, and that need may, U.S. officials say, creep up again, especially as Israel expands its campaign against Gaza. So a key question here will be what can the U.S. provide, especially as the U.S. and so many other Western countries have provided so much to Ukraine already, not seeing the war in Gaza coming.

Thank you, doctor, for talking with us at this very difficult time for you. Doctor, can you hear us there? I'm not sure, it looks like our shot has frozen. Can I just get confirmation of that? Doctor, are you still on the line? All right, we're going to go to our live pictures. At this stage, we see U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived at Gurion Airport in Israel. That's, he's going to, of course, he's the top U.S. diplomat set to meet in the coming days with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now, Secretary Blinken says he's also been discussing a possible humanitarian corridor to get food and medicine into Gaza and get civilians out. And of course we know that a number of Americans are still unaccounted for after Saturday's horrendous attack by Hamas, militants there, and Blinken will be looking for answers on that issue of course. We know at this point that it's thought that some of those hostages are Americans, he has with him in actual fact a hostage negotiator, a top hostage negotiator.

Israel fears to be used as human shields. And in a chilling warning, the group threatened to execute hostages if Israel continues its assault of the enclave.

YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI MINISTER OF DEFENSE (through translator): I released all restraints. We attack everything. The gloves are off. Hamas will no longer exist. We will destroy everything.

      "sentences": "Republicans are growing fearful that Steve Scalise's path to the speakership may be getting much smaller made opposition from members of the hard right and others as well who are not yet sold on his nomination to be speaker of the house, the math simply is a challenge for him at the moment. This is a narrowly-divided house meeting. He needs to get 217 Republicans to support him for the speakership. Well, to win the Republican nomination on Wednesday, he won 113 votes, and three of those votes were from non-voting delegates.So he has essentially 110 members who vote on the House floor, who he'll needs a lot more. We do expect dozens of those people who voted against Scalise and voted for Congressman Jim Jordan to support Scalise on the floor. But there are a number of others who say that they will vote for Jim Jordan on the House floor, even though Jordan himself has urged his supporters to back Scalise and end this paralysis in the House and the aftermath of that unprecedented vote last week to oust Kevin McCarthy from the Speakership. But even despite those calls from Jim Jordan, a number of Republicans we have talked to are making clear they still plan to vote against Scalise on the floor, making it incredibly difficult at the moment for him to win the Speakership. You're going to vote for Jordan on the floor in the first ballot. Are you going to speak with vote for Jordan for every single ballot? REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): I mean, it's hard to say, but I think we'll have to go several rounds and I will not move from that position, at least initially.

Thursday remains a possibility as well, but Scalise does not have the votes.The question is, does he go to the floor? Does he dare Republicans to vote against him, try to sink the nomination? Does he grind it out like he did, like Kevin McCarthy did back in January, winning the speakership after 15 ballots? All key questions for Scalise, as some worry that there's just no path for him to get the nomination, to get the speakership and believe that perhaps another candidate could emerge down the line.

CNN's Sam Kiley has more on the assault and the shadowy figure who may be behind it. A warning though, the report contains graphic content.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A brazen political move. Hamas demands that the U.S. negotiate the release of American hostages on Russian TV. ALI BARAKA, HAMAS NATIONAL RELATIONS ABROAD (through translator): There are also prisoners in the US. We want them, of course. There are Hamas members sentenced to life in the U.S. We demand that the U.S. frees our sons from their prisons. The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. Only recently it did one with Iran. Why wouldn't it conduct one with us? KILEY (voice-over): Confirmation of part of the intent behind the Hamas assaults in Israel. They were enabled by a failure of Israeli intelligence, but plotted by a shadowy Hamas officer they call Al Dief, the guest. Only two photographs exist of Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, who's nearly 60. He's known as Al Dief because he billets as a guest in a different location every night. He's the mastermind or monster, the murder of more than 1,000 in Israel, and the kidnapping of about 150 hostages. MKHALMAR ABUSADA, CHAIRMAN, POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT, AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY: From the beginning of his life, he was very much interested in fighting the Israeli occupation. KILEY (voice-over): In the mid-1990s, he was believed to be behind a wave of atrocities in Israel. And in 2014, he's believed to have lost an arm and a leg in an Israeli airstrike aimed at him that killed his wife and daughter. For the last two years, though, Hamas has pretended to focus on welfare, not warfare. BARAKA (through translator): All the while under the table, Hamas was preparing this big attack. KILEY (voice-over): Israel, meanwhile, invested in automation and sensors, a high-technology iron wall around Gaza and focus forces on the West Bank. Under Dief, Hamas encouraged Israeli complacency. Then last weekend, it hit hard. Attacking communication towers and automated machine guns with drones, overrunning command and control centers, killing senior officers, among them three colonels, and unleashing terror on thousands of civilians. The Israel Defense Forces found Hamas anti-tank mines and other heavy weapons, a sign they may have planned for a longer stay. The shock infantry attack has either deliberately brutal from the start or degenerated into a massacre as Israeli defenses collapsed. It shifted attention and power to Hamas.",
