The warning from Ukraine's President to the United States. \"One World\" starts right now.Between a rock and a hard place, right now Zelenskyy is on Capitol Hill desperately pleading for aid. Squabbling lawmakers aren't making it easy. Also ahead, where is jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny? His team says a prison employee says he's no longer at a penal colony, but could not confirm where he has gone. And later, it's official. All of the members of BTS are now on hiatus. How fans are coping and what's next for the super group. Hello everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. This is \"One World\". It is a crucial day for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian President is in Washington trying to make sure his country and its fight against Russia remain on the U.S. agenda. This, as support for the nearly two-year war, is now waning. Mr. Zelenskyy hopes to show U.S. lawmakers the benefit of the proposed $60 billion in new aid to the country. The Senate Majority Leader laid out what's at stake. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHUCK SCHUMER, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER: If he gets the help he needs, he will win. On the other hand, he made it clear, and we all made it clear, that if we lose, Putin wins. And this will be very, very dangerous for the United States. So, we cannot let Putin influence through any surrogate what is what we need to do for Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

After presenting his case to senators and House leaders, he's now headed to the White House to meet with President Biden. Time is not on his side. Lawmakers may leave this week for the Christmas holiday without voting on the aid package. Let's bring in CNN Capitol Hill Reporter Melanie Zanona. Melanie, yesterday some Republicans, senators, including Rand Paul and Josh Hawley indicated to you that they would not attend today's meeting with Zelenskyy.

Because we all know that if Putin is able to continue his march, that he started in Georgia, that he went to Crimea, that he went to the Donbas, his next stop after Ukraine, after Kyiv will be a NATO country, and that means our Western allies and American troops are in the fight. For all those reasons, Republicans have always been supportive of Ukraine funding behind closed doors. But as they get political pressure from their base, from the far right of their party, the isolationist wing of the Republican Party, they have been much less willing to support Zelenskyy in public.

But it does mean that as we use taxpayer dollars to ensure that Ukraine doesn't lose, we want to see a change in strategy. We want to see them get out of this stalemate. That means they have to admit some mistakes. They must admit that the counteroffensive didn't go as planned.

Russia is suffering 315,000 dead, injured troops, nearly 80 percent of military personnel5, as well.

So, that is a good news story, and I do think the administration could do a better job of telling that story because we all know that Vladimir Putin is a threat to the West, a threat to NATO, a threat to the United States of America. And we significantly degraded that threat by helping Ukraine. By the way, even if we are in a stalemate, we continue to degrade the Russian military as they run up against this wall of Ukrainian and Western defenses. So, you know, that is not all bad. It is not a terrible story that there is a stalemate. We just cannot fund it indefinitely, and that is why we need some strategic changes to give the Ukrainians a better chance of breaking through.",

But we don't want to scuttle what we fundamentally need when it comes to immigration policy in the United States, which is a full immigration deal, a deal that not only includes what Republicans want, which is increased border security, but also what Democrats want, which is a pathway to citizenship. Some hope for all the kids, for example who were brought here years ago by their parents and yet are sitting in legal limbo through no fault of their own. They go to American schools, they participate in the American economy, and yet they're not technically legal citizens. The vast majority of Americans, Republicans and Democrats, want a fix for that problem as well. But Republicans in Congress aren't willing to do it unless it's paired with border security. So, the concern is that if the President bargains away what the Republicans want, they're not on border security just to get aid on Ukraine, then it imperils the chances of what we really need on immigration, which is full comprehensive reforms.",

And even those Republicans whodid attend said that their minds were not changed and that they are still demanding stricter border security provisions be attached to any additional Ukraine aid. And this is despite the direct and urgent pleas from Zelenskyy himself. During the briefing, he told lawmakers that he is counting on them to deliver and warned that if they don't get more money, Ukraine is going to fall. Really framing this as a life or death situation. Now, he also assured lawmakers that the money would be spent appropriately, trying to assuage some of those concerns that Republicans have had over corruption. But Zelenskyy did not dive into this very complicated debate over immigration and the border, which is really what's holding up a broader deal over aid for Ukraine and Israel. And the reality is, that is a negotiation that is entirely out of Zelenskyy's hands, which is why this is just such a complicated dynamic that Zelenskyy was walking into, and why it appears that he has not been able to move the needle here on Capitol Hill. So, we will see whether they can try to come in agreement on the border before the end of this week. There's growing doubts even among Lee negotiators that they're going to be able to get that done. So, at this point, Bianna, it looks like Congress is poised to leave for the holidays without passing critical aid to both Ukraine and Israel, essentially kicking this high-stakes debate into early next year.

You can see here trucks coming in from the Egyptian side to be inspected by the Israelis. Now, this will in effect double the amount of aid allowed into Gaza, but it does not necessarily mean that more aid will actually get into Gaza. Israel has been very strict about inspecting all of the aid that goes into the Gaza Strip. Until now, there has been only one inspection point. This is now the second one. Once these trucks are done being inspected, they will then go back out to Egypt and go up to the Rafah crossing, which is where all of the aid has been crossing into Gaza since this war began. But there is no guarantee that all the trucks can actually get in because of the bottleneck at the Rafah crossing. That crossing is not built for a huge number of trucks. And then we've seen a real catastrophe on the humanitarian level in the southern part of Gaza with hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced desperate for aid with no shelter, no food and the heavy fighting that has made aid distribution so difficult. A major question now is when will Israel allow aid to flow directly from Israel through this crossing into Gaza? For now, I'm told that is not on the table, that it is a decision that the Israeli government has to make and for now they have not approved that.

It needs a two-third majority to pass and it may well pass, but it doesn't mean it's going to come into effect. There's no enforcement. So, this really becomes a measure of trying to the U.N. General Assembly, if you will, trying to send an even stronger message to Israel. Back in October, there was a vote along broadly similar terms, but 121 voted for, 14 against, 44 abstentions. So, if the number of votes for this immediate ceasefire and immediate humanitarian access goes up, then that shows that the dial is shifting in pressure on Israel. Will it make a difference to Israel? Potentially not, but there's a real desperate effort on the way to try to find ways internationally now to signal to Israel that this cannot continue in Gaza. The high civilian casualty toll, the desperate and worsening humanitarian situation cannot continue and that's -- that is in essence what this vote will be about because it cannot enforce anything.

Wow. Well, after two days and a deadline that has come and gone, the COP28 Summit doesn't appear anywhere near wrapping up. Negotiators are scrambling to finalize a statement on the path to mitigating climate change, but they're amid bitter decisions continuing on how to move forward. CNN's Eleni Giokos spoke to a top leader with the World Wildlife Fund about the fossil fuel controversy surrounding the summit. Here's part of their conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
