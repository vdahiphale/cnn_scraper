So, here with me is Priscilla Alvarez, Vanessa Yurkevich, Ryan Young, and Kara Scannell. Great to have you, guys, tonight. Really looking forward to hearing about the stories that you are working on.So, the feud between Disney and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is heating up. Today, Disney launched a lawsuit against DeSantis and his handpicked oversight board after they voted to nullify Disney's special taxing district. Disney alleges -- quote -- \"a targeted campaign of government retaliation -- orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech -- now threatens Disney's business operations, jeopardizes its economic future in the region, and violates its constitutional rights.\" Vanessa Yurkevich is on this story. So, Vanessa, this is a plot twist because up until now, it has been DeSantis against Disney. But now, Disney is firing back. So, what happens next?",

But what we are seeing now is this fight playing out in real time. This all happened essentially in the same moment. You have this board appointed by DeSantis coming in to try to undo a lot of what Disney has done with the previous board and that at that same time, boom, you have this lawsuit dropped from Disney essentially saying, DeSantis, everything you're trying to do is completely unconstitutional and is completely politically-driven.

She could not pinpoint it any sooner than that, but she said she had gone to Bergdorf Goodman's New York department store after work, was leaving just as Donald Trump, who was then, you know, a fixture of the tabloids, 90s, New York City, was coming in. And she said, he said to her, hey, you are that advice columnist, and she said, hey, you're that real estate tycoon. He was like come with me, I need to get a gift for a friend. So, they look at handbags, they looked at hats. Then she said they took the escalator up to the sixth floor. That is where the lingerie was. She kept thinking, this is going to be a great story to tell my friends. Here, I run into Donald Trump and we are going shopping. But then she said, this is when things turned violent. That, you know, they were joking over a piece of lingerie. You try it on. No, you try it on. Then they ended up in the dressing room. This is when she -- her allegation is that Trump shoved here up against the wall, hard enough that her head hit the wall, he closed the doors, which automatically locked, he pulled down her tights and he raped her. And then she said, from there, she was able to get her knee up and pushed him off, left the department store, called a friend immediately. That friend is also going to testify. And then she also spoke to another friend. She was saying that the problem here for her was that she has not been able to have a romantic relationship since because she says it was the sense of flirting with someone and having it turned violent, and she has not been able to replicate that. She also said, then when Trump came out and denied this -- when she wrote her book and came public with the story, he denied it. He said she was a liar, that she made it up. She said she received nasty emails. She got fired from her job as a columnist at Elle. She is saying that these were the ramifications of this. Now, she's on the stand again tomorrow. She has a little bit more direct testimony from her lawyer. But then there is going to be cross- examination by Trump's team. And out of the gate, in opening statements, they said this never happened. Full stop. And they have said they are going to make their case through the plaintiff's witnesses. So, there has been a lot of time on cross examination of Carroll. They are going to try to poke holes in this. Where is the evidence? It's a he said, she said. There are no eyewitnesses --",

And this is what I think is really interesting. The judge has allowed two other women who are not friends with Carroll, did not know Carroll, but came forward in 2016 when some two dozen women have come forward with allegations of assault by Donald Trump. So, two women, a former reporter for People magazine who said that she went to interview Trump on the one- year anniversary of his marriage to Melania, and that he forcibly kissed her. And then another woman who said in '79, she was sitting in a first-class seat next to Trump and that he groped her. So, both of those women are allowed to come in. And the way that E. Jean Carroll's attorneys presented this in the opening statements is they said this was one man, this was one pattern, and three women that he, you know, in a semipublic place groped and grabbed them, assaulted them, and then when they went public about it, said they were too ugly for me to assault.
