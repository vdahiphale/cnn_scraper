But I think people might forget that one of the reasons why he declared, perhaps, a lot earlier than he planned to is he thought that this would dissuade the Justice Department from pursuing this investigation. He thought that this would make Merrick Garland, the attorney general, and everybody just kind of stand down. And that's not how it happened. He ended up getting a special counsel as a result.",

The first time we saw him, of course, was when he testified in the Senate after the report, after the Mueller report. So, I think they want to take it a lot different.

      "sentences": "I usually like to do a deep dive into a couple of false claims from a big speech like this, but former President Trump delivered just so many lies and wildly misleading claims about this indictment that I want to go through a whole bunch of them quickly because I think they're all important.So, Trump kept claiming that the Presidential Records Act said he has every right to keep these classified documents. He said they were his own documents. That is not only absolutely false. It is like upside down world. That act is clear and concise. You can go and read it online. The very purpose it was passed in the 70s was to make clear that all official documents from the presidency, classified or not classified, belong to the federal government the moment a president leaves office. Trump also claimed the Presidential Records Act says he was supposed to negotiate with the National Archives and Records Administration about what to return. Also, absolutely false. That act, again, says all official records belong to NARA. There is no provision for any negotiation. Trump claimed just about every other president has done what he did. Again, absolutely false. No president in the Presidential Records Act era has taken home troves of sensitive records and refused to give them back when NARA asked. He also claimed that the FBI or DOJ illegally released to the press a photo the FBI took where they laid out classified documents they had found at the Mar-a-Lago search. They didn't illegally release it to the press. They included it legally in an August 22 court filing. Trump claimed that Biden had him arrested. There is zero evidence. We know that Biden had anything to do with bringing these charges. They were brought by special counsel and approved by a Florida grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump mocked the use of the Espionage Act. He claimed it was not meant for this purpose. Also, again, falls. That law, despite its name, is not only meant for classic spying. There is a provision that specifically prohibits the willful retention of national defense information, usually classified documents, which is what trump and many people prior to trump have been charged with. Trump vaguely talked about Biden sending 1,850 boxes of documents to the University of Delaware. That is highly misleading. He did not mention those boxes are Biden's legally and properly donated papers from his years in the U.S. Senate or that critically, unlike presidents, senators own their offices' records and can do whatever they want with them. Trump claimed that Biden won't let anyone see these Delaware boxes. False once more. He has permitted to FBI searches at the university, as CNN's Paula Reid has reported, and the FBI found no initial sign of classified documents in them. Trump hinted conspiratorially about who topple the spilled box. We saw in that indictment document, insinuating to his supporters maybe the feds did it, maybe it was the FBI. That is nonsense. That photo was taken, per the indictment, by Trump aide, Walt Nauta, eight months before the FBI search. It cannot possibly have been the feds. And Abby, Trump even lied about something we could see with our own eyes. He said Jack Smith was trembling during his post-indictment speech. You can go watch that two and a half-minute address. Jack Smith absolutely was not trembling.",

As is laid out in the indictment, these documents are the roadmap to keeping our service members safe in the event of any sort of conflict.

I still think with January 6th on the way, when they are starting to look at January 6th, I think the classified documents debacle is awful. I still think when we look at what happened on January 6th, I think it is going to get worse.

And he was thriving, he seemed in good spirits, which is surprising given the day he had. But they are going to try to spin this into a win, as they usually do.
