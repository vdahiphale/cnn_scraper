Scuffles broke out in Parliament while the bill was debated. Now it goes to the president who says she will veto it. But Parliament can override her objection with a simple majority.

And it's about the remaining empower of concentrating resources. So that it's could prolong, its role beyond October elections.And then surely, it's also a sort of wider regional context in here. So, you could say that the decision by Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries to initiate those bills, targeting NGOs and sort of also targeting, in a way indirectly, perhaps, the relations with the collective West, also tells you a lot about the limits of the Western presence, Western influence in the South Caucasus or Central Asia.

Saskya Vandoorne, CNN, Paris. CHURCH: U.S. President Joe Biden is increasing tariffs on $18 billion of imports from China to counter what the White House calls unfair trade practices by Beijing. The new tariffs apply to a range of products like such as steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, battery components, solar cells, cranes, and medical products. Electric vehicles will see the biggest hike, going from about 27 percent to 100 percent. It is meant to challenge Beijing's practice of encouraging very low pricing by domestic EV makers, while charging a 40 percent tariff on U.S. car imports. Here's President Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Price is unfairly low because Chinese companies don't need to worry about a profit because the Chinese government subsidizes them, and subsidizes them heavily. And Chinese relies on other anti-competitive tactics as well. Like forcing American companies to transfer the technology in order to do business in China, sometimes they just outright steal through cyber- espionage and other means. And it has been well-documented and internationally recognized. When you make tactics like these, you are not competing. It is not competition; it is cheating. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it is worth noting that the $18 billion figure and the tripling, quadrupling of tariff rates may be very eye-catching. But in a bigger scheme of things, this is only some 4 percent of all of Chinese imports into the U.S.So, we may not likely to see immediate major impact on bilateral trade. The deeper concern from Beijing is whether other western economies, especially fellow G7 members would follows suit and impose something similar, and that may potentially have a bigger impact given, for example, the Chinese EV industry's much bigger footprint in the European market. Now, the G7 Summit, of course, is coming up in early June. So, a lot of interest in seeing what they do. But from the Chinese perspective, they are also not viewing these tariffs in a vacuum. They are -- they seem to be seeing a pattern ever since Biden met with Xi last November, adding more Chinese companies on the entity list, sanctioning them for their alleged ties with the Russian defense industrial base, and of course, more export controls targeting China, and now these tariffs. So, that is why there are some worries, this latest and move could jeopardize the just stabilized U.S.-China relationship, especially if Chinese leader Xi Jinping decides he doesn't want his country to be viewed as a punching bag by the U.S. Rosemary?",
