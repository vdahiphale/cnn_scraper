And in that interview, he stood by his pledge of mass deportation, suggesting that it would go beyond criminals, but not detailing who exactly he was referring to, but also saying that it is, quote, a very tough thing to do.Of course, there are limited resources for detention, deportation and challenges when it comes to repatriating some individuals back to their home countries. All of that lies ahead for the president-elect and his incoming administration. But he stood firm on the idea that they, quote, came in illegally. But he made an exception, or appeared to make an exception, for those undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. They're often referred to as DREAMers. And on them, the president- elect said that he would work with Congress to potentially provide protections. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECT: And we have to do something about the DREAMers, because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age, and many of these are middle-aged people now. They don't even speak the language of their country. I will work with the Democrats on a plan, and if we can come up with a plan. But the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the DREAMers.",

It smashed them, selling more than $2 billion in tickets. And last night, Swift told fans that her Eras tour had been performed before more than 10 million people.CNN Entertainment correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister has more on Swift's epic Eras tour. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Taylor Swift takes her final bow of the Eras tour in Vancouver, wrapping up 152 sold-out shows in 21 countries on five continents over a span of almost two years in front of 10 million screaming fans singing along to every lyric. While taking in the epic productions, shows lasting more than three hours, the pop superstar performed an impressive set list up to 44 songs each night. The Eras tour launched in March 2023 as the world was emerging from the COVID pandemic. When tickets first went on sale, Ticketmaster's site crashed. Taylor's estimated take? In the ballpark of $2 billion, easily the highest- grossing tour in music history. In fact, Swift already made history before the tour was even halfway over, when Eras became the first tour to ever cross the $1 billion mark. The tour covering her entire 18-year career, the set list representing the many hits from each era of her music repertoire. Swift's star power now right up there with Elvis Presley and the Beatles. And her personal connection to her fans, the Swifties, is unrivaled. They've made her Spotify's most streamed artist for two years running. They've even made the Earth shake. Swifties dancing to the beat of Swift's performance of Shake It Off during her tour stops in Seattle caused seismic activity, equivalent to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake. Swift's influence setting off shockwaves in politics too. Please register to vote for something else that's very important. Fans rushed to theaters for her Eras blockbuster movie in 2023. And to buy the Eras tour book when it was released last week, becoming the fastest-selling new book released of the past four years. A phenomenon coined the Taylor Swift effect boosted hundreds of industries, venues, and even local economies where her concerts were held. But Swift's Eras tour isn't just about the music. It's also about the unforgettable memories.",
