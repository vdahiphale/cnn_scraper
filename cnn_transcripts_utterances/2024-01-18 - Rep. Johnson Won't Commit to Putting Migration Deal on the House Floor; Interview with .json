I got a briefing from the attorney general's office last night, and essentially it looks at everything from A to Z, 1,400 pieces, individual -- 14,000 individual pieces of evidence, 280 plus interviews of people on the ground, family members and so on. I think that what we're going to see is everything that didn't happen and everything that was supposed to happen. There was tremendous error by state officials, by local officials on the ground. There was lapses in communication. There was failures of equipment. There was delays in getting equipment that they didn't need to begin with. There was miscommunication, post miscommunication by way of law enforcement. Even in interviews to the media, those inaccuracies and those misstatements caused confusion in the community. There was a lack of victims' coordination, if you will. Parents were told that their children were dead when they were indeed alive, and some were told that their children were alive when they were indeed dead. There was a tremendous folly of errors that occurred on that day and on the days and weeks and months thereafter, things that I've seen and known about and talked about, but now finally we're getting some transparency and some light here so that people can see what happened.",

These children die just like we tell them to, they shut the lights, close the door, they huddled in the corner, and in the end in that second classroom, you see two stacks of kids, two teachers trying to shield their children, one dead, one barely living. The second teacher died in a parking lot because the cops had surrounded all the arterial streets and the ambulance couldn't get to the hospital. We have to look at these tragedies and understand they don't happen in a vacuum and understand that things happen and cops make bad decisions, and sometimes cops are just plain cowardly. I've seen all of the videos. I've seen even the audio statements where cops are saying there's an AR-15 in there. There's an AR-15.

Mike Johnson is on an island in that room. He is the only one who is kind of saying in his mind what the far-right in his party, the hard-liners, how they're going to respond to this bill. And so, I think the issue that he finds himself in and where we may see the pressure really amp up on him in the coming days is the Senate is signaling that they are preparing to move on their immigration bill, and maybe we don't know exactly what's in it, but there are broad outlines that have pretty much stayed the same. And so the question is, what does he do? He has not committed to putting it on the floor, but I do think it puts them in the issue of, you know, they are taking trips to the border, they are doing all of this.

SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Phil, our job first is to make sure that the government doesn't shut down. With a series of votes today, we will send to the House a continuing resolution to keep the government open. It is my hope the House will do the same. The next job we have in front of us is to finalize this border security deal, which is very close to being done and to pass the supplemental that President Biden requested months ago. Phil, every conversation, every meeting I was in in Europe, the first question was, will the United States continue to partner with 50 other countries who, in combination, are providing the funding, the support for Ukraine?

John Boehner, obviously, a very different speaker of the House even Mike Johnson, ideologically.I do want to ask on other foreign policy issues, because there is a lot going on right now. The fourth U.S. strikes in Yemen targeting Houthi rebels. The biggest question that I have given, one, the reticence of the administration to take this action until just a couple of weeks ago or a week ago is -- what is the end game here?",

It is Iran that most needs to be deterred. President Biden and his team took a disciplined, thoughtful approach to these Houthi attacks of drones and missiles on ships. They went to the UN Security Council and got a resolution. They got 11 other countries to sign up to share the burden of the naval interception. They warned the Houthis. They took modest initial actions, then they took more aggressive strikes. In the last two strikes, we've been hitting -- our forces have been hitting Houthi launchers as they are about to strike ships. So my hope is that we will find a way to deter Iran, but for the intermediate term, it is going to require more action to prevent the Houthis from striking shipping. A huge percentage of global commerce goes through the Red Sea.",
