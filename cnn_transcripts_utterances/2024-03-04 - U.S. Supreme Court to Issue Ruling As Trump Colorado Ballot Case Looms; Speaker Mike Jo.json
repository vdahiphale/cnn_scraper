The Supreme Court expected to hand down at least one opinion today, it could impact Donald Trump's bid for a second term in the White House.And House Speaker Mike Johnson squeezed. Can he get a spending bill passed and stave off a government shutdown again this week without backlash from conservatives? And here's a win for Nikki Haley, Donald Trump's last remaining rival for the Republican nomination picked up her first primary win, first for a woman in a Republican primary. All right, look at that. A live look at the U.S. Supreme Court at 05:00 a.m. here in Washington could see critical news coming out of there today. Good morning, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's great to have you with us on this Monday morning on what is going to be an incredibly significant week here in Washington with Super Tuesday and then the State of the Union on Thursday. And overnight, Nikki Haley had her first primary win right here in the District of Columbia. She did become the first woman to win a Republican primary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What's with the smoke here? Colorado, one of the 15 states set to vote on Super Tuesday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided not to send a delegation.An Israeli official tells CNN, it's because Hamas has not responded to two Israeli demands. They want a list of hostages specifying which ones are alive and which ones are dead, and confirming the ratio of Palestinian prisoners, Israel must release in exchange for hostages. CNN's Max Foster joins us live from London. Now, Max, good morning, always good to see you. I mean, what do you make of Israel's explanation here at why are they basically bailing on these talks? Are they looking for a reason? I mean, what's going on? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's interesting, isn't it? You know, without sitting in the room, you know exactly how these conversations play out, and why they decided not to go. We have to sort of look at the reasons that they're giving, and is this list of hostages -- they want a list of hostages, they're not getting it. So, therefore, they're not going to the talks. Also talking there about the Palestinian prisoners. On the other side of it, you've got people suggesting that Hamas cannot give this list, because they don't know where all the hostages are, not even whether they're all alive or dead, because different groups may be involved, but also just communicating across this absolutely devastated landscape. They're struggling to put the list together. But again, Israel pointed out that not even communicating right now, but that might be for similar reasons. So, some of the key Hamas players aren't communicating at the moment. So, it's became -- it's become this sort of crunch point. There has been a suggestion that Hamas wants to push it into Ramadan, which would work in their favor or push this deal further down the line. We just don't know the point -- this point, but it is of course, very negative that Israel isn't part of these talks because it means a deal just isn't lightly.",

But you know, what happened on October the 7th is perhaps drifting backwards in people's memories, and we're seeing what's happening in Gaza right now and debates about what's proportional, what isn't proportional.
