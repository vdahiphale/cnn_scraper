The Dignity Act, which is sponsored by Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida, has been one that we've spoken about. And we're open to a constructive discussion about dreamers, farm workers, family reunification. These are issues that I think are important to the American people. And that poll very well.

So, they're really trying to get a handle on maybe in the states that haven't found this yet, does this exist?This is going to start rolling out December 16th. And what it will require is nationwide testing of unpasteurized milk. So, raw milk, before it's gone into pasteurization. This isn't just milk that's intended to be sold raw. We have also heard about some H5N1 found in raw milk samples in California, for example. But this is a nationwide testing strategy for milk that is unpasteurized, that is going into the pasteurization process. The goal, according to the agriculture secretary, is really to put the U.S. on a path to stopping and being able to control H5N1 in dairy cattle. As we've seen, 15 states at least have detected H5N1 in dairy cattle herds. So, this is something that, you know, we call this bird flu, but this year, of course, has really been found widespread through dairy cattle in multiple states, John.",

And the judge eventually ended up approving that motion to dismiss. Now, they are looking at this second charge, the lesser of the two, criminally negligent homicide. Now, just because one is gone doesn't mean that the second charge is necessarily any easier on this jury. And they have a lot of evidence that they need to go through. So far, they've shown that they are engaged and they have been looking at the evidence and the testimony that was presented here throughout the past six weeks.

They said that they should not be dropping charges and just asking the jury to move on to the next one, because it is, in their words, coercive.So, they are certainly setting up the path for a potential appeal down the line. But there's no question that they were relieved on Friday when their client, in the span of a day, went from facing a maximum of 15 years in prison, had he been convicted on the first charge, to now just four years in prison if he is convicted of this second charge.

Just 1 percent say it should be Trump's top priority. So, in a word, it's a terrible, terrible idea - I guess that's two words and the idea is a third word in there - for Trump to pardon the January 6th protesters. Even among Republicans, it's only a slight majority, of course usually Trump gets, you know, 80, 90 percent among Republicans.

And the vast majority of voters believed that he would. Eighty-one percent said that he would try and pardon most of them. Just 19 percent said, no, he would not. And, of course, this 81 percent includes folks who are opposed - who are opposed to the idea of pardoning - pardoning those January 6th protesters, yet they still voted for Donald Trump. I think what's going on here, John, is pretty simple, which is, folks knew he was going to do it, and they just really didn't care all that much. Yes, they were opposed, but it was low down on the sort of list of important issues for them. There were issues that were more important. The economy, for instance, was more important. The idea essentially, you know, that Joe Biden's approval rating was only about 40 percent. Most voters thought the country was going in the wrong direction. So, they were willing to look past some of the actions that they thought that Donald Trump would do in office. Actions that they didn't like for the things that they thought that he would do that they would like.
