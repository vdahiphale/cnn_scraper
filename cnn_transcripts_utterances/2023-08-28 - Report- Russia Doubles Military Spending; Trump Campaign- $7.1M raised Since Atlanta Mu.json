But the -- to your point that the central question remains, and even those who had a -- had a good night, had some strong lines, you know, got another look. You know, the polling still is makes it abundantly clear that, you know, former president Trump is the dominant candidate in the race. He continues to clearly lead in all the polls. And it's not clear that one debate really changed any of that. So for these candidates, some of it is staying alive, right? So fundraising attention boosts help, and they're looking for additional opportunities. But we saw Trump really quickly grab attention again and raised a ton of money himself.

Things you've said before come up more and draw more scrutiny. And so he's certainly getting more attention interviews. People are asking more questions about past comments in his books or past comments on the campaign trail, that is likely to continue. And he certainly in the debate didn't shy away from trying to be provocative, trying to make, you know, through attention grabbing statements, so that's likely to continue. But Vivek faces the same problem, I think, that we are talking about, which is, he is really trying to present himself as a Trump-like candidate while still praising former president Trump. And like many of the candidates are saying he would support him if he were the nominee, even if you were convicted of a crime. So it's not really clear how much you can grow your support if you are not going to criticize or take on the former president in any way.",

It's quite an involved process.But what that means is that it's really thrown all of Spanish football into turmoil. We've seen resignations on mass, the Spanish football -- women's football team in a soccer team is refusing to play until Rubiales is either removed or resigns. And so it's really having repercussions, not just at a national level, but an international level too. And so this is probably why they're having the emergency meeting. I have to say that until now, the Royal Football Federation here in Spain has been aggressively defending Rubiales. They put out a statement, for example, after his adamant refusal to resign, saying that Hermoso had lied. They quickly took that down from social media, but they were adamant that he has done nothing wrong. In the meantime, Hermoso has put out a lengthy statement saying that she felt the victim of this sort of aggression. This macho aggression that she feels is still prevalent in parts of Spain here. So this has become a real turning point for Spain, and for Spanish football. So we'll have to see what happens at this meeting today.",
