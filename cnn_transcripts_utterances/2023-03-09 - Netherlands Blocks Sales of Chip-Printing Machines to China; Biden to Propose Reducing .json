Russia launching its largest wave of rocket strikes against Ukraine in weeks. At least 11 people have lost their lives many more injured, key infrastructures were targeted too. All of this as the fate of the city and Bakhmut continues to hang in the balance. We will be live for you in Kyiv with the latest and the physical scars from war are clear for all to see. But what about the mental and the psychological scars inflicted on both soldiers and civilians over the past year? Well, now someone's trying to do something to help. A new National Mental Health Center has opened in Lviv. It provides support to those who are suffering from conditions like PTSD, for example. It's the brainchild of Andy Kurtzig; CEO of U.S. based tech startup, just answer. He has workers in Ukraine. He's been on the show before, and he's been providing all sorts of support since the wall began. He'll join us later on in the show to discuss the launch of this facility. In the meantime, back here in the United States, Wall Street set for a pretty flat open as you can see there. Europe softer on continued uncertainty over the direction of global interest rates or the degree at least rather than the direction. Fed Chair Jay Powell, saying in congressional testimony on Wednesday that the jury's still out on the size even of the next Federal Reserve rate hike. Well, tomorrow's U.S. jobs report will certainly provide some answers. Until then I think we can expect choppy and some uncertainty risk averse, let's call it that trading action. And brand new evidence that Americans are increasingly feeling stretched by continued high prices. Cities CFOs saying more consumers are struggling to pay their credit card debt. Unpaid balances are rising. City also expecting loan losses to increase plenty more on all of that coming up on the show but first a new player entering the global chip was. Europe's biggest producer of advanced chip making technology has joined the United States. And its ongoing standoff with China, the Netherlands says it will block the export of advanced chip printing machines, Beijing voicing its opposition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, China wasn't mentioned either, frankly. But of course, it's no stretch to imagine that this will impactsales of chip, manufacturing and machinery and technology to that market. Given the background, we've already had similar measures from the U.S., and ASML, which isn't just sort of the leading chip maker in the Netherlands. But also Europe is the biggest tech company, in fact, in Europe, and it makes the machines that are critical to making semiconductors, and actually is the lithography so the printing of transistors onto silicon bases. What was interesting, I thought was actually the response that we had from ASML, who said that they don't have all the details that they would like in terms of what the trade ministry is suggesting here. But they expect these measures, they say, not to have a material impact on their financial outlook for 2023. Or for their longer term scenarios, which is interesting, because they have sold some $8 billion worth of advanced machinery to China, one of their biggest customers, for instance, is Samsung, and they make a lot of chips in China in that market. So then you wonder well, is that because the restrictions being introduced here aren't as big, perhaps as many would have thought ASML believes that will only impact their second most advanced chip machinery, they already don't sell their most advanced to China. So then you wonder, well, how big an impact will this really have? Does this restriction have teeth? Well, looking at that response from China, it feels like it does. But perhaps that's more to do with the growing alliance of countries taking this strategy than just this response from the Netherlands.",

That's according to a Senior U.S. Official Lloyd Austin schedule was impacted to buy protests over the Israeli government's plan to overhaul the judicial system with demonstrators blocking a main road to the airport on a so called day of disruption. Hadas Gold is in Tel Aviv. Hadas, I believe the meeting as well was repositioned due to some of those protests too.

      "sentences": "Yes, the Pentagon saying that the Israelis eventually asked the U.S. Defense Secretary to move his meetingsback and change the location so because of this day of disruption that was planned, why protesters who are not protesting the Defense Secretary. They're protesting the Benjamin Netanyahu government's plan to massive judicial overhaul that would essentially allow the politicians in the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. But because of those protests, which for the first time also took place at Israel's main airport, I've been growing airport just outside of Tel Aviv. His meetings were essentially all done at a complex just off of the airport. He's actually as we speak, wrapping up a meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But that road along the airport, we were there earlier today. Protesters were essentially just driving their cars incredibly slowly, and honking their horns waving flags, essentially causing passengers to have to get out of their own cars or their taxis and drag their suitcases by foot up into the terminal. Some of the people there included former fighter jet pilots who said that they essentially wouldn't serve for a government that they believed did not uphold democracy. And that's what they believe these judicial reforms would do. Whereas Benjamin Netanyahu and his government thinks these are just reforms are necessary to rebounds the government. We are now in Tel Aviv or earlier today, protesters also completely blocked the main highway in Tel Aviv, Ayalon highway, we saw thousands of protesters on this main highway. It's a six lane highway on both sides. They were eventually moved off by both mounted and border police who essentially squeezed them off of the highway. But of course, for the U.S. Defense Secretary, most of his concentration during his meetings is about what's been happening in the West Bank in recent weeks. As you've noted, the levels of violence that we've been seeing, just overnight, we've had three more Palestinian suspected militants killed by Israeli forces and his message to the Israelis essentially saying all of this that's been happening in the West Bank, the increased levels of violence that is a distraction from what really matters. And what really matters are Iran and the strategic threat posed by Iran essentially trying to tell the Israelis, we need to really work on common situation in the West Bank. So they can focus on what is a bigger threat to Israel and to the region. But we should be hearing from the Defense Secretary at a Press Conference in the coming probably few minutes, half an hour perhaps. Hopefully, we'll hear more about exactly what they discussed there, Julia.",

And it's tough to intercept those missiles and especially early on in the war, they had an old Soviet era system to try to intercept these missiles. And they were just missing with their old antiquated technologies. And so several groups, including us got together and funded new computers, new software, and new networking gear. And were able to upgrade all those computers just to computer systems alone on that old system, in order to make them just much faster and since then, they've been able to intercept 40 percent more missiles. So 40 percent more successful at intercepting those missiles, just from doing IT related stuff.

Check out this clip from the U.S. series Breaking Bad in Japanese. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Artificial intelligence can now make lip sync issues a thing of the past by manipulating an actor's mouth and facial expressions to actually match those re-recorded words. Not only can that it also be used to scrub bad language from the screen as well. This is the trailer of the lions gate release of a movie called \"Fall\" that was released last year. The act has dropped one or two swear words, but the distributor wanted a PG-13 release. So artificial intelligence was used to change the actor's lips to match a recorded and watered down audio track and also add foreign language versions. Just watch this and you'll see what I mean the first version has bleeped those profanities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

SCOTT MANN, CO FOUNDER AND CO-CEO OF FLAWLESS: Well, for me, I think having directed films and seeing well being part of the experience of the care we take when we direct to make movies as a film community as a whole, really like not just the director, but the actors, everyone who's involved in that. It's a very delicate process. And I think, really what sent me on this journey was seeing my own film, from haste with Robert De Niro and Jeopardy Morgan that made I saw it dubbed in a foreign language. And that's when I realized how bad dubbing really is. In that, dubbing a world that the only process that we really had for the last hundred years, it changes the script, it changes the performance, it loses the immersion and it's very much very damaging to the film experience really.",

So it's really taking what would have seen in an English speaking country has had a limit of, say, 400 million potential audience members, you're widening it out to the full, like close to a billion population of the earth. And so I think it's changing the landscape of film distribution. And I think that inherently will change the where eyes director would go about telling a story, because I'd be more aware of different cultures and diversities that you're making a film for.

I just wondered in terms of what you're seeing today versus how quickly you think that perhaps this could save time even not bringing the actor's back to rerecord things.
