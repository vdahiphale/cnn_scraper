However, based on Georgia's law, she was unable to get that care. And I want to be clear, this was a highly desired pregnancy. Em (sp?) had told me that she had gone through IVF. This was their final embryo. This was a very desired pregnancy. And before the law we would have been able to provide care for her and her husband and her family. After the law, there was a lot more confusion. She had broken her water. This was not a pregnancy that could continue to term and result in a baby. But we had to ask those same questions. Do we have to wait for her to get sick, to develop an infection in her uterus or to start bleeding, or for that pregnancy to no longer have cardiac activity?And as you know, all of that is going on. And we're trying to figure out how sick does she have to get that delays care, right? And that's a really difficult situation for patients and families to be in, for doctors to be in. We want to take care of our patients. We want to intervene. We want to do what's best for them, what they are asking for our patients or the experts on their lives, right? And they know we provide medical evidence. They let us know what the best course of action is for this patient, the dilation and evacuation was what she needed, and we were unable to do that. And she was put in this situation.

Doctors shouldn't be afraid to care for patients because, again, this law that has nothing to do with medicine or science. I think getting out to vote is important. You know, I think that this law is very dangerous. It's got to go. And, you know, I also think that doctors and patients can both continue to advocate for themselves, for doctors being able to provide the maximum amount of care that we can under these really terrible laws and for patients to know, to try to advocate as best they 4can for that maximum level of care.

Unlikely that we would have a result. But now, it becomes even more unlikely because hand counting is a slower process, right?And so obviously there are politics behind this decision, right, because this is tied to Donald Trump's election lies in 2020.

Republicans tend to vote greater numbers in-person on Election Day.So you could imagine, if you have to hand-count the in-person on Election Day, some of those republican votes, it'll take a little while to get counted.
