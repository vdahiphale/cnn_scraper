The Israel Defense Forces says Hezbollah fired approximately 190 projectiles from Lebanon into Israel.Video from Tel Aviv shows Israeli interceptors taking out some of those rockets. The IDF says others fell into open areas. Now the Israeli Air Force reports it struck more than 120 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon within an hour on Monday. The IDF says the extensive strikes were aimed at degrading the Iran-backed militant group's capabilities. Now one explosion lit up the Beirut night sky late Monday. You can see it there. The IDF warned residents it was planning to target two suburbs about 30 minutes earlier. And video from Israeli strikes on Gaza is especially disturbing. Palestinian officials report at least 10 people were killed in the Jabalya Refugee Camp. At least 11 more were killed in strikes elsewhere in northern and central Gaza. The fighting came on the one-year anniversary the October 7th Hamas terror attacks on Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marked the occasion with this stark warning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): In every meeting between me and my wife, with our fighters, with our wounded, with the bereaved families, we hear the same message again and again.

Does that single fact to you tell you that we're looking at a much wider and longer war, without a doubt in the year to come? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think so, Paula. I think what you're looking at is a lot of conflict coming up in the next few months and possibly extending into the entire year. And that's, you know, really sad. The reality for the Middle East, too. But the Israelis of course are bent on trying to break out of basically what amounts to a containment operation that Iran and its proxies have mounted against it. And by the same token, the proxies as well as Iran are trying to keep that containment ring focused on Israel and allow it to reestablish itself. That's really part of the problem. Both sides are very intransigent at this particular point in time. They are set in their particular polls and for each side it's an existential issue.",

And the Israelis of course have a vested interest in maintaining not only their momentum operationally, but also in securing their borders as well as the longevity of the Israeli state.And so they have that perspective, whereas from the U.S. perspective, they are trying to contain the possibility of a wider Middle East conflict. And they want to make sure that something like that does not happen, or if it does happen that it is somehow really contained within the borders of the Middle East. And that's really the issue.

They're talking about seven, in some cases even an eight-front war, depending on who you talk to. But the key problem is this. That's well and good from a rhetorical standpoint. But it's very hard for a nation to continually be fighting a war on multiple fronts.The Israelis have done it in the past all the way back to 1948 when Israel gained its independence. But the problem that they have now is those particular wars, we're talking 1948 or 1967 or 1973, those are fairly short duration and they were against comparable state actors. In this particular case, you're dealing with one-state actor, Iran, but you're also dealing with non-state actors such as Hamas and Hezbollah that have a para-state type apparatus associated with them and a paramilitary associated with them, but it's a very different entity and it's an entity that's very hard to fight because it's really ideologically based more than anything else.

The surge will be coming. The wind will be coming. Notice this large area here of major hurricane winds. This is 110 or greater and then hurricane winds all the way off the coast of Florida. So all the way through the most populated areas of Florida there will be so many power outages for so very long. The other big problem is going to be storm surge. So 10 to 15 feet. And this number could actually still rise depending on where you are. There could be places that could pick up 18 feet of surge. With a storm Katrina, that was a cat five and it went down to a cat three, still had 26 feet of surge in Bay St. Louis. It really is going to depend on where you are in landfall. And we still don't know where landfall is exactly going to be. But this was Helene. Helene did devastation to parts of Tampa Bay area, and that was only a six-foot surge, a seven-foot surge. On up here into Cedar Key, a nine-foot surge. We're talking 10 to 15. Now for the first time in 103 years, another major landfall will happen around Tampa Bay. But think about what Tampa looked like 103 years ago. How many millions less people were involved? Probably 95 percent less population at that point in time. So we have a lot of people in the way. The track is still getting I guess focused here over that area. Nothing related to the south, nothing turning to the left right now, and it's still about 36 to 48 hours away from what we would call considerable landfall when it would actually make landfall over the Florida peninsula. If it makes it farther to the south, it'll be quicker, farther to the north and has farther to go. So that landfall could change plus or minus a couple of hours. But we could see some spots with 10 inches of rainfall, flooding rainfall from this, its freshwater flooding. Not even with the saltwater flooding that will be pushed in from all of that win. We started off with Alberto and now were at Milton, another category five in the books, we hope that it does taper off to be that category three. That's always a question.

Governor Brian Kemp issued a statement in response to the judge's decision saying, quote, \"Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge. Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.\" Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is back to work.
