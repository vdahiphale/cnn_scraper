The fighter jets were called in, in coordination with the FAA, to try to intercept this aircraft where the pilot was not making contact with the F-16 fighter jets. Ultimately, the plane did crash in southwestern Virginia. However, the Defense Department says that the F-16s it did not actually shoot down that aircraft. Now, according to NORAD, which released a statement Sunday, that aircraft did fly over Washington, D.C., essentially violating the airspace. And because the pilot was unresponsive, the FAA worked with the Pentagon in order to try to intercept this aircraft before it could potentially crash and cause any damage to civilians on the ground. The civilian aircraft, according to NORAD, was intercepted at approximately 3:20 p.m. Eastern time. And according to the Pentagon, the plane crashed near the George Washington National Forest in Virginia. There were four people on board this small aircraft. However, we do not yet know the conditions of those people at this time. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So clearly, a way to sort of project his authority in the face of what we know to be a considerable amount of infighting within the Russian troops. But the Ukrainian haven't commented officially on it. We haven't been able to verify it. The one thing we have from the Ukrainian side this morning, is a warning from the communications director of the Armed Forces that Russia, they say, will be stepping up information, psychological operations or are planning to.

At least 275 people killed, more than 1,000 people wounded, and the authorities say at least 100 of those survivors are in need of critical care. The disaster zone runs as far as the eye can see here, with railroad cars scattered on the side of the road. And hundreds of workers here in just brutal heat and humidity, with heavy equipment, and also doing a lot of the work here by hand, with picks and shovels, trying to reopen the road. As you can see here, more of the railroad cars in this -- in this terrible accident. The Indian prime minister came to share condolences with the families of victims, with the survivors, to call for an investigation. The cause has been identified as a change in the electronic interlocking here. And there have been vows from top government officials to bring to justice anybody who's responsible for this accident. But it highlights both the importance of the railroad for India. More than 13 million people a day move along on trains in India. But also, a tragic history of accidents with more than 16,000 people killed, according to government statistics in 2021 alone, in railroad accidents. The authorities insist that this stretch of railroad will be reopened and operational again by Wednesday morning. Bigger -- a bigger question would be how to make the trains in this country and its aging infrastructure safer for future use. Ivan Watson, CNN, in Odisha state in Eastern India. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
