You could see some early morning lightning strikes not too far from Oklahoma City. We've been watching some of them near Omaha. The snow starting to build over the Dakotas. But what's going to happen as we go through the day todays is the atmosphere is going to juice up and fuel up with a lot of humidity. We're looking at temperatures about five to ten degrees above average in the 70s and even some 80s, 80s for Jackson, Dallas, 79 degrees, some low and middle 70s across Springfield. This will also come with dew points that will be pretty buoyant and pretty moist and humid in the middle 60s. That's going to let all that air rise, let the severe storms grow, and some of them will spin. Here's a look at that risk from St. Louis to Springfield, back down into Dallas, where we're looking at damaging winds up to 70 miles per hour, tennis ball size hail and a couple of tornadoes, some of which we are afraid could be on the strong side, EF-2 strength or greater from St. Louis back down towards Springfield and Oklahoma City. So, we'll have to watch this very closely today and again tomorrow. The risk pivots to the east of the Ohio Valley, from Lexington down towards Nashville as we go through Tuesday for the same threats. So, something that we'll have to watch closely. And you can see the storms really blowing up here across Missouri as we go into the afternoon and evening, blowing up again tomorrow from Ohio down into Tennessee. Also notice some of the cold air starting to clash for some of that snow up in the Great Lakes and then going into interior New England later in the week. All of this could come with some flooding rains as well. We have a two-day risk for excessive rain. So, like I mentioned, multiple hazards as we go through the next couple of days. Sara.",
