That is before testimony resumes. The first witness who will be there is David Pecker. He was on the stand briefly yesterday. He will get right back on that stand at 11But first, very shortly, we could see Donald Trump walk through these halls, enter the courtroom, and then a hearing to determine if he has violated a gag order over the last several days with all kinds of posts on social media that have at least directly or obliquely mentioned witnesses in this case. Let's go right outside the courthouse now. CNN's Brynn Gingras standing by. Brynn, what do we expect to see?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John, let's first just remind viewers of what that gag order is. It was put in place against Donald Trump at the end of March. Essentially the judge said to Trump, you cannot post, you cannot talk disparagingly about the jury in this case, witnesses, court staff, and their family members. And since that was put in place, the prosecution has said that he has violated that at least 10 times, and they're asking the judge to fine Trump a thousand dollars for each of those fines.They also would like the judge to remind Donald Trump, listen, you're the criminal defendant in this case, and he should be treated as such, essentially saying that like all criminal defendants, he's subject to court supervision. So what we'll be looking out to see is, will the judge fine him? Will he threaten him possibly going to jail for violating this gag order? Of course, it's no secret in his civil trial that happened last year, Donald Trump was fined thousands of dollars for violating the gag order against him for that trial more than once. So certainly, we are looking out to see how the judge handles this. Trump and his defense has said, listen, I have people like a main witness in this case, Michael Cohen, lashing out at me. I have to be a both to defend myself. So we expect that argument to be said in court today. That gag hearing kicks off when court kicks off at 9:30.

Whether or not that actually is something the deters Trump from continuing could be another problem and challenge for Judge Merchan in the future, but also Trump is not just talking about the judge's daughter or about the lead prosecutor here who is making that opening statement yesterday. He's also now talking about the jury, which is also forbidden by this gag order. And he was in an interview last night, John, and I just want you to listen to what he had to say about the jury. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That jury was picked so fast, 95 percent Democrats, the areas is mostly all Democrat. You think of it as just a purely Democrat area.

You want to protect the prosecutor's family members, but the fact is, when it comes to the jury, if they have a critical mass of jurors who eventually just don't feel safe and are being targeted, there could potentially be a mistrial.If you get to fewer than 12 jurors, the defense would need to agree to do it with 11, which obviously they're not going to do.

And that's why we go back to this 2015 meeting where he agreed to be Trump's eyes and ears. Let him know what he was hearing. And eventually after he suppressed two negative stories at through the \"National Enquirer\" for Trump, he gets wind of the fact that Stormy Daniels wants to sell her story. Her price is too steep. So he passes the information along to Michael Cohen. So not only is he significant for laying out sort of the groundwork for this hush money payment, he's also going to establish that this was a pattern. And why were they doing this? Was it just because he was a friend? Was it just because he really admired Trump? No, it was not just that. It was to help him get elected. And that is the crux of the prosecution's case. So David Pecker quite the character. I've got a couple giggles on the stand yesterday as they were talking about his time with the \"National Enquirer,\" but he is key to framing the prosecution's case as their first witness.",

What it says is that Donald Trump cannot make public comments about really three groups of people, jurors, likely witnesses, and staff members, and their family, court and prosecutorial staff members and their family members. So the gag order actually allows Donald Trump to criticize loudly if he wants the judge, the D.A., and the indictment itself.As to your question about whether he's come close to the line, I think he's way over the line. For example, Donald Trump posted publicly he called Michael Cohen a, quote, \"sleazebag,\" a, quote, \"serial perjurer.\" I mean, that is obviously negative public commentary about a witness.

On one hand, the judge can of course reprimand Donald Trump, as Nick said, any ordinary litigant would be quite impacted by that. You don't want to tick off the guy who's going to run the trial, who's going to decide what evidence goes in, who's ultimately going to sentence you if you're convicted.The other options Donald Trump has, excuse me, the judge has is he can impose a fine. However, under New York law cited by the D.A. the judge can only fine Donald Trump $1,000 per incident. So at this point, they're asking for a $10,000 fine. I don't know how much of a deterrent effect that's going to have on Donald Trump. And then there's the third option which is the judge does have the power technically to imprison any defendant who violates a contempt order for up to 30 days. Now, I do not think that's realistically in play today or in the longer haul, but I do think the judge is going to mention that and potentially threatened Donald Trump with that. The D.A.'s office mentions it in a sort of threatening manner in their brief, even if they do stop short of explicitly asking for it. But it's a tricky question. What do you do if you're the judge when the party does not really care about the financial penalty and the party seems to have calculated probably correctly that the judge is really unlikely to actually imprison him.",

He's no friend of -- he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do. He went to take like a middle ground and oftentimes that doesn't work, but it's certainly not working here. But what he's done to Israel is abandon them and he's trying to be as nice as he can to the other side, call it the Arab world, but that's not worked either because they get him and he's an incompetent man.
