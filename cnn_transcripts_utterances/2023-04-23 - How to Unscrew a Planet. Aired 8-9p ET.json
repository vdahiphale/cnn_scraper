More than a trillion tons of carbon gas has been released into our seas and skies over time. It comes from a lot of different sources, but the biggest is burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation. But tonight, CNN's chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir, has found some reasons to hope some unique ways innovators are trying to capture, contain and reduce carbon emissions. They are climate warriors, and they just may show us \"How to Unscrew a Planet.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEIR (voice-over): Attention humans of earth. (On-camera): I've got good news and bad news.
