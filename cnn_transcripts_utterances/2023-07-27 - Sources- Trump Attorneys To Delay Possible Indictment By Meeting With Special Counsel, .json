We want to bring you up to speed on where things stand at this minute in Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Donald Trump. The grand jury has been meeting over the last several hours.This is the grand jury that would vote on an indictment. In order to have an indictment, they need to meet. They are meeting so we're watching that very closely. While that's going on, we have learned over the last several minutes that Donald Trump's lawyers sought a meeting with Jack Smith's office. They got that meeting, and they have been meeting behind closed doors. So, there is a lot at stake here. And there could be some moves that are imminent. Let's get right to CNN's Evan Perez. And, Evan, you've got new information on what the Trump team was hoping to get out of these meetings that we think are happening at this minute.",

It is possible that the meeting has recently -- has just wrapped. Again, we're trying to verify whether the meeting has concluded.But the purpose of this meeting, the way -- the reason the Trump team was looking for this meeting was to kind of make a really a Hail Mary pass here to try to persuade the special counsel that now is not the time to do an indictment. They were hoping to buy at least a few more weeks. If they don't get an indictment today, then they're hoping that at least a few more weeks they can get between now and when an indictment comes. Now, the former president has a legal strategy and a political strategy. They're kind of one and the same, right, which is delay, delay, delay. They want to push this off as long as they can because it brings it closer to the time that you know the primary voters -- the Republican primary voters are beginning -- are going to begin to have their say. We have, of course, the first debate coming just within the next month. And so, they know that the Justice Department is up against the clock here. That it puts the Justice Department in a position whereby they're prosecuting President Biden's chief rival at a time when the voters are beginning to have their say. So, the strategy here was to ask the special counsel to consider a few more things before making a decision on an indictment. It is possible, however, today that this grand jury will vote. They are there. They took an early lunch, according to our Casey Gannon, who sits there at the courthouse and watches their every move. So again, we are watching and trying to determine what might happen today in the next few hours. Certainly, though, the big -- the big item today was that meeting that happened with the special counsel team, the Trump team asking for it and receiving it. And really trying to make their case that there should not be an indictment, at least not today, John.",

It's a civil rights case and a conspiracy to obstruct the government case. All of those things are relatively straightforward. You're just proving that they happened or didn't happen.

And this is coming just a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to their highest level in 22 years.Federal Reserve and Economy Reporter for the New York Times Jeanna Smialek joins us now. Jeanna, great to have you. I want to talk about the Fed in just a moment but first, this GDP report. Yet another report that surprised to the upside for people at home. What does this mean for the recession fears that just a few months ago felt inevitable? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE &amp; ECONOMY REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yes. It's wild because a couple of months ago you would call people and they would tell you that we were already in a recession. And I think that this is just further evidence that that definitely wasn't true. You know, we have been seeing pretty consistently strong growth, you know, a real acceleration in some measures and a real sort of resilience and others. We're seeing consumers continue to spend. We're seeing businesses start to invest again. And all of that is really sort of contributing to what is a pretty strong growth rate.",
