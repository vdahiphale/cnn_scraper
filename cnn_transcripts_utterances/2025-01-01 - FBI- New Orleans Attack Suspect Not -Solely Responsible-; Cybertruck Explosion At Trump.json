Well, we learned from law enforcement and from officials here that those barricades were not working at the time of this attack. They were instead being repaired ahead of the Super Bowl in February. Instead, the police department said that they had put in place police vehicles and other types of barriers to sort of try and prevent any type of vehicle from coming in. Well, they said this person went around those barriers on the sidewalk and eventually, as we know, plowed into these people.

And what we know at this point, Phil, is that they have the FBI has recovered video -- surveillance video that appears to show three -- three men and one woman appearing to help put IEDs, what are believed to be IEDs, at locations in the French Quarter.Now, we heard from the FBI there that there were additional potential explosives that were found during a search later this morning, and they were rendered safe during the day today. And so, the surveillance video appears to show those people either helping to put those devices there or being close by. Again, that's part of this investigation. Now, to find those people, to ask them whether they were involved in some way, did they help build the explosives or were they just, you know, perhaps standing by? All of those things are on the table for the FBI. The other thing that's very key to this is, you know, the association with ISIS, the idea that this person was inspired by a terrorist organization and what they found was some writings inside the truck, perhaps on the person of this, of this suspect who -- that appears to suggest inspiration by ISIS. Again, that helps buttress the view by law enforcement that this was a terrorist attack, that this was something that was inspired by ISIS or by terrorist organizations. Again, all of this is now part of the investigation. The question of where this person got their radicalization, how far back does that go? We know that he is a former Army member, a member of the U.S. Army. So, you know, how far back does that radicalization go? We know he's from Houston. All of those places are now being investigated, including locations in Houston as well as locations in Louisiana where the suspect stayed before coming to carry out this attack. All of those things now, part of this very broad investigation. It's going to be a long time, I think, before we get a final answer on everything that was involved here.",

It's when risk goes down. The question is, is there another surprise attack at another time at another place? Obviously, the things you're seeing around the Sugar Bowl and other things where -- where security is being increased just makes that harder.But if you look at the events in Las Vegas and try to decipher. All right, we need to know what that means. If you look at some of the other things going on, this is a time where we have to be really on heightened alert, because if there is the possibility of not a lone wolf, which is Evan pointed out, that's what we're used to. The lone wolf inspired attacker. But if there are accomplices, if there were additional devices, if there's something that suggests coordinated efforts, another reason why we have to be looking hard at Las Vegas to figure out what does that mean in this scope?

Is that a residential location? Where was he putting his head down in Louisiana? Where was he putting his head down in Texas? What are the people associated with those locations? What are the phone calls that he was making in the day, the 24, the 48 hours before this? And who were those people? They're going to be peeling back layer after layer after layer, starting with communications.

So they're going to be looking at these incidents that are extremely unusual, like what you're seeing here in Las Vegas as a possible terrorist act until they can rule that out. So that is what we're learning from law enforcement at this point.But what the details we've learned from the sheriffs department there is that this vehicle fire happened at about 8:40 this morning outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. It's 2024 Cybertruck that pretty much exploded at the valet area of that hotel. We know that there was one person found deceased inside, and it's unclear at this point to law enforcement if that person is a male or female because of the burns so badly. We also know that there were seven people that were also injured. It appears minor injuries at this point because of this incident that happened there in front of the hotel. The FBI is involved in this investigation, and Elon Musk actually has tweeted just recently about it, saying now he has his senior team investigating and saying in this exact his X tweet, that we've never seen anything like this. So at this point, again, because of the heightened way that law enforcement is going about everything that is happening across this country. And of course, after what happened in New Orleans, that's how this investigation stands right now. Until they are able to point it in a separate direction, certainly they're going to be doing just what those guys have been talking about is looking at video surveillance of where that Cybertruck came from, tracing steps, trying to uncover more.

The suspect then passes what appears to be a law enforcement car, and then rapidly turns right onto Bourbon Street and accelerates through a group of people. Let's go now to CNN's Tom Foreman.

If you look at what happened to the approach to this, this makes it look smaller than it is. In some ways, you see this come up this road here and turn this is over here on canal and turn in.And then when it starts moving into this area, this is all the French Quarter in here. The actual -- it says it hits the crowd here. If you look at the pictures, it actually seems to have gone further than that before it actually reached a stopping point somewhere up in here. So, about three blocks. So this is a 4,000 to 5,000 pound vehicle. It's an electric vehicle and accelerates to 60 miles an hour in four seconds. So there would be a tremendous number of people here, especially during Sugar Bowl time. And this is not that far actually from the Superdome, which is right over here. You could wind your way over here pretty quickly to get where it happened. And many, many, many tourists here because of the hotels that are there, the restaurants that are there, the clubs that are there, the bars. This is a busy, busy, busy area any time. And one of our witnesses said typically, even on New Year's Eve, you see the crowds spread out a little bit after midnight. Some of them said, really at 3:00 a.m., it was still pretty much the way it had been. So a tremendous number of people, if it had not run into that red crane like device, you see, if the truck had not hit there and had kept going, the crowds down here on Bourbon would have only grown more dense. And who knows how heavy the damage would have been? How many people would have been killed? Real key here, though. One thing I want to point out, the city started this program to replace what are called bollards. You've been hearing it all day long. The bollards are these metal posts here that are rising up. They started this back in November to put in new ones because the old system wasn't working well enough. The purpose of these is to stop people from being able to drive down that street. Usually they're retractable in some fashion. That process was underway with a goal of having it done by the time of the Super Bowl, which is going to be a little more than a month from now. It was not complete. One of the complaints they had was that these the truck went up on the sidewalk around a police car that was here, obviously completely inadequate, stopgap -- stopgap measure. And that's why its the way it is. And now they've got Mardi Gras coming up and jazz fest coming up, more big events, millions of people here, and they haven't shown yet. They know quite how they're going to deal with this kind of threat.",

And then to the medical professionals who cared for all of the victims and of course, the deceased, it's a horrible day. Tom, who spent some time down here, and if Tom is listening, how are you doing? He understands the terrain. We -- New Orleans is a city that welcomes the rest of the world to it, almost year round. From the Super Bowl to the Sugar Bowl to the Final Four, to the NBA all star games, Mardi Gras, jazz fest. I mean, we are used to having huge, huge crowds here and our law enforcement are really, really good at managing crowds. You can see that it is literally impossible to really protect every inch of the city, but Bourbon Street is, Tom was saying, is a special place. After the attacks in Nice in 2016, which was done very similar to this by a truck that ran down folks, and then in Berlin and then of course, a couple of weeks ago, you saw again in Germany at a Christmas market, the same thing happened, you have to try to secure Bourbon Street. Tom, I didn't see the video because I can't -- I'm in the studio, but that's a three block terrain and had that vehicle not hit that crane, it would it probably would not have stopped. So remember there are about 30,000 hotel rooms in about a 30 square block area in New Orleans, which makes it one of the most walkable cities. And they have to make extra efforts to pull out the perimeter, to push out the perimeter tomorrow night, to have extra personnel there as well. But they'll -- they'll try to accomplish that. The most important thing right now, though, let me just say this. I know that everybody wants the Monday morning quarterback the incident right now. But right now there are potentially some still folks that are at large. And I know that it's critically important that there's clear command and control, coordination and communication between the federal authorities, that's the president, the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the U.S. marshals, the governors office, homeland security, and, of course, the mayors office and the surrounding sheriffs to make sure that they secure who those other individuals are. And I know they're all working on that really, really hard.

And so and was evidently here for a couple of weeks.So, not -- not unlike the assassination attempt in New York sometime, evidently, this guy had been here for a couple of weeks looking at how to get this done, and he was intent on killing a lot of people, which, of course, he succeeded in doing last night before the law enforcement officers, you know, shot -- shot him. So everybody just needs to be vigilant. The Superdome is going to be safe tomorrow night. We do these things all of the time. You understand now because of your reporting that there a nationwide threat. So this was a terrorist attack in an American City. It wasn't just an attack on New Orleans. It was an attack on America herself. And all of us have to be in this fight to make sure that we don't bow down to terrorists. We don't let them stop us from enjoying ourselves, but we have to secure the city, and we have to continue to do this over a long period of time, because we have these other major events coming, not the least of which is the Super Bowl, which we've handled many, many, many times.",

And the reason why these records are important is because it gives you a picture of what he was facing currently, financially. Now it does look like in 2012, his wife had sued him trying to get some type of child support. And then as part of that divorce settlement in 2022, he wrote an email that he had fallen behind in his house payments, that he was in danger of foreclosure, that his house payments had fallen behind more than $27,000. And he also wrote that the business he'd formed that he talked about on YouTube, that it had lost about $28,000, and he had also incurred $16,000 in credit card debt.
