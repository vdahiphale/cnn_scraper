Surely before the ruling when the possible seizure of Trump properties seemed a very likely possibility, he complained on his platform, Truth social, about quote being forced to sell his babies. But it seems that was not necessary, at least not yet. The appeals court gave him essentially a 60% discount on the bond, which Trump said would be an honor to post. Despite that break, he baselessly accused President Joe Biden of orchestrating his trials for political gain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And despite sanctions, Russia appears to be using Starlink satellite communications terminals, the same technology which Ukraine relies on to guide its drone warfare. Starlink, which is owned by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, is now giving Russian forces a battlefield advantage, as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine's newest target Is something they've long cherished themselves: small, white, rectangular satellite Internet terminals from Elon Musk's Starlink, apparently in Russian hands and hit by Ukrainian drones. They're not supposed to be there at all, according to Musk and U.S. sanctions.",

Here is even an intercepted signal one unit told us they had hacked from a Russian drone. You can see it maneuvering into a Ukrainian target. Near the heavily contested village of Robotyne, down in the bunkers where the drone wars are fought, this change is huge and has come with an apparent complication for the Ukrainians, too.

Mainstream media hit back at how social media provided a platform for unfounded conspiracy theories.

X forwarded a post from a senior business operations executive, criticizing the way mainstream media has covered the story, saying every news outlet should apologize.
