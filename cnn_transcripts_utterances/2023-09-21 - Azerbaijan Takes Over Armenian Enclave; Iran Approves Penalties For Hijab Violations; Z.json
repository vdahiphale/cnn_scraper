And Iran doubles down on its strict dress code, passing a bill with harsh punishments for women who failed to wear hijabs. We begin with a day of important meetings for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He's scheduled to speak with members of the U.S. Congress in the coming hours, followed by a White House meeting with President Joe Biden. The administration is planning to announce a new aid package for Ukraine, including artillery, anti-armor, anti- aircraft and other defensive capabilities. The White House says Mr. Biden is looking to hear a battlefield perspective from the Ukrainian leader. But we'll also assure him, the U.S. will support cave for as long as it takes. Mr. Zelenskyy spoke about his country's needs to CBS News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): We're defending the values of the whole world, he says, and the Ukrainian people are paying the highest price.

Mr. Zelenskyy says there is a solution for that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY (through translator): In cases of mass atrocities against human rights, veto power should be voluntarily suspended. But we can also observe that Russia will not give up this stolen privilege voluntarily. Therefore, the U.N. General Assembly should be given a real power to overcome the veto. This will be the first necessary step and it is impossible to stop the war because all efforts are vetoed by the aggressor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think that's a challenge for the President because we're being asked to do a lot of very tough lifts by the Saudis. The administration is going to want to go beyond the U.S.-Saudi accord to get something for the Palestinians. And that's going to be tough for this --for this Israeli government. I think there's a better than even chance that at some point, perhaps even before the years out or early next, will -- we really may see progress toward this. I'm wary though of the enterprise. We're dealing with two very problematic partners. We're asking a lot of the United States, most extreme fun ones government in the history of the state of Israel and a repressive, oppressive Saudi Crown Prince who frankly is not interested in only having a singular relationship with the United States.

No. When we look at the data, we do see underneath the headline data that there is a cooling of the labor market ongoing.We're also truly afraid that, for example, now the student loan repayment will further undermine purchasing power, disposable incomes. So, they should also show up in consumer numbers. And then, let's not forget monetary policy has a delayed impact on the real economy, where we have now borrowing costs at record highs, be it credit card debt, be it mortgages. So, this will always take a couple of years before it has completely or fully unfolded its full impact. So, therefore, I find it hard to see that this most aggressive monetary policy tightening will not have negative or adverse effects on the US economy.
