Three explosions reportedly heard in the northwest part of the Iranian city of Isfahan near a military base. Flashes seen in the sky over the city. Now, CNN cannot verify the authenticity of these videos, but they come as flights have been diverted over Iranian airspace. Iranian news media reported that Iran's air defense systems have now been activated across several regions. Tonight's strike comes just hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel will make its own decisions when responding to Iran's unprecedented weekend airstrikes, most of which were intercepted. Iran launched that attack in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month. I want to bring in CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt. Alex, there is so much to be learned here. You have some brand-new reporting. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Laura, the White House has been largely quiet tonight, but you can imagine that they are assessing this as well, looking at all of this footage in real time and also their intelligence.Of course, this has been at top of mind for the White House and for President Biden, who does not want to see this conflict grow any wider in the region. When he had a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend following that attack by Iran, he said that he should think carefully and strategically about next steps, and also noted that the United States would not be involved in any counterstrike against Iran. Of course, again, the focus there being that this is already a very volatile region and not wanting to see it escalate any further. Now, we should note that there were a lot of -- there was quite a bit of movement today here at the White House when it comes to Iran. Of course, they announced sanctions against Iran in an attempt to cut off supplies and further isolate the country. And then also, in addition to that, there was a meeting between senior U.S. officials and Israeli officials about last weekend's attack, but also about the potential invasion of Rafah by Israel. So, clearly, the White House has been monitoring all of this and keeping very close tabs as they seek to try to contain the risk here of a broader regional conflict. But we have also seen since the war in Gaza that there have been public grips between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was unclear whether the Israeli prime minister would take the president's advice moving forward. I think that is still a big question tonight as to what conversations were had and whether this was in alignment with where Israel told the U.S. would -- they would be. So, a lot of questions here tonight still about how this is received and how they move forward, and whether the U.S. does get involved again if there is retaliation another time by Iran after this attack by Israel. So, still a lot of open questions, but the White House clearly monitoring all of this. As of now, though, no statement -- no official statement from the White House.",

      "sentences": "Well, what we're hearing from Iranian media, adding to the details that we've heard already about drones being shot down, it appears that media in Iran, both the sort of local media there and the semi-state media, are playing down these drones that have been shot down.One media is talking about them as small quad helicopters, these very small drones. Another media is indicating that the Isfahan nuclear facility is secure. These again are details that are just coming in. We need to run down more information on them. [23:09:51] But I think what they are indicative at the moment of is a sense that's being portrayed by the media in Iran to the people of Iran, that whatever has happened in the skies above Isfahan overnight and near this military base in Isfahan overnight, knowing that it has now been confirmed that Israel did strike inside Iran, U.S. officials telling us that, that from an Iranian perspective, there is an effort to minimize it, potentially even try to ridicule it. So, what does that mean? If the media in Iran is doing it, it tends to imply that that's the tack approach that the government may also take. Look, we need to take a beat and wait and see what they actually say, how the government actually responds at the moment. We haven't heard from any senior Iranian government officials since the reports of these incidents. And over the night since the air defense systems were activated in Iran in the early hours of the morning, we've been tracking here, I would say, for the last three hours or so, different reports about unexplained explosions, noises, changes of flight patterns of commercial aircraft over Iran. It does seem to be coalescing down to -- the state-run media is only reporting and confirming about the explosions around Isfahan, this city, major city, a few hundred miles south of Tehran, that has military bases and also an important uranium enrichment facility. So, at first take, this seems to be being minimized. But I would caveat that with the fact that Isfahan airport is shut, Tehran airport is shut, another major airport in Iran is shut, the western airspace in Iran is closed. So, at the moment, Iran seems to be, in terms of what's in its skies, is taking extreme precautions and putting commercial aircrafts, taking them out of the sky. Now, I think one point we should -- it's maybe worth bringing to bear on why such a big area of the skies are being cleared. It would be from the west of Iran if Israeli fighter jets were to fly into Iran to take part in strikes. Now, we're only hearing about drones in the skies above Iran at the moment. However, knowing that Iran switched on its air defense systems in the early hours of the morning, we only have to think back to early January 2020, shortly after the United States targeted Qasem Soleimani, that senior figure in the Quds Force, killed him in a drone strike while he was in Iraq. Well, a few days later, when Iranian airspace and air defenses were on heightened alert, they mistakenly shot down a civil passenger aircraft in the skies above Tehran. So, the fact that they are closing airspace may just be a protection for the civilian aircraft because they don't want to make a mistake again and shoot down a civilian aircraft, mistaking it for a potential fighter jet.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it could be several things, Laura. A radar site is a perfect area to go after because that -- once you hit the radar site, that blinds the forces that are using that radar picture for their activities. So, it's a perfect site for the Israelis to go after.The other thing to keep in mind is we've been talking about airfields, and one of the reasons that a lot of the airports have been shut down, as Nic was mentioning in his reporting, is because what Iran does is it doubles the use of their civilian airports as also being air force bases for the Iranian air force. So, in the case of Isfahan, the air base is co-located with the international airport in Isfahan, and it's the home to Iran's fleet of F-14 fighters, which they had acquired during the time of the Shah. So those aircraft are, of course, quite old, antiquated. They've since been upgraded in some ways using Iranian capabilities and other capabilities, but they probably pose a very limited threat to the Israelis. The other thing to keep in mind, Laura, is that when it comes to the nuclear facilities in and around Isfahan, the one that's really important is the Natanz nuclear facility, and that is 120 kilometers or about 70 miles away from Isfahan. So, if you strike the area around Isfahan, you are not going to be striking the city of Isfahan. That is, you're not going to be striking Natanz, but you are telling them, as we've talked about, you are telling everybody that you can reach this area and you can, in fact, eliminate that threat or at least attack that threat if you need to do so.",

But it seems like they were able to do this pretty much with impunity, and it tells us that there are basically holes in the Iranian air defense system and that the Israelis can take advantage of them if they feel the need to do so.",

The Iranians are trying to play down the attack, but it's nighttime. It is --it's a little hard to know the extent of the damage. I'm not so sure that if the damage is indeed substantial, I'm not sure Iran will be able to conceal that for very long. And there's also the question of national pride, particularly from the hardliners of the Iranian right who control that country.

Gentlemen, thank you for being here.We have heard a lot about this capability versus actual damage. How do you see this result, knowing that both nations now have been able to reach the other's actual territory? But there's a distinction here. The Iron Dome was able to intercept at least 99%. This has now reached Iran, although we don't yet know the damage. MIKE LYONS, RETIRED U.S. ARMY: Well, first of all, there was no allies on the side of Iran protecting them, as was on the side of Israel. It was part of that miraculous solution, frankly. I mean, to shoot 99% of those rockets, 300 rockets coming towards your country, is nothing short of a miracle. It was a tremendous military accomplishment. So, Iran does not have the same air defense capabilities. They likely were on high alert. They would -- they would probably give it their best shot, but they just don't have the same capability. So, where this is escalating now is Iran gets violated. The Israelis hit, actually, their targets. Like, you know, the why behind the target still remains. Was it to get close to the nuclear facilities? Was it to destroy aircraft or missiles that were possibly launched from that location on the attack? Was it, again, to go after air defense systems that they want to take out now that will help them in the future? So, again, I think it just shows that from a deterrence perspective, it's back on -- the ball is back on the side of Israel. They have much more military capability.",

Those are the kind of decisions that government officials make, and then whether history shows they're right or wrong.

But they are also in a very dangerous spot because they are facing a two or three-front war right now. They're still fighting in Gaza. They're facing hostilities with Hezbollah across their northern border. And now, they're getting engaged in a direct war with Iran. That's -- I mean, again, Israel, very capable state, very powerful military, but that's a lot for them to handle, and they are going to be relying on help from the U.S. and others to try to shield them from some of this danger.

They would have to attack across wide fronts, all across the country, and also have the knowledge. You can't take the knowledge out of Iran. They have that capability now. Different versus when Israel attacked Osirak in 1981, for example, or the Syrian military, when they had a nuclear facility.

When two adversaries that are committed, literally, for whom this is an existential trouble, conflict, change the rules of the game, you have an extremely serious situation. But the reality, Laura, is that we're in a kind of an information Bermuda Triangle here. We really don't know what the precise motives of the Israelis were for conducting this attack. We don't know whether or not this -- we're still in a messaging or signaling phase. In other words, the Israelis had to respond. They had to show technical mastery by conducting this attack at Isfahan. They did not presumably go after a nuclear facility or a research facility. Some radar, as Cedric said, or military installations or drone installations, unclear. And we really don't know right now what the nature of the Iranian response is going to be. I think within the next 24 hours, we're going to have a pretty good sense of whether or not we are climbing up the escalatory ladder to something the Middle East has never experienced before, which is a regional confrontation involving Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, an exchange of ballistic missiles, sustained strikes on the part of the Israelis against Iranian conventional, maybe unconventional sites, Hezbollah opening up with its 150,000 repository arsenal of high-trajectory weapons, which would lead to the death of hundreds of Israelis, the Israelis would preempt or counter destroying Lebanese infrastructure, thousands of Lebanese would be killed. It's almost impossible to imagine, to add to this, that the United States would be able to stay on the sidelines. I'm not predicting that. I don't know where we're going on this one.

And the Israelis have already made one miscalculation here. When they did the initial strike against the seven IRGC officers, they thought that the Iranians would take this the way they've taken others, and didn't really anticipate that they would see the kind of response they saw last Saturday night. So somewhat embarrassed by that and also determined to show their escalation dominance, they've gone and presumably done whatever they've done here. We don't know the extent of it yet. As you heard earlier, could have included cyber, could have included attacks elsewhere. It's going to take us a day or two to sort all of that out, maybe even longer if they're hard to see attacks like cyberattacks.

It would almost be poetic because the Iranians tried, with their barrage of missiles and drones, to strike an Israeli air force base in Nevatim and destroy Israeli F-35 fighter jets. So, it would be a certain amount of symmetry if the Israelis then turned around, penetrated air defenses successfully, and destroyed Iranian fighter jets on the runway.

If they've just discovered today that their air defenses don't work, that is certainly a degree of vulnerability. They must be giving pause to the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, and his Revolutionary Guards. If that's the case, their retaliatory decisions must be informed by that vulnerability.

Here, he was basically saying to the prime minister, hey, don't let your ego get in the way here, take the win that came from the fact that none of the Iranian missiles actually hit any significant targets.

They felt that even doing something of a cyber nature alone or something you wouldn't see wouldn't send the message sufficiently to the leadership.Now, maybe, as you just heard before from Mark Dubowitz, that it's entirely possible that they were demonstrating some new capabilities. But if they were going to go after the nuclear program, believe me, I think we would have known it tonight because we would have seen it in multiple different sites. And while we don't know yet the extent of what happened, the early report suggests that wasn't it. But here's my longer-term concern. The Iranians have, as you reported earlier, been enriching at 60%, which is just below bomb-grade uranium. And for reasons that have to do with physics, not politics, that puts them only days or a week or so away from being able to produce at 90%, which would be bomb-grade. They have been backing off on the 60% production or so, I'm told by the U.N. inspectors who still get in there on occasion. And now, they could well reverse that in a way to sort of threaten that they're going to go all the way to 90%. I think that could be the escalatory move because I think the Israelis and perhaps the United States would feel if they're producing bomb- grade uranium, they would have to go after this We don't know that they've -- that they're going to take that step. They've always come short of it. The amazing thing about the Iranian program is it has taken them longer to get to a bomb than any nation on Earth. And that has been deliberate. They have been using this as a political measure on the on the lever here as well as one of physics. They are not racing for the bomb. This could change that view.",
