Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley said remnants from each object fell into very hard to reach areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: Very, very difficult terrain. The second one off the coast of Alaska is - that's up in some really, really difficult terrain in the Arctic Circle with very, very low temperatures in the minus 40s. The second one is in the Canadian Rockies and Yukon, very difficult to get that one.",

The questions about whether they will actually be able to recover any of those debris is still looming, but the White House is now offering what they say is the leading theory from intelligence officials and that is that these three of balloons were most likely a benign or for commercial purposes. Here's the White House Press Secretary just moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The Intelligence Community did say that they are considering or looking at this to be potentially benign. But, of course, we want to make sure that we get the objects so we can actually or the debris from the objects, just to be more clear, so we can get a sense of what the objects were for certain.

But there were some who differed and we heard from Sen. Rubio and also Hawley saying that they needed to hear from the President and they were not reassured that there were no threats from these objects to the American public. From your purview, where do you stand on this issue? REP. AUSTIN SCOTT (R-GA): Well, I think the sooner that we get the information on the balloons and the sooner we declassify it everything that can be declassified on it the better off we as the American citizens and the American public will be. So if they're benign, we need to make sure that the American citizens know that and if they're not benign like the Chinese spy balloon, then we need to make sure the American citizens understand what China is continuing to do to our country.",

The first balloon, the Chinese balloon, the spy balloon, if you will, is a very serious issue and a threat to the United States of America. It is a continuing effort by China to defeat the United States and all aspects, whether it be military or economically.And so if the other balloons were benign, then as soon as we know that for sure, we need to release that to the American citizens and we need to go back and focus on the one that was not benign, and talk - and remind the American citizens that whether it be TikTok or fentanyl or the weapon systems that China's developing, they don't call them the bear strike, they call them eagle strike and you can guess who the eagle is, that's all of us as Americans, especially those of us who are serving our country and so China is our enemy. And I'll tell you, Bianna, it's going to take all of Americans working together to defeat the threat of China and make sure that we don't go to war with them. I was a little taken aback this week with the fact that less than two weeks, China literally flew a flat - a spy balloon over the United States of America and then Ford Motor Company, Bill Ford announces that Ford is going to get a team with China to develop batteries. And that's the kind of thing that we can't have as Americans. We can't have corporate America going to the other side to develop their technology and build their vehicles.",

But I don't think that my colleagues that I served with on the House Armed Services Committee intended for Chinese technology to be eligible for U.S. tax credits or for Ford to partner with the Chinese Communist Party to be eligible for tax credits.So I think it would be wise for industry, that is moving ahead with the Chinese Communist Party to understand that legislation can be passed and actually changes the way that tax code is written.

So part of this is law enforcement, responsible gun owners getting out there and beginning to talk about sort of what are legitimate and honestly illegitimate ownership laws. There is also - I don't want people to feel like there's nothing to do. There's actually a lot coming out of the FBI, the NYPD analysis in terms of these red flag laws, trigger laws and others that are helping us understand where intervention might work. We don't see that but - to minimize these harms. And then, of course, yes, we are at a stage where if we can get our response capabilities better as we saw at MSU, as say, compared to Uvalde, you definitely save lives. I mean, they are - they were in their in moments with the surge capacity, the readiness to protect these kids. Great communications to the students, to the family.
