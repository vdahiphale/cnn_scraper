I am following two major news stories that are moving and unfolding in this hour.In the United States, in the state of Maine, an urgent manhunt is underway to find a mass killer. Whilst in Israel, an overnight raid into Gaza could signal preparations for a ground invasion have moved ever closer, and that could be about to begin. But we will begin this hour in Maine where schools, stores, and other businesses are shut down as the police look for the suspect in two mass shootings. The authorities have identified Robert Card who, they say, is a certified firearms instructor and should be considered armed and dangerous. The manhunt began after a rampage on Wednesday night. It ended with at least 18 people dead. Hundreds of officers have now joined the search. To bring us up to date, Omar Jimenez has more.

You know, we were watching that minor incursion last night over my shoulder here that was red, traced a fire from tanks going horizontally. We found out this morning there were tanks. We were also hearing a heavy gunfire in the area. We're also hearing some detonations that we hadn't really heard before so when we work up today and the IDF said, \"Yes, we had an incursion. It was right over there.\" Easy to put two and two together. Well, tonight, just before you are coming to us, there was a flare in the sky, heavy bursts of machine gun fire in that very similar area. And that comes after just a few minutes ago. There have been rocket warnings across much of central Israel because of rockets fired out of Gaza. So it does seem to be very active again here tonight. We're not seeing the tank fire at the moment. But if there's another limited incursion like this one that was last night, large in scale but limited in the scope of what it tried to achieve, just getting a small Hamas operative cell according to the IDF, this would be a very much military playbook. Basically, you don't go in, take out a terrorist cell and maybe some tunnels that they're operating from, and then pull out and wait a few more days before going back. Why not? Because Hamas is able to go back in and repair the damage or do take advantage of your low. So it does feel that we're on that -- we're on the slope towards a fuller incursion.

Gaza, the north end where we are, was quite quiet. There were very few detonations and explosions through that day. And it really gave the sense that real diplomacy was underway. And we understand that still diplomacy is underway in the background. But I think the IDF and the military are ratcheting up the military side of the pressure on that equation. Hamas wants the fuel. They want the humanitarian support. They want that humanitarian pause for the aid to go in. And the Israelis want the hostages back. The military facet of that, I think, is all part of it. Israel intends to keep up the pressure by every account that we can come across here. And everyone that we talked to believes that there will still be an incursion.

And that operation that you and Nic were just talking about probably was not only to gain intelligence, that's something that's doctrinally called a reconnaissance-in-force or what we tankers like to call a RIF operation. It's not only to find potential targets that you can go after when you put a bigger force in, but it's also to see what kind of obstacles you might run into when you're driving those Merkava tanks or personnel carriers into an area that you haven't been in for a long time.

The U.N. agency responsible for aid in Gaza, UNRWA, says it's paralyzed by the lack of fuel in Gaza, all of which is adding pressure to an already dire humanitarian crisis. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz saw the stories of those living in Gaza. I need to warn you, this report contains disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A journalist some call the voice of Gaza mourns over the body of his teenage son. \"They're taking their revenge by killing our children,\" he cries. Al Jazeera says its bureau chief in Gaza, Wael Al-Dahdouh, lost his wife, 15-year-old son, 7-year-old daughter and baby grandson, all killed in an Israeli airstrike, the network says. The reporter had moved his family south of Gaza City after an evacuation order by the IDF, believing it would keep them safe. This conflict is taking a severe toll on journalists with at least 24 killed so far, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists. Reporters are also facing threats, arrests and censorship. No one and nowhere in this enclave is spared, Palestinians say. Death and funerals are constant, anguish and agony are on every corner. Every 10 minutes a child is killed, Save the Children estimates. \"Anywhere else in the world, it is sons who bury their father,\" this man says. \"Why is it different in Gaza, why do we have to bury our children before they've even grown?\" Families, desperate to keep their little ones safe, are taking refuge anywhere they can find. Packed U.N. shelters are turning people away. \"We can't live like this. We're 17 people living in a school classroom,\" this woman says. \"How long are we supposed to live like this? \"Tell us, world, how long?\" Eking out a living here is difficult and grim. Food, fuel, water, everything is running out. \"I don't even know what the point is of being here,\" she says. \"We're still terrified and we have nothing, no help. We can bear it. We're grown-ups. \"But how are these children supposed to handle this.\" There is no childhood left here for the more than 1 million kids now trapped inside this hellscape. And no way, Gazans say, to keep the youngest safe -- Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, I agree; easier said than done. But I think it's very important to have that perspective.
