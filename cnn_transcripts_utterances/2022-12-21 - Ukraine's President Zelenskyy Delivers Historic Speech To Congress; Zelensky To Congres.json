It's going to take weeks to train the folks necessary to operate it. Frankly, Ukraine has been asking for more and more air defense since the beginning of this war. They're getting more, not at the pace they want, and that's why I think you heard Zelenskyy a little bit tongue in cheek, say it's nice to have this, but we need more. But, man, he's behind that as the suffering of the Ukrainian people. So, it's a step but it's not all they need. And it's not clear how quickly they will get the air defense necessary to stop some -- you know, stop some of the suffering.

She was in that chamber during President Zelenskyy's historic speech. Senator Klobuchar, if you can be our reporter for us on the ground there, just what was it like to be in the room? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  Well, thanks, John, and thanks for the last reporting. It was right on. President Zelenskyy has always shown courage. He showed courage when he walked down into the streets of Ukraine when everyone had counted him out and said those simple three words, we are here, and changed the trajectory. Everyone had counted him out and the people of Ukraine out. He did it again tonight. First of all, it was at a moment where Democrats and Republicans are hashing out this end of year spending bill and tempers are high. People were united. Leaders of both parties there, multiple, multiple times of standing ovations and applause, and almost this joyous -- while somber, the joyous support for this man that they respect so much. And the way he was able to conjure those images that Jim and Phil just mentioned of the candlelight and Ukrainians, I saw more than a few members tears coming down their cheeks as they heard those stories and thought of the people of Ukraine in the cold still hanging in there, refusing to give up on democracy. And then his rhetoric, I don't know you can say it was soaring, right? But what it was, was to the point. And he said, this is about the kind of world our children are going to grow up in, as in Ukrainian kids, but also your children, making the case that this is a worldwide cause to stand up for democracy, which is, of course, one of the reasons you're seeing this broad support. People love him. They love the people of Ukraine, but they also know we cannot fold to Vladimir Putin and to Russia. And that's why you're seeing the president standing up with his plans and that is why you're seeing the money coming here. What I hope we will get done, I am sure we will get done by the end of the year for military and refugees and assistance.",

They are incredibly innovative group, and there's already people thinking about their economy moving forward.

But you're going to have strong support still in the Senate.There have been a few, as you know, in the House on some of the statements that were made -- Kevin McCarthy actually did, I remember this before the election, actually draw back some of his statements after he made them about Ukraine. So, I'm hoping that this strong support continues. There are so many Ukrainian-Americans in the U.S. That's important. People are listening to them. But I think people get this democracy argument. You cannot, no matter what your political beliefs are -- and you're always going to have people on the extremes who may not want to help, but when you look at what this is about, you cannot let the barbaric, inhuman Vladimir Putin be able to dominate the world stage and just walk into any democracy he wants and take it over.

We don't remember the America Firsters of that first generation when Churchill spoke. Because after Pearl Harbor was bombed, many of them shifted their tune.

You know, is there going to be anything in there about Roger Stone? Is there going to be anything in there about Michael Flynn? Is there going to be a connection to the war room at the Willard Hotel? And all of the no-good nicks that were hanging out there, all of whom had one common denominator. They all had either been pardoned by Donald Trump or had asked for pardons by Donald Trump. So, that to me, is the real key. If you could show that somehow the White House Donald Trump was orchestrating what was going on through Roger Stone and General Flynn, that would open up a whole new area of evidence.

It's a both a fascinating opportunity for the attorneys and the investigators to get an inside line on what these witnesses might be thinking and might have said. And it's also a possible real problem for them if they've already taken statements from these people. They already have them on the record.

That's what it's all about. And they don't want to incriminate themselves. And the committee, if they had wanted, could have provided immunity. They have the power to grant immunity to witnesses. But they didn't do it with. Now this was contrary to what the Senate select committee did during the Watergate investigation. It seemed like half the witnesses, including John Dean, who we all know, it was granted immunity. But the problem now is the law has changed on that because of Iran-Contra and Ali North and the case that was brought against him. So, I think that the committee was being very, very careful about not undermining any kind of DOJ investigation, and I think they've been pretty much, if you read the summary, you get the impression that they have been feeding information to DOJ and the D.A.'s office in Fulton County just as things have been going along.
