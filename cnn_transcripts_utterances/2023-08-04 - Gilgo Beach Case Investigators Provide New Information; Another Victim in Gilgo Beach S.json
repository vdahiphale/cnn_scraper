The Rankin County sheriff, he said that the actions of these former deputies don't speak for the department. The Department of Justice officials though saying that this was a shameful betrayal of the oath of office. This incident lasted about two hours, and it was during this incident that one of the men was shot in the mouth during what officials call, a mock execution.
