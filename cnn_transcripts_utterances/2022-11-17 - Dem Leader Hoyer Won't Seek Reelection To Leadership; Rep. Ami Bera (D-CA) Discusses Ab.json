He's not talking about what his future plans are right now. He really wants the focus to be on Pelosi.And Victor and Alisyn, I'll tell you, it was clearly a historic moment. It had that feeling that heft to it outside the chamber, inside the chamber today, as House members watched Nancy Pelosi deliver the speech earlier today. All we knew was that she would be talking about the future that she'd taken two versions of that speech home with her according to a source and now we know what her future plans will be. She will remain in the House but not in leadership, which really paves the way for a brand new next generation of talent to come up within the Democratic Party and lead them. And you mentioned, Hoyer also not running, Jim Clyburn will likely step aside. So this is quite a sea change in terms of Democratic leadership, some 20 years that she's been the head of House Democrats. So for some of these members, that's certainly all they've ever known, even those who've been here a pretty long time and she talked about just how much has changed while she's been in that position, listen.

I mean, the reality is in a razor thin House Republican majority, any few members can have power. They can derail the legislative process, they can hold things up, they can take bills down, not vote for them.And so even messaging bills in a Republican-led house are going to be challenging, let alone the basic functions of government like funding the government or lifting the debt ceiling. And so that is why you're likely to see investigations really take center stage, Republicans had already promised to conduct rigorous oversight into the Biden administration. And today, we saw their opening salvo in that fight two leading Republicans, Jim Jordan and James Comer hold a joint press conference to outline what they say are the business dealings involving Hunter Biden, they're going to try to link it to President Joe Biden, but that is just one investigative target. They also want to investigate the pull out of Afghanistan, the origins of COVID-19, the border, the DOJ's investigation into Donald Trump, so just a whole litany of things. But guys, one other thing to look out for here is that not every Republican in the party has a huge appetite for all of these probes. Some of them yes, but not all of them. They're worried about overreach. They're worried about turning off moderates and independents. They say we should use our newfound majority to get things done to show that this place can work to address the priorities that we ran on. So that is going to be a key challenge for whoever is Speaker of the House next year.",

And Republicans in the House, especially are going to face a choice, how much do they want to just resist or do they want to come to the table in some way, extract concessions, but get a deal done. I think Republicans if you think back to even the Trump years, when Republicans held the cards, but they still shut the government down over Trump's demands for a border wall, I think the American people did not look on that very kindly. It was not something that served them very well and I think that there is a risk here and being so - in being solely a roadblock and solely just the - nothing moves forward caucus, that I think the American people want to see something done, especially now given that we're perhaps on the verge of an economic recession and I think people are just frustrated with what's going on in Washington.",

It's so interesting to watch how she won there, because homelessness was on the ballot, crime as in all big cities and those were things that Republicans really hit hard, and yet she is a Democrat, won in that big city.Now, I know that California is generally blue, but do you think that - what do you think that says about those big issues and that a Democrat won?",

I think you could start - you could characterize Karen Bass in that way. It just didn't work.And it's - if it were an outlier, I would say it's - it has something to do, specifically, with Los Angeles. But when you think about the landscape of the Midterm Election cycle, Republicans all over the country were running on crime, were running on this idea of kind of lawlessness in American cities and Democratic run - and places in New York as well and that just didn't work. There were other things, I think, apparently on voter's minds and I just think it just goes to show there are limitations to how that argument can work. There is no more well worn tool in politics than fear mongering around crime. And it was utilized really to a great degree by Republicans in this last Midterm Election cycle. I think it was perhaps the second most - they spent on that issue than anything else other than the economy and inflation, but it just did not have the legs that they thought that it did. It just shows that there has to be more to the message other than things are really terrible and need to kick Democrats out as a result of that.",
