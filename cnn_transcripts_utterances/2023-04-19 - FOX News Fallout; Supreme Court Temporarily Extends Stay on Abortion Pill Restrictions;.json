Tonight, we tell you, FOX News isn't out of the woods yet. A $787 million settlement to Dominion Voting settles only one of the lawsuits that FOX is facing in its 2020 US election coverage. Smartmatic, another company that makes voting machines is claiming $2.7 billion for defamation. A former producer is suing the network, claiming she was pressured to give false testimony in the Dominion case, and shareholders are reportedly demanding company records. One investor has already sued the FOX Chairman, Rupert Murdoch and other top executives. As part of the settlement, FOX admits it aired blatantly false claims that Dominion rigged the 2020 election. Dominion won't get an official on air apology. Its lead attorney, Justin Nelson tells CNN the agreement holds FOX News accountable nonetheless. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was the phone hacking scandal involving his tabloid newspaper empire in the UK. \"The Press Gazette\" estimates that it has cost at least $1.2 billion, if you include legal fees, damages and expenses tied to the subsequent restructuring of the business. Joe Miller is a legal correspondent for The Financial Times. He joins me now. This idea -- coming back to this idea what people wanted to see besides the money paid because the money being paid, FOX can afford it, and it can afford it with spare change in his pocket. But why no apology? Why did Dominion not push for an on air apology in the way you would have done if you're a newspaper for a print apology? JOE MILLER, LEGAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE FINANCIAL TIMES\":  Yes, Richard. Well, it's a good question and a question a lot of people have been asking. You referred there to the phone hacking scandal, and those of us who were covering that at the time will remember Rupert Murdoch, saying that it was the most humbling day of his life. And so that came with a very public apology, so to speak, and conspicuously this settlement is void of any such apology. But I think the thing that is important to remember here is this is a case that was brought by a commercial entity. It may have been about the First Amendment, about free speech in America about the 2020 election and whether or not it was stolen, but it was still brought by a private equity backed company that, no doubt suffered quite a lot of abuse on social media, et cetera, and its staff were reportedly threatened in the wake of the claims that were made about their devices. But they were still in search of a payout and a payout, which they got, and they are not particularly there to stand in for American democratic institutions and demanding an apology.",

I think there is something slightly unique about this case, which is the phone hacking scandal that we referred to earlier, for example, the newspaper in question, the news of the world got some scoops out of it over the years.

But for now, Boris, it does remain status quo for the abortion pill, nothing will change. It will remain available as it did in the previous weeks and months. And I'm waiting to see right now the Supreme Court is going to take this case up, because remember the Lower Court here, the Fifth Circuit, they are still really dealing with the merits of this case. They've set up a really fast-tracked briefing schedule on this, and they are scheduled to hear arguments in this case in just about one month. So the takeaway that I'm just getting now via paper that I've just been handed is that the Supreme Court has in fact extended this stay meaning they are extending putting the Lower Court ruling on hold, meaning everything remains status quo. There will be no changes to the way that the abortion pill is administered. Good news for a lot of doctors and patients who are bracing for any changes, good news for the FDA and the Justice Department, Boris.

So, you know, had it been a permanent stay, I would have felt pretty good about it.

But all of that is on hold until now Friday night, but again, the fact that they didn't give it a lengthier stay or say that until the litigation goes through its paces in the Fifth Circuit on the merits, that means that they I think are seriously thinking about affirming some parts of what the Fifth Circuit said, which, as Jessica outlined a few minutes ago, if they agreed with the Fifth Circuit as to which parts of Judge Kacsmaryk's order could survive and which parts would be rejected, it would mean that women would have to go in person multiple times to their doctor and could only get mifepristone up to seven weeks. So it would mean a big difference -- and not through the mail, so it made a big difference in the way that patients are obtaining this drug, big problems with the FDA and the conflict with the order out of Washington by Judge Rice, which orders the FDA to do what it needs to do to make mifepristone still available as it has been available in the 17 States and the District of Columbia, the jurisdictions that brought in that lawsuit.

And the problem with this is food and energy, of course, makes up a huge portion of lower income households' bills. So this is going to hurt the lower incomes the hardest. And it's really basic. Look at this, bread, cereal; these are both up by 19 percent compared to the year before. Then we have fruit. See what happens to these bananas once I dropped them, up 10 percent over the year. Chocolate hasn't met fare much better. Nor has honey, I believe these are up about 17 percent. And Richard for you, the plane, the air travel at the moment. This is an odd item to have in one's basket of shopping from the coop. But air travel is up 24 percent from a year before. I'm not going to drop this. It's dear Winston's. We don't want to damage the plane. But this goes to show that inflation in the U.K. is really powering on through, is dropped ever so slightly but it's still double digits.",

So why is inflation in the U.K. stickier than say in the U.S.? A. STEWART:  It certainly feels stickier and, Richard, we're expecting now, as of next month, to have the 12th rate hike in a row. Why is it stickier? Two reasons:  there's food and energy. And I'm going to tackle energy because actually, this contributes over a third of that overall inflation figure. The U.K. versus even European nations and certainly the U.S. is much more reliant on natural gas. That's just for electricity generation but also for heating their homes. So that's a much bigger factor. And it's not calmed down nearly as quickly. You can also go best subsidies, for instance, with other European nations.",

How much are we influenced, do you think? I mean, I noticed you went to the coop but was that because you feared M&amp;S was going to be more? A. STEWART:  That's -- I knew you'd ask this question. Listen, Richard and I, we debate whether to go to the coop or Marks &amp; Spencer's most times. He's in London. We went to the coop, Richard, because I think this is the best way to find a range of brands where as much as (INAUDIBLE), they're very much their own brand. So I feel like it would be harder maybe to test the inflation question. And also I know you do love the coop. It wins for you most times.",
