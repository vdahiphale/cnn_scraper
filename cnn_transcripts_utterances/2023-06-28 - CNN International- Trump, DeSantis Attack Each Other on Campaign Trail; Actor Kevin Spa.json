Well, he was the artistic director of the Old Vick Theater between 2004 and 2015. So in those years he really had a very prominent role in London. He considered London to be his home. And the allegations brought forth were by four separate men, four separate individuals, who say that he took advantage essentially of his position. That again, as artistic director of the Old Vick. There were separate battery charges in the United States that he was dismissed of last year, found innocent of last year. He feels I guess emboldened by that. He was speaking to a German publication that just published just a fewweeks ago, speaking again claiming that Hollywood was willing to hire him, they just were too scared to put forward someone like Kevin Spacey who's facing these charges. This trial is going to take four weeks. We're not going to have any results today. But it is an opportunity again for Kevin Spacey and his lawyers to present again what he says is proof of his innocence and for the Crown prosecution here in London to present why the allegations have come forward.",

In other words the people who got sick, they haven't traveled outside of the United States, they got bit by a mosquito in the United States.So let's take a look. It's four cases in Florida and one case in Texas. To put this into perspective, when this happened 20 years ago, it was just eight cases. It was the state of Florida and they managed to spray and do other things so that they didn't have any more than eight cases. And though Florida and Texas have a lot of experience in spraying for mosquitos. So, what should people be on the lookout for? If you have certain symptoms like a fever, for example, chills, headache, body aches, and feeling generally unwell, you can go to the doctor and say hey, could this be malaria. Chances are it's not. But you can tell the doctor, you know, I've heard that there is malaria in the United States, is it possible that this is malaria? Also if you get treated quickly enough, there are anti-malaria drugs that really work quite well. Now let's talk about prevention for a minute. Here's what people ought to be doing. They ought to be wearing mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, and remove standing water. If you've got standing water in your yard, mosquitoes love that. Yet rid of it so that they have fewer places to breed -- Max. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
