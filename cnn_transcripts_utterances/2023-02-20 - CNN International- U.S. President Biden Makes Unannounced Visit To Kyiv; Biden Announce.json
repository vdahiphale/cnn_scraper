Thanks (INAUDIBLE) thanks Congress. I think that is a historical moment for our -- for our country and very important to be able to (INAUDIBLE) on the battlefield.

Because as the president, remember I was warning the world that he was going to attack -- I was certain of it -- and I thought it was critical that greetings and goodwill from the members of Congress. You made a very good impression as you know when you spoke there last. And for all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues that there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine. And this is so much larger than just Ukraine. It's about freedom and democracy in Europe. It's about freedom and democracy writ large. And for all the American people I know that so many have kept the Ukrainian people, particularly the women and children, in their prayers seeing what's happened. They can't fathom the idea of a shelling -- the shelling from orphanages to schools to the like. It's barbaric. And I'm here to show our unwavering support for the nation's independence, your sovereignty, and the territorial integrity. And today I hope we're going to have a chance to discuss how the United States and our allies who I keep in constant contact with, and our partners can most effectively support you and your cause, Mr. President. And I look forward to discussing all of this and addressing the world with you afterwards. Again, the admiration for the people of Ukraine -- ordinary, hardworking citizens were never trained to be military. The way they've stepped up is beyond growth and the whole world -- the whole world.",

And actually, that repeats the message he said on Friday at the Munich Security Conference. \"I hope to be with you next year. The war will be over.\"There's political imperative from all the leaders in that country that support Ukraine. There's a military imperative for Ukraine to win this and draw it to a close quickly. And I think we're seeing vestiges of that and the message is very clear. We can win it this year. Give us what we need to do it. And very clearly from what I'm hearing, Crimea is on the agenda for the Ukrainians to take and that discussion of longer-range missiles fits neatly into that.",
