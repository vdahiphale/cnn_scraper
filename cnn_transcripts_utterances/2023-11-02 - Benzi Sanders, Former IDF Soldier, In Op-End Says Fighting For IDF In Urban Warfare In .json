Walk me through some of these promotions still on hold by Tuberville, specifically related to U.S. positions and the posture in the Middle East with Israel and Hamas war ongoing.

But also we trust them not to put our military profession at risk, damage our institutions, or to be cruel. We've got to a point now where Senator Tuberville is not only being irrational but being cruel to both the military officers and their families. This is now language for seven months, and as you pointed out a lot of different people are affected. Many of them are in the fight. Many of them are working double jobs and, in some cases, as I've experienced it in the past, this in the past on a hold, they are prevented from going into the position. Because there's a rule, a regulation, called Presumption of Position. You can't do that unless you've been confirmed by the Senate. So all of these things are contributing to a national security risk. And I guess it's more important for the Senator to continue this reformative politics and being cruel than for him to sit down and write legislation and maybe have his fellow Senators vote on it, which they wouldn't do.

What they're attempting to do now is squeeze Hamas into that one city of Gaza City. After they do that, Jessica, I suggest they'll go other places, because when talking about the miles and miles -- in fact, hundreds of miles of tunnels and facilities underneath Gaza City -- Hamas made this their main stand. And they're using the civilians in that area as protective shields. Not only civilians but their facilities. They've placed these tunnels underneath hospitals, underneath administrative facilities, under camps, under civilian dwellings. I think what Israel's trying to do is basically surround so the Hamas leaders can't get out and their fighters can't get out of the city and they're going to continue to conduct the offensive to try and kill or capture many of these Hamas terrorists.",
