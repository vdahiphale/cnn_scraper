Here's the big question of the evening, everyone. Did Donald Trump just perhaps violate the conditions of his release? The former president threatening retaliation just 24 hours after, yes, his third indictment, when a judge warned him, by the way, against intimidating or tampering with witnesses. Take a look. On social media, he was writing, quote, if you go after me, I'm coming after you, kind of a way of saying, don't come for me until I send for you, apparently. We'll talk about all that in a moment with our law expert who testified at one of his impeachment hearings. But, first, Trump also railed against the charges against him at an event in Alabama just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Every one of these many fake charges filed against me by the corrupt Biden DOJ could have been filed two and a half years ago. They didn't want to do it two and a half years ago. They wanted to wait, and they did wait. They waited right to the middle of an election and they waited until I became the dominant force in the polls. They want to interfere in my campaign. They want to interfere in the elections, a commonly used tactic in third world countries. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he was talking in very threatening terms about Jack Smith, the special counsel, calling him deranged, and that sort of thing.

And going back all the way to the 2016 campaign, he has a talent for creating this climate, this environment, where it feels like political violence could break out at any moment. He wants the country frightened in a state of almost political terror all of the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, because that is the kind of environment that he tends to do well in. And so I don't suspect that he's going to change this way of behaving at all. He's going to try to exploit this. I was talking to a Trump adviser earlier today who said they believe wholeheartedly that they can delay these cases until after the election and so they don't have to worry about winning the Republican Party contest. They think they've got the nomination already wrapped up. And in the general election battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as we saw back in 2016, all it takes is for Donald Trump to get a little bit of luck and for his Democratic opponent to have a little bit of bad luck, like that Comey letter 11 days before the 2016 election.

There was this duality that was going on that you often seem to mirror in the Republican Party of his allies today, of, publicly, they say one thing, privately, something else.

He may even violate them to some extent. He is going to dare and tempt any judge overseeing any of these cases to come after him and lock him up during these proceedings. They are starting to see this inside of Trump world as a winning hand. A fourth indictment might be four aces, as far as they're concerned at this point.And to some extent, and this is not meant as a criticism of the Justice Department or of the attorney general, Merrick Garland, but by waiting as long as they did, they did sort of welcome this possibility that Donald Trump could say, hey, wait a minute, you're doing this because we're right in the middle of a campaign. Now, obviously, the folks who will defend the Justice Department and the attorney general will say, no, it just took this long to get to this point. Well, it took too long and that it came right in the middle of this campaign process. And, of course, we may not see indictments brought to a trial until well into the Republican primaries of the next year. And who knows what happens after that? Laura, the other big question is, what does the Republican Party do with all of this?

I think like I can almost hear you thinking right now when it comes to any conversation about the notion of witness intimidation, voting rights deprivation, all these aspects that have been swirling around the former president of the United States. Tonight, Trump is saying that they could have charged him right after leaving office, but putting aside that the documents didn't become an issue, obviously, until after he left office, but those are just minor details. That's actually not how investigations work, right? Tell me about the timeline that he is that the DOJ is often criticized for. Do you see that timeline as problematic?",

One is obviously the campaigning. And what Trump is doing is he's providing all this political rhetoric and he's appealing to his base.But the other thing that should be going on is how the legal system works. And politics, on the one hand, moves much faster than the legal process works on the other. The thing about courts and a prosecutor is they take time to build their case. They follow the evidence. And so Jack Smith has done that. It takes a while. But meanwhile, Trump can occupy that space by making it sound as if, oh, they're just dragging their heels. No, they're doing their job. This is what a professional prosecutor does. It takes time to build a case and then to present it. And the political world is going to be moving much faster, so can sort of try and deflect people's attention from what's going on in the legal world.",

The more heated he gets in the political world, the worse trouble he's going to get in the legal world. And right now, Trump has a history of intimidating witnesses. He has a history of sort of inviting violence. And the thing to do, as you well know, if you're trying to figure out if somebody is posing a danger, is you infer from the circumstances and from the language what may be that person's purpose or what's the effect of what they're doing. And that's what we can do with Donald Trump. We can infer from that language, oh, he's trying to heat up the crowd, hopefully producing another riot. And at the same time, we can infer from that language, he's not acting in good faith. That's not a statement that somebody is really going to comply with the law.

The other words that could be used here, given the allegations, at least in the superseding indictment involving the Mar- a-Lago documents, and, again, this is not necessarily a case-specific Truth Social posts.It could be broad in a number of realms. He does have at least three indictments. But it could be viewed by special counsel as a warning to those who might be incentivized or willing to testify, whether they are yet unnamed or somebody who shares a portion of a caption.

It's more of a conflict with your lawyers than it is with a conversation among your students. The pedagogical aspects of this really not able to be the focus. Look, College Board is responding tonight and they say, quote, \"We hope now that Florida teachers will be able to teach the full course, including content on gender and sexual orientation, without fear of punishment in the upcoming. school year.\"I have an inkling that you don't think that this issue is now over, even in spite of that statement. Correct. I don't think this is over. I think the Department of Education is just trying to cover themselves up because they know that there are a lot of angry parents. Thirty thousand kids were supposed to take the AP Psychology exam. And back to your statement earlier about we start school in weeks, we actually start school in my district on Thursday, August 10th. So, we are scrambling as fast as we can to figure out some type of plan as an educator, what am I going to do with my students? And it's disheartening to see the Department of Education try and use a quick fix when College Board has laid out very clearly that unless the content can be taught in its entirety, including gender identity and sexual orientation, that the class just will not register as an AP Psychology class on any transcript if it's taught in the state of Florida.",

But at the end of the day, like we are humans and you know, we're not robots, we're not machines.And I think, you know, both physically, whether it's injuries or whatever it may be or, and mentally. And I think like that is so important that she was able to really think about herself first and her mental health because once again, she is showing this generation that, you know, you have the rest of your life to live. And that's something that my dad, who was my coach and Olympian himself, he really instilled in me was, gymnastics is just gonna be a short part and portion of your life.
