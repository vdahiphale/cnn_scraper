We'll have that next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:51:24] BURNETT: Right now, the defense is continuing its cross-examination of Trump's former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, asking Cohen about 95 secret recordings that Cohen kept on his phone, including some with reporters. Kristen Holmes and Paula Reid are back with me. All right. So, Paula, what do you think is the goal here? Obviously, they -- Blanche is making the point that Cohen recorded conversations without the other party knowing about them, which is allowed in New York. Although, of course, not a topic anybody would think is above board. But he's making a point, there were a lot of them.",

That is likely to then talk about this recording that came up. He never ended up playing the recording for David Pecker. He said, by then, everything had been solved, they were fine. But I do think also part of this is just to continue to paint Michael Cohen as unethical. And he, Blanche, asked Cohen about his previous testimony that the power of the \"National Enquirer\" was its placement in supermarkets. So that's why I don't know where he's going with this, but clearly, he says, \"Have you ever told anybody that before your testimony this week,\" Blanche asks.",

This is a significant thing for the defense to highlight, that, wait a second, you had -- for years, you've were talking about this. This has happened eight years ago and you're only remembering this now? Now, apparently, that Cohen is disputing Blanche's assertion that Michael Cohen testified about the power of the \"National Enquirer\" after David Pecker testified about the power of the \"National Enquirer.\" Cohen disputes this suggestion that he altered his testimony once he heard what David Pecker said. But this is not the first time that they're picking up on something he's never said before. If he can continue and establish a pattern, that could go a long way towards undermining Cohen's credibility.",
