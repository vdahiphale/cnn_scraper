      "sentences": "The Republican challenger, Adam Laxalt, still 8,054 votes ahead. That was closed to 13,000 just a few minutes ago. Forty-eight point nine to 48.0. So, he is one point ahead in this race. You see 449,000 thousand votes, 441,000. The new votes that just came in are from this northwest county, Washoe County, Reno, and the areas to the north of the border.I will go to the county. I just want to put the numbers up in front of you here. You see the latest numbers come in. Excuse me, one second, while I turn my back. This is what you're seeing on the side of the screen, 11,182, which is 61%. This is from Washout County. This is 6,565, which is 36%. So, why does that matter? Number one, you look at the statewide vote, she is trailing right now. So, she needs simple math at home of the additional votes that are being counted and getting reported over the next day or so. She obviously needs to overcome this. She needs to overcome by a smaller margin now because she's getting closer. So, the reason she closed the gap is that she got 61% of these votes, the 36% for Adam Laxalt. He has been winning so far, 50% of the vote statewide. So, any time in this new vote reports, she can pass that number. She needs to pass him by 51 or 52. But if she is getting 61, she is going to narrow that gap. I want to bring this down a little bit and move it down here to talk about why this is significant. The biggest batch of votes -- we can move it over here, excuse me, Wolf Blitzer -- biggest batch of votes is here. Still outstanding votes in Las Vegas, the suburbs around, the biggest part of the state. It's close to 75%, 73% to 74% of the population, it will be over 70% of the statewide vote. We were done counting them all. So, that's the most significant. But this is a swing county in the northwest part of the state. One of these places you look the winner here, especially in a close race. The winner of this county, eight times out of 10, if not more, is going to win the state. Fifteen percent of the population, second largest county in the state, she is getting 50% in the county right now. The new votes that came in was 61%. She's overperforming yesterday, if you will, and the day before with the early vote counts, which -- again, she is trailing, so she needs that, she is trailing statewide. Let me show you the governor's race, why this is important. Actually, now, this has changed. This is actually a change in the governor's race. Just moments ago, the incumbent, Steve Sisolak, he is still trailing statewide. This is Republican challenger, Joe Lombardo. A look to just a moment ago, Lombardo was winning in Washoe County. So as these new votes came in in the Senate race, they also tabulate in the governor's race and the democratic candidate has pulled ahead. I want to go to the statewide numbers in that race. So, we can come and see them here. You see that he is still behind, right? So, he is behind. So, Governor Sisolak, that's what he needs, right? Any vote count, he needs to overwhelmingly make up the gap. He is still behind. When it comes to the Senate race, she is behind by a much smaller margin, right, 800,000 votes, which is why this is so important. Over the next day or two, maybe later tonight as we get more of those votes, the raw vote total counts, but if you are trailing, you just need to beat that. He is ahead of you. But now, it is getting closer to the point where we're almost at a point where there is an even percentage. It is a point or two behind his. And so, if you are getting 61% in a swing county like that, you're incredibly encouraged. The question is, you know, and Gary Tuchman is on the ground for us there, how many votes are left and then what percentage of that do you need? Her percentage has shrunk a little bit in what she needs to win, which is progress for her.",

Now, we think our estimate is approximately 95,000 votes remain uncounted in Nevada.And after those votes were added, now the new needed to win percentage for Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democratic incumbent, is in this range of 52% to 54%. So, she needs 52% to 54% of that outstanding 95,000 in order to win this race. Now, Laxalt is still in the lead. So, his need percentage range is lower. He needs between 43% and 47%. But I just want to note, John was explaining this, she just won 61% of that batch in the Reno area. Now that means she significantly overperformed in that batch, what she needs with this outstanding vote. Not every batch will look like that. But that is how people should watch the votes coming in. Does Catherine Cortez Masto start achieving this 52% to 54% range of the remaining votes, Wolf?",

So, okay, you would stay at home unless you need to exceed her performance. That is absolutely right. She needs to do better in the remaining count than she has done so far.But -- and this is a very important but -- most of the votes, most of the votes, the preponderance of them, are here in Clark County where she is getting close to that 52%. So, if she can do a little bit better -- if in Clark County, she can turn that 52% to a 53% or a 54%, closer to 55%, then that would exponentially increase her odds of catching up because most of the votes are here. So, she is already close to what she needs at the statewide level here. This, obviously, you have to factor in these other counties, and there are other votes, as Brianna just explained. She can boost her total here where most of those votes are from, marginally, not a ton, and keep doing what she just did here, as David just noted, 60% the last time. She can stay around that ballpark street a little bit maybe, but stay up there, stay well above 50%. It's possible. Out here, you don't expect her to do that, in those counties. So, it's critical. She is running about 52% right now in Clark County. She needs to boost that number a bit in the remaining votes that come in, the percentage of each installment as we get more votes. And if she does, she is in play, but it is very tight, 8,000 votes. Nevada, like Arizona, very competitive.",

This is an 18-point swing from four years ago when he lost the independents by 10-percentage points. It gets even better for him among Latino voters. So, take a look here, in the Florida governor's race, Latinos split 58% for DeSantis, 40% for Christ. They made up 21% of the overall electorate. An 18-point advantage for DeSantis after he lost Latinos by 10 points four years ago, a 28-point swing.His opinion of governor and job approval, 59% of Florida voters this week said they approve of the job he did. Forty-one percent said they did not approve. And what about asking Florida voters if they think their governor should run for president? Well, 45% say yes, they want to see Ron DeSantis run in 2024 among the Florida voters. A slim majority, 52%, say no. But no doubt this next number will get a lot of attention at Mar-a- Lago and maybe a reason why we are seeing the press releases as we are. Do you want Donald Trump to run for president in 2024, we asked Florida voters, in this election this year? Only a third of Florida voters, 33%, said yes. Sixty-four percent of Florida voters, Dana, said they don't want to see Trump run in 2024.",

That certainly doesn't resonate with Hispanics in South Florida. I think the fact that you have candidates that are tailoring their messages to Hispanics who are pro-America, believe in the American dream, and who love this country tremendously, many of which are exiles from socialist and communist regimes, and feel that Republicans better understand the sort of trauma that they left their countries from.

In fact, one member said tonight, Bob Good, he's a Virginia Republican, he indicated tonight that they want to put up a challenger to Kevin McCarthy because -- not necessarily because they think that that challenger will win, but they want to demonstrate that Kevin McCarthy does not have 218 votes in the full House.And as a result, there will have to be some deals cut to get a whole wide range of concessions about, essentially, giving them more power over the speakership, assuming that McCarthy would have agreed to these changes. They essentially would be able to push him out of office if they did not like something that he has done. Among the wide range of other measures, make themselves more powerful and weaken the power of the leadership, something that the leadership very likely will resist. McCarthy has rejected a number of those suggestions. Now, McCarthy also has had conversation, we have learned, with President Biden himself. Just yesterday, they had a brief discussion, a short discussion. Joe Biden, earlier tonight, revealed some details about the short talk. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But then you go to the House floor and there is a vote of the whole House of Representatives.And so, if members of your own party -- if you have -- let's say 222, needs to 218, I'm not moderately good at math but it just takes a few of them to withhold their votes. And if you don't have the support, then you're not the speaker.

Now, it's a four-week time slot.He is going to want to be involved, God forbid, Ron DeSantis goes to campaign for Herschel Walker. Is Trump going to just let him do that without showing up in Georgia himself? I mean, people in Georgia are going to be, no, stay away. But who can control Donald Trump? No one can control Donald Trump. So, I mean, I just think those dynamics, it's totally different in the event that Senate control is not on the line. I think -- I was turning this over in my head.
