The casket is on its way to the cemetery for a private funeral service. The 24-hour public wake so packed with mourners, thousands of people in line were turned away. More than 230,000 people paid their respects, according to the Santos football club. Among them, Brazilian president Lula da Silva. We have Stefano Pozzebon and Julia Vargas Jones live in Santos, Brazil. Also joining us, is CNN senior sports analyst, Darren Lewis, Julia, I want to start with you.

People told me, there will never be another Pele because he was a trail blazer. You can't copy him, because he did something at a time when it was unthinkable. His achievements could never be replicated. You'd have to go back in time. Ladies, old ladies and young kids, telling me about what he meant to them. Some people, they weren't even alive to see him play. You know we spoke to a 5-year old in line, that told us that he just wanted to catch a glimpse of Pele before he was brought here to the cemetery for his final resting place. A 16-year old said the highlight of his brief, young life was to have met Pele and just take a photo with him. That was who he was. He was a natural for the limelight. He was a celebrity, he was the embodiment of a celebrity. So it was easy for people to connect with him, because he would come to your level. He would show up and say, hi, hello, sign shirts and he had this beautiful handwriting. Anybody that has an autograph from him says, look, it's so pretty, the way he writes his name. We met people that had shirts signed by Pele. They tell us they haven't washed it in 20 years. That's the legacy he's leaving behind. That's how people remember him. I think this morning, as his casket was being taken from the stadium, into the fire truck that you probably see in those live images, there was a big drumline surrounding that fire truck. There's a big sendoff from the organized cheering squad, telling us that, we are celebrating his legacy. It's not only a solemn time; yes, the ceremony that will take place behind me, it will be a solemn moment for the family, it's private. But the public, they want to celebrate his legacy and who he was and what he meant for the entire country. So there is a moment of joy. I think people are allowing themselves to let it all out, especially after this very difficult year. We're also coming out of a pandemic. Brazil was hit so hard, so many deaths; 700,000, I believe. And this is an opportunity to come together, to celebrate the legacy of a man that just means so much, Eleni, to Brazilians.",

We'vetalked about it many times over the past few days, the 77 goals he scored to make him the joint top scorer for his country. The three World Cups, the only footballer ever to manage that in the men's game and his ability to connect the world with a love of his incredible skill on the pitch. But there is also, more importantly, that societal legacy, that Julia did so well to sum up and Stefano as well to touch on, because you know he gave a voice to Black Brazilians, Eleni. Bear in mind he was born only 50 years or so after the abolition of slavery in Brazil. He helped to fight racism. He was, for me -- I know there's lots of debate about it but, for me, he was the first Black global sporting superstar, I'd argue, ahead of the likes of Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson and even the legendary Muhammad Ali. If you think about Neymar, it was his post, the PSG superstar, last week, that, for me, spoke best to the legacy of the greatest footballer of all- time. He said, look, Pele give a voice to the poor, to Black people and especially to Brazil. That, Eleni, is why these scenes of chaos, these streets being lined with hundreds of thousands of people wanting to say that a final goodbye, on his final journey. Because this was a man of the people. I think about the time that he scored the 1000th goal and he used that platform to remind the world, that, while they were seduced by his brilliance on the pitch, that they should think about those people last well off. They should think about their relationship with people of a different color, a different, race a different social class. He was the embodiment of so much more than football, of sport. And she was absolutely right. This is the man that stands astride of the beautiful game. He's a guy who just impacted, transcends sport and will be remembered forever.",

Now I think, despite all of those words from Ben-Gvir, from people in the region and the Palestinians, of course, the two main voices we need to pay attention to most are those of the United States and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We heard from the U.S. embassy spokesman, saying that ambassador night (ph) has been very clear in conversations with the Israeli government on the issue of preserving the status quo in Jerusalem's holy site. Actions, the spokesman said, preventing that are unacceptable. Subsequently President Netanyahu felt compelled to put out his own statement. His office saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu is committed to strictly maintaining the status quo without changes on the Temple Mount. Reiterating what he said before his government was sworn in.

Other countries, like Morocco, have gone a step further, completely banning, prohibiting travel from China to Moroccan soil for the time being. And this is frankly embarrassing to Beijing, which has basically imposed isolation for the better part of three years, closing its borders, while maintaining zero COVID. Now that COVID is growing out of control across China, it has announced that, as of Sunday, it is going to end mandatory quarantine for people coming into the country.
