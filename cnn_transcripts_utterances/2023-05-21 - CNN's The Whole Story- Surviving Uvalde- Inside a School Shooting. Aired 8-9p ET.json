      "sentences": "Good evening. Welcome to \"The Whole Story\". I'm Anderson Cooper on May 24, 2022. A gunman walked into Rob Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas and killed 19 children and two teachers before he was finally killed by Police 77 minutes later.It's one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. And what makes it even harder to understand is that 376 law enforcement personnel responded to the scene, but it took them more than an hour before they actually moved to breach the classroom and confront the shooter. They waited while children inside lay injured and dying. Over the past year, CNN Shimon Prokupecz and his team have been digging for answers and through sources they've obtained the entire investigative case file which includes thousands of documents, hundreds of hours of footage and multiple audio recordings. If all the city officials haven't seen all this evidence, neither have the families of the victims until now. In this next hour, we're going to show you a new video from the aftermath and it's tough to watch and sometimes shocking. The only images or sound from children are those who survived that day and the only sound of gunfire you'll hear is between police and the shooter. Now we've shown the footage you're about to see to all the parents of the surviving children who are in the video and they've given us approval to show all of it. They told Shimon they want people to understand what this kind of violence does to kids and hope the reality of this video will lead to some change. They also hope police responding to future shootings will learn from this Surviving Uvalde: Inside a School Shooting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
