(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem early Wednesday, where Palestinians worship during the holy month of Ramadan. Video put out by the Israeli police shows officers entering the mosque by force as fireworks are launched at them. Videos on social media appear to show officers striking people with batons. Eyewitnesses telling CNN, police also fired stun grenades and rubber bullets. The police said in a statement that they went in because hundreds of what they called rioters and mosque desecraters barricaded themselves inside in a violent manner and, quote, \"threw fireworks, hurled stones and caused damage.\" The authorities arrested more than 300 people during the incident. The Palestinian Red Crescent saying at least 2 dozen Palestinians were injured. Israeli police say two of their officers were also wounded.",

They are entitled to see that and, at the same time, equally, the defense is going to make a motion practice, basically challenging the evidence, challenging the law, saying that he can't get a fair trial in Manhattan because a lot of people in New York City, especially in Manhattan, where he's charged, he's going to say are Democratic leaning and didn't vote for him. And so he's going to make lots of motion practice trying to get the case delayed, get it moved away from Manhattan and charges dismissed. I don't think he will be successful in any of those.

Thank you very much, indeed.Well, let's connect you to Europe where Belarus' president is on a two day working visit to Russia. Alexander Lukashenko is there for talks with Vladimir Putin with the war in Ukraine, of course, very much on the agenda. The Kremlin says a new peace proposal by Belarus will likely be discussed. On Thursday, the leaders will attend the meeting of the supreme state council of the union state, as it's known. And that is the highest governing body of the union state of Russia and Belarus. Meantime, over in Poland, Ukraine's president has just been awarded the country's highest honor, the Order of the White Eagle. Polish president Andrzej Duda called Volodymyr Zelenskyy man about standing qualities (ph) during a ceremony at the presidential palace in Warsaw. And Mr. Duda also hailed the people of Ukraine as heroic, saying he had no doubt that Mr. Zelenskyy would save the country from Russian aggression. And in Brussels, the head of NATO has reaffirmed the alliance's support for Ukraine, saying continued support is essential. Jens Stoltenberg also said it would be an historic mistake for China to supply lethal aid to Russia and added that Sweden should become a NATO ally as soon as possible. Lots to unpack here with our teams around the world:  David McKenzie is in Kyiv; CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon.

A lot of pomp and circumstance as you'd expect. And the meetings have been substantive between the Polish president and the Ukrainian president. I think what is mostly on the agenda, of course, is the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the need for Ukraine to get full support. President Zelenskyy did talk a lot about the importance that their Western neighbor has had in this conflict, first from a humanitarian point of view, saying that Polish citizens opened their arms to Ukrainians fleeing the first days of this conflict. And of course, Poland has been on the very edge of support in terms of pushing other allies in Europe and in the U.S. to expand the financial and military support of the Ukraine's war efforts. Take a listen to President Zelenskyy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  You have not abandoned Ukraine. You stood with us, shoulder to shoulder.

But he also said that the reason they might have to do that is if they run low on ammunition. And you've seen again today a recommitment by Poland to help Ukraine and overnight a substantial increase in U.S. military aid to the country:  $2.6 billion announced by the White House, both drawdown ammunition, meaning coming from existing U.S. stockpiles, like HIMARS munitions and Patriots missile system munitions.

And that is the message really that we are getting, even here at the Pentagonon a daily basis, is that what the Ukrainians really need the most right now, apart from these heavy munitions, apart from the very sophisticated Western systems, is just fundamentally that ammunition. And what secretary of state Antony Blinken was discussing just now at a press conference following that meeting with his fellow foreign ministers at NATO was this need, of course, to keep up with Ukraine's needs. And he acknowledged that it's going to be difficult but that ultimately what they are all working on and what that was most discussed at this meeting is going to be maintaining that support for the Ukrainians and giving them the ammunition that they need. And of course, we have seen efforts in the U.S. and in Europe to ramp that up. There has have been a lot of new efforts underway in the United States to increase the amount of production of ammunition as well as in different countries in Europe that is ongoing. There's questions about whether or not they're going to be able to do that, just given the logistics. But that is top of mind, of course, for the NATO foreign ministers right now, is how to keep up with this demand, especially with Ukraine using so many resources to keep this city of Bakhmut. And of course, it is something that the U.S. had originally advised them against, using so many resources to try to take the city that the U.S. and the Pentagon did not believe was very strategic. And so what we're seeing now is kind of an effort to keep up with the Ukrainians, figure out how to build up their arsenal, really, to deter and defend against the Russians, who do not show any signs of letting up, either, but also, of course, just to show Ukraine that they are with them, really, until the very end here.

We were with Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister at NATO, again, making sure that we support Ukraine through its victory, even after its victory because, afterwards, it will still be a neighbor of a very aggressive Russia.

We're also seeing a more muted military response and last time we saw U.S. -- then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visit Taiwan.

Now the timing there is very clear in that they're trying to send a message about how unhappy they are, about this meeting, moving forward. But remember, though, that last summer, when Pelosi went to Taiwan, Beijing reacted with these unprecedented military drills that essentially simulated a blockade of the island. It's not expected that this visit is going to create that kind of reaction because the meeting is happening on American soil. It's not happening in Taiwan.

China is a key trading partner, not just for France  but for the E.U. We're also seeing the European Commission chief come along to this trip, Ursula van der Leyen. Now there is a lot of skepticism, though, about how much Macron can really do when it comes to China, playing more of a peacemaking role. We know that China has refused to condemn the invasion. It has refused to even call it an invasion; in fact instead, we're seeing Putin and Xi Jinping increase their ties. Russia and China increase their partnership. This meeting of Macron to Beijing comes only weeks after Xi Jinping went to Moscow, where he and Putin had reaffirmed their partnership in a whole variety of areas. Nonetheless, from Beijing's perspective, this meeting with Macron is also going to be key for China to reconnect with the world after three years of devastating zero COVID restrictions that also sought China's economy heavily damaged.
