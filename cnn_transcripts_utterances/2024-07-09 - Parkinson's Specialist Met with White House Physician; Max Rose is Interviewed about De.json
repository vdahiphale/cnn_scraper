On Monday, the press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, was asked repeatedly about these meetings, and she struggled to answer the questions.

And that's going to make it very, very difficult to make this campaign a referendum on Donald Trump, which is the only way even Biden people concede they can win.MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": And look, it seems clear that they are so used to being able to obfuscate this issue that they are not prepared for the calls for more transparency. And I think on the one hand you have the transparency issue of what do they know that they're not telling us, right, such as this letter that they belatedly put out after refusing to answer the question and thinking that they could get away with it, and now they are acknowledging that more information is needed, that people do want to know what the nature of these visits was. But there's also the question of whether Joe Biden is being honest with himself. When he said to George Stephanopoulos that he hasn't had any of these types of cognitive tests, I think that raised a lot of questions with people of, well, why isn't he? Given what we have seen, given the questions that so many people have, why not have further testing, why not have more disclosure to put people's worries to rest?

MAX ROSE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (D-NY): Yes, look, I - I think that it's important to actually reconsider the way we're framing this campaign. These concerns will never go away. And, guess what, the concerns were there before the debate. And despite those concerns, there is a resounding belief in Joe Biden's capacity to lead and his extraordinary record. But I would definitely urge the campaign too really have this deep sense of vigilance and to stay hyper aggressive and to be old school. What you saw yesterday on \"Morning Joe\" was the president just calling in and doing a freewheeling interview. And I think that's what the people are looking for. Some of the anger on Capitol Hill right now is actually not associated with the debate, but associated with the silence of the campaign in the days after the debate.
