And 34 percent say, potentially 10 years from now. So, you add it together, there are 42 percent who are saying, this is not a risk decades from now, this is something in the not too distant future. And listen, this comes after we've heard a number of leading figures sound the alarm on A.I. Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of A.I. He says that there's a risk that eventually A.I. becomes so smart that it can manipulate humans and, get this, override restrictions that are put in place.

It's called, 2020 DB5, and it's the largest of the next five asteroids approaching the planet.Joining us now for more perspective is Adam Frank.

ADAM FRANK, PROFESSOR OF ASTROPHYSICS, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER AND AUTHOR, \"THE LITTLE BOOK OF ALIENS\":  Yes, people take it for granted. We've been doing this for a while. So, I was like, oh, yes, you just, you know, go out, you know, put on your suit and wonder around. But, you know, space has a lot of ways to kill you. And so, you know, anytime you go out there, it's dangerous. And you know, you wear -- you have to bring the planet with you. You know, that space suit is this battery-operated, you know, exterior planet in some sense that you wrap around yourself. And you know, if anything fails, you're in trouble. Basically, in space, you get 15 seconds. If you were to, you know, if something were to break and you were exposed to space, you have basically 15 seconds before you pass out, and 90 seconds before you're gone. So, you know, any time these guys step outside, or you know, women as well, step outside, it's super dangerous.

And what we just found around Enceladus, which is the moon around Jupiter, has all of the elements that are necessary for life, carbon, oxygen, now phosphorous as well, sulfur. But we just found phosphorus which is the last one we needed.All life on Earth uses this compound as the, kind of, biochemical framework for life.

If you are look at the trends over the last two decades, really, if you look at homicide rates, they really jumped during the pandemic. That first year, 2019 to 2020, we saw an increase of more than 30 percent in the homicide rate, bringing it up to where the suicide rate is in this age group between 10 and 24. Now, in terms of the increase in suicides in this age group, that's been rising steadily since 2007, really about 62 percent over that time period. Now, they are both at a rate of about 11 percent 100,000, or put in real numbers, that's about 7,000 deaths per year in this age group in the United States. That is really crazy to think about. Even crazier is when you start to dig into the data by the different age categories, if you look at the youngest kids who were studied in the CDC report, kids between ages 10 and 14, you'll see a particularly troubling trend when it comes to suicide rates. That tripled between 2007 and 2018. So, this is something that mental health experts, public health experts, in general, are paying extremely close attention to.
