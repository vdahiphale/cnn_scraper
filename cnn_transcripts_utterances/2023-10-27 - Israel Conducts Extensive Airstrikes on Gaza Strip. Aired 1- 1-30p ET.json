      "sentences": "Yes, it began about three hours ago. It's been heavy through the afternoon, but it really began about three hours ago, I would say, heavy artillery fire and missile strikes going into Gaza.There are a couple of artillery batteries not far away from where we are, and they were both sending repeat heavy round after round after round. You could hear the -- you could hear the guns firing. You could hear the detonations behind us. And then, after that, there were -- the tank fire started up, tanks from positions close to here that we haven't heard before, a lot of tank fire really sustained from a number of different tanks. And during that time, a huge wall of smoke came up from Gaza, carried on the wind through the area where we are here. You could taste it. You could smell it. And it was a sort of smoke that the military would use to maneuver hidden from the enemy. So we don't know if this was smoke being used for an incursion. We don't know if those tanks were being used for an incursion. What we do know is, when we have stood here on the recent nights and we have seen tank fire, it means we find out the day after from the IDF that there has been an incursion. There were the hallmarks here of a potential incursion. But from where we have been, it is the tanks and the artillery pieces and the small arms that have been doing the talking, perhaps drowning out the negotiations going on in Doha, perhaps adding emphasis to Israel's position. But, as we know, Hamas has also responded by firing its rockets into Tel Aviv, where you are. So, is what we're seeing on the battlefield an amplification of positions held at those talks to create more pressure, or is it the breakdown in talks? But what we're witnessing here is a definitive uptick in tensions, in artillery fire, in tank fire. Where it goes after tonight, what it means going forward is not clear as we stand here. But, definitely, it's the guns doing the talking tonight -- Anderson, Jake.",

And they have been largely destroyed by the Iron Dome. If it weren't for Iron Dome, I mean, the Israeli casualties would be in the tens, if not hundreds of thousands. It seems today in Tel Aviv, because of the alerts, it seems like there was an increase in Palestinian attacks on Tel Aviv. And, anecdotally, just because of the app that they have for Israelis in terms of the red alerts in different neighborhoods, different areas of Israel, it seemed, anecdotally, that there was an increase in Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.

Not so many rockets here on our location today. What I can tell you specifically from here -- perhaps it's anecdotal, but we know from our experience here, when you take out the Iron Dome from the equation -- and we understood that's what happened here temporarily -- the missiles hit. They hit the building next door to us. They hit a number of other locations here in this town. Iron Dome is absolutely essential, but Hamas knows that, Islamic Jihad knows that, and they will have over the past few weeks tried to analyze when their missiles get through. What pattern of missiles? How many do you fire in which direction? How many do you fire in a slightly different direction? How soon after? They try to create patterns that will defeat the ability of the Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a very intelligent computerized system that detects the incoming missiles, knows which battery to fire against them. But when the batteries fired those rounds, it still needs to reload. So, Hamas will have studied this to try to find the weak points, and perhaps that's what we were witnessing this evening. Certainly, when I saw all those lights light up on the app and hear the pings, that was a sense it created to me, Jake.",

And, in fact, the minister of defense, Gallant, said today in a briefing, he said on the record, something along the lines of, all the money that went into Gaza over the years, did they build a university? Did they build a factory? No, they built tunnels and rockets. And they really described this elaborate network, and they described them as bomb-proof -- I mean, airstrike-proof. And this is something that they -- A, they fear that this is why they think they have -- they took the hostages, they kidnapped these people, so as to prevent the Israelis from just, like, firebombing, napalming the tunnels, because there are 224 innocent people in there. What can they do in phase two with a ground incursion when it comes to the tunnels? That just sounds absolutely terrifying to go into the tunnels.",

DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  ... following instructions, they're going to save your life. The enemy is launching missiles. And if you're going to save spaces, you're going to save your life. Recently, we managed to get many alerts from citizen regarding troubles with the application of the Central Command. This application is one tool in order to let, alert you in real time. There are alerts and Telegram of the Central Command. Please use all the tools in order to be informed. So far, we notified 310 dead soldiers and 229 abductees. Our heart is with the abductees in this Shabbat evening. We are committed for the national mission to return them home. We are summarizing the third week of the war. Hundreds of thousands of IDF soldiers are all around the borders of the state in the air, ground and the sea in order to protect the state. In the last day, we see many rockets launched towards Israel. I said and I'm going to say again we have good protection for the state of Israel. And we know how to deal with threats. And we saw the air force. This is not automatic defense. Please listen to the instructions of the Central Command, and the safe spaces are saving life. And we're going to intercept as many as possible, but it's not automatic. QUESTION (through translator):  You exposed the Shifa Hospital activity. Does it mean that the IDF is going to attack there, they're going to -- and is there going to be any deal with -- for the cease- fire for hostages? HAGARI (through translator):  We're going to bring additional information and many more videos of interrogations of terrorists. We're going to bring additional information regarding using infrastructure by using hospital or civil infrastructure, cynical usage that using the civilian as a live human shield. We cannot let terror be active from hospitals and attack our citizens. We cannot let it happen, not the state of Israel. We will not let it happen. Regarding the rumors about a deal with the hostages, I advise you not to deal with rumors. We're talking terror and psychological terror and a cynical usage of Hamas. We are going to bring you any reliable information and relevant. We will give it to the families, and then we're going to update the public. Until then, please don't give into manipulation of the psychological terror of Hamas. Last question.",

The exact size and scope of that, he did not go into.Colonel Cedric Leighton is joining us as well. Colonel, to you, what does that mean, the ground operation expanding? LEIGHTON:  So, Anderson, I think what we're seeing here is that more moves by the Israeli forces using armor and possibly infantry units, infantry squads going into specific target areas, is what it sounds like at the moment. Now, this incursion may take the form of a massive movement of forces, or it may take a movement -- the form of much smaller, more precise special operations-like movements. We don't know that yet, obviously. But it seems as if this is the start of that particular movement that will perhaps gain them a little bit more territory. Perhaps they're going after certain targets. It seems to also be done in concert with both air activity, as well as naval activity. So it seems to be a multipronged approach, using all the elements of Israeli IDF, Israeli Defense Force, power. And that could very well mean that they're going after targets in the north, it seems like, more Gaza City and the area just south of there. So, I would basically say the northern half of the country right now seems to be the center of interest. There could still be activity in the south, of course, and in other areas, but we just haven't heard about that yet.",

And there are two missions that the fixed-wing aircraft, the normal fighter jets, like an F-16 or an F-15, could carry out. And those missions are very much in term -- in line with close air support missions. It is not the only thing those aircraft can do, but they can very much be used for that. It would be a little bit difficult for them to do it in a very crowded area. And they'd have to deconflict, in other words, make sure that they don't target their own, don't hit their own forces, but they can absolutely use both rotary-wing and fixed-wing assets to perform close air support missions.
