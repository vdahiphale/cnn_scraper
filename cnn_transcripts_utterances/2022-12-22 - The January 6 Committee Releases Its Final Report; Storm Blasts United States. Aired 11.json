It is now public, it is now online, it's on our own website as well as the House's website as well, so follow along, we are going to dig in deep into this report and what you need to know.It's a result, by the way, of over a thousand interviews and documents, including emails and texts, phone records, and a year and a half of investigations. Of course, this is after the 10 public hearings we all witnessed and the day's events on January 6th. The report includes allegations that the former president, Donald Trump -- quote -- \"oversaw\" -- unquote -- the effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states that he has lost. This report was just released a little over an hour ago and it outlines eight chapters. Chapter 1, the big lie. Chapter 2, I just want to find the 11,780 votes. Chapter 3, fake electors and the president of the Senate strategy. Chapter 4 -- which, of course, is the vice president. Chapter 4, just call it corrupt and leave the rest to me. You're remembering from the public hearings, huh? Chapter 5, a coup in search of a legal theory. Chapter 6, be there, will be wild. Chapter 7, 187 minutes of dereliction alluding to what the president was doing while the attack on the Capitol unfolded. And Chapter 8, analysis of the attack. And yes, we are going through this line by line, the findings. The report covering 845 pages. We're also here bringing you tonight the reporting, the analysis you need to understand and contextualize in light of all that we've already seen and heard from on this late Thursday evening here in Washington, D.C., the only way that CNN can. Let's go back to justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider, in our Washington newsroom. She is pouring through the findings for us. It's after 11:00 p.m. now here on the east coast. Jessica, we're going through all these chapters. We are pouring over the details. There is a lot in this report. What is the latest?",

He gave a name -- he gave a place, he gave a time, and he gave what the motivation was which was, of course, \"stop the steal.\"And so, what the report is doing, you're going to hear from a lot of lawyers about the litigation side, the politics of this, who testified and who didn't. On the radicalization side, there is a lot of material in here. Remember, the report begins with \"stop the steal.\" What people have to remember is every piece, from the fake electors to the January 6th violence, to all the craziness of Giuliani to the issues of what Trump was saying, all of it is based around a single narrative, which is \"stop the steal.\" Some people are bringing legal challenges, some people are playing politics, some media folks are supporting Trump. And then you have the violent wing. But they are all working together. This is what is remarkable about the report, is that they (INAUDIBLE) connective tissue, right? Are all these pieces (INAUDIBLE)? Basically, the connective tissue is the \"stop the steal,\" the lie from the beginning that Trump was promoting. He is the connective tissue from the well-paid lawyers who are fighting in Georgia to the -- to the radical extremist insurrectionists who are trying to kill police officers. Their connective tissue is Trump. And I think that the report is very, very successful in showing that narrative outside of all the very important details that come out as well.",

It wasn't that he was throwing out random things and then can say, oh, my goodness, what happened? He understood, he clearly understood. He is a creature of social media. He is a creature of radicalization. He understood how his people were hearing them.He's telling us what to do, he's telling us why we're doing it, the vote has been stolen, and he's telling us what he needs to happen, is that he emerges at the Capitol. Remember, one of the biggest testimonies coming out was, of course, Trump trying to get to the Capitol. Why is that? It is because his people understood that his presence there would then be sort of a rallying cry for some delay. That's what they needed. They need to buy time so that the electoral votes were not certified. That is what the violence is about. The violence had a legal agenda. It is hard for people to understand. But the violence's purpose was to create enough delay, that the next day, if you're not certified, the next, all the legal shenanigans would happen, which is clearly what we now know to be the plan. And so, that is what is going on, that radicalization, Trump understood that's what his people wanted. And what lessons that we can draw from this? One is, of course, the lesson that the committee is telling us, which is this man cannot be president again. The other is that these groups are for real, they are anti-democratic, they do not believe in a peaceful transfer of power, so continue to prosecute them, continue to go after the leadership, and denigrate these organizations much like they have been in the last couple months.

So, I think there's a lot of good lessons to be learned from this. We should not be afraid of calling domestic terrorism what it is. It's a violent threat. Bad ideologies will exist in this country. They always do. And I do want to end with this: The committee report and Thompson, who really should get a lot of credit for this, I know Cheney does, as she should as well, this is -- does not get distracted. This is what is really important. In the end of the report is about the peaceful transfer of power. All the other staff, the Trump craziness, the finances, the hate that we hear in the media and elsewhere, that's also a secondary. Focusing on violence and a peaceful transfer of power is sort of the big takeaway here.

Indulge me for a moment as I -- and I want to hear your reaction initially to it because you had a particular segment that was really impactful, I think, you said about Congresswoman Liz Cheney.Before we get there, let me just read for you for a second a really significant part here. It is page 586 of this 845-page report. It gives some really good context here. Here's what it says, President Trump -- finally, he told the crowd where to go to, to -- quote -- \"take back our country.\" So, we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. We are going to the Capitol, and we are going to try and give -- we are going to try and give our Republicans the weak ones because the strong ones do not need any of our help. We are going to try and give them he kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So, let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. When the president announced his intentions from the microphone, people listened. House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, called Hutchinson mid-speech. Do you guys think you are coming to my office, he asked her. She assured him that they were not coming at all. Figure it out. Don't come up here, he replied. The announcement from the stage put the Secret Service on alert, prompting agents to designate over email a last-minute response team to filter in with the crowds on the president's walk/motorcade over to the Capitol and establish an emergency plan if things go south. White House security officials were monitoring the situation in real time, remarking that President Trump was going to the Capitol and that they are finding the best route now. Nonetheless, these staffers were in a state of shock because they knew, particularly, if the president joined, this would no longer be a rally. We all knew that this was going to move to something else if he physically walked to the Capitol, an employee said. I don't know if you want to use the word \"insurrection,\" \"coup,\" whatever, we all knew that this would move from a normal democratic public event into something else. But the logistics made the move all but impossible. Ron -- we heard some pieces, Ron, from different testimony. Having it eliminated in this way, what is your reaction?",

But the report does zoom in so tightly on him and his immediate circle, that it's somewhat cropped out of the picture for large number of other Republicans in Congress and in the states, who are willing in different ways, Laura, to advance the scheme.I mean, as in the executive summary, it largely gives the benefit of the doubt to the fake elector, suggesting that they were duped by the Trump campaign into participating. It discusses very little of the extensive communication from Republican members of Congress with Mark Meadows throughout this entire period, including one call for the declaration of martial law to stay in office. This is a report with one goal, I think, overall to make the case that Donald Trump violated his oath of office, violated the law, is unfit to ever again serve as president. But I think it leaves open the question of how broadly the rot that he set in motion really spread across party and the willingness to overturn a democratic election to stay in power.",

Can you reasonably say that you believe that you actually won this election and the report is thorough in that belief, if it was there, is nonsensical? But there's a part. And Ron, I'm going to read it. I know that you feel strongly about this particular part. It was part of the foreword from Congresswoman Liz Cheney. She says, part of the tragedy of January 6th is the conduct of those who knew that what happened was profoundly wrong, but nevertheless tried to downplay it, minimize it, or defend those responsible. That effort continues every day. Today, I am perhaps most disappointed in many of my fellow conservatives who know better, those who stood against the threats of communism and Islamic terrorism but concluded that it was easier to appease Donald Trump, or keep their heads down.

I think if there's any criticism in this committee, which has done incredible work in terms of tenacity and creativity and presenting the evidence to the public, the only question would be whether they are too focused on the idea that dealing with Trump himself will deal with this broader problem. Yes, they talk about political extremists, but they -- do they really grapple with the way this has spread within the mainstream political universe? And I think there are questions on that front. For example, when you talk about, when they say there should be more accountability, they're talking about lawyers.

This committee has done painstaking interviews to try to corroborate what Cassidy Hutchinson said. And they've detailed in these particular six pages of their report, they say that they have interviewed numerous people associated and working for the Secret Service as well as the White House. They say they've come up with witnesses describing the president as angry, irate, and furious. And in particular, this is something that our team reported one month ago that we are now getting confirmation of in this committee report, the fact that the driver of the vehicle was, in fact, interviewed and seemed to corroborate the fact that the president was animated and irritated.

Of course, that was never proven, that was completely false. But when Sidney Powell was telling Donald Trump her theory on this, Hope Hicks says that Donald Trump put the phone on mute and then explained to everyone else in the room, that sounds pretty crazy, doesn't it? So, that was his initial assessment of this. Laura, crucially, the president never publicly disavowed Sidney Powell's claims. Instead, despite releasing a statement saying that she was no longer part of the legal team, Donald Trump did seem to go along with Rudy Giuliani's claims, Sidney Powell's false election fraud claims, even though in private, it appears he viewed them as -- quote -- \"crazy.\"",

I know that we have a huge threshold in this country or an ideal in this country that voters know best. But when voters are deluged with lies and conspiracy theories, the way that we know this happened during the whole January 6th and even before, we have to hold our elected officials to a much higher threshold.

And they are all accurate and important, sort of strayed with (ph) or other details that they did not make part of their package that they showed the American people, but it is part of this meticulous report for two reasons. One, history. We don't have anything like the 9/11 report that goes through everything. But two, DOJ, my old employer, because this is their roadmap to accountability. These details say about Stone, about Chesebro, great example. He did not figure too much in the hearings but he is really important. All the things that DOJ can then pick up the ball with and decide what to put together as far as criminal information and indictments come because they have their own information now. There is this (INAUDIBLE) and, as you know, that can be really synergistic when they are trying to make cases. So, a lot of this is the (INAUDIBLE) for the DOJ.",
