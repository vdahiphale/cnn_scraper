Silence is not golden in this case. So it seems as if the more they try, the worse it is. It's so ham-handed at this point. And what's very interesting is how they're putting all of the blame, so to speak, on Kate herself. So here -- you know, here Princess Kate is recovering. We can't see her yet. She's operating as her own media agent at the same time. It's highly suspicious to people like myself who work in crisis management, but also to the general public as well.",

Conspicuously absent, Brianna, is the Haiti's Prime Minister, who was not at the meeting today. Blinken has been calling on Ariel Henry to form a transitional government, something that Henry has resisted in the past. But the U.S. is pushing forward, saying that they have the funding for a force of about 1,000 Kenyan soldiers to come to Haiti and begin to restore order, take on those violent gangs that have pushed this nation to the brink of collapse.You've already seen over the last several days several embassies beginning to take out their personnel from heavily guarded compounds, saying they simply cannot operate anymore in Haiti. The U.S. removed some non-essential personnel. They had to fly in a military helicopter in the middle of the night over the weekend and take out those non- essential personnel, also bring in more security to keep the embassies safe. And you're starting to see around Port-au-Prince areas that had once been relatively safe, the presidential palace, the area where the embassies and diplomats' compounds are located, come under gang violence and gunfire and receive some of those coordinated attacks that we're seeing more and more of. For the Haitian people, it is an entirely different story. Thousands have been forced from their homes, cannot receive any aid, cannot get to hospitals. They're essentially being terrorized before the entire world by these gangs that have said that they do not want Ariel Henry returning to the country. They do not want him as prime minister. They do not want the security force coming in, and they are flagrantly violating the calls from the international community to stop the violence. So this situation is not improving anytime soon -- Brianna.",

And you show this story of her. She's having this weekend with a number of her girlfriends. She's going back to her home to be with her child, and she mistakenly reverses her car, Cara.

This ranch was in a very remote location, you know, a small town. The sheriff's office probably hasn't seen a case like this.Very few people knew Angela and her husband. They had been a little bit private with some of the information surrounding it. And in response to requests for information, they said a statement that was something along the lines of, our preliminary investigation suggests this was an accidental death, but we're treating it as a criminal matter. So, that's simply a formality to say the investigation is ongoing from what our reporting tells us. This was an accident, as we described.",

I'll just, you know, get out of the car or I'll break a window. In fact, all of these things are very difficult to do.We learned through our reporting that, really, you have about a minute to get out of a car that's submerging itself into water. And opening a door is nearly impossible because of water pressure. Even breaking windows, and even if you have a tool that will break a window, can be extremely difficult, not underwater and underwater even more so. So, that's part of the reason why this reporting just was so surprising to us to learn that it would have been very difficult for Angela to know what to do in that scenario.",

You have half of American parents who also participated in the study saying that they have at some point looked through their teen smartphones. It appears that the teens are generally aware of this. 43 percent of teens saying that they know that their parents have looked through their smartphones.
