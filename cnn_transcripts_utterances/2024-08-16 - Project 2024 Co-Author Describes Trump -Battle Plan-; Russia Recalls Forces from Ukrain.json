Why is this a big issue, this idea of eliminating taxes on tips?TED PAPPAGEORGE, SECRETARY-TREASURER, CULINARY UNION:  Well, thank you so much for having me on. Look, there's a couple things. One, the idea that the current tax structure it's not etched in stone. It was brought in by Ronald Reagan in 1983. And it's quite rich that the -- you know, there's this heavy push on going after basically workers, working folks that are making tips. When we see this issue, as we talk about big corporations and billionaires like Trump that don't pay taxes. So -- but what the thing that you heard from the vice president is really key. It's not just the idea of taxes on tips. We think the IRS has overreached on that. But it's also the idea of raising up the minimum wage. In most states in the country, they have a subminimum wage, and many of them are $2.13 an hour. So, a company can pay you, if you make tips, $2.13 an hour, and that's outrageous.

It's doing great, but the price of food, gas, housing are out of control because of big food, big oil, and large Wall Street landlords price gouging.And look, this idea of taxes on tips being just, you know, not the way to go is part of that program of looking at working class families and what affects them. And look, we're just saying that tips should be treated differently than wages when it comes to taxes. But look, in Nevada, we're one of the seven states where we've been fighting literally for 30 years to make sure we don't have that subminimum wage, that $2.13 an hour. But across the country -- you know, this is a federal issue, Jim.
