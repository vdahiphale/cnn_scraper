I know if I was sitting in the middle of a campaign, I'd be frustrated if I was a Democrat in what's going on.But that's a party that's healthy. That can have these discussions. That can have open disagreements. That's what an American political party is supposed to be. The Republican Party has become a cult where you can't speak out against the leader. You can't say anything different than what -- whatever his whims of the day are because anybody that did have an independent thought has been excommunicated from the cult. That's how a cult works. So, when you send fake electors to the convention, all it's doing is solidifying the fact that there is still a significant number of people, and almost every Republican elected official, that still pretends at least that the election was stolen. You're going to hear that this week at the convention. You're going to hear a very divisive message. Us versus them, a dark America, American carnage, you know, it's all over unless you put us in office, and by the way, the election in 2020 was stolen. That's what you're going to hear. And that's why the Democrats, once they figure this stuff out, people will forget I think about this and look forward to the future whatever the outcome is. And it's an optimistic future-focused message it's going to very much pale the Republican message in contrast.",

If we're going to go after Joe Biden for those kinds of flubs and for the lack of mental acuity, then there are plenty, if not more of those exact same examples that you just showed, Wolf, showing Donald Trump.But here's the big difference. There is no way in hell -- and Donald Trump knows this and it's probably why he was mocking the president because he knows this and it pisses him off. There is no way in hell Donald Trump could ever hold a candle to Joe Biden in terms of doing the exact same thing that Joe Biden did last night, talk to reporters for over an hour, getting into the facts, getting into the nitty- gritty, getting into the policy of what is going on on the world stage, of the nuances of history, the nuances of the relationships, the kinds of things that he understands from having that experience and having that knowledge firsthand. Nowhere -- no one ever, I think, looks at that and says -- and thinks that Donald Trump could ever compare himself to that. And that's why I think Donald Trump is actually making fun of him because he is concerned about that. And so, I think that that is something that we all need to concentrate on. This is going to come down to the choice, the contrast. Joe Biden is in this. He's our nominee. And the focus is going to be it's between him and it's going to be between Donald Trump. And we're going to see next week, Project 2025. As much as Matt and Donald Trump want to say that that's not the case, it is a scary MAGA agenda that does not put the American people first. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will put the American people first. And that is what we need to be talking about.",

I mean, kind of being a psycho who's dumb about foreign policy and mixes things up. That's more of a feature with him instead of a bug.With -- you know, Joe Biden, obviously, competency is an important part of his message. And so, what you saw at the debate was counter to that. Just like, it would be huge news if Donald Trump gave a really serious press conference once. So, I think it's a reality. It's a double standard, but this is what the Republican Party has chosen. They had many serious candidates in the primary even this time, and especially in 2016, and they chose this guy. So, it's not like it would be a surprise to anybody. They want somebody who's going to up -- going to stand up there, reflect their anger back to them, reflect division back to them, and further divide the American people. So yes, it's a bit of a double standard. I think it's unfair, but at the same time, Donald Trump has just basically embraced his psychoticism in this stuff.",
