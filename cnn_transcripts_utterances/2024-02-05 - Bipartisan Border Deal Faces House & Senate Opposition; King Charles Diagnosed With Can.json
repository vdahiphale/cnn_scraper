      "sentences": "And tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.A bipartisan border deal appears to be on the verge of going bust, as a dramatic fight is playing out, among Republicans, battling each other, behind closed doors, tonight, as Donald Trump is warning that anyone who is considering voting yes, could be ending their career by doing so. Also, the King diagnosed with cancer, Buckingham Palace not saying yet what kind. As Charles is suspending his duties, William is stepping in, and Harry is rushing to be at his father's side. Also, Mike Pence wouldn't help Donald Trump overturn the election. But a prominent senator and 2024 vice presidential contender is now suggesting he would have. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Republicans appear to be on the verge of tanking a bipartisan immigration deal, after years of demanding that more be done, to secure the southern border, and after three months of negotiations. By CNN's count, a majority of the Senate Republicans are now leaning against it, after an animated meeting, behind closed doors, on Capitol Hill, tonight. One senator came out of that meeting, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who I should note, is a member of GOP leadership, saying, and I'm quoting him now, \"I think the proposal is dead.\" All of this is coming, as Donald Trump has been pulling the strings, behind-the-scenes and really, in front of them, ratcheting up pressure to sink this bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It probably would mean the end of their career. This is a Democrat trap. It's a trap for Republicans that would be so stupid, so foolish, to sign a bill like this. Actually it's one of the worst, one of the dumbest bills I've ever seen. I think it's dead, totally dead, at the House. This bill is impossible to believe that somebody actually negotiated. And he's a very nice guy.",

And Congressman, just given you are obviously a Republican, you live in a border state, why is the status quo better than this bill? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): Well, good evening, Kaitlan. Great to be on. And first of all, the reality is the backdrop here is really important. We have Ukraine funding, as a big part of this $118 billion bill, $60 billion for Ukraine, as well as some other foreign aid, none of which is paid for. And then, you slap in $20 billion of border funding, tied to legislation that we find to be problematic. We find it to be problematic on multiple levels. We believe that it is perpetuating the mass migration that this administration has been advancing under Secretary Mayorkas, and under President Biden. We see that in the numbers, we see that in what we're looking at, when we look at the bill. $4 billion to hire asylum officers, to basically process people that -- these are not going to be conservative hires, right? They're working closely hand-in-hand, with the United Nations NGOs, speaking about another $1.4 billion to NGOs, who have been running people up through the southern border. And to then put this sort of magical trigger at 5,000, which is basically about a 1.8 million number for the year. And I know they say that's encounters. But the fact is Mayorkas has been releasing about 85 percent to 90 percent of these folks into the country. We're getting hammered in Texas. This is not going to solve the problem. And by the way, on the political front, I think, you know, and the viewers of this show, know, I mean, it's not like I was, running around stumping for President Trump out, in Iowa, earlier this last month.",

SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Well, thanks for having me on, Kaitlan. That was a lot. But I'll say this. I will say that we need to do something about the border. We need to do something about border security. And to me, it seems like he was looking more for a political attack than a solution. This is a proposal, negotiated over months and months, with conservative Senator Lankford, along with Senator Murphy, Senator Sinema, Senator Schumer. And many other Republicans, by the way, had a say in this. And what we have here is something that gives the President, emergency authority, to do something about the border, and shut it down, if necessary, while still preserving asylum. And one word I didn't hear, out of the Congressman's mouth, was the word, fentanyl. There was a major county, in my state, and this is going on all across the country, where the sheriff just confiscated enough fentanyl, to kill every person in our county. What this bill does, it puts significant resources, at the border, new technology and the like, to finally do something about fentanyl, in addition to stopping this chaos at the border. So, it isn't anything everyone wanted. We know that. That's what compromise is about. And I just feel that we have a duty, to the people of this country, to put politics aside, and not use this at some electioneering slogan, and actually get this done. That's why the conservative Border Patrol supports this bill, because they see it every single day. And while it's not everything they want, they believe this will make a difference.

On that news, the King returned to London, today. He's being treated as an outpatient, at Clarence House, which is his home, just down the road. And I'm told he's in good spirits. But his medical advisers have warned him away from going out in the public at all, so he doesn't become vulnerable. I'm also told that he is carrying out his key responsibilities, as head of state. So, that is appointing a prime minister, if that were needed, but signing bills into law, a crucial role in Parliament. But also remember Kaitlan, that he's also head of the Armed Forces, the Church of England and the judiciary. None of these systems work, without his sign off, ultimately.

That trial was originally supposed to start, next month.

It's just down the road from around. They've had almost a foot so far. And Tom (ph), if you tilt down? Kaitlan, you'll see what the issue is. This used to be a road. It is now rain and all of this mud and silt. So everything here is so saturated that it's not going to take that much more rain, for more of these mudslides. More than 120 mud debris and rockslides so far, some homes lost. So just a little bit more rain is going to cause problems. Now, we just heard from the Mayor. And she, during her press conference, got her phone out, and President Biden was calling. And so, she put it on speaker.

Well, the Mayor has said to us, listen, Angelenos, you're not used to this. But with climate change, you might have to get used to this. Because what's causing all this? A warmer-than-normal Pacific, that's in climate change, and El Nino. So that brings all this moisture. You get this atmospheric river, 20 times more water then, is carried along the Mississippi River. And El Nino is pushing that right at California. We're told that we should expect more of these kinds of events. And when they do come, they are going to be more intense. So, the message from the Mayor?
