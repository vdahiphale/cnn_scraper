The arraignment of an indicted former president. Donald Trump is expected to voluntarily surrender and appear in court on Tuesday afternoon. He reportedly faces more than 30 charges related to hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. It is impossible to imagine all the scenarios Manhattan law enforcement officials are gaming out right now, given what happened on January 6th, given that Trump has again called for protests this coming Tuesday, and given that supporters like Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene are tweeting things like this. \"New York, put your MAGA hats on. Under our constitutional rights, we will support President Trump and protest the tyrants. I'll see you on Tuesday.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval joins us now with more on the extraordinary measures going on outside the New York City courthouse in Lower Manhattan. Polo, that's a cocktail of a lot of different things coming together on Tuesday. You're going to be busy following all of this. What are you seeing right now?",

The security presence that we are seeing right now, that we have been seeing for quite some time, will certainly pale compared to what we are likely to see on Tuesday. That is when we certainly will see an increased police presence of more people, certainly on the ground here.And it's important to remind the viewers about why we've seen that significant police presence increased, not just because the defendant in this case happens to be the former president of the United States but which obviously comes with some Secret Service concerns, but also as we walk this way, it also is the concern, of course, that we could see an increase in protest and the potential for some of those protests to evolve into something that ends up a bit violent. So it just gives you an idea of what we're seeing downtown, and it's not just what's happening there. But of course we're seeing press from all over the world here, and this will also continue to increase as we get closer to Tuesday. Jim, let's send it back to you.",

You know, in every courthouse in America almost you have justice, the statue, holding the scales, weighing the evidence. And justice is always wearing the blindfold.So it shouldn't matter whether this is a president or not. That actually should be irrelevant to the order of charges, to the types of charges. You know, there are different folks. There's the D.A.'s, there's attorney generals, there's a special investigator, and the District of Columbia that has an investigation going on. These are all independent investigations. The D.A.'s, the A.G., the special investigator, they're doing their own thing. There's no coordination here, so it really doesn't matter which one should go first. Which one should go first is the one that's ready. And if it's a strong enough case is presented to a grand jury. And then that's the last point. That's extremely important here. D.A.'s don't indict people. Grand juries indict people.

Just an amazing buzzer beater right there in the last second of that game, sending San Diego State, the Aztecs, advancing to the first championship game in team history. Just unbelievable stuff in this final four.Of course, that's how this entire March Madness has been. Take a look at legendary basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley. Sir Charles could not believe it himself. He was at the game. It was just unbelievable. I'm sure people were jumping up in their living rooms as well. On Monday, they'll take on UConn for the title. The Huskies dismantled the University of Miami Hurricanes last night. Not only that UConn has won every tournament game by double digits. I hope I have that right, but I think that is right given what we've seen from UConn so far. Sports analyst and reporter Andy Katz joins us now. Andy, do I have that right? Has UConn been that dominant the entire time throughout this March Madness? And have we been sleeping on UConn this entire time? How did they end up getting into the final? I think they're like a four seed, right, or something like that. And what do you make of this final game against San Diego State? I mean, this is going to be quite the clash here. It's going to be a fun game. ANDY KATZ, WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY SPORTS ANALYST: Yes, you're right, Jim. I mean, first off, UConn has beaten all its opponents in the NCAA tournament by double figures, and in by far the most unpredictable tournament maybe ever, they've been the most predictable team by the way they've played. Certainly in the second half as Dan Hurley told me over the last couple of days. I just talked to him again earlier today. You know, this team has not faced second half adversity, and he's been a little bit surprised by it. And the crazy thing is UConn went 14 in a row, so they started 14 in a row, they got the number two in the country. And yet in January, they went a little sideways. They got away from who they were, which is much more of a defensive team. They're kind of like Noah's ark. They've got two of everything, two big, which is not the case with a lot of these teams in this tournament. And then they got back to who they were, and because of what happened in January with them when they finished in the middle of the pack in the big east, that's why even though they played and had the talent to be a one or two-seed they were seeded four.",

He was a preseason big East player of the year.Tyler Kolek from Marquette ended up getting that because they won the league. But Sanogo has been by far the toughest matchup for any other team in this tournament. And really, it would be remarkable.
