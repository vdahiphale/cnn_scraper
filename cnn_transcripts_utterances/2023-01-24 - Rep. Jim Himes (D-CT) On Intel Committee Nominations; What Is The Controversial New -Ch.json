He used to supervise investigations of Russian oligarchs as the head of counterintelligence for the FBI's New York field office.He's now accused and charged with working for a sanctioned Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, in 2019. You worked hard to try to get the Trump administration to sanction Deripaska's companies. I should note McGonigal has pleaded not guilty. But he also had a role in the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. What's your reaction to these charges? And I wonder if this makes you think that any portion of the Mueller probe should be revisited -- any portion he may have been involved in?",

Shocking that it happened -- that the alleged -- you know, the alleged crimes may have been committed by somebody who was so senior at the FBI.But, Poppy, what's interesting to me about this story is exactly where you were going. Number one, this is yet another indication of the incredible government-wide effort to try to get Deripaska out from under the very severe sanctions that he was operating under in 2018-2019, including, by the way, his main asset, the aluminum company RUSAL -- EN RUSAL. None other than the Treasury of the United States, under Donald Trump, was working very hard against congressional opposition to raise those sanctions on Deripaska. And so, number one, I'm really interested in knowing how broad was the all-government effort to lift the sanctions on Deripaska. And number two, yes, on the political side of this, this was a very, very senior member of the FBI in the New York office. There was all kinds of questions -- and I don't want to get into details because they were just questions -- about the behavior of the New York FBI office prior, of course, under Jim Comey. And then, of course, there will be questions about did this individual or people associated with him participate in the Mueller probe. And, you know, I don't want to suggest that necessarily --",

And if he really believes that Adam Schiff lied, he needs to tell people when he did that because Adam is a careful guy and that's not true.

As a general matter, if you're doing interviews of people who are suspects, you don't want them to see the video first and allow them to tailor their statements to the video.By the same token, even witnesses who are not suspects -- you want them to be giving statements to law enforcement about their own independent recollections, not changing their memory based on what they saw on a video. So we want to make sure that key witness interviews are completed prior to releasing the video, and that's really the preference in any case like this. And that's why we're speeding up our witness interviews. We're trying to expedite the investigation as much as possible so that we can release that video very, very soon.",
