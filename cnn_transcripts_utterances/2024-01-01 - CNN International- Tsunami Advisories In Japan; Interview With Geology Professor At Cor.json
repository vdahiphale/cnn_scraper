      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley. Welcome to our ongoing breaking news coverage from Japan where tsunami advisories remain in effect.Powerful waves have been lashing Western Japan after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on New Year's Day. That initially prompted tsunami warnings. Those have now been downgraded to advisories, but of course the danger remains. Then there's the immediate impact of the quake. The tremors shook the snow off this building in Nagano. You can also see it rocking the power lines. Power outages have been reported as well as aftershocks too. Now, it was much more violent scenes from this office building. Japan's weather agency warns aftershocks could continue for a week, potentially triggering building collapses and landslides. And meanwhile, a fire broke out in this city after the quake, and there are reports of injuries too. State broadcaster NHK cites officials at one hospital saying they're receiving the injured, but some doctors have been unable to make it to work due to damaged roads. Much to discuss. Let's bring in Geoff Abers. He's a geology professor at Cornell University. Professor Abers, good to have you with us. Thank you much for joining us today. The government has removed those tsunami warnings, but of course, vigilance is still required. The advisories remain. Has the worst been seen, at least tied to the initial 7.5 magnitude quake that we saw in your mind? GEOFF ABERS, GEOLOGY PROFESSOR AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY: I think that's right. The main risk of tsunami was shortly after that earthquake. We saw the first wave was about a little over a meter that hit the coast There's some long-lived waves that are bouncing back and forth about the Sea of Japan, but they're much -- going to be much smaller.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think, usually what we tend to see is aftershocks persisting for days or weeks of an earthquake of this size. Most aftershocks are, at least in magnitude units, smaller or smaller, so magnitude sixes and -- are possible.There is a small possibility that this is a precursor to a larger earthquake. Chances of that are just a few percent at most. We don't really have a good handle on that. So, the advice here is to expect no magnitude six size aftershocks. Those can be damaging. It can certainly shake buildings.",

I think when we hear about an earthquake in Japan, our minds are immediately cast back to 2011, and the earthquake that we saw there, actually on the other side of Japan. But that was a nine-magnitude earthquake. And obviously this is not a linear scale.Can you just explain the difference between what we've seen already here and what we saw back then? Because the structure of the tectonic plates beneath the east and the west where we're talking about today are very different too and that matters, as does its proximity to land.",

So, this is about a factor of 100 less energy in the earthquake than the magnitude nine on the Pacific side.The largest size of earthquakes depends on how big the faults are. The main plate boundary is on the east side of Japan, where the magnitude 9.0 is. The 7.5 here, although earthquakes of this size have been known, it's a much sort of at the large end of size of earthquakes that have been observed on the west coast of Japan.",

And so, at least newer construction, Japan is quite earthquake resilient. I think the risks tend to be a much older construction that before sort of the 1960s. Unreinforced masonry buildings are still are a few of them around in Japan.But I think, you know, the people that are very well prepared, they're really warning systems in place where people get alerts on their phones of large earthquakes, often seconds before they feel the waves, but ahead of time. So, I think the concern would be mostly if you live in one of these unreinforced masonry structures or near them, those would be the places to be cautious of for aftershocks.",

But to break things down, there really are two issues at play right now, Julia. One is infrastructure, and then two is injuries. Let's first talk about these infrastructure issues.As we have seen from this video over and over, when the quake hit at 4:10, I mean, this was intense. It has not only resulted in 33,000 homes being without power, it's also damaged roadways. Five highways are close. We've seen video of roads with cracks in them. That is making it very difficult for rescue workers to get to those areas in need. In particular, we are hearing stories of doctors who can't go to treatment facilities such as hospitals because the roads are in such poor shape. In addition, we have learned that two airports have had some structural issues, that is going to delay the movement of military forces, rescue forces, possibly, as well as resources such as emergency kits, food, you know, the basics that you would need during an emergency. So far, a thousand government soldiers have been activated. However, we have learned that as many as 8,500 are on standby. We heard from the prime minister of Japan several hours ago, he said, treating the injured is going to be the top priority. Another issue, Julia, is the fact that a lot of people right now are simply stranded. They cannot go home. A lot of people were enjoying this January 1st New Year's Day holiday. They were at the movies. They were going bowling. They were in the train stations, at the grocery stores. So many people are stuck. And we understand that around 21 schools in this quake area are now serving as shelters to help people who may be in need. And I should also tell you that in addition to this tsunami threat that's been lingering, there is this fear of aftershocks. And according to Japan's weather service, Julia, these threats could last anywhere from three days, perhaps well into the end of this week. We will have to see. And that's a threat that just no one, unfortunately, can control.",

Thousands are now without power.And you can see the quake's terrifying impact in this video as a home violently shakes. The threats of aftershocks, as we've been discussing, remains high. Now, Israel beginning to withdraw some of its troops from Gaza. The Israeli military says the \"move should alleviate economic burdens and enable troops to gather strength for upcoming activities in the next year.\" The IDF has warned the war is expected to continue throughout 2024. Nada Bashir is following the story. Four is from Lebanon. Nada, good to have you with us. I've looked at the numbers of brigades, the 551st and the 14th Brigade, they are comprised of reservists.

It's almost been forgotten very bizarrely, it's almost been forgotten as a result of this war and Hamas' terrorist attacks of October the 7th.And so, as a result, I don't think it's going to necessarily sow divisions in this war cabinet. The country has generally been united in this war with Hamas in the wake of those attacks of October the 7th. And I think that the war cabinet will remain very much focused on the job at hand, which is to destroy Hamas militarily and to get the 100 plus hostages still being held in captivity by Hamas and other groups inside the Gaza Strip for some 80 days now to get them all back home. Yes, this is a controversial issue, this judicial overhaul. Yes, the Supreme Court ruling is also controversial, but I think the war cabinet in particular will remain very much focused because this war, certainly from Israel's perspective, is more important than this judicial overhaul.

I think we've seen the French also fire once upon Houthi launches and try to intercept or shoot down some of those launches. But it has been largely the U.S. That being said, there have been a number of other countries, some named, some unnamed, that have been part of the effort to secure shipping there.

Thank you.Now, just hours into the New Year, Ukrainian officials say Russia has launched a series of fresh attacks. Ukraine's Air Force Command says it destroyed most of the 90 drone attacks launched by Russia on New Year's Eve. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared New Year's Day a national day of mourning. That follows Friday's air assault that killed at least 53 people. Search and rescue operations are ongoing. And in their New Year's speeches, the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia had very different messages for their nations, as Clare Sebastian reports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): One gave a detailed account of the war, the other never directly mentioned it. In very different ways, this was two leaders calling on their conflict weary populations to stay the course. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): And just like that, December 31st, today we say, we do not know for certain what the new year will bring us. But this year we can add whatever it brings, we will be stronger. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We have proven more than once that we can solve the most difficult problems and we'll never back down. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Vladimir Putin's speech was pared back, less than half the length of the previous year, and this time no assembled company of military servicemen. Still, it was an opportunity to project strength and confidence as he positions himself for a fifth term as Russian president. PUTIN (through translator): We were proud of our common achievements, rejoiced at our successes, and were firm in defending national interests. Our freedom and security, our values, which have been and remain an unshakable support for us. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And yet, Russia's security has been shaken. Increasingly brazen attacks on Russian territory have brought the war closer to home. The year closing with one of the deadliest attacks for Russian civilians yet in the border region of Belgorod. And Putin faced one of the most direct threats to his rule yet, Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin's aborted march on Moscow in June. A plane crashed two months later, closing that chapter for good. ZELENSKYY (through translator): We defeated the darkness. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Amidst a stepped up Russian aerial campaign and waning western weapons supplies, President Zelenskyy stuck to his well-known tactic of accentuating the positive, including Ukraine taking one small step closer to E.U. membership. ZELENSKYY (through translator): This process will definitely have a logical conclusion, full-fledged membership in strong Europe. A powerful one, from Lisbon to Luhansk. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And yet, this past week has shown Ukraine enters 2024 increasingly vulnerable. That message even spelled out by Putin in his first appearance of the new year, promising a group of wounded Russian soldiers the strikes would intensify. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.

      "sentences": "Right. And then, it's important to notice that, yes, we're no longer under the warnings. It's now a tsunami advisory. However, subsequent aftershocks have also been known to trigger their own tsunamis. We don't necessarily know what that will happen in this particular case, but it has happened before, which means it can happen again.So, it's certainly something we're going to keep a close eye on, especially basically anywhere up and down the western coast where you do still have that tsunami advisory in place. In the town of Suzu, where we've been seeing some of that video off and on throughout the day of those waves sloshing back and forth, even though they sit on this little inlet here, what you're noticing is, if you think about it, if you're in a bathtub or a hot tub, for example, and you take a rock and you drop it in, you're going to get those waves that splash out. But then when they hit the edge, they come right back. So, as those waves kind of push inland, you're going to keep them coming back and forth into this area. So, it's a series of waves. Now, so far up to this point, one of the highest measurements that we've actually had recorded and observed was right about 1.2 meters, just shy of four feet. Several here right around that 0.9 meters, so just under one meter total throughout much of this area. And again, lots of them have been measured up and down pretty much the west coast. The tsunami itself takes place because when the earthquake itself happens underground, that plate gets thrust upward and that displaces all of the water that's up above it. Well, that water then rushes out. For -- in the initial stages, it's still over open water, but then it begins to push inland and it becomes a series of waves is that kind of sloshes back and forth. The topography in the coastline of the area that it's impacting can also have an impact on how high those waves can end up reaching as well. Now, the initial quake itself was a 7.5 magnitude right here on the Ishikawa Prefecture here. Again, we've had several aftershocks since then, you're talking at least 26 that have been magnitude 2.5 or higher just in the last few hours. Now, most of them have been in that four and five magnitude range, we have had at least one in the six magnitude. The important factor here is that even though these are not as severe, strong as the initial 7.5 quake, when you have that large initial quake, buildings and homes become structurally compromised. So, it doesn't take another 7.5 to cause further damage. Now, typically speaking with a main quake of 7.5 magnitude, you will have on average at least one aftershock that's a 6.5 or higher, at least 10 or so that are magnitude 5.5 or higher. And again, those ones that are about that 5.5 magnitude can still cause further damage, again, because of the initial damage that was caused from the main quake. So, this is something that's likely going to be one of the bigger concerns going forward, especially for the next 24 to 48 hours, is any of those larger aftershocks that take place any further damage. Also, something to keep an eye on too is going to be the potential for some landslides if you get some of those aftershocks that come in too.",

And it's really hard to predict what ultimately the outcome of these appeals will be. But we do have some clues based on an appeal that was filed by the Republican Party in Colorado to the U.S. Supreme Court about what some of the broader issues and constitutional questions that exist here are.And at its most basic level, the first one is, does this section of the 14th Amendment in the constitution even apply to a president or a former president? And then, you have to get into the idea of, can the states even enforce this section of the constitution. And lastly, the Colorado Republican Party has also raised First Amendment concerns too. So, those are just basic, you know, broad issues that Trump will probably try to tackle and try to poke holes in in his appeal as well. But look, we've seen a variety of responses and decisions from these states. You know, we obviously have Colorado and Maine that have both said that Donald Trump should be removed from the primary ballot, but there's several states that have said, no, we don't think that it is the state's role to remove political candidates and we need to give voters a chance to do that or choose who they want to elect. And, you know, we're still waiting on Oregon to weigh in and decide what they want to do. So, a lot of uncertainty at the state level. And that's why there's this increasing pressure on the U.S. Supreme court to weigh in. It just remains to be seen if they do. And if they do, what that looks like. CHATTERLEY: Yes.
