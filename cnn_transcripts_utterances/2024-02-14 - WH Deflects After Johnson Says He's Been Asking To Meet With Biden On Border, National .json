The White House, let's say they're noncommittal on the prospects for that sit down. The two leaders are at an impasse on how to handle the border crisis at home and two key allies engaged in wars abroad.And Speaker Johnson is not budging. He's on his way to blocking a second bipartisan Senate bill targeting some of those issues. But he doesn't have much wiggle room. He already has a historically narrow Republican majority, and it shrunk by one last night. CNN's Melanie Zanona is live for us on Capitol Hill. So, Melanie, what are Republicans saying about New York's third district and this flip back to the Democrats?",

I would say there's a mix of finger pointing and a mix of downplaying as Mike - Speaker Mike Johnson said behind closed doors this morning and in front of a press conference earlier today that this was a Biden-won district. There's always going to be an uphill battle for them. Republicans were also heavily outspent by Democrats in the race and the Republican candidate, Mazi Pilip, had way less name recognition in the area because Tom Suozzi, the Democratic candidate who won, had represented the area for many decades in Congress before.But no doubt, no matter what the reasons were for Republicans losing this race, this puts Democrats one step closer to winning the majority in November. And it also is going to decrease the already razor thin majority in the House. Now, that doesn't matter as much for these big bipartisan, massive legislative priorities like funding the government. That's something that's going to take Democrats and Republicans anyway. But it does matter when Republicans want to pass messaging items that are key to their agenda. Remember, they had to jam through the America's impeachment articles last night before this special election. So there are serious questions right now about whether they can achieve other priorities like impeaching President Biden.",

So even Republicans over in the Senate said there's just not an appetite to impeach Mayorkas. There's no expectation that this is ultimately going to end in a conviction. So it largely was a messaging exercise here in the House, but one that Republican leadership over in the House felt important enough to try to get this through, like I said, before the special election last night, because they knew they were potentially about to lose one more vote.",

But when those run up short and they don't want to pull from these missions, it means what can we do as an agency to cut funds? And in this contingency plan, that means cut back on detention capacity, which is, again, a super pricey budget item for this agency. And again, it comes back to, Republicans say they want to secure the border. The White House says they want the same thing.

We impeached Alejandro Mayorkas yesterday in the House. I know it was a close vote. I know the Senate probably will not convict him and remove him from office. But it was a clear signal. And this president has been a failure when it comes to border security issues. With a wink and a nod, he's welcomed more than eight and a half million illegal aliens into our nation, 20,000 Chinese nationals, young men who have come across our secure border or unsecure border since October of last year. This is a crisis. This is a humanitarian crisis.

It's actually to deal with undocumented migrants once they are caught in the United States, in the interior.Notably, that deal that was brokered by Sen. James Lankford that the White House worked on and endorsed, it would have gotten over $7 billion in supplemental funding to ICE.

You had obviously this large law enforcement presence. There were medical units that were staged in and around the area, all of that precautionary. But of course, very important if you do happen to have some type of critical life event where you do need to call in first responders in order to help people. And they essentially approach this in a layered approach. You have the close in security, obviously around the team itself, and you have to ensure the security of the attendees, but also setting up a perimeter and ensuring that you have those resources that are looking outward for any possible threats that may be trying to come in. Again, too soon to tell who this individual or individuals were that were involved in the shooting, whether this was anything that was specifically targeted towards that crowd, that obviously a major question when you have a large gathering.
