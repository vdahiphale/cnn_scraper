He was 31.Well, fans gathered to pay their respects outside the hotel in Buenos Aires, where police say the singer fell from the third floor on Wednesday. Payne rose to fame as a teenager in One Direction, alongside bandmates Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson, and Niall Horan. The group formed in 2010 and became a global pop sensation, selling millions of albums, embarking on world tours, and becoming teen idols before they went on hiatus in 2016. In the year since Payne released a debut solo album and said last year he's excited about working on new music. He leaves behind a young son.

It's the CasaSur Hotel in the very popular neighborhood of Palermo, one of the nicest areas of the Argentinean capital.We learned from the audio of the 911 call first prompted the actions of first responders that the hotel called the police and health emergency services because a customer was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and was threatening to tear up the room where he was staying, according to the receptionist of that hotel and this audio that we have verified. However, it's not clear whether that person was indeed Liam Payne because also many fans who spoke with our colleagues down in Buenos Aires told us that he had just posted a video on his SnapChat just a few hours before he's tragic death, showing him smiling, relaxed, happy to be in Argentina. Liam Payne was in Buenos Aires for the concert of his former bandmate, Niall Horan, who performed in the Argentinian capital on the 2nd of October and decided to stay behind to enjoy the countryside. And in videos in the last few days, he showed that he was enjoying his time in Argentina, in the spring of Argentina. Of course, this is a tragic news that it will send shockwaves all across the world. One Direction were loved by fans, not just in Argentina or their homeland in the British islands, but also all across South America. Take a listen to what we found in Buenos Aires.

The Israeli military killing at least 16 people in multiple strikes in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatiyeh, 52 others were injured according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.One of those who was killed was actually the city's mayor. He was killed when one of those airstrikes hit a government building in the heart of that city. The Israeli military says that they were going after a Hezbollah compound that they say was underground belonging to Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces and they accused Hezbollah of using Lebanese civilians as human shields. But the Lebanese prime minister is accusing the Israeli military of deliberately striking that government building at a time when local officials were holding meetings about emergency relief operations in southern Lebanon. No immediate comment from the Israeli military on that allegation. Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, we are continuing to watch as the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is continuing to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza now in the crosshairs of that deteriorating situation. Also, of course, in the crosshairs of Israeli bombardment and fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants in Jabalya, one of those key cities in northern Gaza. This is of course the fourth time that we have seen Israeli troops carry out a major ground operation in Jabalya, but this time they are also calling on hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate northern Gaza forcing many to flee, but others have been trapped amid the bombardment. And the humanitarian situation is simply worsening with United Nations now calling the situation in northern Gaza catastrophic. The U.N.'s Human Rights Office said it took one of their teams 10 tries on Wednesday to actually be able to reach hospitals in northern Gaza where they were delivering fuel and supplies. Meanwhile, of course, we're seeing the United States putting major pressure on Israel to improve the humanitarian situation. Some steps have been taken according to the U.S. State Department, but it's clear that much more still needs to be done. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It also wants neighboring countries to be able to help shoot down missiles and drones over Ukraine, something Poland, for example, has signaled it might be willing to do. And it intends to hold on to some territory inside Russia as a buffer zone. Well, it also, and this was new, wants to deploy a, quote, \"comprehensive, non-nuclear strategic deterrent package inside Ukraine\" without specifying what that would look like. Now on the political side, the plan makes it very clear that only a concrete invitation to join NATO will prove to Russia that its war goals have failed. Now this plan comes amid criticism of Ukraine, especially in the United States, that it's drain on taxpayer funds. So there's clearly an effort built into the plan to include sweeteners for Western allies -- joint investments, for example, in Ukraine's natural resources with a return on that investment. And post-war, Zelenskyy is also proposing that Ukrainian troops could replace some U.S. troops stationed in Europe as part of NATO's defense, making use of their battlefield experience. Now all of this, of course, still requires Western buy-in and Zelenskyy was pretty open about the challenges of that. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I want to be frank with you on certain behind closed communication with Ukraine. We hear the word talks from our allies much more often than the word justice. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but to the fair one. That is why we have the peace formula.

Yet another month or so, there's a record global temperature.CHINCHAR (voice-over): The report found that more than 50 percent of areas where water is collected and flows into rivers were in abnormal conditions. CELESTE SAULO, WMO SECRETARY-GENERAL: 2023 was the driest year for global rivers in 33 years. Second, glaciers around the world lost most water in 50 years, in the last 50 years. Third, the water cycle is becoming more erratic. CHINCHAR (voice-over): Due to the record heat last year, glaciers lost more than 600 gigatons of water. The report says the U.N. experts said the earth's water cycles are becoming more irregular due to climate change and warned that bold action is needed.",

And that's what I think the Prada team has brought to us.NADEAU (voice-over): The mostly white suits consist of a cropped torso and, quote, \"portable life system backpacks\" with red accent lines, a nod to the fashion brand's sports line, Linea Rosa. The specially engineered boots allow the wearer to spacewalk for at least eight hours a day, while the suit's material both reflects heat and withstands the coldest temperatures. The suit's mobility is also improved from those worn when man last walked the moon. LORENZO BERTELLI, PRADA CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER: I think somehow, it was also a nice exercise for our design team to really start from the functional point of view and then really have understanding how to make it also looking good. NADEAU (voice-over): Pierre Cardin last month launched its own contribution to space style. The French brand unveiled its first astronaut training suit for use at the European Astronaut Center in Cologne, Germany. In step with Pierre Cardin, Prada is bringing its textile and sewing expertise to the world of space exploration, as galactic fashion seems to be blasting off.",
