He would not say whether he would vote for himself. If you guys have a camera, we can all see it. You all see it. When I go to the floor. He was walking in a very -- it appeared to be rather tense moment to see and comment or walked out of the room. They walked back in the room. And they were engaging in these talks. Scott Perry, also, he just left the room. He would not comment about really much of where he is at the moment. Chip Roy, as he was walking into this room, I also asked him whether he's willing to vote for McCarthy here, he would not say. It is very clear here that there are series of discussions right now because McCarthy sees these votes as essential and showing some level of movement. And here's Chip Roy. Mr. Roy, have you decided you're going to vote for Kevin McCarthy right now? REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): (inaudible)",
