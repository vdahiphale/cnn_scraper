One group that could swing the election, undecided Latino voters.You are looking at live pictures out of Miami, Florida, right now. Any moment for President Donald Trump will hold an event with Latino leaders, who are expected to pepper in with some questions. We will bring that to you live in just a few moments. Also, Vice President Kamala Harris reaching out to this key voting bloc. This morning, her campaign unveiled new economic proposals targeting Latino men. And, tomorrow, she will sit down for a prime- time interview on Telemundo. Her campaign is also targeting battleground Michigan. Tonight, in Detroit, former President Barack Obama will rally for Harris. And he will have a notable opening act, one of Detroit's favorite sons, Slim Shady himself, Eminem, the rapper set to introduce Obama, making a rare appearance out on the campaign trail. He is not expected to perform, we understand. Of course, we will have to watch and see what happens live. Good morning. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. At any moment, former President Donald Trump will join a roundtable with Latino leaders in Florida, Trump's campaign trying to shore up support among this crucial group of voters. Steve Contorno joins us now. Steve, what are we expecting to hear from the former president?",

Now, he is choosing to deliver this message at his golf club in Miami area, which might seem somewhat interesting, given that this is not a swing state, but it's symbolic for two reasons. One is that this is an area that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in 2020, becoming one of the best performances by a Republican presidential candidate going back decades. And a lot of that was because of his support among Cuban Americans and Venezuelan Americans and Puerto Ricans here. It's also one of the epicenters of the Spanish-language media. And this camera on this stage surrounding me are cameras representing many of the Spanish language outlets in this country. So even though it's a message being delivered outside of the battleground map, it will be -- reverberates to many Latino audiences in states like Nevada and Arizona, where those populations will be critical this election, Jim.",

Senator, thanks so much for being with us. So far, in your state, more than 1.1 million people have voted. It's a very tight race there right now. Why do you think that is? SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI):  Well, we always expected Michigan to be a very tight race. We are a battleground state, as you know very well. And, by definition, that's going to mean it's going to be a very tight race. So this is where I expected that we would be here in Michigan. It's close. That's why we're working very hard these next two weeks. We have got a very aggressive ground campaign working to knock on doors, get our voters out. But it's going to be a close one.

This is something that I had anticipated. We saw it last cycle. We saw it again. I told folks for the last couple years expect all of these races to be very close. That's where we are. And it's basically going to be about getting our voters out in the ground game and making sure that we get people out. I have heard it explained, which I think is a good way to look at it, we're at the margin of effort right now. Whoever has the best team on the ground, making sure that their voters are going to have their voice heard, we're going to win. I think we just have to execute our plan. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job. And each of our individual Senate candidates, they're basically in candidate-versus-candidate races. And all of our candidates are running against, I would say they're either flawed to very flawed Republican candidates. And, as a result of that, they continue to -- holding their own. And I expect us to still have the opportunity. In fact, I believe we're going to hold our majority, but it will be close. It's going to go right down to the wire.",

You can't feel comfortable with that. You mentioned enemies within. He has said that he would use the National Guard to go after the enemies within, which are his political opponents. That is as antidemocratic as you can get. That's authoritarian. This is a guy who's unhinged. He should not be in the highest office in the United States. And people have to rise up, get out and vote and make their voice heard and make sure that this man is not elected. I mean, even folks who served with him who he appointed called him a dangerous individual, whether it's the former secretary of defense or homeland security. These are people who knew him intimately and said he is a dangerous individual.

That has only increased exponentially over the past eight years. And so this is a real homecoming for him. You can expect a very different tenor, which I think you have seen, lots of cheers and celebrations of him. The thing that really resonates among this community, which is not only Cuban Americans, it's Venezuelans, it's Colombians, they see specifically his rhetoric on the Democratic side of the aisle here as being communist, as bringing in this kind of darker, leftist things into the American culture as resonant to them, because many of them did flee leftist regimes in Latin America.
