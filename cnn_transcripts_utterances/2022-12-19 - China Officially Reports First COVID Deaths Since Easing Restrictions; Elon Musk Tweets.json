If you bumped into somebody who had COVID, you could be shipped off to a quarantine camp.Now we have city governments that are saying hey, you contract COVID and you're a public sector worker and you don't have severe symptoms, go ahead. Keep going to work. That is the starting U-turn that the Chinese -- the message that's being sent by the government to Chinese citizens who have been warned hey, this is a death sentence a month ago -- avoid at all costs. Shut down your business. Shut down your school. To now, hey, it's kind of life as usual. Let's just deal with it. In fact, a top official in China saying this should be compared to the coronavirus cold, not some kind of death sentence. So lots of mixed messaging coming from the world's most populous country right now --",

He says he will abide by the poll's results. This is two months after Musk's controversial purchase of Twitter for $44 billion, taking it private.So far, the 12-hour poll has attracted more than 14 million votes. Fifty-seven percent say yes, 43 percent say no. And there might be a lot of Tesla shareholders who want that yes. Tesla's stock down 57 percent this year. Some concern among Tesla shareholders that Elon Musk is distracted with his Twitter purchase and should get his focus back exclusively on the electric carmaker. All right. As Iran cracks down on protests and hacks into their social media accounts, the death of a 16-year-old activist, called a suicide by the government, may be something far more sinister. A CNN investigation has uncovered the final hours of Nika Shahkarami, a protester who died after a September demonstration in Tehran. Let's go to CNN's Katie Polglase live in London. And Katie, what really happened to this girl?",

And since the protests, they have then become incredibly important for activists for mobilizing support and organizing demonstrations. And so, if there's any indication that they're no longer secure that's, of course, of incredible concern.",

Mortgage rates had doubled in the Fed's rate hike spree to fight inflation. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, 6.31 percent last week. A year ago it was 3.12. What that could mean for the housing market in a moment.Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets are lower this morning -- any year-end cheer dampened by the realization higher rates are likely in store for 2023. In Asia, Talk Japan is considering a two percent inflation target. And on Wall Street, stock index futures looking to find footing after a tough week. The Dow slipped last week more than 1 1/2 percent. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq down more than two percent. The S&amp;P 500 -- this is -- most likely reflects what's in your 401(k). It's down nearly 20 percent for the year, on track for the worst loss since the financial crisis of 2008. It's the final full week of the year. On deck, consumer confidence, home sales, jobless claims, a GDP revision, and the Fed's favorite inflation gauge. And speaking of inflation, gas prices falling a penny overnight. The national average now $3.14 a gallon. While mortgage rates have slipped, they're still much higher than a year ago. Housing prices remain high in many parts of the country. What's the outlook for both buyers and sellers heading into the new year? We have the expert for that, Bess Freedman, CEO of the real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens. It's a company with 3,000 agents in Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Bess, so nice to see you this morning.",
