They're going to have to figure out whether Donald Trump is immune from going to trial because he was president, because he was already tried in the Senate after his impeachment and acquitted there.And so before they can do that trial, somebody is going to have to figure it out. Ultimately, it will be the Supreme Court. The Justice Department wants to skip the middle court, the appeals court, the D.C. Circuit and go to the Supreme Court straight away. The Supreme Court is considering that and we now just have this new brief in from Donald Trump's team. So it's before the Supreme Court to look at and decide whether it's time for them to take the case or if it should stay at this middle court that's planning to have arguments in about three weeks and resolve - get their say in whether Donald Trump has immunity from this criminal prosecution. And so what Trump's lawyers are writing today is: \"The Special Counsel urges this Court,\" the Supreme Court, \"to bypass those ordinary procedures, including the longstanding preference for prior consideration by at least one court of appeals,\" that's the D.C. Circuit, \"and rush to decide the issues with reckless abandon. This Court should decline that invitation at this time, for several reasons.\" One of the reasons they say is that Jack Smith's - Special Counsel's office, the Justice Department, their argument is that the Supreme Court should decide this issue quickly of presidential immunity for Donald Trump because it's in the public interest. Trump says that's a partisan argument you're making because he's on the camp train trail. Everybody slow down. He doesn't have to go to trial in March.",

This is the first court that has found that the former president was essentially an insurrectionist and that the 14th Amendment does hold that he should be barred from being on the ballot. Now, the collision course is the calendar, right? Because January 5th, the Colorado supreme - secretary of state has to certify their ballot for the primary. And so the Colorado Supreme Court has already put a pause on their decision, saying if Donald Trump appeals before then, by January 4th, then he - his name gets to remain on the ballot, at least pending the litigation, right? The view is that it's going to take some time for the Supreme Court to get this. The issue is that now you have twin cases, right? You have this one, which if this is successful, you have to imagine other people are going to bring similar challenges to remove Trump from other ballots in other states, states that he's much more likely to be competitive in, right? And certainly, we also have this trial and so there's twin cases that are now on their way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which I think we haven't been in a place like this since Bush v.

On the other hand, we are in extraordinary times, and so they can do it.

Secretary Benson, thank you so much. I know you have declined to take a position on the lawsuit playing out in your state, which is now being appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court saying that it's for the courts. But what was your reaction to this ruling in Colorado? JOCELYN BENSON, (D) MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE: I think - well, first, thanks for having me - I think this is a critical issue and it's one that we need clarity on. A state court ruling in a separate state doesn't apply, of course, to Michigan. And so we're all, as we have been since this emerged over the summer, as an issue looking to the U.S. Supreme Court to help clarify this issue and really give us some finality on the substantive issue as soon as possible. And this is important not just for our state, but for the Republican Party, which needs to know that it has a qualified nominee. It's important for election officials everywhere so that we know who we can put on the ballot. And also more important than anything, it's really critical for voters to be able to go into this primary season with clarity so that they can make informed decisions as they cast their ballots.",

There's no precedent on this. This has never happened before. It is a matter of interpreting the United States' Constitution. So ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court is the final arbiter of that. It has the final say. The Colorado Supreme Court decision was very solid, I think. There wasn't a lot to criticize there. But I - it's just so hard for me to believe that the Supreme Court is going to allow a presidential candidate to be taken off the ballot by one state, given that that impacts all the other states.

And so does the fact you cannot be engaged in an insurrection after you've taken an oath to support the Constitution. It's very unique that the issues come up, but it's a very real issue and I just don't think we can wash aside the role of the courts and politicizing the courts would really be a disaster.

So, is either side serious about a pause this time? Not clear. But Netanyahu has to go through it as well, because he is facing both internal pressure from the hostage families and the Israeli public, especially after the killing of those three hostages by Israeli troops over the weekend, and also internationally. Israel could be facing a situation where the U.S. votes together with other U.N. members to call for humanitarian aid and some sort of a pause that, of course, that language is still being worked on.The fact that the other U.N. members haven't just gone ahead and called for a vote means that the White House is seriously considering signing on to it.
