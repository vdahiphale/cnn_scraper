You are watching ONE WORLD. Russian officials are now responding furiously over the assassination of one of their top generals. Russian authorities say this man, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, was killed in a bomb explosion outside an apartment building earlier today in Moscow. A source with knowledge of the operation says Ukraine's security services were behind the killing. Russia is calling it a, quote, terrorist act, and vowing the murderers will be -- the murderers will be punished without a doubt and without mercy. Kirillov's death comes a day after Ukrainian prosecutors charged the general in absentia with the use of banned chemical substances. CNN's Red Pleitgen has more from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I'm going to get out of your way and you can see the actual scene of where all of this took place. And you already mentioned that the entrance to that building where all this happens, the second entrance down from here, was badly damaged in that explosion. And the Russians are indeed saying that they believe that the explosive device was hidden in an electric scooter park right outside that building. And that there were about 300 grams of TNT inside that explosive device. They have already said that they found remnants of that explosive device. And one of the other things that they said as well is that they believe that it was detonated remotely. Now, we do know, at this point in time, that the Ukrainian security services have claimed responsibility for this. A source saying that to CNN that Ukrainian security services were behind this. The explosion, despite the fact that 300 grams of TNT might not sound like very much, seems to have been substantial. We can see that there's a lot of workers here on the ground. Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the ground. Some others have cordoned off the area. But one of the other things that we're seeing as well, if we pan over to the other side, is that the explosion was so strong that it damaged the building on the other side of the road. You can see there that windows have been smashed by this explosion that took place. There was an eye witness report that we have seen. Some of them on Russian media saying that they thought that maybe some sort of cement truck had unloaded a lot of cement, or what, something very heavy had fallen down on the ground. So, clearly, the people who live in this area very much heard this explosion as it took place. Of course, at the beginning, not exactly clear of what it might have been. The Russians have launched a criminal investigation into all this. You can see the investigators, and we've seen the investigators on the ground here, not just civilian investigators are from the police authorities, but also military investigators as well. Of course, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, very important for the Russian military, very high up in the Russian military. He was the head of Russia's nuclear biological and chemical defense forces. And the Ukrainians had actually indicted him in absentia. Just yesterday, the Ukrainian security services accusing the Russians of using weaponized chemicals in the war in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov, for his part in the past, had accused the Ukrainians of doing the exact same thing. So certainly, someone who was on the forefront as far as that conflict between Ukraine and Russia is concerned, and someone who the Russians, of course, for their military, was extremely important.

      "sentences": "Well, Hamas now becomes the latest party to these negotiations to express some optimism about theprospects of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release deal. We have heard optimistic comments over the course of the last week from U.S., Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials, and now Hamas is joining the fray. But as with the others who are expressing optimism, Hamas is also adding a note of caution to their comments. In their statement, they are making clear that, quote, Hamas affirms that in light of the serious and positive discussions taking place in Doha today, under the auspices of our Qatari and Egyptian brothers, reaching an agreement for a ceasefire and prisoner exchange is possible if the occupation stops imposing new conditions. And that if is indeed that note of caution that they are raising, suggesting that Israeli negotiators are making additional demands as this negotiating process moves forward. A second Hamas source said that they view the current state of negotiations as, quote, positive and optimistic. And it is important to note that amid this optimism, we are also seeing a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region. The U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, just last week, traveled to Israel, Egypt, and Qatar to try and advance a deal. He said he hopes that he can put the conditions in place to reach a deal with the United States within the next month. And that is indeed the target here, appears to be to try and reach a deal before President Biden leaves office on January 20th and President-elect Trump will then be inaugurated. And we know, of course, that the Biden administration has also been closely coordinating with the Trump administration over this deal as incoming Trump advisors have also been traveling to the region and coordinating closely with the officials who they will soon be replacing. It is important to caution, though, that as we are seeing this momentum, as we are seeing this optimistic language, the reason why we are also hearing notes of caution from all of the parties involved is because we have been this close in the past. We have been very close to a deal and ultimately talks have collapsed. And that possibility still very much looms. But Israeli and American officials who I've spoken to have pointed to a new set of conditions in the region in terms of Hamas being increasingly isolated. Israel having accomplished a slew of military achievements in Gaza, including the killing of Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, that might make them more willing to reach a deal now. All of this pointing us in the direction of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal. But again, the deal isn't reached until it's done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And all of those four officials told me in different ways that there are still significant gaps, many issues that need to be solved. A deal is not around the corner. Is it possible that the deal will be achieved by January 20th? Yes, it is possible because in many negotiations, you know, it's slow, slow, slow, and then it's very fast.

Now these mass graves that we'd had hints about way before Bashar al-Assad fell, of course. The International Commission on Missing Persons speaks of a man known as the gravedigger who appeared before a German court back in 2020 who described his role in taking truckloads of dead bodies to some of these sites. And that site you showed a moment ago at (INAUDIBLE) to the outskirts of Damascus, what we were hearing was happening there from some of the truck drivers involved is that it was each week that four tractor trailer loads of bodies containing 150 bodies each were brought twice a week between 2012 and 2018. And that of course alone would mean many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of bodies possibly. So this grim task now of trying to extract the bodies and identifying them begins. Although what we understand also from some of these advocacy groups that are involved in trying to get cameras to these sites and to help them be cleared and opened up that the bodies can be retrieved is that what we understand happened is that once the bodies were brought, they were then bulldozed in order to make them sufficiently small that they could be put into these very large graves. So the process of identification is also likely to prove very difficult.

He spread numerous conspiracy theories about the COVID vaccine, prompting some social media platforms to ban him from spreading harmful misinformation. And he has claimed the drug AZT, which is used to treat HIV and AIDS, is not effective and that it only has official approval, so the drug makers can rake in profits. And he says people should drink more raw milk, even though studies show unpasteurized milk can contain E. coli, salmonella, and other dangerous bacteria. OK. Time now for The Exchange.

He has said thatthe COVID vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine ever made. In an interview last year, he said no vaccine is of value. He said that the polio vaccine has killed many, many, many more people than it's saved. I mean, this is a man -- he's not -- he's not a skeptic. I mean, it's reasonable to be skeptical about things. He's a cynic. He doesn't believe data. He's a science denialist. He's a conspiracy theorist and a virulent anti-vaccine activist. And were he to actually be confirmed as head of Health and Human Services, I think it would be a dangerous time to be a child in the United States of America.",

I think it's safe to say that one of the Trump administration's greatest achievements, the first term was Operation WarpSpeed, where normally it would take years for a vaccine to be approved and go through the trial phase. This happened at literally warp speed as the operation was called within just a matter of months. The president-elect said that he had dinner recently with the CEOs of Eli Lilly and Pfizer, one of the makers of the vaccine. Is that reassuring to you at all, given that he spoke with these two heads of companies?",

When he -- when he was in aRepublican debate heading up to the 2016 election, he made a statement that vaccines cause autism. He was considering having RFK Jr. his head of a sort of vaccine safety and scientific integrity commission. He said children get too many vaccines, that they're getting like forced doses of vaccines. So I think he has a history of being anti-vaccine. And I think that's why he's not appalled by having somebody like RFK Jr. to be in a position like that. So no, I'm not reassured.",

And if he doesn't think that, then why are we giving anti-retroviral therapies, anti-AIDS therapies to people with AIDS? They should ask him whether or not he plans to do what he said he's going to do, which is to pull back the polio vaccine until it's tested in a prospective placebo controlled trial. Is that his plan? They should ask him point blank whether he is going to do anything to disrupt the vaccine infrastructure in this country, like, for example, exposed to liability by removing the vaccine injury compensation program. And then we'll be back to where we were in the early '80s when company after company abandoned vaccines. I worry for vaccines in this country, as is everybody who cares about children's health.

A week and a half ago, Dali was charged in federal court with one count of being a stowaway on a vessel or aircraft without consent. Among other things, the judge ordered Dali to wear an ankle bracelet with a GPS monitor, surrender any travel documents, and told her she cannot go to airports or leave the area where she is staying. That includes, of course, jumping on a Greyhound bus to Canada. Dali had been staying with her roommate, a law enforcement source told CNN. Her roommate reported her missing after he saw her GPS ankle bracelet on the floor. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
