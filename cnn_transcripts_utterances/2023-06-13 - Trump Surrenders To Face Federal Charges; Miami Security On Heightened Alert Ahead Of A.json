Miami's police chief vowing this morning they are ready to handle security concerns but there are no barriers to separate protesters and Trump supporters outside of the federal courthouse in Miami.

There are roosters walking among the protesters. It is increasingly a circus-like atmosphere when we are here for a pretty serious and solemn occasion. It is the first former President of the United States to be arraigned on federal criminal charges. In just a few short hours, former president Trump is expected to make the drive from his Doral Golf Club to downtown Miami to surrender. When he arrives, he will be in a car and expected to arrive in the federal courthouse behind me in a garage underneath the building. So not expected we will see him. But once inside the building, he will be under arrest. The process more or less likely for any other defendant. We are not expecting him to have a mug shot taken since law enforcement knows exactly what he looks like. But they will take his fingerprints. And then he will appear before the magistrate judge. Changes will be read. He said he will enter a plea of not guilty. That is just the first step in a very long and historic case. At the defense table will be two attorneys, Todd Blanche and Chris Kise, the former solicitor general of Florida. This is not expected to be his final legal team. But it is going to take some time. All of the additional proceedings will be before the trial judge, Judge Aileen Cannon. She is a Trump appointed judge. She has made one decision in a matter related to this case that was roundly criticized by legal scholars and ultimately overturned. Usually the judge is not a central storyline in a trial. But everything that she does in this case is likely to be scrutinized.",

What they are trying to do is a political exoneration, put enough mud into the water to give Republicans to hang their hat on as they debate and argue about this in the public domain. None of this is going to hold water in court nor are the complaints about the Presidential Records Act or he shouldn't have been charged under the Espionage Act because he wasn't committing espionage, well, the title of the bill means absolutely nothing. There is a bunch of stuff being thrown out. But that's what Republicans are talking about. I was there when Byron gave the interview this morning. And he gave a pretty authentic review of what Republicans are saying. At the core is, basically, the Republicans want Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Hunter Biden prosecuted.

The Miami police is looking at that through the lens of we have a group of Trump supporters here and we don't consider them to a threat to Donald Trump. And we have adequate resources in terms of the personnel. And so there is a little clash of styles there. And the wild card is, of course, when your Trump supporters start to fight with the counter demonstrators, do you lose control of the situation there? And they are confident that, no, we are not.

One is our military intelligence agents and a nod to them; in other words, our obligation to them, not to Trump, is that we protect the work that they are doing. And the second is that there is a mention of our allies. I think that's playing out here in really important ways, that the United States doesn't exist on the globe by itself. It needs its allies to have confidence that those who have access to the highest security clearances are protecting them or at least not putting them in bathrooms, right? There may be a gap between always being in the SCIF but people certainly know that those pictures looked wrong. So our present capabilities are impacted by what our allies are likely to believe is the case in terms of classified information and they are also seeing the polling that Trump is the frontrunner.
