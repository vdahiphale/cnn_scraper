I asked the Former Chairman of Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen, and how he thinks allies can help Ukraine secure a victory. Plus, from cozying up to Putin to launching spy balloons over the United States, tension between Beijing and Washington reach new heights. My conversation with Jing Tsu, author of the \"Kingdom of Characters\" about better understanding China. Also ahead -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. America and its NATO allies are watching developments very closely in eastern Ukraine where the battle for Bakhmut is raging and Russia may be on the verge of a much-needed victory. As you can see, Russian troops are inching closer as they try to encircle and capture the city, but Ukraine vows to defend what is left and says, it is still in control of a key highway into the area. So, how important is Bakhmut? The U.S. defense secretary says, that it would not be a strategic setback if the Ukrainians decide to reposition west of Bakhmut, arguing that it's value is largely symbolic. Meanwhile, in the south, Russian shelling has killed three people including two children, that's according to the Ukrainian military. My next guest, retired U.S. Admiral Mike Mullen spent four decades serving his country and then he served as President Obama's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And he's joining me now live from Annapolis, Maryland. Admiral Mullen, welcome back to the program. So, you know, the word Bakhmut has been on everybody's lips for a long, long time. How do you assess its nature to the prosecution of this war? MIKE MULLEN, FORMER U.S. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN:  Well, I think it's -- I basically agree. I don't think strategically in terms of the progress on the ground, that it's overly significant. But I do think from both sides, actually, both Ukraine and Russia, that it provides -- it's almost symbolic. And it's been six or seven months, that the Ukrainians have been fiercely defending Bakhmut. And it's also been obviously that long that the Russians have been attacking it. And one of the things that is just a fact is, because of the effort in defense, the Russians have expanded a tremendous amount of resources. They've lost thousands and thousands of soldiers. They've lost an enormous amount of equipment. And so, whether, technically, it is a huge gain or loss on the ground, I think in terms of impact of the war, it's had a significant impact on what Russia can do. And I think it -- you know, in its own way, starts to limit what they can do in other places, for instance, in the south, which is a place you just talked about.",

And also, viewing the photographs of the rubble that Bakhmut has become, which I think is what Putin is trying to do across the country, to ruin as much of the country as possible. You know, it will have its effect. That said, those losses that we described earlier with the Russians are typical of their inability to fight. And I think one of the things to your point about the counteroffensive when it comes in the spring, we will find the Ukrainian military much more capable of what we call combined arms training. The coordination of air, artillery, armor, they will have much more armor available to them, if you will, in the Bradley's and the Strikers that are over there. And so, I think in a long run, it puts Ukraine in a much better position to fight -- continue the fight. And I -- Russia's given me no indication that they are capable of dramatically changing how they fight while they continue to stay -- sustain these huge losses. And I think that'll be -- that will happen in the counteroffensive as well.",

So, clearly both sides are focused on this potential shortage of ammunition. And it's really critical, particularly for the Ukrainians, to be very selective about the use of ammunition that they have because obviously the supply is not infinite. But you also hear that, you know, Russia is having the same problem. So, I think everybody is aware of that and the commitments as well as creating the production lines, which is -- which can be a problem as well, which will produce ammunition for the future fight. And I think that there are -- everybody would like -- one would like this to end, you know, immediately. Secondly, there's discussions on how it ends. But my sense, Christiane, is this counteroffensive, and the results of that for the rest of this year, we'll really set the stage for when these ends.

He said, after a year of war, what stands out is less solidarity than the gap between rhetoric and real delivery. A cynic might conclude -- would conclude that the west unspoken aim is not just to prevent a Russian victory but to avoid a decisive Ukrainian success for fear of escalation by Vladimir Putin's regime.

But now I think it's very solid and significantly getting better. I am also, you know, struck by the fact that we should remember that when Xi Jinping took over in 2012, his first out of country visit was to Russia. And so, it's been pretty consistent since that time. I think the idea of China providing lethal weapons is a huge step in the wrong direction for China. It's really dangerous. And there is enough discussion of it right now to certainly indicate that there is intelligence where that is being discussed as a possibility. And I think that would be a huge mistake for Xi Jinping.

Welcome, welcome to the program. Look, you know, it is a conundrum. China is a mystery for all of those who've sought to try to understand her for, you know, thousands of years.

JING TSU, AUTHOR, \"KINGDOM OF CHARACTER\" AND PROFESSOR, EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURE, YALE UNIVERSITY:  Well, certainly, for myself, having started literary studies in history, it's become impossible to just read all the dictions (ph) of history and literally to try to understand the pace and the degree of transformation that China is heading towards at this moment.

So, if you found the prospect (ph) of Chinese language, it had to jump through several hoops in order to get itself on par with the alphabetic age, which by far dominates the technology that we deem as the most critical today. For instance, global communications, from telegraphs to typewriters. How do you send Chinese in a telegram using Moore's code, or how do you type Chinese on a keyboard that's labeled by alphabetical letters like QWERTY? And more importantly, how do you get into the computer age to get Chinese into the machine? So, each of these critical choking points showed how China was able to not just state but how much the people were galvanized behind, how failure in the history of Chinese nationalism.

And so, the idea of coming into its own was always cast in the mentality of the underdog, even though we think of China as one of the greatest superpowers now. So, I think that've very much ingrained, I think, in President Xi Jinping's way of thinking when he came to power. You can see a kind of distinct roll back of a kind of opening up a marketing reform that we saw in the 1980s. In fact, the generation that grew up during the opening reform era, I think is experiencing the current moment with this -- with this fair degree of shock and also, I think, disillusionment. So, I think it's really important to think of that as think of cold war 2.0 at the moment, and bringing back a kind of, 1950s, 1960s mentality, there's also a generation that's actually wondering what's going to happen in the 21st century, not just of a 2.0 version of the 1960s.",

And certainly, the victimization narrative is always -- has a very unelectable (ph) presence in the Chinese mind. However, in Chinese nationalist history, the idea of victimhood was not abject and disempowering. It was actually a way of inspiring themselves and aspiring to be better, to be stronger, but always cast in the sense that in the world that they would be better. That they would better leaders than the west once they do come into power. So, I think that kind of narrative is very powerful, right? If you are speaking from the perspective of the underdog, it's much more useful than a victors' narrative. We've only enjoyed prosperity and positivity, in which I think is kind of the story of the west by this point.",

So, if you want to block an infection or if you want to impede an infection or slow down an infection, you want to teach your body how to recognize those fingers. And so, all you have to do is say, look, cells, this is what the spike protein looks like.

And so, that work they pioneered over UPenn over the course of even 20 years, and especially in the last decade, prior to the pandemic, that really allowed for us to build on.
