And today, one year on from the October the 7th, Hamas terror attacks, I'm talking to you from a region in more peril than ever before, with multiple ongoing conflicts, and no clarity about how much further they will escalate or how and when they will end. This is how it looks today at the site of the Nova music festival in Israel, where Hamas militants massacred hundreds of young people and hundreds more in and around a nearby kibbutz. Raw emotions, as families of the victims remember the dead, and the more than 100 people still held in Gaza. Well, the Hamas terror attack set off Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, where more than 41,000 people have been killed, many of them women and children, and living conditions are dire. And Israel hitting more Hezbollah targets. In Lebanon, more than 2000 people reported killed there, and more than 1 million displaced. Jeremy Diamond now takes a look back at the horror and sorrow of that day one year ago and the ongoing death and destruction in Gaza through the eyes of two mothers. A warning, his report contains disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This comes as Israel is intensifying its air strikes and artillery barrages on southern towns and villages in Lebanon. We have reports from the national news agency, the official news agency here, that 10 Lebanese firefighters were killed when they were preparing to go out on a rescue mission in the south of the country. This comes as the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military put out yet another series of evacuation orders for 25 villages in southern Lebanon. At this point, the total number of villages that have received those orders is around 150. They are being told to go north of the Awali River, which is about 50 kilometers north of the border with Israel. And told not to go back to their homes until further notice, and for nobody to drive south in from the Awali River.

This issomewhere where many civilians had returned to given the lack of security in other parts of Gaza, where they have been forced to flee time and time again. And the Israeli military has said that it is planning to target Hamas militants and infrastructure in the area in northern Gaza. They believe that there has been a build-up, a resurgence of Hamas militants on the ground in this particular region of northern Gaza, and have now said they have encircled the Jabalia area with troops on the ground ahead of a planned operation. But as you can imagine, this is a deeply distressing situation for the civilians in this area. They have been ordered to evacuate once again, and we have been seeing video emerging of civilians fleeing with whatever belongings that they still have in an attempt to reach the so-called safe zones that have been outlined by the Israeli military, namely the Al-Mawasi coastal area. But of course, we are also now seeing similar messaging in the south. As you mentioned. The Israeli military has said that it will be, in its words, responding with force to Hamas activity they believe to be taking place in and around neighborhoods surrounding the Khan Yunis area of southern Gaza. Again, another area we have seen a huge amount of displacement amongst Palestinian civilians who had taken shelter there. There are still significant encampments for the displaced in parts of southern Gaza, particularly around the Khan Yunis area, and they are being told also to evacuate to the Al-Mawasi coastal area. As you can imagine, the vast majority of Gaza's 2.2 million strong population have now been internally displaced, forced to evacuate time and time. Coastal area. But as you can imagine, the vast majority of Gaza's 2.2 million strong population have now been internally displaced, forced to evacuate time and time again. There is simply no safe zones, according to multiple U.N. agencies for civilians to turn to. And, in fact, while these so-called humanitarian zones have been established, namely that Al-Mawasi coastal zone, what we have seen over the last year is these outlined zones getting smaller and smaller, shrinking in size. We've also seen these safe zones actually being targeted, coming under attack and being struck by the Israeli Air Force. So, a huge amount of concern for Palestinian civilians, who are once again being told to evacuate. And of course, signals of an expansion of, perhaps deepening, of the Israeli military's operations on the ground, as well as in the air. And of course, it is troubling to think about the fact that this is now a year on, we are still seeing these widespread strikes in areas that are known to be densely populated by civilians. Just over the weekend, we've seen a series of strikes in central Gaza, one of the most troubling incidences over the course of the weekend was perhaps the targeting of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital compound. Again, this is one of the very few hospitals remaining in Gaza still able to treat patients. The compound is somewhere where civilians had taken shelter in tents, and this was struck by an Israeli drone strike, as confirmed by the Israeli military itself, which has said it was targeting a Hamas command and control center, something that they have said in the past with regards to other areas, as well as hospitals, but again, with no evidence of this. So, a hugely worrying situation. And as you've been outlining, Becky, at least 41,000 people have been killed over the course of the last year, and as the strikes continue that death toll is only set to rise.",

It was talking about twoperiods of six weeks where President Biden said the ceasefire would continue, even if there's no agreement on a ceasefire. Israel immediately responded that they would renew the war after the first six weeks, and in the first six weeks, they would only release 32 of the hostages, which didn't make sense to me. So, I was approached by some of the hostage families, and I approached Hamas and said, are you willing to make a deal that ends the war in a short period of time, three weeks, and you release all the hostages? And they -- after several days, came back to me and said, yes. Why isn't it moving forward? I think that the United States is very invested in the deal that they've been negotiating now for about four months of trying to make it work. It's being negotiated at the level of the head of the CIA Bill Burns and Brett McGurk, the special envoy of President Biden. I think it's very difficult for them to detach themselves for something they've been so engaged in for so long and pick up something else that might actually work, but I don't think they have the choice because I think the person they're working for President Biden, who's coming to the end of the term has to understand that this is a legacy issue for him. Question is, if Biden going to be remembered as the Gaza war president or the president who ended the war in Gaza and brought the hostages home? This is really on the desk of President Biden now, because the United States has enormous leverage over Israel, it does. I made a list of -- I made a list of 15 different things that the United States could do if it's only done behind closed doors, then it's perhaps limited, because Netanyahu can do whatever he wants. If he goes public and says, these are the things that we are doing now when we're considering reassessing our relationship with the State of Israel, this becomes public, and it's the citizens of Israel who are the sovereign, not Mr. Netanyahu.",

The U.S. -- that the U.S. was acting as a mediator in Middle East peace. This is clearly not just happening in the United States. We saw it happen in the U.K. and in Europe, but it's been particularly pronounced in America. We saw all those campus protests earlier this year in favor of the Palestinians. I think what has happened is that previously, the only political price an American president would pay on the Middle East domestically was for showing insufficient support of Israel. Now that is the status is still the case among more conservative and moderate voters, but there's this new dynamic now on the left of progressives and Arab American voters, who are inflicting a price, firstly on President Joe Biden and now potentially on Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. This is in the middle of a U.S. election and there are very serious concerns among Democrats that this could really hurt Harris, particularly in the key swing state of Michigan, among progressive and Arab American voters.

She's not really given us any strong indication about what she thinks about this, how deeply she's thought about the Middle East question. And, in fact, many other massive international issues that she would face if she goes into the Oval Office as present next January.

We are starting this week in a region on a dangerous precipice. An expanding war with a civilian toll that has already been devastating beyond comprehension. Gaza, all but completely flattened, more than 40,000 killed. Now, Israel has expanded the war into Lebanon. You can see the smoke rising from an air strike carried out just a few hours ago. The death toll reaching above 2000 there in just a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, we sit and wait to see how Israel may respond to the barrage of more than 200 ballistic missiles targeting military and security sites in Israel last week. Well, just one year ago, it felt as if the political architecture of this region was undergoing a significant change. Saudi Arabia and Israel seem closer than ever to normalization on the heels of the Abraham Accords orchestrated by the United States that saw the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco normalize relations with Israel. Plus, Saudi Arabia and Iran, after nearly a decade of no diplomatic ties and a regional power struggle look beyond sectarian conflict and towards economic opportunities that could only be achieved by calming tensions. Well now, as we wait to see what comes next between Israel and Iran, Middle East scholar and friend of this show, Vali Nasr points out that the calculus is now much different for the Arab nations in the wake of these rapprochements.
