In the Northeast, the deluge of flash floods and an urgent search for a 2-year-old girl and her 9- month-old brother in Pennsylvania. The family car was swept away in a powerful storm killing their mother.Flash floods also killed four others and as that same region braces for more rain in coming days, other parts of the nation are suffering from extremely high temperatures. 80 million people in 12 states are under excessive heat warnings. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers is standing by in the Weather Center. Chad, with these floods, what are you expecting over the next few days? What's the outlook?",

There will be showers overnight tomorrow night, but I don't think there's anything that's going to really exacerbate really what we have out here where the flash flood watches are. The ground is saturated. There's nothing the ground can do to absorb any more. And yes, there will be some showers around, but nothing that really lingers. Nothing that lasts a very long time. And there's a slight risk of too heavy of rainfall in the yellow area and that's honestly just because it has rained so much for so long.Something else in the atmosphere -- I mean, the bases are loaded on weather today. I mean, obviously smoke back in the area across parts of the Midwest. This all part of the high-pressure in the West itself bringing down smoke from Alberta and British Columbia fires here. There's your heat dome making all the heat across the South and the Southwest. Records broken yesterday in some spots and certainly in the next couple of days a hundred or so records -- more records will be broken out there. Look at right now in Vegas, it's 110 degrees. Right now. And they don't put these watches and warnings out just because it's going to be hot. It has to be above a threshold to get to these extreme temperatures, to get to these warnings and watches and advisories. Phoenix on Wednesday it'll be 118. Death Valley making a run today at 124. It's already in the upper 110s right now of course.",

You've spent a lot of time out there, some of the hottest days on record have been recorded at Death Valley. What is it like to experience that record-breaking temperature? NICHOLE ANDLER, PARK RANGER, DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK: Oh, well, 128 degrees is kind of intense. Some folks like to say it's like when you get really cold and you feel the pins and needles.

      "sentences": "Oh, it's a continuation of the theme. We've seen the former president and his legal team try to figure out how to delay this, perhaps beyond the 2024 election. And here what the special counsel prosecutors are saying is that they've been trying to back door, at least trying to set up a conversation with Donald Trump's legal team to discuss some of the issues of -- some of the how to handle some of the classified information that is at the center of this case. And I'll read you a part of what it says here.The government asked to have a call on July 14th with the council counsel for the defendants in order to see if it was possible to address some of the defendants' concerns. And that they have not heard from defense counsel since sending that email on July 14. And this filing is -- this motion is now to avoid further delay. What is at work here is that Jack Smith and his team want to set up a protective order. They're asking the judge to set up a protective order that'll essentially restrict how this information that is shared with the defense, how that information is handled for obvious reasons. Right? Some of it is classified and it's also very sensitive. And what they say is, that the Trump team has raised some objections but they won't say specifically what their objections are. So we can expect tomorrow that Judge Aileen Cannon, the first time she's going to be having both sides in front of her in this courtroom in Fort Pierce. She's going to talk about some of the issues related to classified documents, but also what you just raised just now, she wants to talk about the potential trial date. Which the special counsel says they're going to be ready by December. Donald Trump's team says don't set a trial date just yet.",

Republican-appointed judges basically said that she was wrong on every aspect of that. So you can expect that everybody is going to be watching everything that she says tomorrow very closely, including obviously the Trump team. They want -- as we just discussed -- they want this trial to be put off as long as possible. They say that they want the -- essentially the voters to decide. And then of course, if Donald Trump becomes president, then he could try to get -- have this thing wiped away. So we'll see whether she sides with them in trying to delay this or whether she finally says, no, here's a trial date, you got to get going.",

When you do that, you hope it is not something sensitive like family information that you're putting in their. In this case, this entrepreneur, this Dutch person who was contracted to run the .ML -- the Mali domain, was realizing that he was getting all this incoming emails and he was curious about it.So he set up sort of a work around where he could catch the emails and kind of filler them and see what is going on. Now he talked to us after he had informed the U.S. government about this, so he wasn't, you know, running to the press about this. But this is over 10 years. So millions of emails, like you said, many of them were spammed, but many of them weren't. We can look at some of them. In one case there was an FBI agent emailing a U.S. naval office asking for personal information so he could, you know, SSN -- social security number -- so they could come and visit the FBI facility. Another case it was a high ranking general, Army Chief of Staff, his hotel reservations that the hotel employee emailed .ml instead of .MIL by accident. So, this is a mistake. And it's not necessarily anything that you couldn't do to wipe away this type of mistake. But the Pentagon told us that they're trying to get less use of personal emails to deal with this, but also raising awareness with other people that you have to put that extra \"I\" in the middle to make sure that you're connecting with the Pentagon employee.",
