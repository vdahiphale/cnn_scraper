Bush writing in \"The Atlantic.\" \"The New York Times\" writes this morning, quote, \"Donald Trump has long exhibited authoritarian impulses, but his policy operation is now more sophisticated, and the buffers to check him are weaker.\" So sometimes you can tell what Donald Trump views as political vulnerabilities because he simply tries to flip the script.

But, you know, Republican voters, I think, have been hearing these warnings for a long time. To me, it all feels very much like 2016, when we saw the same rhetoric coming from the Republican establishment saying to Republican voters, look, we're not liberals, we're not Democrats making this critique, but we really think this guy is dangerous. So there is a fair amount of deja vu. I think, as Kristen was saying,there is a feeling on the part of a lot of the Republican base that is most devoted to Donald Trump, that he was not able to go far enough in his one term as president, and that it was because of the so-called deep state. You know, we have a story over the weekend about the fact that this is sort of ironic, considering the Republican party's longtime emphasis on limited government, on reining in executive power and limiting federal control over local policy. You know, a lot of the policy promises that Donald Trump is making, in addition to being rather alarming for those who are concerned about democratic institutions, they also would sort of bulldoze local control over a variety of areas of life and policy.",

And that ended up being somewhat persuasive to people. We did see, you know, those election-denying candidates like Kari Lake in Arizona really paying a price for subscribing to the attacks that Donald Trump has made on the election process, on democratic institutions, on the peaceful transfer of power.And so this attempt to, you know, reframe January 6th and the attempt to overthrow the government and turn that into something that his supporters see as pro-democracy, that was not persuasive to general election voters in 2022.

Now, they are moving south, which raises major concerns about where these civilians are going to go. Of course, northern Gazans had been told to move south, and many of them had gone to this city of Khan Yunis, where Israeli and American officials now believe many of -- or much of the Hamas leadership has gone to. And so now Israel is calling on civilians in Khan Yunis to move even farther south. The U.N. estimates that there are 1.8 million Gazans who have been displaced. That is the vast majority of the 2.2-million-person population. Kate, the big question is whether Gazans are actually getting this message. How easy is it for them to actually get that? Israel is relaying these evacuations via social media, via leaflets that have been dropped, with QR codes that take you to a rather complicated map, a grid map with different numbers in different areas. So not only is it complicated to understand, but it is -- it is, you cannot assume that Gazans are actually getting this message because of how weak the internet connection has been, because of the numerous blackouts in communication that we've seen over the course of the past few weeks. And at the same time, Kate, we are starting to see and hear more of an alarm from the highest levels of the Biden administration. Top Biden administration officials talking about the imperative of keeping civilians safe. Over the weekend, we heard the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who was talking about his experience in urban warfare. He said you can only win in urban warfare if you keep the civilian population protected. Here's a little bit more of what you have to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In total, three commercial vessels were attacked by these missiles and a few of them were actually struck directly and suffered damage. Now, throughout all of this, the Houthi rebels were also launching drones. And the USS Carney shot down three of those drones, according to U.S. Central Command, and there were no injuries or damage to the U.S. destroyer during the series of attacks. But look, none of this is coming in a vacuum. This all comes as these Iran-backed proxy groups have ramped up their attacks on the U.S. and its allies over the last several months in response to the U.S.'s support for Israel as part of the Israel-Hamas war. And the Houthi militants have said that they will not stop these attacks because they say they're standing in solidarity with the Palestinians. But in the meantime, the U.S. says that it is considering all possible options for a response. The U.S. has responded in the past to these attacks by these Iran- backed groups in Iraq and Syria. They have launched airstrikes on weapons depots and storage facilities being used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iranian proxy groups. However, those have not deterred these attacks. And the attacks have really only escalated over the last several months to the point where we are now at over 70 of these attacks being carried out by these Iran-backed groups against U.S. and coalition forces in the region. So the question now is what is going to stop these attacks? The U.S. says at this point that they are weighing all of their options. John.",

Negotiators had a conversation on Friday evening, but after that they did not continue to talk throughout the weekend. That is because Democrats, in their view, think that Republicans are pushing these talks too far and too close to what the House passed immigration bill included earlier this year. That is an on-starter, Democrats say, and part of the reason that there is a pause in these talks. Now, I've covered a lot of these negotiations up here on Capitol Hill. It's very common that negotiations fall apart before they come back together, but things are not in a good place right now. And multiple sources that I'm talking to believe that it's possible that the Senate could move forward with this money for Ukraine and Israel without additional border funding. The problem, not additional border funding, but changes to border policy, the problem with that approach is that it's dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. Speaker Mike Johnson has made extremely clear that he is going to need robust policy changes from the Senate in order to move forward in his chamber. Democrats also need Republican votes in the Senate, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear that he also wants robust policy changes to the southern border. So, things not in a good place right now. This morning, things can always change, Sara, but right now it looks like those border talks are stalled. SIDNER: I think the headline here, border talk stalled, not in a good place when it comes to trying to put this through Congress. Thank you so much, Lauren, for your reporting. Kate.",

There are more and more conservative, hardline Republicans saying they're unhappy that, you know, he's looking to Democrats to solve some of the issues they're facing on the floor. It's really a no win for any Republican leader. This is just more pronounced, but it's been that way for quite a while, quite frankly, in the U.S. House. There are no easy solutions. And quite frankly, part of it is because our U.S. government was built on kind of this principle of, no side should get everything they want. There should be a level of compromise in coming towards the middle. That's quite frankly what our founding fathers envisioned, but unfortunately, particularly in the hard right, that unwillingness to work together, that willingness to kind of dig in to get your way is kind of what they are prioritizing right now.
