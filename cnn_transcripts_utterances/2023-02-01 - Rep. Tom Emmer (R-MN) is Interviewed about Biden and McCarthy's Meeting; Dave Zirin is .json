It is shaping up to be quite a tense meeting given the White House has said it will not negotiate. They want McCarthy to commit to not letting the U.S. default on its financial obligations. On the other hand, McCarthy has accused the president of being irresponsible for saying he is refusing to negotiate.Republican Congressman Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota is joining us now. Good morning, Congressman. I guess the first big question is, what is Kevin McCarthy going in there expecting to happen during this meeting with President Biden today? REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): Well, it's great to be with you, Kaitlan. I think, first off, you correctly set where the parties were probably a week ago with the president saying there would be no negotiations and McCarthy saying, look, we've got to be able to talk about reasonable stuff, sensible stuff, responsible stuff when it comes to what we're going to do with the debt ceiling. I think today is a great sign. I think today shows you when the president is inviting Kevin McCarthy down, that the negotiations are beginning. And that's a good thing.",

This is a get to know you, I would say, meeting where they're going to sit down and talk about their mutual goals, their concerns. I think Kevin McCarthy will reassure the president there will be no default. He will reassure the president that Social Security and Medicare are off the table. That's not going to be discussed.But certainly, as he - I expect he will tell the president, as he's told others over the last few weeks, you can't tell the American people there is no waste in our spending, government spending, that we shouldn't be looking at. So, I think it will be a good first meeting, Kaitlan, where the two - the two leaders will sit down and have a good conversation, which, hopefully, as we proceed, will lead to some type of resolution that's in the best interest of the American people.",

Everything's on the table in terms of scrutinizing what we're spending on, why we're spending it. Can we spend better? Can we spend more efficiently?

Keep in mind her own -- members of her own party have criticized her anti-Semitic remarks and said that she is not worthy of serving on this committee because of these past statements and because of her bias.It's much like a judge, for instance, Kaitlan. When a judge gets a case, if he or she has a preconceived bias or interest, it is the rule that they need to recuse themselves. She is not willing to do that. So, the process will be, she will present in front of the Rules Committee. If they agree with her, then it's over. If they don't agree with her, it will come to the House floor. She will be able to debate to the entire assembly of members her case and then there will be a vote. And if she loses that vote, she will be prevented from being seated on the Foreign Affairs Committee. She'll be able to be on any other committee in Congress, but she won't be able to be on that one.

And, third, there are things we can do to step forward for screening future police, monitoring those who are in service in law enforcement, and making certain that we have standards of conduct that are acknowledged to be sensible. The things we've seen, the evidence we've seen, the videotape is just a reminder that we cannot stand by and let this go without having a purpose and a course of action ourselves.",
