He's trying to get to the right of Donald Trump on everything being Mr. conservative -- the true conservative, as the Ted Cruz people would say. He literally has much of the Ted Cruz team working for him on this. And that didn't work last time. Ted Cruz lost. And I think what Donald Trump showed you was that a lot of these Republican primary voters -- very few of them are going in with a checklist saying here are all of the ideological positions I have and I want the person who is most to the right on them. They're looking for an ethos that Donald Trump has.

In this case, somebody's got to beat Trump someplace and the rest of them have got to drop out. But in the meantime, you don't know who that's going to be. And so, you might have a big kamikaze candidate right now, which is what I would say Chris Christie is likely to be -- Chris \"Kamikaze\" Christie. He is going to take Donald Trump on head-on and prosecute this guy. And he is a top-notch prosecutor. And so, Trump is going to have deal with a prosecutor on stage with him at some point, I would imagine, and that could open a lane for somebody else.

But I think if he's going to be beaten somebody has to make the case that he shouldn't be the nominee.I think it's -- I think people replay 2016 too much. In 2016, you plausibly had a majority of Republican voters who didn't want Trump as the nominee. Who were quite skeptical of him. And you had that fragmented field and it meant that he didn't need 50 percent to win -- that 40 percent or so was good enough. Now he has won over the voters of the party. He has -- he's not over 50 percent in the polls except for a handful of them, but there's a clear majority of these voters to whom Trump is acceptable. They think he was a good president and they think he could be a good president again. And so if you're going to beat him this time it's different from 2016. You have to make a case not just for yourself; you have to make a case about why should they change their mind about Donald Trump. And so I think Van is right. But it's important that Chris Christie is out there doing that even though I don't think the vote -- if he can -- if he succeeds in convincing voters that Chris -- that Trump was not the winner they thought, I don't think that means those voters are going to go to Christie himself. But I think it's right that someone needs to actually prosecute that case. If you're running against the frontrunner you can't just talk about yourself and you can't just obliquely talk about them.
