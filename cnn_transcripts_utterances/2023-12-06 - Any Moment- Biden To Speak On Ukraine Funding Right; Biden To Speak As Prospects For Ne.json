It fails to approve more money for Ukraine and agreement on Capitol Hill is looking quite grim right now. As the White House is already been warning about the dangerous stakes for the U.S. now the president is going to weigh in. And lawmakers, it's very -- up in the air whether or not they're going to act.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House, Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Priscilla, I want to start with you. What are you hearing about what the president will say?",

He's also gone to the pages of The Washington Post to express how important it is that this has passed.And the resounding message from the president has been that this supplemental request in aid to Ukraine and to Israel is not just about helping these countries abroad, but it goes directly to the national security of the United States. And that is likely what he is going to say today. Now, just to remind viewers, this is a $105 billion supplemental request. It includes $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, and $14 billion for border security, among other asks. But it is the part about border security and border policy, where this has hit a snag. Republicans have wanted robust policy changes to pass this supplemental. Now this of course, comes at a delicate time for the White House, which is seeing high encounters on the U.S.-Mexico border. And what the White House has said is that this supplemental request includes funds to assist with that and that they have also tried to pass policies to stem the flow. But of course, all of this just taking on added urgency by the end of this month.",

Those proposed changes are bridge too far for Senate Democrats. And they are saying that they will not accept it. Now the concern is going to be what will happen after the Senate Republicans later this afternoon plan to block a measure to actually fund Ukraine, fund Israel, provide money for border security but does not institute those changes -- the policy changes that they have been demanding. But Republicans I talked to even the ones who are staunch supporters of Ukraine say that blocking this measure will send a message to the administration that is time to cut a deal to their liking on the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): We have to be concerned with our safety at home and our way are not safe and sound and it's getting worse. This is a chronic situation that we have to fix. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): We've told the Democrats in the very beginning. Ukraine aid needs to be paired with a provision to stop the flood at the border.

We said there's a lot of breaking news this hour. This now Kevin McCarthy is resigning. The ousted speaker announced today that he will leave Congress by the end of this year. He did so in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.I want to get to Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. Melanie, this is obviously big news because he is the former House Speaker.

Republicans right now can only afford to lose three Republicans on any party line votes.That number is going to go down to two Republicans once Kevin McCarthy leads. And that is something that is not lost on members. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was a staunch ally of Kevin McCarthy summed it up best when she said, I hope no one dies. A very succinct grim reference to the idea that the House Majority right now is so tenuous, especially when you have such a chaotic and rambunctious group of Republicans, the same Republicans that ultimately forced Kevin McCarthy out of this speakership last month or back in October, I should say. So, a huge political and practical implications here with this decision. Now, it was highly anticipated and long expected. In fact, me and my colleague, Pamela Brown, reported in October that it was expected he was going to step down. McCarthy denied it at the time, said he was even going to seek reelection. Clearly, that is not the case. And he has found that adjusting from life as a speaker to a rank-and-file member has been difficult. There's been a lot of bad blood in the conference since then. So, it's unclear what Kevin McCarthy will do next. But he did offer some clues in this op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. I want to read you part of what he wrote. He said, I've decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways. I know my work is only getting started. I will continue to recruit our country's best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders. And he also made clear he has no regrets, including about that decision to put a stop gap funding bill on the floor with the support of Democrats which ultimately led to his ouster. So, we'll see what Kevin McCarthy decides to do next. But in the meantime, I'm told that House Republicans are planning to toast Kevin McCarthy at a party next week. This is something that was planned before his public announcement, of course, Republicans were expecting him to retire. And they said they just wanted to thank him according to sources involved in the planning. Dana.",

I want to talk about this in more from our new poll, with who else David Chalian. What does it tell us?David Chalian: Well, as you noted, if you take a look at Biden's approval here, Dana, in our brand-new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. He's at 37 percent approval, 63 percent disapproval, as he's about to turn the corner into his reelection year. And look at this number over time. You know that it's a numeric low, but he's, hey, been hanging out down here for some time. Look here, he starts going down after the Afghanistan withdrawal. That really took a hit in his numbers in 2021. There was this uptick here in his approval around the time of the 2022 midterms last year, where Democrats performed better, but basically this entire year has been a downward slide now to this new numeric low of 37 percent.",

It's a pretty poor outlook from the American people, only 29 percent assess current economic conditions are good -- as good. 71 percent say they are poor. I'll note that's a slight uptick from what we've seen before. But still, it's in the cellar in terms of positive overall impression to the economy. And his approval rating -- the president's approval rating on the economy, Dana, is even worse than his overall approval rating. It's only a 33 percent, 67 percent disapprove. You are right, we saw on issues like abortion rights or voting rights and election integrity, that Democrats have an advantage of those issues. And they did turn out on those issues last year. So that is a good note. But I would just note on what voters say right now is the most important issue, he's got real trouble as well.",

Of course, Donald Trump's words about a dictator, that certainly is also likely to be front and center.

DeSantis has not been a terribly effective attack dog on the debate stage, I will say, at least not against Nikki Haley. So far. I mean, Vivek Ramaswamy, took more swipes at her in the previous debate. But I think she even got the better of him in that. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that when I look at that ad, I see that Hillary Clinton has become this massive boogey woman on the right, largely because of former President Donald Trump. And it's someone that DeSantis clearly sees as it could be an effective attack to tether Haley to a former secretary of state. The leading candidate for Democrats two cycles ago, who has been totally demonized on the right to the point where, you know, they chanted lock her up the last few cycles. And that he thinks that it's easier to tie her to someone like that, despite all the lies that were spread about Hillary Clinton in the 2016 cycle, because that's something that really gets the base going. BASH: Yeah. And you were alluding to this, but I think we should say it very clearly, which is when Nikki Haley talks about Hillary Clinton, she's talking about being inspired by the now secretary -- former secretary because she was telling women, get off the couch, get out of your chair, get out of your comfort zone and go run for office, no matter what your political persuasion is.
