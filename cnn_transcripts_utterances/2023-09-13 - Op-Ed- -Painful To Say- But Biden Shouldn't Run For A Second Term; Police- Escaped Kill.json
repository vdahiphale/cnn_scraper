      "sentences": "A new op-ed penned in The Washington Post urges President Biden not to run again for president. Columnist David Ignatius writes, quote, \"I don't think Biden and Vice President Harris should run for reelection. It's painful to say that, given my admiration for much of what they have accomplished. But if he and Harris campaign together in 2024, I think Biden risks undoing his great achievement, which was stopping Trump.\"Now, recent polling suggests that many Democrats agree with Ignatius. Sixty-seven percent of Democratic-leaning voters say they prefer a different Democratic nominee. I want to bring in CNN's Jeff Zeleny because Jeff, I think what's interesting about this is there have been plenty of opinion writers who have wrote a column like this. There's a reason why this is reverberating around Washington, D.C. both last night and this morning. Why?",

I mean, the senators who ran against President Biden four years ago have been quiet as church mice on this. They have not talked about the fact that there should be a challenge -- Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren, Sen, Klobuchar, Sen. Booker, and others. So I would be surprised if Democrats would speak out against this because they are afraid of weakening the president. They do not want to do that. Of course, given now this impeachment inquiry coming, that could strengthen him politically in the long term, but these concerns remain that David Ignatius expressed this morning. But this may be something that could get to the president in his head because again, he respects and admires him. They both do, each other, so much.",

He was shining shoes, working in the fields. So it's not so much that he knows how to survive in the woods. I think that the stealing of the rifle, which has a scope and a flashlight -- it basically is sending a message I will not be taken alive. And his mother even says she's given up. She doesn't believe that he will be captured alive. And that she thinks that because he really needs his complete freedom to simply sustain himself psychologically, everyone is in danger. Because if they close in on him I think you might see a situation like David Matt (sic) from the Dannemora prison break in 2015. He will just take as many shots as he can and he's going to give up the ghost because he's not going back to prison.",

I've got a couple here that I picked up at the pharmacy yesterday. And it's really just the oral form that we're talking about -- the pills that you take for nasal decongestants.Phenylephrine is different from a drug called Pseudoephedrine, which a lot of people have heard of. That was put behind pharmacy counters in 2005 and 2006 because of the risk that you could use it to create methamphetamine. And so, you can still get it without a prescription in most states but you have to provide your I.D. to the pharmacist and go up to the counter and ask for it.

And this advisory committee to the FDA voted unanimously to agree that the studies show these are not effective. And the problem is they're incredibly popular. More than 240 million bottles or packages of these cold and flu medicines were sold in 2022 alone, amounting to $1.8 billion in retail sales, and that's not even including online sales, Costco. It's just the retail stores. And so a lot of people are using these. It's not a safety issue but the designation they get is generally regarded as safe and effective.
