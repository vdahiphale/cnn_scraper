According to SDL Auctions, the bunker was built in the 1950s and is nestled 14 feet below a country field in Derbyshire, England. Roughly the size of a garage, this cozy decommissioned bunker retains some of its original charm with classic bunker features like an asbestos fire blanket, vintage binoculars, and a still-stocked pantry that`s not at all gross. Also, this ominous Cold War hotline phone for literal red alerts. But it also has sought-after upgrades like carpeting, velvet drapes, and an unused chemical toilet. Hey, can`t put a price on that. Actually, auctioneers expect buyers will fork over up to $26,000 for this homey piece of history, perfect for those looking to shield themselves from a volatile real estate market. And also, you know, a thermonuclear blast. Hey, you know what rocks? This Minnesota home covered in rocks. If you`re passing through the town of Arco, stop and marvel at this craggy crib that was once a gas station but is now the uber-unique home of the Herzogs, who`ve lived here for 25 years. Covered in everything from pipestone to pink quartz to volcanic rock, it may seem random, but the owners say there`s more here than meets the eye.",
