In one CNN poll, 12 percent of those surveyed said they have chosen a candidate but could still change their minds.

I know this year has been very difficult given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza. And given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon. It is devastating. And now Sinwar's death can and must be a turning point. Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all.

FiveThirtyEight has the odds of Trump or Harris winning Michigan as dead even. So, Oakland County and I'll add to that, Kent County, are really two places to watch.Oakland County, that includes suburban Detroit; Kent County includes Grand Rapids. Both have really been trending blue in recent elections. But some polls show that Trump is making some inroads there. I think both Oakland and Kent Counties could really be leading indicators for the rest of Michigan. In 2020, Joe Biden won those counties by combined 130,000 votes and his statewide margin was about 154,000. So Trump doesn't have to win these counties. He just needs to improve his performance by maybe 10,000 or 20,000 votes, perform a bit better than he did four years ago in Michigan's rural counties. If he does, I think he could crack Michigan. On the flip side, Harris can actually cede Biden's margin in some of these counties, Trump will have a significantly harder time outside winning.",

We've been hearing also this morning from the deputy of Yahya Sinwar about what his death will mean, saying that the demands of Hamas remain as they have been for the last year, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the liberation of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Essentially the same demands they've been making throughout. The question now, of course, what the succession will choose to do, who it will be, first of all, whether it will be Yahya Sinwar's brother, still believed by Israeli forces to be inside the Gaza Strip, or some of those Hamas leaders who are currently in exile in Qatar.

And that, of course, itself would be an impact, could have an impact in the forthcoming poll. We do expect a response before but just in terms of what American officials have been saying and the president himself have been saying about what Yahya Sinwar's death might mean. Initially we'd heard from President Biden, hope that this might represent something of a breakthrough, an opportunity certainly to start looking for a ceasefire since the comments have been a little bit more tempered, that whilst the possibility of a cease-fire with Lebanon is there in Gaza, says the American president, looks more difficult.

      "sentences": "For the first time in human history the so-called global water cycle is off balance, causing a crisis that could wreak havoc on our lives and the world's economies. The water cycle refers to the way water moves around the Earth from evaporation to condensation to precipitation.The Global Commission on the Economics of Water published a warning in a new report, which outlines the risks of the imbalance. And the commission says disruptions to the water cycle are already causing water scarcity and they warn this could impact more than half of global food production, which in turn is projected to shave off a chunk of countries' gross domestic product by 2050. And low-income countries could see the worst of the impacts. And joining us now from Stockholm, Sweden, is Johan Rockstrom. He's the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Thank you so much for being on with us here. So the global water cycle is off balance. I gave a brief explanation of what that is. But can you help us understand how exactly this is happening?",

      "sentences": "The answer is yes. We have the U.N. International Panel for Climate Change, the IPCC, showing that we've now reached 1.2 degrees Celsius. So global mean surface temperature rise caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning. In particular, we've just touched 1.5 degrees Celsius in the year2023, the warmest temperature on Earth over the past 100 years. That is well established. And 2023 was a record year on water extremes. Insurance companies estimate that this has cost the global economy $200 billion U.S. And all of these extremes caused by climate change are in one way or another related to water. Storms, floods; if you look at Helene and Milton, it's not verified that these were reinforced by climate change but we know that it's exactly what we're expecting. Warmer oceans lead to more fierce storms and more downpours of extreme rainfall, resulting in flooding, which impacting on people's livelihoods and assets. So I would say that this is now well established that we're causing imbalance in the global energy balance on planet Earth, which causes an imbalance in the water cycle.",

Everything depends on fresh water. And what we're seeing is that river basins around the world are running dry. We have the Colorado River, we have the Limpopo River, we have the Yellow River. If you go from China to Africa, to the U.S. we see massive changes in the flow in these rivers, which is because of land use change. So deforestation. I mean, just one statistic, 50 percent of the rainfall on land is not originating from the ocean but it's originating from healthy nature, healthy forest systems in upwind countries. And you have atmospheric rivers flowing the water downwind. So we see that the way we degrade nature is impacting on the water availability in downwind regions. And this is affecting economies across the world. So, yes, it's very concrete. It's very localized and it's having major impacts.",

We talk of a number of missions and mission number one is actually to manage the food production in the world in a different way.Because over 90 percent of your and my fresh water need every day is actually not for drinking water, is not for health. It's for food. We calculate it's quite a dramatic number. The U.N., the United Nations, shows we need some 50 to 100 liters of high-quality fresh water each day for our human health. But if you want to have a healthy diet, you need another 3,500 liters per person per day. So there you see what an enormous jump. If we can manage water and agriculture for irrigation, drip irrigation systems, having more efficient management of water for food production, that's one way of really saving water and building more resilient economies around the world.",

Game four though, it was tight throughout, we had 14 lead changes and 13 ties. No team led by more than six points. Liberty were down by three with under 90 seconds to go. Jonquel Jones gets the bucket plus the foul there. She hit the free throw to tie it up. The Liberty, they had three chances with under a minute to go to take the lead. But Brianna Stewart misses twice. Now on the Lynx next possession, Courtney Williams is going to miss. But Bridget Carleton gets the rebound and gets fouled by Sabrina Ionescu. Carlton makes both free throws. So could we get some more Sabrina magic this time to win the title? No. Her shot no good at the buzzer. Lynx win 82 to 80 to force a winner take all game  five on Sunday. After the game Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello, not happy with the officiating. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Game four another nail-biter in Cleveland and Carlos Dan just continuing to be one of the best post-season hitters ever, homering again. This was his fourth of the postseason.That put the Yankees up 6-2 in the sixth. Bottom eighth now, two outs, Guardians down a run. David Fry gets a dribbler but Mark Lauder Jr., a bad throw, Cleveland ties it at 6 on the air. But the Yankees get lucky themselves in the ninth. Brian Rocchio drops the ball here trying to make the play. New York would end up getting two runs in the inning. They win it 8-6. They can close out that series tonight. Over in the NLCS, the Mets staying alive with a big win over the Dodgers in game five, Pete Alonzo setting the tone from the get-go with a three-run home run in the first. The Mets then put up five in the third. Starlyn Marta, he was 4 for 5, 3 RBIs in this one after getting no runs off Jack Flaherty in game one of the series. Mets getting eight off of him in just three innings last night. New York wins 12-6. So what we've learned, Kim, you can never count out these Mets. The Subway Series still alive. We could get a Mets-Yankees or we get Dodgers-Yankees or Guardians. Guardians still have a chance to come back. But baseball postseason has been great thus far.",
