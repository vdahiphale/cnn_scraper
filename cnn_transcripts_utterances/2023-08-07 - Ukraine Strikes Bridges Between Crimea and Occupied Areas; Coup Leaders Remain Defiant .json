Ukraine very effective in its use of waterborne drones against a Russian amphibian ship, against a Russian oil cargo tanker, even against Russia bridges into Crimea over the past two weeks, attacking things, frankly, that Russia were thought were impregnable. And at the same time, too, Russia responding with hypersonic missiles over the past 24 hours, some of which Ukraine acknowledged hit military targets, including an aviation field and an aviation plant near where I'm standing here in Zaporizhzhia. So an uptick, certainly, away from the intensity of the fight along the Southern frontier, where the counteroffensive is focused, but that is still where Ukraine is putting most of its efforts, desperate for a breakthrough.

The Philippine Coast Guard says its vessels were escorting supply ships to troops in the Spratly Islands chain, which is claimed by multiple countries. China says it has sovereignty over the islands, and in fact, claims almost all of the South China Sea and says the ships illegally intruded into Chinese waters and that its Coast Guard took necessary action. At least 14 people are dead as a result of flooding in Northeastern China. One of those killed is the vice mayor of Shulan City, Northwestern China also suffering heavy agricultural losses from all the rain. The area is a major supplier of food to the rest of China. In addition, 40,000 people have been evacuated from Wuchang (ph) City. They're part of a massive wave of people being forced from their homes because of flooding. Aid is being trucked in for more than a million people. State media says it could take a month for the waters to recede in some areas, the flooding coming in the aftermath of Typhoon Doksuri, which slammed into China at the end of July. And flooding is also swamping parts of Europe. In the small nation of Slovenia, which borders Austria, the cost of repairing flood damage could be more than half a billion dollars. That's after a month's worth of rain fell in just one day. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (voice-over): By floodwaters, this house in Slovenia no match for days of torrential rain. Residents say they watched and waited as a nearby river swelled in the storms, which began last week. But by Saturday they were forced to evacuate after the river burst its banks, leaving nothing to contain the rushing waters. This man says that eight people lived there, both young and old. He says it's a huge loss, but he's grateful they got out in time. Slovenia's prime minister says this is the worst natural disaster in the nation's history, affecting two-thirds of the country, with large parts of Central and Northern Slovenia deluged with floods. Emergency workers are making a public plea for rubber boats, so that they can reach areas no longer reachable by road. This is what they're up against: dangerously fast waters, which have stranded people in some areas. Volunteers in this Northern town risking their lives to save two tourists stuck in the rapids. One local mayor says he's just now getting a chance to inspect the damage. He says much of his town has been inundated since Friday, and what isn't covered in water is caked in mud. He says it's a huge financial loss and estimates the damage in his town alone will run into the millions of dollars. The prime minister echoing that concern, saying the price tag to clean up and rebuild across the country could top half a billion dollars. But some residents are already starting that process, and local media says around 600 soldiers have been deployed to hard-hit areas to help with the efforts. This restaurant owner says it will be hard to bounce back from what she calls an apocalypse, but she says it least this disaster is one that many people are weathering together. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And on the flight back to Rome's Fiumicino Airport, the pope said that he had a private meeting with some 13 victims of clergy abuse in Portugal and that this meeting was very painful to him. During that press conference, he also told journalists that he was in good health and feels really great after the trip. It was definitely an intense five days for the octogenarian, but he was in great form, despite recent surgery and mobility issues. His message to young Catholics on the trip was clear.

So how do these microbes work when it comes to mosquitoes and malaria? MARCELO JACOBS-LORENA, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, JOHN HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes, the initial discovery was that any mosquitoes that carry this bacterium is incapable of transmitting the parasite. And then looking into the mechanisms, we found out that this bacteria secretes something into the supernatant (ph), outside of the cell. So -- and that is -- contains the inhibitor.
