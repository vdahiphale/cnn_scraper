I'm Jake Tapper.And we start with our law and justice lead and a dramatic day in the New York court, where the jury is deciding how much Donald Trump must pay to a woman. He defamed as a jury previously decided. This afternoon, Judge Lewis Kaplan threatened to kick the former president out of the courtroom, claiming Mr. Trump was being disruptive during E. Jean Carroll's testimony to which Trump responded, quote, I would love it. This was after the judge had already warned Trump to speak more quietly when talking with his lawyers during Ms. Carroll's testimony. Carroll told the court today that Trump, quote, shattered her reputation by publicly denying he sexually abused her and attacking her. She said she has gotten death threats and had to hire private security because of his comments. Last year, a jury found that Trump did sexually abused Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996 and that he defamed her while publicly denying her claims and viciously attacking her credibility. Carroll is asking now for more than $10 million in damages in addition to the $5 million the court previously awarded her. Donald Trump is expected to make remarks after court ends today, part of his continued strategy of trying to turn the myriad courtrooms into the campaign trail. The former president was in Iowa Monday night for the Iowa caucuses, which he won with more than 50 percent of Republicans support. He then flew to New York and sat in the same New York courtroom yesterday as part of this case before going to an event in New Hampshire last night, New Hampshire being the next state to vote in the Republican primary for president. That'll take place Tuesday. Trump then flew back to New York and returned to his home at Trump Tower before returning to the Manhattan courtroom today. Tonight, back on the plane, expected to head back to New Hampshire for an event in the city of Portsmouth. CNN's Paula Reid is in New York where we're hearing Trump is set to speak after court ramps today. And, Paula, it's not only Trump being combative with a judge, right? It's also Trump's lawyers.",

Look, when you walk into a federal courthouse and there are rules not being disruptive while a witnesses testifying is something that applies to everyone. It is unclear why Trump does not think he has to abide by this rule. Then when it comes to his lawyers, just a few moments ago, one of his lawyers tried to introduce some evidence that the judge was not aware of that he had to remind her that this is his courtroom.I mean, that's pretty standard. There's a whole class in law school about evidence and how you introduce it. So, it appears that Trump is aware of the rules. Alina Habba also clearly aware of the rules of evidence, but we're seeing this pattern where Trump voluntarily attends legal proceedings that he does not have to be present for, then refuses to follow the rules, spars with a judge and then throws his hands up and says, look, I'm the victim of an unfair system. Now, Jake, look, Trump and his lawyers and some of his other cases, they are litigating some very legitimate constitutional questions.

Jean Carroll is maybe 20 feet and anyone who has been in a courtroom knows that while you're in the well of the courtroom, if you're a lawyer or a party, that jury is watching everything you do, they're evaluating everything you do. And so this conduct could come welcome back to really haunt Donald Trump. I will say there's an interesting showdown of personalities here, because Judge Kaplan controls his courtroom more tightly than I think any other judge. I've been in front of, and thus far, he seems to have a pretty low tolerance for the histrionics from Donald Trump.

Even if you don't like them, if you don't -- if you think it's a witch hunt or whatever else. And so, this is an incredibly risky strategy for the former president.

There are mounting concerns around the potential for that crossfire to escalate into a deeper conflict between Lebanon and Israel. We heard today from Israel's chief of general staff warning that the likelihood of war between Israel and Hezbollah has increased in comparison to previous ones that Israel is at a point of increased readiness.Those comments were made during a visit to reservist stations along Israel's northern border that has been a point of concern for some time now, of course, we've heard just in the last week from Hezbollah's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah. He has a directly connected the situation along that border, with the situation in Gaza, saying that they can be no discussion around a potential cessation of violence between Hezbollah and Israel without a ceasefire in Gaza first -- Jake.",

Garland will meet with the victims' families later today.His visit comes a day ahead of the U.S. Department of Justice's report on the botched police response to the Uvalde school massacre. The long anticipated review comes more than a year and half after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary, the deadliest U.S. school shooting in almost a decade, even though there were numerous 911 calls made inside the classrooms. As this deadly rampage was happening, the nearly 400 responding officers waited outside those rooms for more than an hour, 77 minutes, to intervene and to ultimately take out the shooter. To this day, there really has not been any serious accountability or even explanation for such a delayed response. Instead, there's been silence or contradictions from law enforcement, public officials, and school administrators, leaving grieving families haunted by the idea that their loved ones left trapped in those classrooms could have been saved that day. Ending school shootings feels like such a daunting task given the degree and amount of gun violence in the United States and the unwillingness of so many officials to do anything about it. But there does appear to be some kind of hope. A new study published by the medical journal pediatrics shows an anonymous tips work in preventing school shootings and suicides. Let's bring in CNN security correspondent Josh Campbell. Josh, tell us about the results of the study published in pediatrics.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Jake. Well, this endless wave of mass shootings that you and I have continued to cover has been met by researchers stepping up efforts to look at ways of preventing such shootings. And one of those that has proven to be very effective according to this new study, pertains to these anonymous reporting platforms that are available to school children. Researchers in particular looked at the platform, see something anonymous reporting system that's run by the violence prevention group, Sandy Hook Promise, and what they found was that was very effective in one state looking at a few years of data.I'll show you some of those results. They determined that this system allowed for over 1,000 mental health interventions over 100 prevented suicides and six averted school shootings. That's because a student called into this tip line or reported online saying that they saw something concerning. They wanted councilors or responders to take a look. You could see the impact of their work. And what we're talking about kids, obviously anonymity is key because in so many instances, they might be talking about their own best friend who might be talking about harming themselves or harming others. In fact, law enforcement who has studied this issue, including the U.S. Secret Service, they have found or read you part of one of their recent reports, anonymous and confidential reporting options can broaden the appeal of reporting, especially for students who are concerned about being identified then ostracized by their peers after reporting, research finds that the fear of being ostracized are experiencing other forms of retaliation is a significant barrier to reporting. So, again, as you mentioned, it seemed so daunting covering these shootings, but at least one possible glimmer of hope here. The kids themselves, picking up the phone or go into these apps, going online to report concerning behaviors to help save lives -- Jake.",

But in this instance, where we're talking about anonymous platforms, we've seen both Republicans and Democrats come out and say that they want to see action.I spoke with one legislator in Michigan who said that this was after that Oxford High School shooting, he said that they formed a task force and one of the key findings was they wanted to provide more resources to that state's online platform that they use to report tips. So, again, very important. Finally, Jake, if you're an educator out there or if you're a parent wondering how I can find out more information, visit our story, CNN.com/health. You will find a wealth of resources in order to help educate kids about the ways that they can report concerning behavior, Jake.",
