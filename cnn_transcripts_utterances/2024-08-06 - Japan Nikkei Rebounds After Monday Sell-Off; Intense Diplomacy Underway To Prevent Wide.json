Japan's Nikkei has rebounded sharply from Monday's record sell off. The index has managed to claw back more than half of the 12 percent loss, the biggest since October of 1987.The question now is whether U.S. markets can follow suit. The Dow closed down more than a thousand points Monday, its worst percentage loss in nearly two years, and the NASDAQ fell nearly 3-1/2 percent as tech stocks took a beating. Investors are concerned over weak jobs numbers and a possible recession, but U.S. Futures are pointing to a rebound when markets open today, you can see there more encouraging numbers. I want to go now live to Tokyo and CNN's Hanako Montgomery. So, Hanako, what is the latest on markets in Asia, and what can we expect from the financial day ahead for the rest of the world?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Rosemary, it's good to see you. So, on Tuesday, we've seen Asia stock markets recover somewhat after the massive losses we saw just a day before, but experts are warning me that the markets will likely remain very volatile until September, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely make some rate cuts.Now, the reason why we saw Asian stock markets, and specifically the Japanese stock market, which was the hardest hit just yesterday, recover in about 24 hours, is really twofold. The first is the fact that we received better than expected service sector -- service sector data for the month of July for the United States, which has eased some concerns about a potential recession for the world's largest economy. Now, the second reason is because the Japanese yen has stabilized a bit and its value has dropped a little bit. Just yesterday, the U.S. Japan -- the U.S. dollar in Japan rate surged very highly, and the value of the Japanese yen went up very significantly, which spooked a lot of investors and hedge funds. And the reason why we did see those massive movements is largely attributed to the fact that the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the second time in 14 years just last week, the interest rate is now at about 0.25 percent which sounds very low and it is compared to many other countries around the world. But the reason why Japan said it needs to raise interest rates is because it needs to prop up the value of its currency. Over the last year, we saw the U.S. Japan rate drop significantly, and the value of the yen dropped significantly, which has made the cost of imports for things like food and fuel that much more costly. So, the Bank of Japan raised those interest rates and it's work, the value of the Japanese yen has gone up. But again, that sudden surge that we saw yesterday spooked hedge funds. It spooked investors, which led to that selling spree we saw yesterday. But now that the U.S.-Japan rate has stabilized somewhat, it's now trading at 146 yen to the dollar, it has -- it has eased some concerns. But Rosemary, we're not out of the woods yet. As you just said, we're expecting to see some changes potentially in the U.S. and U.K. stock markets in the hours ahead. And experts have warned that we could be watching with bated breath what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do come September, Rosemary.",

They have promised that there will be a response, but we simply don't know what that will look like at this point. Nor does Israel and nor does the United States.You saw the Situation Room meeting in Washington that really shows that they are trying to figure out exactly what this retaliation might look like. Now, we've heard from two U.S. officials that in April, many of the military assets that Iran may well use when it comes to some kind of retaliation against Israel had been moved. So, this has made it far more difficult for U.S. intelligence to try and predict what will happen, and of course, the timing of when that might happen. Now, when we did see that retaliation from Iran back in April, it was very much telegraphed when we saw some 300 drones and missiles rockets fired on Israel itself. So, it gave Israel -- it gave Israel's allies, specifically the United States, time to prepare and to be able to bring down the vast majority of those projectiles. It's a very different situation this time around, because they simply don't know what they are up against. Now, we know that Gen. Kurilla, who's the CENTCOM chief is in the region at this point. He was last time round as well able to coordinate that response to Tehran's retaliation, and this time around, he is in the region as well, although no specification on which country he is in. But that shows that they are trying to have some kind of protection, as the U.S. has said, that it will help Israel and that it will try to protect them from any kind of attack. Now, as you said, we have heard from the Israeli side as well. We've heard from the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant telling his troops that they have to be prepared for anything, saying that they have to be prepared, not just for defensive moves, but also for offensive moves. But Tehran has been very clear that there will be some kind of retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political bureau chief, who's in -- who was in Tehran at the time of that killing. And there's also differing narratives on how he was killed. From Tehran, we're hearing that it was an airborne projectile and that there was a severe explosion outside the guest house, but we have sources close to the matter telling CNN that they believe that there was an explosive device planted inside that guest house potentially months before. So, there are a lot of unknowns at this point, Rosemary, but what we are hearing from certainly the Iranian side, the certainty is that there will be some kind of retaliation.",

The U.S. blaming Iranian proxies for the attack. Is this an effort to drag the U.S. into the conflict and if so, how should it respond? PINKASI mean, a regional, wide conflagration. But I have to take a somewhat heretic view here and maybe give the viewers some food for thought. The worst scenario is an escalation with Hezbollah, not necessarily with Iran, because, in terms, Rosemary, of range of missiles, the number of missiles and the accuracy of the missiles, all of which are interconnected, Hezbollah poses a much greater threat. What the Iranians pose is a threat of a regional escalation that the U.S. is so worried about. Now, the funny thing, or the tragic thing, or the puzzling thing about all this, is that the U.S. does not want to be dragged into the war, that's obvious. The Iranians do not want America to be dragged into the war because they have a lot of assets that may be compromised in that process. No one actually wants the Americans to be dragged into this, except arguably Israel, which thinks that an American strike on Iran could turn the debacle of October 7th into some kind of a strategic game changer. I think it's false and flawed. A flawed assumption, but there you have to.",

And the timing was also important and pertinent because it was the inauguration of the new president in Iran, and Iran already pledged and vowed and promised to retaliate.So, the question, the first set of issue issues, is whether this is just from Iran versus Israel in a con -- you know, in a contained setting, or conversely, is Hezbollah also involved? Because if Hezbollah is also involved, and as I said before, they pose a greater threat, that may also mean that the Houthis in Yemen may be involved. And before you know it, we have a 360 degree attack. The second set of calculations that we're looking at is what exactly are they targeting? You know, in nuclear theory, there used to be a distinction between counter force and counter value, counter force meaning you hit military installations, military forces war -- you know, weapons, platforms and counter value. You hit power plants, airports, seaports and population centers. If the Iranians and Hezbollah go for counter value, then we're looking at a major war. If, on the other hand, they limit their retaliation, their response to several dozens of missiles, over half of which will probably be intercepted by the U.S., by the British, by Jordan and by Israel and maybe other countries that I don't know of. So, we could call it quits, you know? We could say, OK, this is a remake of what happened in April, an exchange of missile or drone salvos. But if, if there is a misfire, a you know, a mistake in the launching of the missile, and it does cause damage, then hell may break loose.",
