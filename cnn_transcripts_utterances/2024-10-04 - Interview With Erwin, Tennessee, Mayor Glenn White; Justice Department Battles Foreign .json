      "sentences": "Yes, so a month ago -- this comes almost exactly a month ago, where the Department of Justice swept up this thing called Doppelganger, which means two faces.And, in that operation, they were setting up things like fake CNN sites, fake \"Washington Post\" sites, fake FOX News sites, and also using influencers, Americans who were unwitting, to put out their propaganda and to make things look more authentic. And so this is the problem that Americans have, is that it's really hard for Americans to be able to see the difference between what is real and coming from a trusted source and what is being put out by the Russian government. And the Iranians do the same thing.",

      "sentences": "So, in 2020, the Russians really did start this whole idea of trying to infiltrate our system and use Americans to put out their message.Now they are expanding that in order to look like Americans and use Americans. And so we are seeing a lot more sophistication and certainly is being aided by A.I., in that they can create more authentic-looking sites. And when they phish someone like you, they can research you and figure out messages that will make you think that you know or are somehow acquainted with this person who is e-mailing you.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Yes.So, it's so interesting because Russia and China, we see this whole thing right now where we talk a lot about Russia and China and Iran and North Korea all being in the same group. But, in fact, in this election, Iran absolutely wants to defeat Donald Trump. I mean, they are trying to influence Americans to vote against Donald Trump, just like they did in 2020. And the Russians are continuing, just like in 2016, to undermine the Democratic Party candidate and preferring Donald Trump. So that juxtaposition is kind of interesting. So you have two kind of things working together, but at cross-purposes. Russia is still the most sophisticated and the most active of all of the parties. Iran is less sophisticated, but they are more aggressive and more daring. And they don't care at all about whether they get caught. The Chinese are involved, but they tend to be involved more at the state and local level and then really big picture, like putting out A.I. advertisements or out on social media these images that make people in the United States and other countries think that our democracy isn't working and that we are the source of all problems in the world.",

He said that, within about 15 minutes, they got the alerts going on the cell phones and they told people they could leave. The whole process, according to him, ended around 11:45. And they also have video evidence that some workers linger about 45 minutes later. That is in contradiction to what we have heard.

So the next morning, probably 8:00, 8:30, somewhere around that time, I received a call from my building co-inspector saying that the river was rising.
