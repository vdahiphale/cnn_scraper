Well, the mystery is deepening over weather and whereabouts of the Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group. We haven't seen Yevgeny Prigozhin since last month stunning uprising against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Today we know where he isn't? The President of Belarus says Prigozhin is not in his country despite an exile deal but rather in Russia. Russian state media is showing what police found in a recent raid on Prigozhin's home money, passports and even wigs. President Alexander Lukashenko was responding to a question by CNN's Matthew Chance. Matthew joins us now from Minsk.

Now we head to New York with this drone footage shows about 50 sharks swimming near the beach of a state park in Long Island. It is not clear what kind they are. And experts say they are likely San sharks. And they're causing alarm after five people were bitten in what they call a large marine animal in 24 hours alone. Authorities say those were most likely shark bites. Long Island is stepping up its shark patrols to keep swimmers informed and safe.

So if you look at the global average, it is worrying, because that means that the summer season in the northern hemisphere is either getting hotter and winter is not that extreme in the southern hemisphere.",

Rescue used a drone to drop a rope and life jackets to the pier before they were dragged to the riverbank by a crane. The extreme flooding comes as several parts of China have been hit with torrential rain over the past month, killing at least 15 people in the southwestern city of Chongqing according to local authorities and state media and prompting for counties in the city to issue the highest Red Alert warnings.",
