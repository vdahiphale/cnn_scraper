And in my lifetime, I have seen unbelievable changes in the opportunities for women. I think it`s important that women are well represented, that it is not an all-male governance as it once was.

Scientists say more than 7 million people a year die from pollution, from mostly fossil fuel emissions and plants. But they`re also the direct climate change impacts like searing heat waves and the expansion of pathogens like malaria because of a warming planet. The World Health Organization says that health needs to become a focus. DR. DIARMID CAMPBELL-LENDRUM, HEAD OF WHO CLIMATE CHANGE UNIT: So they think they`ve been negotiating about carbon emissions. The message we`re bringing is that you`re actually negotiating about human lives and how many human lives you can save both by preventing the health risks of climate change, but also saving an awful lot of lives by climate action through clean energy.",

They discovered what`s believed to be the shipwreck of the Africa, a cargo ship that hadn`t been seen in nearly 130 years. In 1895, the steamship was carrying coal from Ohio to Ontario, Canada when it disappeared during a Lake Huron snowstorm. None of the 11 crew members survived. An underwater drone captured footage of the ship break about 280 feet below the surface of the lake. And notice the ship was covered with muscles. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If you could look down on the Milky Way galaxy, it would look like a spinning pinwheel type spiral. Within our solar system, we have eight planets, but did you know that within our Milky Way galaxy, there are more than 5,000 known planets. And now astronomers have caught a glimpse of a young star, 160,000 light years away outside of our Milky Way galaxy that could be forming a new planet. Scientists believe that planets are formed when small grains of dust, which are circling and swirling around a star collide and fused together and grow, kind of like a rolling snowball. Eventually a planet can be formed. This massive star called HH 1177 is in a galaxy called Large Magellanic Cloud. And the star is surrounded by a rotating ring where it`s looking like the conditions could be just right. This is the first-time scientists have witnessed a planet potentially being formed outside of our celestial neighborhood.
