Just ahead the American Army Private who crossed into North Korea in July is back in the U.S. after Pyongyang expelled him. President Joe Biden prepares to make a speech about democracy whilst Republican lawmakers hold the first hearing in their Biden impeachment investigation and more misery for Greece.The country gets hit by the second severe storm this month. We'll have a live weather update. U.S. Army Private Travis King is back on American soil after being expelled from North Korea. He landed at a military base in San Antonio, Texas earlier Thursday morning. King is the soldier who made an unauthorized crossing into North Korea in July during a tour of the demilitarized zone. The U.S. government says it took intense diplomacy involving several countries to get him back. Officials say he was handed over into a U.S. military custody at North Korea's border with China. Let's get the very latest from our Paula Hancocks joining us from Seoul. I mean, often these, you know if someone's been detained, and they've been released back to the U.S. as a big celebration, not the case is signed, but you don't really know what happened. And there's a lot of information basically the authorities need to get from Travis.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. It was a very different homecoming than we have seen. As you say in the past Max, there's usually great celebration when someone is finally released from detention anywhere, but certainly in North Korea. This is a very different situation than the very fact that Private Travis King did run across the border, it appears voluntarily.That's what U.S. officials assume; it's what North Korea assumed. And so there are a lot of questions that officials will want to have answered. In the coming hours though and days we are told the focus will be on King's health. Now in San Antonio, there's a medical center, the Brooke Army Medical Center, which is run by the Department of Defense. And it has a program that is specifically for this kind of occasion. It is where Americans go after they've been held in captivity to try and help them acclimatized back to normal life. It's where Trevor Reed went and Brittney Griner after they were released from Russia. So it really helps them try and get back to some sense of normality. Now we have been told the focus will be on health. Now it will be physical health, it will obviously be checked by physicians but also emotional health. It's been two months and no one really knows what he would have gone through in North Korea. But what they will also want to do is debrief him extensively. We've heard from North Korea through state run media, that they had an investigation into what happened. Now we know that that would entail extensive questioning on North Korea's behalf. He may just be a private but he's still a member of the U.S. military that was based in South Korea, and they would have questioned him extensively. So what the U.S. side would want to do now is to find out exactly what questions he was asked, what he may have shared, although we've heard from many places that he's unlikely to have been in retention of any significant confidential knowledge, but that will be part of this rehabilitation, if you like. So that's really what the next days and even potentially weeks would look like for Travis King. We haven't heard much from U.S. officials since he's actually touchdown in the United States. They did give a briefing, though, as he was in the air saying that he was in good spirits in good health, and he was very glad to be finally going home. Max.",

      "sentences": "OK, Paula Hancocks in Seoul. Thank you. It's the case that could have the most far reaching personal implications for the Israeli prime minister. Israel Supreme Court is hearing challenges to a new law that makes it harder to declare a prime minister unfit for office.Critics say this law was passed specifically to benefit Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial for multiple corruption charges, charges that he denies. CNN's Hadas Gold is following today's hearing for us in Jerusalem and joins us now. So what's going to be laid out today Hadas?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max this building behind me; the Supreme Court has really been the center of so much of the political drama in Israel for the last nine months. And never before have the Supreme Court justices held so many challenges to amendments to basic laws passed by the Israeli parliament passed by the Israeli government, as they have in the last month or so.And so much of this is connected to this massive judicial overhaul that Netanyahu's government is trying to push through. So what they're hearing as we speak in that building behind me is a challenge to that law that was passed very quickly in March actually that makes it much more difficult for a sitting Prime Minister to be declared unfit for office and therefore removed from office. [08:05:00] Now, prior to this, there wasn't really any sort of major law on the books. It was mostly case law that determines that the Attorney General, who was a member of the government did not necessarily a political ally to the prime minister that the Attorney General could declare a prime minister unfit for office. Now, the way it works, is a prime minister can only be declared unfit for office for physical or mental reasons. Either they themselves can do it or a majority supermajority in the cabinet then ratified by super majority in the Parliament could declare that. That makes it much more difficult to declare a prime minister unfit for office. Now, the reason many people see that this was done was specifically to personally benefit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And that's because he is facing an ongoing corruption trial. And there has been a serious question whether he would be declared unfit for office because of the term surrounding this corruption trial by the Attorney General; she had not done so yet. And there was an indication she wasn't necessarily going to do so, this law was seen as specifically to protect the prime minister. And that's why these petitioners brought this to the Supreme Court saying that it was inappropriately passed for personal benefit. Now, what's interesting, what we've heard so far is that the lawyer representing the parliament conceded that this did benefit the Prime Minister personally, but he says this is a democratically elected parliament and the Supreme Court should not be able to strike it down. Now the Attorney General is not representing the government here. And she argues that this should not stand. She says a basic law cannot be used as a kind of private resource that removes personal problems from the field of morality and criminal law. Max, we should be getting a decision on this though much faster than other cases which are in front of the Supreme Court possibly within the next few weeks, Max.",

The Prime Minister says that there aren't going to be any more left. We spoke to one woman on Tuesday who abandoned her efforts to get out of the territory. She couldn't get 50 yards from her front door. She tried again yesterday morning. And just today, she managed to finally cross the border took her 35 hours.What's also interesting as the Americans say that look Azerbaijan is going to welcome international observers. But they say they'll need a few days to talk to their allies to figure out what that effort might actually look like. But as the Armenian Prime Minister will point out there may be hardly anyone left by the time they actually get there. Here's exactly what the Prime Minister said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're winding down all of the institutions by the end of the year, but they've also made clear that this isn't exactly voluntary.This is necessity because in the words of the President of that territory due to the current difficult military political situation, and because the priority is to make sure that people can actually leave even those who took up arms against Azerbaijan. And so that is the priority. They have to make nice, they don't want to do anything that may jeopardize those efforts. One other thing to mention quickly, and that is that we're getting a little bit more detail about the former state minister, this wealthy businessman named Ruben Vardanyan, who was arrested yesterday. According to state media, he's accused of financing terrorism participating in the activities of illegal armed groups and crossing the border illegally. But let's also remember that what Azerbaijan thinks is an illegal military force. Armenians and people in Nagorno- Karabakh they would just call it their army.",

But here we are once again talking about Volos. And you can see during the height of this precipitation event, the flooded rains and then of course, the aftermath.Now the residents, they're dealing with their second natural disaster in less than three weeks. This is known locally as Storm Elias. And that is what people have been referencing this name of the storm to that there's also been flooding and power outages that we are well aware of. Clearly you've seen the flooding, but it's the power outages that are going to be so impactful there and just the amount of rain that has fallen in such a short period of time. When we start doing the math, you're talking about several months of rain. And look at this, 342 millimeters in a 14 hour period. That's the shortest duration of time that we saw the rainfall. But if you expand that to an entire day, a 24 hour period, some locations, just north of their received over 400 millimeters of rain. So you look at the average. This is the climatological period for Volos. And you can see September really roughly about 30 to 40 millimeters of rain on average for the entire month. Then you go back three weeks, and you look at the devastation that was brought on the intense and very heavy rainfall across the region that unfortunately left that destruction in its path. And it looks as if this has been on an unfortunate repeat. There is more rain as you mentioned Max just really starting to wind down though for the day today, which is the good news. We should start to clear things out by the week end, so people can get back to the recovery effort.",

We know that the Senate Republicans and Democrats reached a deal that deal though, is dead on arrival in the house. And the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, so far sticking to his guns, of course, largely because far right members of his party will not vote for a kind of straight government funding deal. And so, he is faced with this choice between either potentially losing his speakership or allowing the government to shut down. And so far, it seems that he is willing to let the government go ahead and shut down. We will see what kind of deal they can eventually work out. But meantime, there are thousands of government workers who could soon go without pay, many government institutions across the country that will shut down that people need and use.
