(END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in Washington. Let's get right to what America is talking about, the Trump show. Today, the president-elect gave a press conference, and he basically wants to take his infamous sharpie to redraw the world map. Donald Trump gave glimpses into his foreign policy views in a marathon session with reporters that was entirely reminiscent of his first four years in office. He made promises. He made threats. He made references to famous friends, and he dropped jaws in diplomatic circles all around the globe when he would not rule out using force against a NATO ally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's not what happens in the 21st century. That's what happened in the 19th century. And, of course, the Chinese government is going to come in and say, oh, those Americans, they want to attack you, we're going to invest in you, and we're going to give you development.

It was FDR, it was Woodrow Wilson, it was an America that said, we are the country that believes in self-determination of people around the world. And you know who benefited from that? My grandfather, who was in jail for four years alongside Gandhi, fighting for independence. I want an America that is strong because of the principles we stand for, unlike the British Empire, unlike other colonial empires, a nation that believes in the self-determination of people.
