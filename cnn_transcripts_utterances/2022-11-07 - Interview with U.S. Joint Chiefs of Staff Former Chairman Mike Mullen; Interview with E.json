Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. And amid the rolling blackouts that you can see behind me, the coming winter is sure to be the new battleground all across Ukraine. As the past four weeks of Russian attacks on energy infrastructure forced legions of engineers to work around the clock, trying to prevent a total collapse of the grid here. For many residents, especially in towns and cities badly damaged earlier in this war, monumental efforts to rebuild homes, as well as traumatized minds are going full steam ahead. Here's our report from the suburbs that felt the full force of Russia's failed attempt to take Kyiv back in February and March. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voiceover):  On the outskirts of Kyiv, the bridge into Irpin in the Bucha district was a life saver for those who managed to flee the early Russian advance. In the seven months since these scenes, the horrors of what those troops left behind have been fully exposed and residents have been quietly rebuilding. Mykhaylyna, the deputy mayor of the Bucha region, is taking us to meet residents who are rebuilding. But throughout this heavily destroyed residential area, it's a race against winter. As temperatures start to plunge and blackouts continue. Money is tight but spirits are high. At the very least, they need to replace glass in the windows and patch up holes the size of tank and artillery rounds. Tetyana (ph) shows us pictures of her apartment's small bedroom, destroyed in March, rebuilt now. Her story is hair raising and miraculous. Hunkering down in the basement for 10 days under Russian occupation, this is the picture of the Russian tanks arriving just 15 minutes after she fled. When we left, they were shooting at us from behind, she tells me. Now, I realize what kind of a second birthday I got. What kind of a gift? Because those people who left right after us were shot. As this city tries to put the pieces back together again, there is another, more sensitive, perhaps even more difficult kind of rebuilding underway. The U.N. children's fund UNICEF has placed pop-up tents full of warmth, light, and care. All these children have been traumatized and some have been forced to witness unspeakable horrors. This is Bucha district, after all, ground zero for Russia's war crimes. Eugene Lopatin is the regional manager for this program.",

Kherson is the only regional capital that Moscow has managed to capture since it's February invasion. And the fate of the city is extremely significant for both sides. It's hard, sometimes, to get a real sense of the state of play on the ground in this grinding war. So, let's get inside from former U.S. Joint Chiefs chairman, the retired admiral Mike Mullen, and the former deputy NATO commander general Richard Shirreff. Welcome back to our program, both of you. I just wondered if you could, perhaps, just weigh in on really the spirit that was -- you know, that we saw when we met those people in Irpin. I mean, that's the Bucha district. They couldn't have suffered worse pain. And yet, you see these people who are nowhere near giving up. Admiral Mullen, what do you think? MIKE MULLEN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEF OF STAFF:  I agree, Christiane. I mean, the peace says an awful lot and is really uplifting in terms of the spirit, the determination, and the resilience. Even as Putin and the Russian military have taken this different tack to try to put them out of power at a really critical time, they see me bouncing back from that as they have throughout the war. So, I would -- you know, I -- and I take great hope or I have great hope for the future with respect to where this eventually goes because of that incredible resolve, the depth of the people of Ukraine.

I had several people tell me in September that winter had already arrived from the fighting standpoint and that clearly has not been the case because the Ukrainians continue to make progress. But literally since Kyiv, the lines of communication, the logistics challenge, the battlefield challenge has just -- they've been extended. And so, the further east that the Ukrainians go, I think the tougher the fight. And certainly, Kherson as a regional capital will be significant, not just physically significant but I think really significant as to the eventual outcome. I think the more Ukraine reaches to the east, the tougher the fight is going to be, much less in the middle of the winter which is, obviously, now setting in. So, I think we can expect a very, very difficult battle, to come in the next few weeks and months with Kherson very much at the -- in the middle of it.",

Now, it was reported in one of the newspapers that a Ukrainian commander on the ground, you know, basically said that if the Russians, as sort of ill- equipped as they are right now, hang on to Kherson.

I was very happy to see reported publicly in thelast day or two that the air defense systems, I think one from the U.S. and one from Spain, have arrived because that's not an insignificant threat as well and supporting them in that regard. In addition to the systems that we've provided thus far, plus the intelligence sharing that we clearly have provided. And I think, in a way, and it gets this Black Sea issue, I think if Putin loses control of the Black Sea, you can almost say that he's lost the war. It is one of the reasons he took Crimea, originally, so that he wasn't going to lose his fleet capability, his navy fleet capability in Sevastopol. And I think we do -- as it gets harder and harder financially for many countries to support, I think we also need to keep in mind how vital that sea lane is to support the food issues that are throughout the globe right now because of this war. There are many countries that were on edge before the war started in terms of food insecurity and that has been badly exacerbated. So, in a way, it really is Kherson has the possibility of being a real standoff position that could turn the outcome of this war one way or the other. And then lastly, as it turns against -- continues to turn against Putin, you know, my biggest worry is that somehow being desperate and losing, he'll turn to the use of nuclear weapons, which I think changes everything. And we need to figure out as best we can how that could never happen. And that's a very, very complex and difficult task as well.",

But if I look at Moskva and I look at the, you know, the recent action with respect to the Ukrainians impacting, I'd say the Russian fleet is pretty vulnerable. And I don't know that they could hold up very well in a kind of conflict. And it's almost -- it's an asymmetric vulnerability. So, I would expect the Ukrainians to continue or certainly to support that. Obviously, the Russians will use that fleet as much as they can to control both access and trade in and out of the Black Sea. And certainly, impacting that in ways where they can't do that would have a huge impact on the outcome of the war as well.",

As you'll be witnessing it firsthand now. And of course, the mud makes it much more difficult, hence the slowing down. And also, down in Kherson, the ground makes it much more difficult to move. So, you know, hence the slow but steady successes. I think also, what we've seen is very clever use of the long-range precision missiles artillery that they've been gifted. They've integrated that very successfully into the way they operate. I think the cry need now must be the -- must be air defense. So, we've got to keep up the pressure. As well as the offensive maneuver capability. I think the requirement for air defense is paramount given the pounding that Ukrainian cities and energy and power supplies are taking, because it's going to be a very long cold winter unless we give them the means to protect themselves more effectively. All that, I think, can be taken together given the way the Ukrainians have operated. As well as the way the Russians have operated, we haven't really talked about them, points to me to ultimately to Ukrainians achieving their military objectives. But it's not going to be quick. It'll run -- probably run on through this winter or I think we will -- we are likely to see more gains coming up. I'm worried about the Russians because, you know, the Russians have demonstrated how awesomely bad, frankly, they have been. We all expected them to be much better than that. They've collapsed in many cases now in east of Kherson. There are reports of some quite effective Russian units. And I don't think we're likely to see the sort of spectacular collapse that we saw on September though. But nevertheless, my senses the Russians are on the back foot. Ukrainian morale is high as a kite. Whereas the Russians are not. Their morale is poor. They've got real problems with their mobilized forces. Large numbers of whom have been put into the fight with minimal training and are being slaughtered and being killed or being taken prisoner. And that message is going get through. Who wants to die for Putin in a foreign land when, you know, when they don't need to. And I think the Ukrainians will capitalize on that. And I think we should see more gains from the Ukrainians.

And I'm certain that in the Pentagon and in other NATO capitals, there will be some significant wargaming about the potential reactions to any form of nuclear weapons. Together with very close monitoring by all our intelligence services of potential rollouts of nuclear warheads and the like. And I have no doubt some pretty careful messaging into the Russian chain of command at all levels about the unacceptability of the use. And so, I think the message is probably pretty clear.

But you've also recently said and I'll quote that you think, \"The United States should do everything possible to lead both countries to the negotiating table.\" That doesn't go down very well here.

Every war typically comes to negotiated end. And there needs to be guidelines and boundaries, you know, that get created into which a negotiation can occur. Not least of which before Putin is so desperate that he might pull the trigger on a nuclear weapon. So, I am very much still in that camp. I know that that goes against the grain, if you will. I think it's a far reach to think everything is going to return to the Ukraine. That said, you know, I don't know that for sure. Again, I am praiseworthy of everything the Ukrainians have done.

It is a shared responsibility of the global community to come together to address not only adaptation, not only mitigation, but also loss and damage. You're absolutely right. Pakistan is -- we contribute less than one percent, in fact 0.8 percent of the carbon footprint. But we are the eight most climate stressed country on the planet. And in that sense, it's a -- this is an incredible injustice. While we didn't contribute as much as other countries perhaps to climate change, we're feeling the brunt of the damages. While the financial commitments, as you mentioned, it's not 100 million, it was 100 -- I think, it was 100 billion per annum and unfortunately no, that target has not been met. We understand the world is facing incredible economic difficulties as a result of COVID, the war in Ukraine, and a whole host of other issues. So, while we still need to, sort of, emphasize to all those countries that made that pledge that we may have missed the target or we may be on track to miss the target, but that doesn't mean that we're still not obligated to meet that hard pledge.

He immediately arrived as soon as the flooding happened. He was in Pakistan before the U.N. General Assembly with me visiting flood affected areas. He championed our cause at the United Nations. He was at the Pakistani pavilion today at COP 27. And hopefully will be working with us going forward for our donors, conferences, et cetera. We would have been out of the news of the agenda. You know how quickly things change in this front. So, the United Nations and the support from the U.N. secretary general for Pakistan for climate, in general, is absolutely admirable. We have to be -- well -- I mean, there is a lot of reason to be pessimistic but we have to find reasons to be optimistic. And one of the reasons I am optimistic is I believe it's an incredible achievement particularly on behalf of the G77 plus China that we have got loss and damage onto the agenda.

This has devastated economies, not only, sort of, Russia and the Ukraine, but across the world. Fuel prices are high, everywhere from America to Europe and in Pakistan as a result of the difficulties from this conflict, and on top of the COVID crisis, and on top of that, we're dealing with this climate catastrophe.

So, it's led to asset inflation, initially. But now it's led to goods inflation. And goods inflation implies the prices are rising more than wages. Real wages are falling.

There are history books that have been written that show that only civil wars, revolution, wars, famines, literal reduction of inequality. But that's not the way we want to have a reduction of inequality. It would be a disaster, like it happens after wars. Of course, we need progressive taxation so that when globalization or trade or technology increases inequality, because a lot of tech innovation is capital intensive, skill bias, and labor saving then we tax those that are better off, those that are the winners, and we transfer resources to those who are left behind. Now, transferring this resource is not sufficient. People don't want to just have their wealth rechecked (ph). If automation is going to destroy job, they want to have the dignity of new jobs. That's what many people are against the transfers and welfare. That's much harder because if technology is going to lead to massive technological unemployment because of A.I., machine learning, robotic and automation, the economic pie is going to be larger. We can tax those who win and transfer to those who are left behind. But those who are left behind won't have the dignity of work. That's going to be much harder to address and to obtain.",

However, but many white-collar jobs are now subject also to automation. We initially had only routine jobs that were blue-collar but now cognitive jobs can be sliced in different tasks. These tasks can be automated and the big revolution is going to be the displacement of millions of people that are in the service sector. I'll give you an example. Once we have autonomous vehicles, five million plus lift and Uber drivers are going to be without jobs. five million truckers, frimsters (ph) are going to be without the job. Social is a benefit.

Instead of offshoring, we should have reshoring or friendshoring. Producing in countries that are friends of us. However, that process of friendshoring and of secure and fair trade, as opposed to free trade, has economic costs. Is, as I say, stagflationary because it reduces potential growth because you are not producing where it is most efficient at least costly. You're producing where it's more costly. It gives us some national security but increases the cost of production. So, it's one of the factor that reduces economic welfare, even if it gives you more social political security.",

Because there is a rising power that is challenging the hegemonic power of the times. And we are starting to see a decoupling within U.S. and China in all dimension. Trade in goods, in services, in the movement of investment and capital, movement of labor, technology, data, information. And the U.S., this past October, has passed, what I call, the beginning of an economic and technological war against China. The restriction to the export of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment to China are massive. Massive in a way they're going to lead to China to react in a way that is going to become dangerous. They are going to feel like they don't want to compete with them only, we want to contain them. And they are going to become more aggressive. They could counter sanction us by restricting, for example, the exports of rare Earths that are fundamental for producing semiconductors, green metals, and things of that sort. During World War II, before Pearl Harbor, U.S. restricted the export of oil and scrap metal to Japan. That made Japan so threatened that they struck us in Pearl Harbor. We are beginning something that maybe is necessary. Because if we are not trying to control the development of China, not just of semiconductors, but of their A.I., machine learning, and counter computing, whoever is going to win that race in the future is going to dominate not only the global economy, but is going to become the military and the security and the geopolitical hegemon of the world. So, we have this cold war, is getting colder, and is becoming worse and worse by the day. Whether it's going to lead to a hot war or not over the shift of Taiwan, we don't know. But last week, the head of the U.S. navy said that China may strike Taiwan, not five or 10 years for now, they say it could happen as early as 2024. So, these are factual risks that we are facing. I hope that we can avoid this cold war from becoming a hot war, but we are on a collision course with China whether we like it or not.",
