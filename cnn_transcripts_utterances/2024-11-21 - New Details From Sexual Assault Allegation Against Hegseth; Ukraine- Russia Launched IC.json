Breaking overnight, new details from the sexual assault allegation against Donald Trump's defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth. Monterey, California's city attorney releasing the police report from the 2017 incident after a public record's request. The report lays out competing versions of what happened including conflicting accounts of how intoxicated Pete Hegseth and the woman in question were, as well as descriptions of video surveillance from that night. Hegseth said the encounter was consensual, but the woman told police that he blocked her from leaving a hotel room, and he went on to sexually assault her. Hegseth was not charged with a crime, but his attorney acknowledged that he paid the accuser a settlement that included a confidentiality agreement. It is unclear how questions about this incident might impact his nomination. Hegseth is set to visit Capitol Hill today alongside the Vice President-elect J.D. Vance, making the same visit another embattled Trump cabinet pick made yesterday. Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, also at the center of sexual misconduct allegations traveling to Capitol Hill yesterday to lobby for his nomination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  It's been going great, the senators have been giving me a lot of good advice. I'm looking forward to a hearing. Folks have been very supportive, they've been saying we're going to get a fair process. So, it's a great day of momentum for the Trump-Vance administration. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Lets talk about first, this report into Pete Hegseth. This is a police report redacted. Not all the materials that are part of the investigation were released, but we did learn more about the incident. This in particular has raised questions in Donald Trump's orbit, not least because the transition team was surprised by this allegation when they learned about it. What impact might that have on his confirmation process?",

      "sentences": "So you mentioned others with challenges. Matt Gaetz, of course, the attorney general pick. \"The New York Times\" yesterday, obtaining a graphic that they say was built by federal investigators who were looking into Matt Gaetz. If we could put that up, please?This is a web of what they say are payments from Gaetz to women who attended a variety of what the times refers to as sex parties over a period of years. And they write this, quote, federal investigators established a trail of payments from Matt Gaetz, Trump's choice to be attorney general, to women, including some who testified that Mr. Gaetz hired them for sex. This, according to the document obtained by \"The Times\". And we've been hearing from the lawyer as well for these two women. So while the House Ethics Committee may have blocked this report, we are starting to see pieces of what's known here. That said it doesn't -- it does seem like the Trump team is full speed ahead on Matt Gaetz. What's your understanding of the behind the scenes dynamics on the Hill around this right now?",

      "sentences": "So there are major concerns about Matt Gaetz and these allegations. And while the federal investigation did not lead to actual charges it calls into question ultimately what is the federal government going to look like under a second Trump administration? Who I've spoken to, not just Democrats, but also civil rights leaders who point out the fact that they see Donald Trump as a creating this world in which the federal government looks like a mold of him. Let's not forget that the former president and president-elect hasallegations of him, of himself also being accused of sexual assault, being found liable for sexual assault. And so this, this, this there's a concern around this acceptance and permission structure of violence against women or alleged violence against women. And that is deeply concerning to many on the Hill. And let's not also forget that Matt Gaetz also has, like Pete Hegseth has -- does not have any experience in -- to lead the DOJ according to many of critics. And that is a major concern for someone who's going to be leading a department that President-elect Trump has vowed that he would upend and create -- use as a cudgel to go after his political enemies. And Matt Gaetz is obviously someone that the president elect believes can do that. He has been a disrupter on Capitol Hill. And so this is really about bucking norms and what does that mean for the federal government and what does that mean for Democrats who investigated President-elect Trump, like Letitia James in New York and Fani Willis in Georgia? Matt Gaetz is certainly someone who seems willing to do the bidding of President-elect Trump. And that is deeply concerning to many people.",
