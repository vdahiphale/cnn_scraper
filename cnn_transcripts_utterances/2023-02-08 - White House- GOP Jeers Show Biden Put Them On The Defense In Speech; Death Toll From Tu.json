Both sides for reasons of their own appear to want this, the President to show voters that the GOP is in his eyes in the sway of extremism, which certainly resonated during the Midterm Elections, and Republicans appear to have wanted to reinforce their credentials with the base and use their newly won control of the House to amplify that effort. So last night, with House Republicans using a potential default on the national debt to leverage budget cuts for the administration, President Biden framed what they want the way he wants it.

I have to say though, Anderson, the smell you often get here is one of death slowly approaching and this part of Kahramanmaras so integral a city to Turkey is so utterly destroyed. It has been staggering today to see just how much of it has been completely swept away by the tremors on Monday. The rebuilding here is almost an impossible concept to some degree without all this rubble being moved first away and there are thousands of people trying to deal right now with the awful cold here, as well, of course, with each family's own personal agony, the losses we've been seeing here -- Anderson.",

And I think yes, that is a concern as we see the cold bite here, but also the excavators get deeper and deeper into rubble.Remember, people here were fast asleep at four o'clock in the morning. So many of the bodies brought out, survivors even sometimes, people simply lying where they slept, trapped by the rubble around blankets, as they look for survivors, they look for bed clothing, frankly, as a sign that somebody might be somewhere.
