      "sentences": "Yes, it is definitely shaping up to be an economy heavy day here at the White House. So let me just lay out for you this announcement from the President that we're about to hear any minute now. As you pointed out, it is a $2.8 billion investment program, a grant that will be spread out across some 12 states to really invest in battery supply chain. It is related to things like electric vehicles, the electric grid and it is going to be something that the President rolls out in person at an event in Pittsburgh tomorrow.So you can just imagine that the event is going to have multiple layers, where he is, one, able to talk about this big legislative accomplishment because remember, the money for all of this comes from that bipartisan infrastructure bill that Congress was able to pass last year. It is also something where he can talk about trying to take action to bring down inflation and also invest in clean energy. All of these things are obviously big, important priorities for this administration and politically significant, too. You're just talking about the midterms, some of these grants are going to be handed out in states that have very important and competitive races coming up in just a couple of weeks.   Now, you mentioned this first announcement that we saw at the White House earlier today. This was, of course, the announcement of releasing 15 million additional barrels of oil from the strategic reserve. This comes from the 180 million barrels of oil that the administration previously had announced, would be coming out over the course of six months. And this, of course, is another action that the administration is taking to try to sort of move the needle to bring gas prices down. If you remember, earlier this summer, they saw some good news. They felt like gas prices were consistently coming down. And then in recent weeks, we did see prices coming up a little bit. So this is something that they're certainly trying to tackle. And on all of these fronts, we're getting a reminder that it is really all about the economy. Yesterday we were talking all about the abortion- related a political messaging. Well, today it's back to the economy and that is really where the focus is for this administration in the White House.",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor and Erica, I think that the impact looked bigger about 24 hours ago, because we saw oil prices move down sharply and that usually drives down prices at the pump. But we've seen basically a complete reversal, oil prices are back up to where they were 24 hours ago, so that's going to limit the impact here.I think there's been some confusion even in the energy market about exactly what's going on. You can remember that in late March, the President announced he would release 180 million barrels, a record setting amount and that was in response to the war in Ukraine. He said that would happen by the end of October. Well, we're almost at the end of October, and they had about 15 million barrels left. So this is not a new emergency release, it's really the same one. I mean, it would be like if I announced that I was going to run five miles. And after four, I stopped and held a press conference to say I'm going to run a mile, it's not a longer run, I'm just making a bigger deal about that final mile. So I don't think we should expect to see a dramatic impact for prices at the pump. It probably helps on the margin. And I think if you zoom out, this president has clearly been more aggressive than his predecessors at releasing oil from the emergency reserve. And a lot of the experts I talked to they say, you know what, it has been at least somewhat effective at keeping a lid on energy prices. We can debate how effective but it's certainly been a factor.   Looking forward, I think the two big factors are going to be what happens to the flow of energy out of Russia as the war in Ukraine continues and sanctions bite, and what happens to the economy, because while presidents can't make gas prices cheap again, recessions can and that's obviously a big concern that's out there.",

      "sentences": "Well, normally these adjustments are pretty subtle, but because inflation is so high, the adjustments have been bigger. In fact, the adjustment for the standard deductions, this is the biggest increase that we've seen, since the cost of living adjustment started in 1985. For individuals, there's an increase of $900, married couples is 1800. That is significant. The IRS is also bumping up the income thresholds for tax brackets.To give you an example, in 2022, if your income is $90,000, you're in that 24 percent tax rate, 2023, that same $90,000 is going to be taxed at a 22 percent rate, same story for joint filers. So I think if you put all this together, it shows at least one silver lining of inflation, less money to Uncle Sam and more money in your pocket.",

It is also passing the inflation Reduction Act, which is about getting prescription drug costs down for folks, getting health care costs down for folks, ensuring that people will - utility bills that they start coming down.And so this is one of a number of actions that the administration has taken to get cost down for people because that's what inflation is. It's higher costs for folks. It doesn't matter where it's coming from and so the administration has been really laser focused on showing the actions that they are taking, the Democrats are taking to get prices down for people.

But this is going to be a drop in the barrel, so to speak, this 15 million barrels, so not going to do much.Look, inflation is caused largely because I think the Fed had been too easy with the money for too long, they've tapped the brakes, they waited too long. So it's partly a monetary stimulus that occurred, partly fiscal stimulus and the Democrats should take some blame for this. Their American rescue plan, you could call that the Inflation Acceleration Act overspent. They juiced demand at the time when demand was already high and supply was low, so that's on them. So this is (inaudible) I'm not blaming the Democrats entirely for this, but they are partially responsible, not the Republicans have an ideal plan either, but they're going to have to.
