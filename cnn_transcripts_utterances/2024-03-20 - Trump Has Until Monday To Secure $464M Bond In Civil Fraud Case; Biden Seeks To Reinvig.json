They've had this 30-day grace period. That ends on Monday. They kind of had been under this assumption that they would be able to find someone. And what they went to the courts with this week is saying, no, we so far have gone to 30 places. We haven't been able to find anything. The AG's office is objecting to that today, saying they really are casting doubt on it and don't believe that they actually tried their best efforts to try it. And where it puts Trump and his legal team now is they're kind of scrambling to figure out what they are going to do before Monday. Because when it comes to - he could wait and count on this appeal, wait to see if they're going to lower what he has to pay for the bond to maybe $100 million. But they're also looking at wealthy supporters, seeing if they could help him here. They're looking at his properties, what they could potentially sell and quickly.

And she says that's simply not true as a hard matter of law. And if they have limits on how much they'll write the bond for, which he also claims, why wouldn't you pool some of the different companies and bonds to put together the full amount that you owe. Or, she also says, you could actually just transfer ownership temporarily to the court and they would hold these properties as the collateral for the bond. And so there's - there is - there are these properties. The question is, what are they worth, why is he having trouble getting anybody else to accept them as collateral and why, as a fallback, doesn't he just transfer them to the court?",

TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JAN. 6TH COMMITTEE: Well, I think what the attorney general is suggesting is that they're not being honest here. And I think it's not surprising where the very reason why the former president is where he is now is because he's had a pattern of fraudulent dealings when it comes to his finances. So I think what's really important here is that these folks that would underwrite a bond here, these are rational business entities. If there's money to be made here, they would do so. And frankly, I think the fact that he spent, I think he noted countless hours negotiating a bond here, suggests that there is a deal to be made here. That this is not some unprecedented amount that insurance companies wouldn't support here, so I think what the AG is saying is that put up or shut up.",

He is much more in assets and that has always been the case. And it's not so clean cut that he could just put something up for sale because then it triggers all of these other factors. And so that's why he's in the position that he's in and why there is kind of this panic of what he's going to do here and the anger that you see. And on the AG's office, I'll say there's a lot of mistrust in their claim that they just can't find anyone to underwrite it, because it was the 11th hour that they got Chubb to underwrite the bond for E.

She wasn't expected to win her Republican primary race to be North Carolina's top public school official.Then last week, in an upset, she did win. And when she did, her extreme and controversial comments began getting attention. Last Friday, CNN's KFILE reported that she has, for example, tweeted under her now dormant personal account about wanting to see former President Obama put in front of a firing squad on pay-per-view, saying, \"We could make some money back from televising his death.\" That's just one of a string of social media postings between 2019 and 2021, in which Ms. Morrow made suggestions about executing Obama and other prominent Democrats for treason, including Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, former New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then President- elect Biden. In the Biden tweet, here's how she answered the question, \"Will you follow Joe Biden's advice and wear a mask for a hundred days?\" \"Never,\" she replies. \"We need to follow the Constitution's advice and KILL all TRAITORS.\" Ms. Morrow has also promoted QAnon, tweeting the QAnon slogan, where we go one, we go all, multiple times. She also tweeted that the actor Jim Carrey was \"likely searching for adrenochrome, which is a reference to a QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that celebrities harvest the blood and drink the blood of children to prolong their own lives.\" That's what they believe. In addition to all that, Ms. Morrow, who again is the candidate to be North Carolina's top public school official, has called public schools socialism centers and indoctrination centers. Now, as part of that KFILE report, CNN reached out to Morrow and her campaign multiple times to get her side of the story, but received no response. So after publication of the KFILE story, Morrow tweeted the following: \"According to @KFILE and @CNN and @CNNPolitics, Obama's drone attacks on hundreds of innocent Muslims in Yemen are not treasonous. The insanity of the media demonstrates the need to teach K-12 students real history and critical thinking skills,\" which, of course, doesn't directly address the multiple social media postings we just listed. So with that in mind, CNN's Shimon Prokupecz went to North Carolina to try and speak with her in person. It took him several days.

But what I see is bad staffing, allowing your candidate to walk that far with Shimon being able to get every question in that he could. You want to have a car there so you can get your candidate out immediately because you know, and this is problem number three, you don't have good answers to these questions unless you can just simply say that either you didn't do them, which clearly she did or what I said was wrong and apologized for it. Unfortunately, in American politics, these days we don't really reward people for standing up and saying that they made a mistake. We don't reward the apologies. That's one of the lessons that Donald Trump sort of taught us in 2016. I was in Wake County, in Raleigh, the day after the Access Hollywood tape came out, and I would have told you that day, Anderson, that there's no way Donald Trump could win. The reality is he did.

Joe Biden was slightly favored, but not overwhelmingly. And of course, he has slightly won the election, not overwhelmingly so.Look at where we are today, in a Marquette University Law School poll that was put out last month, look at that advantage that Joe Biden has on -- excuse me, that Donald Trump has on immigration and border security. It's near 30 points. This is a tremendous change that's going on and it is no wonder that Donald Trump is running on immigration. And he's not just running on it in the Republican primary, he's running on it in the general election. And I also think that's why there hasn't been quite the backlash that you might expect over Trump's comments, some of which I, of course, wouldn't make and it is because that voters at this particular point are quite concerned about immigration and they trust Donald Trump on this particular issue.",

Look at that, 49 percent to 24 percent and that is in line with what we are seeing in the polls in general amongst Hispanics, right?Joe Biden won them overwhelmingly back in 2021 and by over 20 percentage points. Democrats normally carry them overwhelmingly. If you look at the polling right now, on an average of polling amongst Hispanic voters, who did they choose in the ballot test, it's barely Biden about -- Biden by about two points. It would be the smallest margin for any Democratic candidate among Hispanic voters, basically, throughout history since we started polling the gosh darn thing.

It is many different diseases, so different individuals respond differently to things. But when talking about these medical occasions, by the way, I don't know if you've seen this, Anderson, but this is an Ozempic pen. This is what it looks like. You basically can dial in your specific dose, that's what people have at home and they give themselves injections, typically once a week.What the drug does is several things. One of the things to this point about the brain is that it does seem to affect what is known as the satiation center of the brain. That's an area of the brain that's right in the middle over here. So it makes you feel full. You eat, you feel full. That's what should happen. But for some people, they just don't get that feeling of satiation. They don't get that post-meal sort of feeling of fullness. They continue to have this sort of food chatter as it has been described to me, a term that I didn't know, but they're constantly thinking about food. And that's what this drug seems to be able to target. It allows people to feel full after a meal. And it also slows down to some extent their intestines as well, so that feeling of fullness stays even longer.",

So, a lot of people have problem with the BMI measurement. But if you use that, about 42 percent of the nation would qualify based on BMI alone. They also say people who have a BMI of 27 plus some other condition, be it heart disease or diabetes, or high blood pressure or something like that, so there's a lot of people who would qualify.I will say there's a lot of people who are taking either Ozempic or this is Mounjaro. This is again a similar sort of pen, you inject yourself at home. Who frankly don't qualify for this? And that's problematic because there have been acute shortages of these drugs. For people who actually do qualify, they have a hard time actually getting a hold of these drugs and there may be significant side effects, maybe even more so in people who are doing this, who don't fit those BMI criteria.",

Some of these drugs have -- iterations have been around for a long time, 20 years, even for some of the Ozempic type of drugs but not in the numbers that were seeing now. So as you start to increase the population of people who are taking that, you're going to see different sorts of side effects. A lot of them focus on GI type symptoms. People may feel constipated, they may have nausea, they have vomiting, stomach paralysis. It can be more serious.People can develop pancreatitis as well. And again, talking to obesity doctors, they say that the likelihood of these sorts of side effects seem to be amplified in people who are taking it more for vanity reasons other than for really needing it because of BMI. I will say this, a lot of weight loss also seems to come from the loss of lean muscle mass. So especially for older people who might already have a diminished muscle mass, this can be problematic. You're losing your weight because you are losing muscle in addition to fat and that's a problem. The second question you asked, in terms of do you need to be on it for your entire life. I wanted to pull this graph just to show you. This is a particular drug, this is a Mounjaro type drug and what they found, if we can put up that graph, is that basically in 36 weeks, about eight or nine months, you lose about 20 percent of your body weight.
