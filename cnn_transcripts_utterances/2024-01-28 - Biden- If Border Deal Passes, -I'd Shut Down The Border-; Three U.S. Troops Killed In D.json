Good morning, and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. Former president Donald Trump has not even seen the text of a major deal just secured between President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of senators aimed at securing the southern border with Mexico. In fact, it hasn't even been released to the public yet. It's supposed to later this week. Yet, that has not stopped Trump from ratcheting up his demands that Republicans kill the measure in Congress as he makes immigration and the border front and center in his campaign and wants to deny Biden a legislative accomplishment on an issue polls say is one of the president's biggest vulnerabilities. Now after privately calling Republicans and urging them to reject the plan, the former president has been increasingly vocal in public, railing against the deal on social media and demanding that Republicans only accept a quote perfect plan that gives them, quote, everything they want.

So he clearly -- he's saying it out loud. He doesn't see any upside in giving Biden a big win on this very, very difficult issue.

Because even if a Senate deal is reached, once it reaches the House, House Republicans appear ready to just kill it as everyone has reported. And if they kill it, which maybe will make progressives happy, it allows President Biden to say on the campaign trail, I was willing to concede a lot because he was willing to concede so much in this border deal that the left flank is really angry at him. You know, they essentially feel as though he's totally changing, potentially in this deal, asylum law, which, you know, is a right, right now under U.S. law for migrants, whether they're entering at a port of entry or entering between ports of entry. It's a right that they have to claim. And this law, this bipartisan deal would potentially totally change that. So it's big concessions on Biden's part. And it allows him to essentially make that argument against Trump.

But ever since last March when the first indictment came down and they all defended him, that has been the way Republican base voters have processed this. They have processed the idea that the legal system is rigged against Trump, and he's a victim here. And, you know, I was in Iowa and New Hampshire these last few weeks attending Trump's events, attending other candidates' events, and it's a pretty unanimous sentiment that they feel like none of this -- they're not persuaded that any of this, either makes him less electable or is his fault in any way.

When has Trump ever ignored someone that has gone after him, especially since she's attacking him on his acuity? And that is her main line of attack right now, because she isn't willing to say what -- anything about his character, about the substance of those 91 felony counts. I find it really remarkable that she says that she hasn't paid attention to them even when, you know, the search of Mar-a-Lago occurred. She was out there tweeting a defense of him, saying that, you know, the Justice Department was being weaponized against him. But also, the other person who loves this in the back and forth between Haley and Trump is Joe Biden, because President Biden, even though he is trying to say that the race is very much between him and Trump, he likes that Trump is getting dragged into these side fights with Haley and thinks that it's potentially helping him as he starts to solidify this contrast with the former president.",

BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, they're struggling with that a bit right now, because they really do want to make sure that another key part of their coalition, young voters, which helped Biden win in a number of the battleground states, that those young voters come back to him, you know, by November. And he's had trouble finding ways to engage with the Muslim and Arab community. And some of the Muslim leaders I've spoken to said that they really want to see him get out there into these battleground states to address the Israel-Hamos war, but that right now, the way his policy is towards Israel and towards Gaza, is making that so a lot of these leaders don't want to meet with him. And a lot of young voters aren't necessarily listening to Biden because they feel as though his policy hasn't changed.
