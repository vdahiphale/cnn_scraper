The elections are up in another few weeks and we're going to see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a third term in power.And just ahead of those elections, Bianca and Max, what we're seeing on the ground are protests by the Aam Aadmi Party, which is the political party of Arvind Kejriwal, the sitting chief minister of New Delhi, who was arrested Thursday evening after the Enforcement Directorate, which is the Federal Financial Crimes Agency, which interestingly comes under the Modi government, arrested him after conducting raids in his house. Massive security presence all around. And because of that, we're seeing protests on the roads in Delhi today, especially outside Arvind Kejriwal's party office. Now, many of these leaders and members have been detained, but the concern here is, which is being expressed by these leaders, not only within his party but also other opposition leaders, is why has Kejriwal been arrested now? They're questioning the timing of it all. And, of course, this comes at a time when Modi and his government, they've been facing fierce criticism over the clampdown and the crackdown on political leaders from the opposition party and critics of the Modi government just ahead of the elections. They claim that there is this attempt, and the BJP is attempting to orchestrate a situation where there's an uneven playing field ahead of the elections. Now, these are serious charges against Arvind Kejriwal, according to the Enforcement Directorate, which has accused several Aam Aadmi Party politicians and Arvind Kejriwal. The charges that they're levelling against Kejriwal in this case is of corruption and for allegedly taking kickbacks from an alcohol licensing policy. Now, Arvind Kejriwal has denied these charges, and so have his colleagues who, many of them, in fact, have been behind bars, some for over a year now. A very prominent opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, took to X and he put a post out. I'm going to quote him here. This was a comment against Narendra Modi where he said, and I quote: A scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy -- unquote. Now, we have to understand this in the larger scheme of things, Bianca and Max. We're talking about the largest democratic process in the world, the elections in India, when Narendra Modi, like I said, will be seeking another term. There are, unfortunately, very few politically relevant parties in the last 10 years, ever since Modi has come to power. Arvind Kejriwal's party is one of them. He's not only won Delhi two times over and governed it as the chief minister. His party has also won the state of Punjab recently. So, for many critics and analysts, they see Kejriwal as a thorn in the government's side, and they believe that this is an attempt, ahead of the elections, to get him out of the way, put him behind bars. But that will not stop, according to the Aam Aadmi Party leaders and supporters, Arvind Kejriwal from governing New Delhi from jail is what his party leaders have to say. But these are going to be interesting times and weeks ahead. We're going to see a lot of political drama unfold on the ground, and this is not the end of this particular drama, because the court will be hearing the enforcement directorate, as well as Arvind Kejriwal's lawyer in moments from now, where the lawyer will be seeking a stay on his arrest. We'll bring you more on that in the next hit.",

As CNN's Kristie Lu Stout tells us, families there are struggling.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): India's Silicon Valley, its IT hub, is running out of water. Bengaluru needs about 2 billion liters of water each day and currently it's only getting around half of that according to the chairman of the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewage Board. The result is a daily struggle for the city's nearly 14 million residents. If there's no water and we're not able to bathe, we will get sick, mother of four Kumkum says. Her youngest child suffering through a fever. Families like Kumkum's are now reliant on water tankers like these and have to pay for the privilege. Domestic worker Shusila says she earns just $24 per month and spends half of that on water. Pushing her finances to the brink. The tankers are commissioned by the Karnataka state government but that's no guarantee that supply can keep up with demand. Meher Taj arrives to collect water for her family and seven children but is forced to return home empty-handed. There is no water here, she says. Even when I open the tap, there is no water. Drought means the water supply from the city's Kaveri River and man- made lakes is dwindling. Bengaluru's deputy chief minister says thousands of the city's groundwater bore wells dug hundreds of meters into the earth have run dry. Authorities have responded by fixing rates for tankers and handing out fines to those caught misusing drinking water. Kumkum says there has been little improvement. The local authorities tell us they have put in an application, have filed a complaint, but nothing happens, she says. Bengaluru's population has ballooned in recent years as tech workers have flocked to the city's thousands of startups as well as international firms from Adobe to Infosys. Experts say that boom alongside unplanned urbanization have contributed to the water crisis. VISHWANATH, BENGALURU-BASED WATER RESEARCHER: If we do the distribution well and there's enough water if we tighten our belt for all of us. But if we don't do the distribution all the resources that come in will only go to a few. LU STOUT (voice-over): As India prepares to go to the polls, the situation has turned into a political blame game. But that doesn't mean much to Bengaluru's poorest people, bearing the brunt of the water shortages even before the summer heat sets in. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But for everybody in the studio that you don't see, who really is far more deserving of any kind of praise than I am, and I'm just going to miss everybody so much. And thank you for everybody that watched the show as well because, like Max said, and we were discussing this morning, we've had really loyal viewers of this program, and it means a lot. People who watch at 4 a.m. when they're working or when they're getting up, and it's all you can really hope for when you anchor a show. And we can hear some of the producers downstairs now.
