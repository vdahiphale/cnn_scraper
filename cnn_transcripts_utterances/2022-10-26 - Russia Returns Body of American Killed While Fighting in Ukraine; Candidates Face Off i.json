      "sentences": "So, Erica, this is the body of Joshua Jones, a 24-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee, who was killed in fighting, fighting with the Ukrainians against Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine back in August. His body had not been recovered. And, really, this was a huge effort on behalf of the Ukrainian presidency, on behalf of two Ukrainian lawmakers who had been trying now since he was killed in August to get his body back to Ukraine and ultimately back to the U.S. so that his family can have closure.We drove in on no man's land, the sort of area between Russian and Ukrainian territory. The two sides had agreed on a two hour ceasefire, so there was, quite, a narrow window of time that we had to move in and out, during which there was no shelling, which is pretty unusual in that area along that contact line in Zaporizhzhia. And, essentially, at a certain point, we had to stay back a little bit and an ambulance went with further down the road where the Russians passed the body of Joshua Jones to the Ukrainians. They then brought him down towards us, they took the body out. Those two lawmakers who I mentioned, Ukrainian lawmakers, went aside to identify the body. They had been in discussions with the Russian side for quite some time and they had already exchanged photographs to be sure that was it the body of Joshua Jones. There were certain tattoos and markings that they were able to use to positively identify him. And he was then put back in the ambulance and driven in to the city of Zaporizhzhia. He will then move on to Kyiv. And then from there, the hope is that, as soon as possible, he will be repatriated to the United States. CNN spoke already to his father, Jeff Jones, who was tearful in his conversation and said simply, we got him back. Because, understandably, Erica, for the family, this has been a horrifying period and really very challenging to try to come to terms with the death of a child without having the body, without having that closure. And so the hope is from the Ukrainian side that his family will now be able to have that solace, Erica.",

There are other bodies of foreign nationals that have not yet been repatriated. And so I think that the hope is that is this kind of an initial step and that this will lead to further gestures of goodwill, for further releases, because every culture, every country understands the importance psychologically in terms of the grieving process of having a body and being able to bury or cremate or whatever your tradition is, but being able to say goodbye in your very personal familial way. So, that is the hope. Whether that transpires remains to be seen. But certainly today was a step in the right direction. It's also important to remember this should be seen in the broader context of a number of prisoner swaps that have been taking place in recent weeks between the Ukrainians and the Russians. Just yesterday, another couple dozen Ukrainians were released as a part of one such swap. And I said, the hope is to make sure that there are more of them, Erica.",

He would, as he said he would, kind of mush words together or kind of lose a word or stumble over a word. So, it was very obvious that he is still very much recovering from this stroke.But that aside, there were also a lot of issues here that each side is really trying to seize upon now that we are a day after, the morning after this very pivotal debate, which, it's important to keep in mind, why do we care so much about Pennsylvania, because this is an open Senate seat and it represents likely whoever the winner is represents who is going to control the U.S. Senate. So, a lot of attention paid on the commonwealth. So, one of the issues that the Oz campaign is really focused on was Fetterman's answer on fracking. The moderators asking him about previous comments where he said he did not support fracking, and then he said he did support fracking. We'll let you listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They want to paint Oz as very extreme on abortion, an issue that the Fetterman campaign thinks, Erica, could really make the difference within independent and suburban women as they are in the closing days of this campaign.But, again, just to reiterate that his health was certainly on display.

[10There are a lot of politicians who don't debate, they are afraid to debate, they don't want to get on stage and be subjected to attacks that they feel are unwarranted, whatever their reasons are. So, for Fetterman to decide to step up and take this risk and display his current disability for all to see was a gutsy decision. I also think it was the right thing for the voters of Pennsylvania, more importantly it's the right thing politically for Democrats, because they deserve -- all voters to deserve to see a side-by-side comparison and argument between the two candidates.",

This is something that we saw Zeldin attack Governor Hochul on, coming right out of the gate. He was very aggressive on this. Hochul tried to push back, talking about her record and about guns. Listen to how she responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY):  You can either work on keeping people scared or you can focus on keeping them safe. I have worked hard to have real policies that are making a difference. But there is no crime fighting plan if it doesn't include guns, illegal guns. And you refuse to talk about how we can do so much more. You didn't even show up for votes in Washington when a bipartisan group of enlightened legislatures voted for an assault weapon ban. REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY):  Unfortunately, Kathy Hochul believes that the only crimes that are being committed are these crimes with guns. And you people who are afraid of being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars. They're being stabbed, beaten to death on a street with hammers. Right now, there should be a special session.

Hochul pushing back, saying she helped get 8,000 illegal guns off the street, helped pass legislation raising the age to purchase a semiautomatic weapon to 21, so trying to push back with her record.

Now, when we step back, history is not really on Donald Trump's side here, neither is legal precedent. Trump is trying to keep the firewall around the inner most circles of his White House.
