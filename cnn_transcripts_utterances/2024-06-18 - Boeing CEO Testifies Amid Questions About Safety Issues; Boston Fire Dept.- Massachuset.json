And yet, the whistleblowers that we have heard, including testifying before this committee, have reported a host of retaliatory behaviors, from reassignment, to exclusion from key meeting, to being sidelined and sidetracked in their careers, verbal harassment and threats, and even physical violence. After whistleblower, John Barnett, raised his concerns about missing parts, he reported that his supervisor called him 19 times in one day and 21 times another day. And when Barnett asked his supervisor about those calls, he was told, quote, \"I'm going to push you until you break.\" He broke. When whistleblower, Sam Mohawk, raised concerns about Boeing's concealment, concealment of nonconforming parts, he was put in charge of completing correct -- corrective action investigations with an impossible deadline and then threatened with formal discipline, including firing. He couldn't meet that deadline. When I hear about these experiences, I wonder whether Boeing really wants change. How can you reassure us that Boeing is going to, in fact, end this broken safety culture?",

I know, coming from manufacturing myself, it's been difficult to hire people in a manufacturing operation because, let's face it, we tell our kids you've got to get a four-year degree and you want to be in management. So we don't encourage people to go into manufacturing. But can you speak to that issue, or maybe Mr. McKenzie can speak to that issue, in terms of just your challenges in hiring people in a manufacturing setting for a very high-quality, high-demand aerospace industry?",

The post-Covid moment in the aerospace industry has been unbelievably difficult to navigate.We have 10,000 suppliers. We put almost two-and-a-half million parts into a 787 Boeing because it's big and it has resources. Even those restrained. We were able to keep more than most. But like you say, we turned over a lot of people. And yes, a lot of experienced people. Our supply-chain experienced enormous turnover. So as we try to respond to unbelievable demand for airplanes out there, we have a supply constraint that is very real and it is not resolved today. And I think one of the most important things we can do we've done it in a few large instances, but now we have to train ourselves to do it at small instances, meaning every employee. If a part is not there on time, if a part's nonconforming, we will stop the line. This so much of this relates to an untrained workforce. I add to it, it's all about that, honestly.",

David, you have heard that the CEO telling Congress here safety has been something that they're making progress on at Boeing. Of course, the families of victims say that's not the case. What do you say?",

Now, many of them were moved back, but apparently some, according to Mohawk, were lost. David, how serious is that in terms of safety for passengers?",

And the parts that came in were separated from the aircraft.When those parts are segregated, they have to -- by regulation, they have to be in a separate fenced container that's clearly marked that they're not airworthy parts and that they're under investigation. And each one of those parts has to be looked at, examined, and signed off by a person like me, by the airworthiness inspector to say that they are ready and airworthy to be put on. I think that what happened here is that those 60 parts that he's talking about were not segregated. They were not put in a place. So what happens is, before someone comes in -- and this is the beauty of the FAA back in the years -- is we would make unannounced visits. We would just come in and start looking at stuff. And it was much more effective than today when they're all you're scheduling this and scheduling that and showing up. They knew that they were coming. So because they knew they were coming, I suspect what happened is these parts were then put into where they're supposed to be, which is a segregated area. The missing parts, I don't have an answer for that. And it's totally unacceptable. Every part has traceability. And I've been after this just for years about the fact that they need to start using blockchain to track every part. You need to make sure that every part that's ever manufactured on these airplanes is not a duplicate part, it's not a bogus part -- is what they sometimes refer to it. But technically and regulatory wise, it's referred to as a suspected unapproved part. And that's what the most concern is for me right now is, who's duplicating this stuff?",

We heard from the mayor of Boston just a short while ago, Michelle Wu, who was updating residents about this outage. She did say, so far, it is happening statewide. And the police commissioner also mentioned that this hopefully will be temporary. We have no reason to believe at this stage that there is any nefarious reason behind this outage. But the cause of the outages still being determined. So we will certainly be keeping an eye on that for you. Take a listen to the mayor, just updating residents just a few minutes ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR MICHELLE WU (D-BOSTON): For our residents, if you are experiencing an emergency, if you find your way to police, fire or EMS, we will make sure that you get to the right place. So don't worry about needing to have the exact right number or anything as this is getting resolved, hopefully, very quickly. There are multiple places on the police Web site you can find the phone numbers for all of the district stations and those will be available also on social media.
