      "sentences": "Well, one of the great things about these election nights, Casey, is that we have no idea what's going to happen. It's up to the voters, not the pollsters, not the pundits, it's up to the voters and the voters are giving us some surprises this evening.And probably, nobody is more surprised than the man who is the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy. Let's go check in with Manu Raju. He's at the headquarters of House Republicans. Manu, I think that it's fair to say that by now, people thought that it would be a bacchanal at House Republican headquarters, it would be raucous, the champagne corks would be pumped. It seems kind of serene. MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Kevin McCarthy had hoped that this hour in the 11:00 p.m. Eastern hour that he would be out here declaring victory, they were preparing to give a victory speeches this time, but there are too many races that are too close to call and talking to his advisors, they are saying they are waiting to see how some key races in the West break. And see some key races in the Midwest break before Kevin McCarthy comes out and address his supporters. Now, they are still very confident that they will get not just the votes to enough seats to take back the House, but enough seats to have what they consider a comfortable governing majority. They have set a bar at 20 seats, picking up 20 seats. I'm told by a Republican source that they are still confident they can get there, in large part because of success they are seeing in New York, they believe that can help them ultimately get to where they want to go. Now, McCarthy himself has met with his political advisors at the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee this evening, as well as his super PAC that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in key races, as he has tracked races, race by race, talk to some of the candidates who support he will also need at the end of the day to become speaker should Republicans regain the House. But Republicans still confident even though it's going slower than they anticipated as they wait for the final numbers and for the final margin for potential majority, Jake.",

They had expected a huge wave before the Dobbs decision, which changed the dynamics completely.And then, ultimately, they were concerns that it could potentially even be a single digit victory for the Republicans. If it were that narrow, it would make McCarthy's task of governing incredibly difficult, given it would empower some of the folks on the far right of his conference, which is why they've invested a ton of money to expand their potential pickups to around 20 seats. No more are they talking about that 60 seat massive wave. A 20-seat majority they believe would be enough to get their agenda through and not have problems with that right flank of their conference. Can they get there, Jake? Still an open question at this late hour.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Or at least not a negative night for them, not the time they were referring (PH).We have projections for you now and five of them are for Democrats winning and one is for a Republican winning. In Tennessee, Republican Andy Ogles, a former mayor conservative think tank executive has flipped a seat in Tennessee. It is a Nashville area district that got much more Republican after redistricting. Democrat Greg Landsman has flipped a seat in Ohio. This is a surprise and a big win for Democrats. He beat longtime incumbent Republican Steve Chabot, this congressional district includes Cincinnati and became a lot bluer after redistricting. Democrat Marcy Kaptur in Ohio, one of the longest serving members of the House has been reelected in Ohio. She defeated a far-right Trump supporter who was at or near the Capitol on January 6th, that's after her district was made more Republican, she won anyway. Ohio State Legislator Emilia Sykes has won an open seat for Democrats in northern Ohio. It's a swing district that Biden won by three. Kansas Democrats Sharice Davids has won a third term. She's one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress. That is a tough congressional district. It's a battleground district. She has been reelected. Rhode Island State Treasurer Seth Magaziner has held on to an open seat for Democrats. It's a district Biden won by 14, Republicans thought they could pick it off in a wave here. Apparently, it's not the year they thought they were going to have. Let's look at the balance of power. Right now, in the House of Representatives, Democrats have 155 House seats, including one pickup, Republicans have 184 House seats, including six pickups. 96 seats remain. The magic number 218. In terms of the state of play, looking at the competitive seats, we told you at the beginning of the night, we're keeping an eye on and watching pretty much determined who was going to be able to control the House of Representatives. Republicans have to win 22 competitive seats, Democrats have to win 44 competitive seats. And right now, we're taking a look at those competitive seats and counting the votes and trying to figure out who is actually going to win. It still seems as though Republicans are on to a possible path to taking control of the House of Representatives. But this is not the night as you can tell by the crickets chirping behind Manu Raju with Republican headquarters. This is not the night they thought they were going to have.",

That's a conversation for later in the week.But then you come here, the Republicans were going to pick up a whole bunch of New York, right? Well, they may pick up some in New York. The question is, are you going to get all of them in New York? Sean Patrick Maloney, the Democratic campaign committee chairman is still running behind there. But will there be a massive turnover in New York? You don't see it in the numbers now. But you do see again, if they pick up that seat, that's one and they only need a net gain of five. So, you come back down here. And again, we come through your home state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, just a minute ago, this one, this one here was red, and you see this, this is such a competitive district. If you look at the district, demo -- Joe Biden won this district by less than one percentage points, 0.6. right. So, there you have it. Right. There you have it. This is one of the most competitive places in America in one of the most competitive states, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This has gone back and forth, it said 93 percent.",

I was up in these districts a couple about six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, Susan Wild said if Matt Cartwright and I hold on, we will hold our majority, that may have been overly optimistic, but if they hold on the margins. And again, Western Pennsylvania, Summer Lee 99 percent of the vote in, ahead in the district Republicans wanted to take. This one here, this is a surprise to Republicans here.

We've talked about this before. I won't dwell on it. But two out of the three, the Democrats are holding. Republicans thought they could get two, they had dreamy hopes of getting the third one, that was unrealistic I think from the beginning. But this, Phil (PH) was just talking about it at the White House. It's not just because Abigail Spanberger won, it's because this district is like so many other competitive districts across the country. So, if you have a good candidate, and she can hold on, then you're -- then you're thinking we can replicate this as we grow across the country, which is why I want to move now to the Midwest, the state of Ohio, the Republican Senate candidate won. The Republican gubernatorial candidate won reelection Mike DeWine in a walk, right, in a walk. And yet, Marcy Kaptur holding on here, redrawn district, right? You see the red out here. They added this to her district to make it tougher. Thinking in a midterm year, Democratic presidents first midterm, Marcy Kaptur, again another frontline Democrat who managed to scratch and claw district by district, her way to reelection.

But that narrow majority is actually only going to empower the extremists that are going to win who are in the Republican Party, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world, because they will -- their votes for McCarthy, a speaker and for whatever are going to be so much more important than actually the irony of so many extremists losing is going to empower the extremists who remain.",

Now, we don't know the final numbers yet. And I want to emphasize that, because remember, in 2018, it took a long time to count the districts out in California. But I was just texting with a very smart Republican who says 20, will be lucky to get to 25, right? So, that would be -- and it could be smaller than that. So, what you might get here is, the idea was, is this a big giant change election. The House number is going to change. I think it's likely and I'm getting out ahead of our smart people in the decision desk.

It's one of the most fascinating political areas in America, Phoenix, and the sprawling and growing suburbs around it. Right now, Katie Hobbs says 58 percent in the county where Kari Lake for 10 years was an anchorwoman in people's homes. That's who she's trying to.

Vicente Gonzalez is the winner in that race in Texas. In Illinois, 13th Congressional District, Democrat Nikki Budzinski has flipped an open seat that was gerrymandered to become more blue. She's a former Biden administration official. She will defeat Regan Deering. And then, in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, Republican Thomas Kean Jr. has defeated incumbent Congressman Tom Malinowski. Malinowski is the incumbent, Kean Jr. the former New Jersey Senate Republican leader and also son of the former New Jersey governor and chair of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean. Let's look at the balance of power right now: 218 seats are needed to control the House of Representatives. One hundred and sixty-five seats, the Democrats have 165, including two pickups. Republicans have 190 seats, including seven pickups. Eighty seats remaining right now. The state of play right now when it comes to those competitive seats, those 82 competitive seats we've been looking at the entire night. Republicans need to win 21 of them. Democrats need to win 40 of them. So Republicans have an easier task ahead of them. Let's look at these other two races right now that I -- very interesting as votes are coming in. In Colorado's 7th -- 3rd Congressional District, Lauren Boebert, the incumbent Republican congresswoman, a firebrand, some would say an extremist, is currently losing. She's 8,551 votes behind her Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, with 80 percent of the vote in. That is a surprising result as of now. It is not the end. We're still looking at the votes. They're still counting them. And then in New York, at the 17th Congressional District, Sean Maloney, who is the -- in addition to being an incumbent congressman, he is the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he is losing with 85 percent of the vote in, to Michael Lawler, a local state representative.

In the state of Connecticut, another Democratic win. Incumbent Democrat Ned Lamont winning his rematch against Bob Stefanowski. This race decided by three percentage points last time around; a much bigger margin this time, securing another four years for Ned Lamont. Let's take a look at some key race alerts now for races where Democrats are defeating either election deniers or election questioners. Starting with Arizona: Katie Hobbs right now, 172,000 votes ahead of Kari Lake, 52 percent of the vote in, in Arizona. Let's get an update now from Michigan. Gretchen Whitmer, the incumbent Democrat, 133,000 votes ahead of conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, 62 percent of the vote in, in Michigan. As we take a look at Wisconsin, a very close race there. Joe Biden won the state by only about 20,000 votes last time. That's roughly the advantage that incumbent Democrat Tony Evers has right now, about 25,000 votes ahead of Tim Michels, with 83 percent of the vote in, in Wisconsin. We also have an update to bring you in the state of Kansas. This race very, very close. Incumbent Democrat Laura Kelly, perhaps the most vulnerable incumbent Democrat on the entire map, 24,000 votes ahead right now of Derek Schmidt, with 86 percent of the vote in, in Kansas. And we have a bonus projection to bring you. In a secretary of state race in Georgia, this guy became a household name after the 2020 election. Brad Raffensperger caught on tape as Donald Trump tried to convince him to find 11,000 votes in the Peach State. Raffensperger refused. Donald Trump made him a target.

Most of them are right here in Atlanta and the suburbs, and they are by far -- by far -- the biggest slice of the vote still outstanding to be counted is in these Democratic areas.

This state is so competitive and you have a lot of Republican votes still to be counted. But your eyes don't lie. The biggest proportion of the vote -- let me come up here, I move the map a little bit -- is here. And we're getting into the suburbs right around Atlanta, where most competitive races in -- in statewide elections in America are decided in the suburbs. Cobb County, where 14-point advantage right now, 15-point advantage right now for Senator Warnock. Still a good chunk of votes out there. Fulton County is Atlanta, the largest county in the state. Atlanta here, suburbs to the North and South. About 10 percent of the state population. Again, Joe Biden won this county by 46. Senator Warnock is doing better than that if you add it all up there. So he's doing well. And then you come out here, you start moving out to the suburbs. Gwinnett County, 18-point Biden win there. Again, you're looking at 21 right there. So Warnock is overperforming Biden in most of these counties where you still have a large percentage, or a decent percentage I should say, a decent share, of the outstanding votes, as you see the circles. So you come back in. Again, the only cautionary tale is we have seen this happen before by watching Trump races. When these counties start to come in. And again, you know, this is at 1.1. It's 21 in terms of the 159 counties in terms of population size. But it's an 18-point win there. So Herschel Walker will pick up some votes here, which tells you, if I'm sitting in the Warnock campaign headquarters, I'm reasonably optimistic looking at that. But if we have lived through Georgia elections, we're going to count these. And then, again, we're going to have to count them to the end.

But again, Chester County is going to come back up here. But Fetterman is slightly underperforming Biden. This is why we're still counting votes here, right? You come in here, Bucks County earlier on -- you remember, early on, Fetterman had a very big lead in Bucks County. That has shrunk as you count the day of, election-day votes, right? Biden wins it by 4.4. We're right in that ballpark. We're literally right in that ballpark, if you look at it right there. Then you come here to Montgomery County. Oz had a late campaign event here. Biden wins by 26.2. Again, you're right in that ballpark when you look at it. But this is it. So we still have votes to count in the Philadelphia suburbs here. Let's just check. We've checked Chester a minute ago. And then we come right in to the city. In Philadelphia city, Fetterman is running up, and only 69 percent.
