Katherine, this shooter was a 28-year-old Nashville woman, police say. Police believe she was a student at the school at some point, which would have been over a decade ago, considering her age now. How significant is this connection for investigators? KATHERINE SCHWEIT, FORMER SENIOR FBI OFFICIAL:  I think what it tells us right away is, in some cases supporting, not surprising she's from the area. She knows she's familiar with the building. And that's not surprising, the fact that school shooters her age at 28, most of school shooters, more than two out of three school shooters are under the -- are teens or in their twenties. She fits right into that category. Shooters who shoot at school shooting their neighborhoods. They shoot people they're familiar with, so I think there's a lot of things that it tells me and some of the things that I don't know, because it's a female is probably more likely that her grievance was with an individual in the school, whether it was a real or perceived grievance, and she planned to do this kind of destruction because of that grievance.",

Interestingly, I spoke to some of those pro-government supporters after Prime Minister Netanyahu had made his televised speech after him essentially delayed making a decision on these judicial reforms. And some of them told me they were disappointed. They want him to press ahead with the reforms. They want it done now. They say, that's why they voted for him. And I found this very interesting statement coming from people. It echoes what the government said from these pro government protesters saying that these vast anti-government, anti-judicial reform protests, they call them a minority and they say that they're essentially they're hijacking the electoral process here. They didn't win the election, but they're trying to hijack the things that the government is trying to do.
