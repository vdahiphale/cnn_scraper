One is the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, Michael Whatley. He is kind of considered the lead contender in this potential race for who Donald Trump wants to take over. They're also looking at South Carolina Republican Party Chairman, Drew McKissick, as well as Florida State Senator, Joe Gruters.Now, just to discuss Whatley and why they really like him, the big reason that we're told is because he's been a cheap or -- excuse me, a chief champion of Donald Trump's election fraud claims from 2020, and Donald Trump really wants someone who will and the charge on that. If this were to happen again, if he becomes the nominee and something happens in November in that election, he wants someone who is going to be very loyal to him, especially on that front. And after Donald Trump has had all of these concerns about how Ronna and the RNC, or how Ronna McDaniel and the RNC handled this back in 2020.",

This chaos on Capitol Hill coming just hours after two embarrassing back-to-back defeats for Republicans on the House floor. The House first failing to impeach DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and then quickly rejecting $17 billion in aid to Israel.Let's get right to CNN's Manu Raju who joins us from Capitol Hill this morning. Manu, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer apparently seems to be moving on to Plan B now. What can you share with us?",

New changes at the border, immigration policies because Republicans had demanded that immigration must be part of this, then a bipartisan deal after four and a half months caught between a trio of senators, they tried to move forward with that. But then Senate Republicans and House Republicans said that they would not accept that plan just within a matter of hours of its release.And now Chuck Schumer, after today when Republicans in the Senate are expected to block that larger package of the border bill, plans to essentially drop that border provisions and said move ahead with the emergency foreign aid instead. And Schumer is optimistic that he can get the votes he needs to advance it out of the Senate. This all comes as finger pointing is happening among Republicans in particular. Concerns about the divisions right now within their party, making it hard and almost unable to govern. As we saw on the House floor yesterday with the collapse of an Israel aid bill and also the inability to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas despite the push for months to do just that. A lot of members also concerned about their leadership's inability to put together a plan to deal with the border that could actually become law. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX):  I think there's been a real lack of leadership on this. We need a round two here because otherwise we're getting nothing on the border.

The GOP leadership miscalculated the votes, thinking that there would be enough Democratic absences to get this over the finish line.There's an expectation that they could ultimately impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, but that depends on two things. Whether the majority leader of the House, Steve Scalise, can make it back in time. He's returning -- recovering from cancer treatment. And also, the outcome of the New York special election next week, who wins that could determine whether Mayorkas becomes the second cabinet secretary to be impeached. If not, they could fail on that effort as well. Rahel.",

One of the things that he pledged when he was president was he would rather have half a loaf and win and live to another day to fight for the other half alone. We need to take steps in the right direction to close that border. That's what this bill did. That's what the Senate bill did. That's what H.R.2, a bill that passed in the House last year did. But you would think that there's some room here to allow for a bill to move forward that's actually going to make some progress on shutting down that border. And border security is very important. It's in the minds of Republicans as well as Democrats. And there is a pathway here. If you allow regular order, if you allow amendments to this bill, I think you can actually get something that's done and combine it with aid to our allies at the end of the day. But there's --",
