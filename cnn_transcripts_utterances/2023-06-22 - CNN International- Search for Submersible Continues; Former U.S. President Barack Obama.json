And it is a critical new phase these oxygen levels of the five on board may have run out. President Biden rolling out the red carpet for India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, a move that some say it's controversial.We'll be live at the White House in just a moment. Plus, a CNN exclusive, Former U.S. President Barack Obama is in Athens speaking with our Christiane Amanpour, part of that conversation just ahead. Search for the missing submersible in the North Atlantic has entered a dire stage. At this point is fear the five people on board may have little or no breathable air left. More banging sounds were detected yesterday but the Coast Guard hasn't been able to find where they're from, where they're coming from, or they're if they're even from the submersible. Meanwhile, a Former subcontractor who helped develop the sub says the construction materials and design choices were considered controversial and experimental at the time back in 2018. Paula Newton joins us live from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. What's the atmosphere like there, Paula, considering the oxygen levels?",

      "sentences": "Yes, despite everything, the odds that they're facing right now, Max, they are quite hopeful and something new in this phase of this search and rescue. There are more assets out there in the North Atlantic than they have been since the search and rescue mission began.And we just learned from the U.S. Coast Guard as well, that the Canadian ship, the horizon Arctic has arrived and has sent one of those remote vehicles. And it has arrived to the sea floor, which is important because it can now begin to look for that submersible. I mean, look, it is unnerving really to think about what they may be going through on that submersible right now. Especially as those oxygen levels continue to dwindle having said that. Officials say, look, that oxygen level could last longer than it was predicted to last. And for that reason, they are searching that sea floor. And Max, the other thing to keep in mind is this is a mini submarine that is designed to when something goes wrong to actually float to the surface. They are still holding out hope that even if it is not floated to the surface, now that it will eventually float to the surface, perhaps it is stuck. They just don't know. The point is this search and rescue has reached an unprecedented phase, given all the ships that are out there now as many as 10. And the fact that there are now at least three salvage in terms of deep diving capability, ships that are out there that have that equipment on board now and that can begin that very crucial search as we've been saying, as much as 13,000 feet or more than two miles on the seafloor there, Max.",

It just so happens that right now, there's also not just, you know threats to democracy by dictatorships and autocrats, but also in liberal democracy as well.He has called the President of China, a dictator, and they're sticking with it. He is also hosting as we speak, the Prime Minister of India Modi, who is considered autocratic or at least a liberal Democrat. What is the point, I guess? Or how should a President engage with those kinds of leaders, either in the naming of them or in the dealing with them? BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Look, it's complicated. The President United States has a lot of equities. And when I was President, I would deal with figures, in some cases who were allies, who, you know, if you press me in private, do they run their governments and their political parties in ways that I would say are ideally democratic, I'd have to say, no.",

So that is very, very troubling.Also, India has abstained or not voted positively on a lot of the U.N. votes that are there to condemn Russia for its illegal invasion on Ukraine. In addition, India has stepped up its import of Russian oil that comes by sea, and all of this is very troubling, certainly to the coalition that wants to see the Defense of Democratic Ukraine and punishing of autocratic Russia. That's on the one side, as you know, in the United States, members of President Biden's own Democratic Party in Congress, some of them are pretty angry about this visit. But interestingly, on the other side on the right, there has been praised for Modi's invitation to the White House because they believe that the Biden Administration can try to get Modi onside to help them challenge. And I guess peel away support from China, India support from China. So it's very much as the President said President Obama, an idea of national interests of stability of essentially real politic and this is where the Biden Administration finds itself right now.",

It is wide ranging interviews so don't miss it in full, the President's interview President Barack Obama that's airing on Thursday at 10 pm in New York again on Friday at 6 pm in London. As we mentioned, the White House is pulling out all the stops to welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his first visit U.S. President Joe Biden and the First Lady hosted him for a private dinner on Wednesday night.In the coming hours, he'll address Congress and hold a news conference with Mr. Biden something Indian officials initially resisted since Modi doesn't hold news conferences back home. Now the visit is not without controversy, as we've been hearing the group of Democrats is urging respond to bring up human rights concerns. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us from the White House. I mean, the whole point of these state visits is to bolster relations between two countries and is can be very difficult when you broach these sensitive issues.",

Moscow is blaming Kyiv for a strike on a strategic bridge, known as the gate to Crimea. A Russian installed official said the damage is forcing traffic to be temporarily rerouted.The Chonhar Bridge connects occupied Crimea and Russian held parts of Ukraine's Southern Kherson region. So far no official comment from Kyiv, which has said it, wants to retake all of its occupied lands. Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014.

Now, according to this official, they believe that what could have struck the bridge is one of these Storm Shadow missiles, a long range cruise missile. It has about a range of more than 250 kilometers. This is a missile jointly developed by France and the U.K. And it was just last month that Britain announced that it would be supplying Ukraine with that missile. Now, as far as we can tell you the Ukrainians are being a bit mum about all of this. CNN did contact someone with the intelligence service, who said that Ukraine will continue its security, its intelligence, its military and also local resistance to try to expel the Russians and bring Ukrainian control back to Crimea since it was occupied in 2014. But he said that beyond that their only comment is to be continued, Max.",

International crews have been racing against time to locate the tourist's sub that went missing on Sunday and the effort has now entered a critical stage. Experts fear oxygen inside the sub may be close to running out.The submersible lost contact with a pilot ship whilst it was heading to the size of the Titanic wreck in a remote corner of the North Atlantic Ocean, the extent of a search operation is massive. Experts aren't sure what might have happened to the sub, and there are a range of possible mishaps that could have played out. More than 20 years ago, journalist and author Michael Guillen was sent on assignment to the Titanic wreck. When his submersible got stuck, he spoke about the chances of survival of the five passengers earlier on CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So if they're not the ones making the noise inside, you know banging on the walls of the sub, which is what I would have done if they'd lost communications.Noise travels very well in water much better than it does in the air and we've been listening for it. Then it might just be a piece of metal or part of the ship just banging pieces of metal just banging together. We may never know we may never recover this -- . (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You've got extreme cold, it is black, and there is no light down there.And so you're relying on your ROV lights to illuminate the area you're going to search. And it is a massive area to search.

There's no measure here or calculation as to what oxygen was on board that craft when it went into the water. The reaction of the people inside the vessel will affect the quantity and the way it used.So I think that's academic you've either got oxygen or you haven't. If it has run out then that's so be it. If it's still there, then the search continues. And that's what they are doing is continuing search.",

But at some point there we'll reach a point when they will make a decision and say, well, we've done what we can, and we're now going to pull back.But I think we're a little away from that. Now, the American Coast Guard speaking earlier said they're going to carry on looking until they're told otherwise. And of course, we've got all this new equipment arriving in the area, we've got the Air Force, workforces dropping beacons and trying to listen for sounds, which they have found sounds. But nobody can tell you yet what they are. And sound does travel underwater, and a long way. So it could be anything making a noise down there. And I wouldn't like to speculate on what or where? But they will obviously coordinate those soundings that they get, and then that will go into a specialist organization that will start to look and analyze that. In the meantime, the ROV's, or anything that's capable of going down and searching will be deployed. And then of course, they've got the question then, once if they do find it, they can survey the outside of it with cameras, and we'll be able to see what condition the sub is in, if it's imploded, or it's in one piece. They would go to the port with a camera and we might be able to see inside and see if there's anybody still available or looks still alive inside. And then they will make the decision on recovery. That's a hazard and a long drawn out job and complex job in its own right.",
