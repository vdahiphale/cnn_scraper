      "sentences": "Now there you see the podium, we are awaiting President Biden, who is going to give a major speech, where he iswarning the US on the threats to democracy and the threat to US democracy at the moment. We will have the full coverage of the speech, which we are expecting. It's running about 15 minutes late now, but we are expecting it very soon. It is Thursday, it's September, the 28th. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. President Biden is set to deliver a warning that there is something dangerous happening in America, it's part of a series of speeches that he's been giving on democracy. But this speech expected any moment now is likely to include pointed remarks about former President Donald Trump, of course now the leading Republican candidate for the White House. The President is actually in Arizona -- Tempe, Arizona, to be precise, where he's honoring the state's late Senator John McCain. The two men were friends for decades, despite sharp political differences and Mr. Biden is also going to be announcing the construction -- that is Cindy McCain, of course, who is just addressing the crowd. The significance of today is that the president, President Biden, not only has decided to make this important speech, just after of course, the second Republican debate, which took place last night, the debate where Trump didn't show up and where Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey called him Donald Duck, and No Show Trump from Ron DeSantis. But he didn't show up, and by all accounts, and from what we saw, the rest of the debate was a pretty messy affair. So the fact that President Biden decides to give this speech today, and not only does he do it in a Republican, if you like, stronghold from John McCain, but it shows the bipartisaness or the bipartisan nature of the way in which he has lived his political life at a time when, arguably Donald Trump is now of course, going so much in the opposite direction. That's the scenario that we are looking at, as we cover this today. Jim Sciutto will be with me from Washington. Jim, I believe is with me now. Jim, the significance of today's speech? I mean, I'm guessing we've heard a lot of what the president is going to say. We've heard it before. But it's all about timing, and moment and placement of where he's saying it.",

He goes on to describe an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy. That's what he's describing here. And I suppose, though, we have heard similar phrases before, similar warnings before, the difference now is this and that is that Biden very much expects to face Donald Trump again in 2024 and he is attempting to communicate here, that this is a serious choice, a serious choice for the US, for US voters, the choice in effect between maintaining the US democratic system as we know it, and losing it. And I know, Richard Quest that that sounds bombastic, but that is the current president's belief. He said it before and his intent here is to make that clear to voters is there well, we approach about 14 months from making another decision on the White House.",

Also an emotional moment there. He cited the well-known report that Donald Trump once dismissed wounded veterans and those who lost their lives as \"suckers and losers.\" He asked, \"Was John McCain a loser? \"Was my son, Beau, a sucker?\" An emotional moment there.

Joe Biden is Kryptonite or perhaps the only Democratic Kryptonite to Donald Trump.

But the big difference is, Jim, we now know the dangers that lie with a Donald Trump presidency. And, Joe Biden is saying look, you don't have to take my word for it; look what he did -- and along with the support of the extremist MAGA Republicans on January 6th. He didn't have to mention names. He didn't even have to mention that day in particular. But we all knew what he was talking about. So none of this has to be left to our imagination. We've already seen it. And in fact, he's saying, do you want it to be worse? We can't afford for this to be any worse than it was.

Joe Biden didn't make a speech about Tim Scott or Nikki Haley or even DeSantis. He was talking about one man. He was quoting one man. And he was quoting one movement.

But right now he's very far ahead. I should note that, when President Biden took aim at the MAGA movement, calling it an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy, he did go on to say he does not believe that is all of the GOP. And he said -- and he's noted and this is true -- that during his career, he has often worked with Republicans. And to that point, Maria Cardona, some of the legislative achievements of his presidency so far were bipartisan votes; for instance, on infrastructure; for instance, on the CHIPS Act. As you watch this, there have been some questions in the background about whether a Democrat might challenge Joe Biden. They might take advantage of how tight those polls are for 2024.

That's not going to happen. Now what we need to do as Democrats is we have to make sure that we do everything possible to not just get our voters out to vote but to get every single person who is concerned about the future of our democracy, all of the people who were moved by President Biden's speech today, to get out and vote. And I will say to my Democratic brothers and sisters, who bring up Joe Biden's age as a concern or who bring up the lack of enthusiasm as a concern, they need to shut up right now because every time they bring that up, they are helping to have Donald Trump rise in the polls and giving him a better chance to be elected.

I think the visit by Jens Stoltenberg especially today to Kyiv today was an important one because one of the things that he also said, that the Ukrainians are gaining ground, he believes. He says it's difficult but they're making ground but he also announced that NATO would provide Ukraine with further ammunition, talking about artillery and tank ammunition. A couple of days ago, we were on the battlefield during a big nighttime battle around the town of Bakhmut. And when you see something that close, you understand how much  ammunition that the Ukrainians are firing. They're going to stay in the fight. They're going to need a steady stream of ammunition.

Russia having the second strongest army in the world. And right now, everybody's talking about Ukrainian offensives on pretty much all battlefronts. In some areas, the Russians are trying to make gains but by and large, when on the ground here, it certainly seems to be the Ukrainians who have the momentum and initiative on their side. That doesn't mean things are going quickly. And a lot of points are valid. They do need a lot of armored vehicles and tanks, they have lost armored vehicles and they will have to replenish that. And the spare parts are a whole other matter as well. And that's something I think that the Ukrainians are making clear that their partners need to be in it for the long run. And you do see some countries like, for instance, Germany and like, for instance, the United Kingdom. Already at least as far as ammunition is concerned, pledging that that is something where there'll be a pipeline that will go on for a considerable amount of time. Armored vehicles are indeed expensive. The spare parts are expensive and servicing them is expensive as well. And that becomes exponentially more expensive when these things are used in combat and damaged pretty much constantly as they try to move forward. So certainly, the Ukrainians are saying it's going to be difficult but they also say the momentum right now is on their side and they believe they can keep it on their side.",
