The Supreme Court's temporary pause on that law expires in just a few hours. So the justices will either extend that freeze or they could let the law take effect while legal challenges play out. Critics say the law will effectively legalize racial profiling of Latinos in Texas. Supporters say Texas is simply taking action to curb a crisis the federal government has failed to fix.

And, as you mentioned, what it essentially does is give local law enforcement officers the ability to arrest people who enter the country illegally or are suspected of entering the country illegally, as well as also giving judges the ability to deport people back to Mexico if they're here in Texas illegally. This law has been challenged by a number of immigrant rights organizations, as well as the Biden administration, the Department of Justice. They're essentially arguing that immigration must be enforced with one voice, that you cannot have states kind of acting on immigration issues unilaterally. Texas officials are saying that they have the sovereign right to defend themselves in this crisis, to defend itself in this crisis, and that they should have the ability to enforce laws as they see fit. So this is the dynamic and the struggle that is playing out between state and federal officials here in Texas. And it was tied -- it's been tied up in the courts. An Austin judge said -- that initially stopped this law from going into effect several weeks ago said that it would be a nightmare scenario if states all across the country could pass their own form of immigration laws. It was then turned over by a federal appeals court and allowed it to go into effect, and then the U.S. Supreme Court has stepped in and halted it. It is expected that the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue some sort of ruling on this law here today, Brianna, so very -- this is being watched very closely all across the U.S. southern border, especially here in Texas, as officials anxiously await what the U.S. Supreme Court is going to rule in this case.",

It said it was merely being persuasive to social media companies to try to get them to move problem -- remove problematic texts. Two states, Missouri and Louisiana and about five social media users sued the government, saying that you weren't just being persuasive. You were actually engaged in coercion that violates the First Amendment rights of users. And I thought, when we started the oral arguments, it would be a lot of nuance over how to draw that line between persuasion and coercion, but the position taken by the states, argued by the Louisiana solicitor general, was so hard and fast that several justices made clear from the outset of their comments that they were not going to go as far as the states were going. He suggested that even mere encouragement could come up against the First Amendment, if platforms were encouraged to take down things that, again, would have health misinformation. And let me just give you the one little part that became funny, triggered by this initial question by Sam Alito comparing social media platforms to the traditional news media. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SAMUEL ALITO, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE:  I see that the White House and federal officials are repeatedly saying that Facebook and the federal government should be partners. We're on the same team. Officials are demanding answers. I want an answer. I want it right away. When they're unhappy, they curse them out. There are regular meetings. There is constant pestering of Facebook and some of the other platforms, and they want to have regular meetings, and they suggest, why don't you -- they suggest rules that should be applied and why don't you tell us everything that you're going to do so we can help you and we can look it over?

Now, they're revealing in this filing that they have approached some 30 different underwriters, can't get any of them to be willing to underwrite and secure this nearly half-a-billion dollar bond, including some of the world's largest insurance companies. And according to these filings, Trump's lawyers are saying that the insurance companies, many of them have internal limits that they can't individually secure a bond in excess of $100 million. And he's got five times that problem. Another problem that they have run into, they have said, is that these insurance companies and underwriters are unwilling to accept real estate as collateral for this bond. They only want cash or stock, something that can easily be turned into cash. Real estate is hard to sell and hard to turn around that quickly. So they're unwilling to accept that. In the words of one of Trump's lawyers, he called it a major obstacle for them securing a bond. So this, as you say, is all part of Trump's arguments to this New York appeals court panel of judges to say, let us not -- we can't come up with this money, allow us to move forward and appeal, and we will settle this later on because we have these assets. Now, the New York attorney general's office has opposed this. They say that they are ready to move forward to collect on this judgment if Trump isn't able to come up with this. Now, the decision is in the hands of the New York Appeals Court. We expect a decision that by the end of this month. And Trump's lawyers are saying, if the judges are going to rule against him, he's asking them to allow him to appeal to New York's highest court, and then continue to allow him to have time to come up with this money. Again, we are in another situation where the clock is ticking and it will be up to the appeals court here to say where this is going to go next, if Trump will have time or if the New York attorney general's office can move forward to try to seize this judgment -- Boris.",

They were convinced that there was fraud sufficient to overturn an election, which, of course, we know that there isn't.
