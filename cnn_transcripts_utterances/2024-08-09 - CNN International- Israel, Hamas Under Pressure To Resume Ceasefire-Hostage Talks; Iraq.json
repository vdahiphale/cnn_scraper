And that's where they found that these routine childhood vaccinations, like the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, or like the polio virus vaccine, these will have prevented, like you said, more than 500 million illnesses, about 32 million hospitalizations, and more than 1 million deaths. This is --FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, ANCHOR, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, the U.S. is urging Israel and Hamas to resume talks on a ceasefire and hostage deal. As fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East grow, we'll be live in Tel Aviv for update. And hitting the trail, both U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will be making their pitches to voters today, fewer than 90 days until the presidential election. And Ukrainian twin sisters are competing together at the Olympics to honor the memory of their fellow athletes killed in the Russian invasion. And we begin with new pressure on Israel and Hamas to return to talks, aimed at a ceasefire in Gaza and freeing the remaining Israeli hostages. Mediators are making a renewed push to bring the warring parties to the negotiating table that's planned for next week. Israel says it will send a delegation to talks planned for either Cairo or Doha. There's no word from Hamas. The U.S., Qatar, and Egypt say, they may present what they're calling a final bridging proposal. This comes as fears of an imminent Iranian and Hezbollah attack on Israel threatens to escalate the conflict into a wider war. I want to bring in now CNN's Clarissa Ward live for us from Tel Aviv. So, how will the change in Hamas political leadership potentially affect the talks, if it does move forward? CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you mentioned, Fredricka, Hamas has yet to respond to that call from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt to gather in Doha next Thursday, August 15, for what they call a final ceasefire plan. And while we're calling it a call to attend, it's really more of a demand. It is unusual. We haven't seen this level of urgency, with all three of these nations coming together, essentially issuing an ultimatum to Israel and Hamas saying, this is it, guys. You need to come. You need to be here. We need to hash this out. They're also saying that while gaps remain, they do think those gaps are bridgeable. But Fredricka, I would just say, from people that I've been speaking to in the region, there's a lot of skepticism. There is a lot of ground that would need to be covered between the two. As you pointed out, the fact that Yahya Sinwar is officially the political head now of Hamas does say something about where they're at vis-a -vis the diplomatic track. So, there are concerns that while this is a very well-intentioned effort to try to avert a retaliatory attack from Iran or Hezbollah by basically giving Iran an exit ramp or an off-ramp that it will be very difficult, even with this level of urgency, to corral both sides, and get them to hash out an agreement that would finally get over the hump of these several stumbling blocks that really have been persistent for months now, Fredricka.",

OK, we're willing to forgive our need or forgo our need for vengeance, because we have managed to secure, finally, a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Hezbollah is sort of the wild card in all of this.Hassan Nasrallah has indicated that they could act unilaterally or in tandem with Iran and its proxies, and certainly, intelligence officials in the region have been saying more and more that they expect Hezbollah to act on its own. Would they be swayed by this last call for talks next Thursday in Doha, remains to be seen. I would say, here, there is still a state of high alert, people waiting, watching, and anticipating that that strike could still go forward, despite these diplomatic efforts, Fredricka.",

I'm just going to explain to you this is an alleyway called Corneliusgasse, but these Swifty fans have taken after a song where Taylor Swift references Cornelia Street, and they've made this their camp, if you will. So, just follow me.You can see they've ran in chalk all over the ground. You can see so many of Taylor Swift lyrics here. And what you're going to hear over and over again from all of the Swifties here is that they wanted to create a safe space to come together. Yes, it was shocking. Yes, it is terrifying to imagine that a terror attack could have potentially killed and named these fans, but they do not want that to stop them from coming together and celebrating. Just keep following me here. Is it OK if I show your bracelets? Is that OK? All of these bracelets that you're seeing everywhere, and one of the things that you can walk up to any of these Swifties and ask is, would you like to change bracelets with me? And with that one simple phrase, Fredricka, you have made a stranger your friend. And that's really the goal here. Just keep following me, because it is amazing. The costumes as well that you might see behind me here, more people drawing chalk, spontaneously break into songs at some point. So, a really extraordinary atmosphere. People here, of course, from all over the world, all walks of life -- excuse me, and they say they're going to continue doing this because the concerts were supposed to be held for three days, many people were booked here through the weekend, and these types of organic events are really popping up all over Vienna. So, yes, the concerts are canceled, but the songs of Taylor Swift and her fans are filling the Capitol.",

But I think that many of the fans here we've been speaking to have found joy and comfort, and maybe some strength, and being able to come together. If I could just walk you a little bit more, since you ask me another question here, they're literally hanging their bracelets on these trees. And just coming together in whatever way they can, so yes, there is hope that they will get to see Taylor Swift at another opportunity, at another time, that they may get their money back.

That wasn't playing well. Who actually is going to win that debate? I'm not exactly sure. I think the one interesting thing, though, is that Trump has really been downplaying expectations for Harris, which, again, is something that you tend to do the opposite of saying that she's not as smart as Biden and so on.

I think that he is fearful what this debate could actually mean. I think he was much more confident going into the debate against Biden. Harris is a little bit more of a wild card, not necessarily sure what to expect. You saw her back in 2020.

And it's one of his arguments of how he'll bring inflation down if he wins the election. He's been saying for years that Biden would ruin the oil industry in the United States. Yet, the data shows actually, despite the focus on the shift to renewable energies, that the Biden administration clearly has oil and gas production in the United States is at record-highs. The profits of the energy companies is exactly the same. So, irrespective of policy, they're doing their business anyway.It is true that gas prices are around 40 percent higher than when Trump was in office, which is clearly a painful spot, and he should be pointing that out. I'll try and help him out on that point. But we know the problem is, of course, Ukraine-Russia war, geopolitics in the Middle East, and a mismatch of supply and demand, the OPEC+, the big oil players also play a role in. So, some element in truth in the concern, but I don't see what difference he's going to make when he gets into power. And it's part of the problem, if he gets into power.

I think economists agree that actually one of the big kickers we were recovering from the pandemic, a big rescue act, just shy of $2 trillion was signed by President Biden, and it didn't help inflation. The way that you tackle this, of course, is that you raise interest rates, and that's what the Federal Reserve has been doing.Now, what the former President also said yesterday was that he'd like a say in what happens with interest rates. What politician in their right mind is going to say, look, we're raising interest rates to tackle inflation and cause people more pain. They just wouldn't do it. And that's why you keep your central bank separate from your government. And if you don't trust me, ask Argentina and ask Turkey, because they know what the interference looks like and what hyperinflation feels like. And we don't want that in the United States of America.

And that's because, as we have some of these what's left of outer bands of Debby, you have these little cells that can rotate. And we've been watching tornado warnings around the DC area, and then headed up into Pennsylvania from this band right here, where we just had a tornado warning. It pretty much in the DC metro. So, watching again for these little spin-ups that can continue, as we go through the day today. Also watching some flash flooding concerns Washington, DC, right now with a considerable flood warning, meaning that they're worried about the damage. Parts of DC just got an inch to an inch and a half of rain in just 20 minutes. That's a lot of rain very quickly. And then, sometimes, you just doesn't have anywhere to go. You can see the flood warnings really even still in effect for parts of Charleston, as well as they still deal with a lot of the lingering effects of 10 to 20 inches of rain. You can see Charleston there, and even parts of Wilmington taking on the brunt of the heavy rain in the Carolinas. Today, though, the flood watches stretch up to the Canadian border, upstate New York, even parts of Vermont and New Hampshire, as we're still looking at up to six inches of rain possible in some locations. So, the last of it continues to swirl up through New England, as we go through the day today, again, with some of that heavy rain, still looking at some totals, three to six inches possible.
