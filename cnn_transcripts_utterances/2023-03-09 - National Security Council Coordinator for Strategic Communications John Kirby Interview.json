The leaders of that group are in the house Stephanie Bice, Republican from Oklahoma, and a member of the appropriations and budget committees, and Chrissy Houlahan, Democrat from Pennsylvania, a member of the armed services and intelligence committees. They wrote an op-ed together in the hill, let me read you this. \"To reach its potential, paid leave policy must be durable.
