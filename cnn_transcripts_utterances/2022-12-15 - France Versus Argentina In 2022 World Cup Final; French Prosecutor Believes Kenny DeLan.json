The U.N. has expelled Iran from a key women's rights commission after the U.S. ambassador called its membership an ugly stain on the commission's credibility. The Iranian regime cracked down violently on nationwide protests over the mandatory head scarf for women. China is warning citizens that canned peaches will not cure COVID. There's been a nationwide buying frenzy as China faces an unprecedented surge in cases right after easing pandemic restrictions. All right, the World Cup final is set.

Lionel Messi up against his Paris Saint- Germain teammate Kylian Mbappe. And that, of course, has some pretty major implications here in Qatar with the Qatari owners of PSG. But France absolutely, rightly, deservedly enjoying their moment. We've seen those brilliant pictures from inside the dressing room after full time at the team hotel as they returned back late last night having got past Morocco despite a dogged determined Moroccan performance and their partisan support. And this is what their goal scorer, Theo Hernandez, had to say about their second-straight World Cup final. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THEO HERNANDEZ, FRANCE DEFENDER (through translator):  Really, it's incredible. To play in back-to-back World Cup finals is an incredible moment. We're going to give it our best shot and work really hard. It was difficult but now we are in the final. DIDIER DESCHAMPS, FRANCE HEAD COACH (through translator):  We're feeling emotion and pride. Obviously, today's match was very important. For the last month, we've been together as a squad. It's never simple but there is happiness. We hope the players will be rewarded. We will seek another title on Sunday. It's marvelous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was France who got the better of Argentina, knocking Argentina out in the round of 16, 4-3. Mbappe very much have the better of his PSG teammates on that day. Just a word, though, on Morocco. Lots of tears, understandable emotion after full time.
