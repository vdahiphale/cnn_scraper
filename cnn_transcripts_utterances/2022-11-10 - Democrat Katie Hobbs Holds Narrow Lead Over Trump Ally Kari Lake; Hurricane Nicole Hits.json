Still moving street signs. And I want to show you right behind me you can see that this is closed off, that would be because that's a downed power line which is what officials will definitely be working today as they do the damage assessment.So let's take a walk. Let's go see what the beach looks like here in Indialantic. You can see that water still remains pretty aggressive coming in, still pounding the beach area here. And listen, you know, something that's interesting to note is the timing here on two fronts. One, the hour. We're coming up on -- well, it is 7:30. And in about an hour you're going to see high tide, which officials tell me is a major concern right now because while storm surge may be down, water levels remain high and we could actually see pretty high levels with high tide coming in. So the idea that this is over by any means is far from the case right now. And again, I cannot let this go without pointing out that we are just six weeks out of Hurricane Ian. So this coastline is going to be very different given that they were vulnerable because of coastal erosion after Hurricane Ian and then now Nicole continues to pound the area -- Kaitlan.",

Deemed dozens of buildings unsafe, directly correlated to that beach erosion. Structures teetering right on the edge.We're seeing impacts with the airports, flights. More than 1200 flights cancelled because of Tropical Storm Nicole this morning. So officials in Brevard County and throughout Florida making a big deal about this being far from over. Take a look. You can see the water coming in where we are right now. This is the first time we've seen it this morning anyway since we've been here come up to this area.

In other words, Biden does have things on the right track. He said that yesterday and I think he surprised Zeke Miller when Zeke asked him that question. He said, yes, I like what I've been doing. And I think Democrats responded to that. So you're doggone right. And the thing is Harry is right, a lot of progressives won, a lot of moderate Democrats won, too. Right? Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Josh Gottheimer in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger, Henry Cuellar, Colin Allred, a lot of good moderates won, too. This is something I don't often say.
