It certainly seems -- all seem to be moving in the direction of the Ukrainians possibly in the not-too-distant future getting those German-made Leopards 2 main battle tanks. As you've already said, the Poles, they came out and said that they had submitted requests to the Germans to deliver those German-made but Polish-owned tanks to the Ukrainians. And the Germans have indeed acknowledged that they got that request from the Poles as well.Right now, it seems as though other countries specifically Germany also seems to be moving in the same direction, but they want to make sure that everybody is comfortable with that move. Now, the German defense minister came out and said yes, they want to decide as quickly as possible. Another person who said he was very encouraged was the Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, who said that he also believes that right now all of this seems to be in the final stage. And a decision could happen very quickly. Now, the Germans, for their part, say they want to make this happen but they want all of this to be broader and closer cooperation, especially also involving the United States. Now, ideally, the Germans say that they would like the U.S. to also give Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine, just to make sure that this is a really broad alliance. We know that the U.S. so far is saying they don't want to do that. They say they don't believe that the Abrams is suited for the battlefields in eastern Ukraine, takes a lot of gas, the maintenance of that turbine engine is also very difficult. But it seems as though the U.S. and Germany are trying to find some sort of way to mitigate that and to try and make that happen in the end. Right now, as you said, things pointing in the right direction. We'll see how long it takes and whether they get that across the line, Kate.",

I don't have any inside data or inside intelligence on that, but I think what we're talking about is just the export agreements that Germany has with the 13 other European nations that they have delivered Leo 2 tanks to. It is a smart move, in my view you know Fred's commentary about a mix and match of different vehicles.When you take a look at what the Ukrainian forces attempting to put together with so many contributions from so many countries, it becomes a logistical nightmare for the commander on the ground to subsume parts, types of maintenance, and all kinds of training for a bunch of different types of equipment. I could go down a litany of the list of the kinds of new Western technologies that Ukraine has received from other countries. And from a commander's standpoint, it's staggering from the standpoint of what you have to incorporate into your force.",

If Germany's indicated that it wants to see the U.S. -- I'll just say put more skin in the game as well, and send -- and send the M1 Abrams over -- you know this different type of tank. If it's the fastest way to get things moving and to maintain a united front with European allies in the face of Russian aggression, is there harm you think in the U.S. sending over M1 Abrams tanks?",

It's been -- the way it's been described is its kind of like the biggest upheaval of his government since Russia's invasion. And it comes as they're facing this ballooning corruption scandal that appears to be linked to the Ukrainian government's military supplies and their procurement process of getting aid and supplies throughout the war.

You know, the first thing is having worked with the Ukrainians back and I'm dated on this. I'm about eight years away from having -- last having worked with Ukrainians, they were having a significant amount of trouble inside the Ukrainian government. The younger Turks, if you will, within the government has stamped -- have stamped that down, but there are certainly still some holdovers. And I think President Zelenskyy has been magnificent in addressing it upon immediately finding out about it and says -- he says there's no room for this kind of thing.But the other thing I would -- I would just say all governments have different elements of corruptions, gee, even our own. And in a time of war, that's something you have to stamp out when you're a leader. And in a time of peace, it's the same thing.",

There's some debate on how much he has gained, but they are not going to hold on to territory. Part of that is a deflection away from the fact that Russia has just had a terrible time in mobilizing their forces. They had a 200,000 call-up. Well, by doing that, they were just snatching people off the street and not training them well.And at the same time, they were having a brain drain of people leaving the country that didn't want to be snatched up and serve. So, when Putin says, hey, I'm going to now mobilize another 300,000 or 400,000, to me from the standpoint of again, a commander, he can't train that many in a short period of time. He has not shown the capability to equip or man that force either and get them to the frontlines of the battlefield. So, again, it's a lot of bluster on the part of Russia.",

She's going to hear from the district attorney's office. We don't know what they are going to argue on this report. Trump's lawyers are not going to be in court today, making arguments about this. But this all gets to the culmination of the grand jury's seven months of investigation, you know. This is a panel that has hauled in people like Rudy Giuliani, people like Michael Flynn, people like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, it's investigating that call Donald Trump made to Brad Raffensperger and fake electors and efforts to harass election officials. So, what we are trying to glean today is whether the judge is actually going to make this final report public that summarizes their investigation and recommends whether anyone should face criminal charges, or perhaps make some of it public.
