Good evening. Thanks for joining us. The former president was not under oath when he left the courthouse in Lower Manhattan this evening at the end of day one of his civil fraud trial. He was under no legal obligation to tell the truth. So when characterizing the proceedings and why he was there, he didn't, he lied. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This was for politics. Now, it has been very successful for them because they took me off the campaign trail, because I've been sitting in a courthouse all day long instead of being in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or a lot of other places I could be at.

He actually didn't have to be there.This is a civil, not a criminal proceeding. Nothing in the law requires his presence. He was there because he wanted to draw attention to the case, a case in which today, one of his attorneys Alina Habba restated some of the same inflated claims about Mar-a-Lago and other properties that the judge has already ruled were fraudulent. Also revealed as fraudulent today, the former president's complaint about how unfair that judge was -- that a judge was hearing the case and not the jury. It turns out neither side asked for a jury trial, according to the judge and Trump attorneys acknowledge that the law doesn't allow for a jury trial. Of course, even before court began, the former president was attacking the judge and kept up during the break as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, you know, telling her that there's really no argument for hearing the politics of this. She said to the judge that she had to address it because the attorney general did also speak outside today, but certainly trying to bring the politics into the courtroom. And the former president, you know, he was watching her intently when she was sparring with the judge over this and he was pretty engaged the whole day. He was looking at the documents before him. He was watching the witness testimony, and then as you said, he was coming out at every break to address the cameras that were lining the hallways to the courtroom.",

So they were looking at not just money, but also some practical implications. And as you said, the judge already found that Trump was liable for fraud on these financial statements by putting false values for some of these properties, and he said that the Trump Organization would have to be dissolved by canceling some of the business certificates. But it still remains very unclear what that means and what that will what that will look like, which could be much more significant than any dollar amount that could be the ultimate result of the end of this trial -- Anderson.",

Governor Hochul, thank you so much for being with us. I'm glad it's with good news to talk about. Can you just bring us up to date on what you know about what led to the discovery of her? GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY) (via phone): Yes, everyone in New York is breathing a collective sigh of relief right now. I was literally in the arms of the parents, we were all hugging each other, just yesterday, as I went up to the State Park. Just looking at the site where the little girl had been abducted. We didn't know quite that it was an abduction at that moment. But as more time unfolded, we realized that that was likely the case. We spread the search to a much larger area than the state park, checking on the cell phone pings throughout the towers, which helps you identify people who had been in the park at a certain time and were their phones were later. So the technology was a great help to us. But we spread that search around five counties. Also searched for known sex offenders, started identifying individuals in that category. So it was really an incredible, coordinated effort from so many agencies. It was a state park and so the state of New York State Police were involved as well as our DEC teams, but it was extraordinary to see how they traced it down to an individual's home. The home was surrounded by law enforcement and helicopters and they were able to bring her to safety and not long after, she was in the arms of her parents at a hospital and being transported, so she is going to checked out. But she is in good health. And we're so, so grateful for everyone who did an extraordinary job. I told her parents I said, we will find your daughter. I said I promise you we will find your daughter. And I as a mom, am just so grateful that she has been found safely tonight.",

You'll recall maybe that when we left you Friday night, he had just said this when asked whether this would include working with Democrats if needed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

That would require a majority of the House, 218 voting members could vote on that procedural motion. But, at the moment, Anderson, I surveyed and talked to a number of these conservative hardliners, people who align themselves with Matt Gaetz. Gaetz appears to be right. He does have enough Republican support to oust him if the Democrats decide to oust him as well. And that is a key question. It will dominate the question tomorrow as well. Democrats are still grappling with what to do, whether to seek concessions from McCarthy.

He has used, quote unquote, Kevin violating conference rules, as his rationale, behind filing this motion to vacate. And so, obviously, it's, number one, hypocritical but duplicitous at best. And, you know, I think it just speaks volumes to who Matt is, his character, and the fact that he doesn't care about the American people, he doesn't care about governing, he cares about getting attention and notoriety and, whatever his personal petty grievances are with the Speaker and putting that above all other considerations. And so, you know, we'll see. Within the next 48 hours, obviously, a vote will occur. I am supporting Kevin McCarthy, as I have throughout, and will continue to do so. I think, you know, when you look at the work that we are doing as a House Republican majority and what we were elected to do to serve as a check and balance on the Biden administration and the reckless spending that occurred under the prior two years, Matt is undermining that selfishly.

But now, they must also worry about saltwater that creeps, steady and invisible toward the crops, machines, and drinking water systems of almost 1 million people. GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), LOUISIANA: I happen to be one who believes in the power of prayer. I'm going to ask for people to pray for rain. WEIR (voice-over): After a second straight year of extraordinary drought, the not so mighty Mississippi is too weak to hold back the Gulf of Mexico. So the heavier saltwater is running downhill towards New Orleans in the shape of a wedge, with the tow about 15 miles in front of the kind of inundation that could threaten the health of the vulnerable and destroy everything from lead pipes to appliances. (on-camera): So the Army Corps of Engineers is urgently racing against time and salt with a couple different tools. This is the first of what will be many barges that can bring about a half million gallons of freshwater at a time downstream. They use it to dilute the brackish stuff as it goes into a small water plant here in Plaquemines Parish. The corps says they can move 36 million gallons a day, but even that wouldn't be enough to save the New Orleans water supply. So they're already talking about maybe building pipelines to prop up that water system. In the meantime, the corps is also building a big sill, like an underwater speed bump to try to slow the wedge as it moves inland. But these are all temporary fixes, and the leader of this parish says, if this is the new normal, that means parts of Louisiana will need the same kind of desalination that they use in Israel and other desert communities. You've had one trailer would be the reverse Osmosis and the other would be the filtration system right there. (voice-over): Keith Hinkley is the president of Plaquemines Parish, a spread out county of less than 25,000 now spending a fortune on desalination.",
