If it makes it there, the first critical test happening in the House Rules Committee on Tuesday, that's because Chip Roy, a conservative from Texas, has threatened to use every tool at his disposal along with conservative Ralph Norman to block this legislation from moving forward. All eyes are on Thomas Massie, another conservative on that committee and what he is going to do, but once it passes out of the house, if it indeed gets out of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, this fight will then move to the U.S. Senate. You are already hearing backlash from some conservatives like Lindsey Graham, who are arguing that the defense number agreed to in this legislation is just not high enough. The Senate can move this bill very quickly, but that requires them to have agreement among all their members.

No one was injured.They say two people sought medical attention, but no one had to be hospitalized. The damage described by the mayor is insignificant, but I think the optics of this, this is the first time we've seen residential buildings hit in Moscow. It comes just a few weeks after we saw that drone attack on the Kremlin, just a week or so after we saw that pretty violent incursion in Belgorod apparently carried out by Russian citizens who had been fighting. With Ukraine, it shows just how much this war is now hitting Russian soil. A Russian MP with Putin's party coming out and saying, this is a reality that we now have to recognize. We need to really step up our defenses. And I think part of this will play to a Russian audience.

But of course they fought incredibly hard just to get to this point becoming just a number of a select few of teams to even be in this position in the first place.But it was a battle of improbables here to try and advance to the finals because the Miami Heat on their side, they came in as a playing team. They had already been setting records in history along the way, becoming the first play in temp team to win a series. Then they're taking out top seeds across the east and then even though they gave up three in a row and potentially would have become the first team to give up a 3-0 lead in a series, they came into Boston in a Game Seven environment where everybody was against them in this arena from the very beginning, and they were able to turn the tide over the course of the game in the later stages. As that lead grew, there were even Celtics fans, they were booing their own team as the Celtics called time out as they tried to get a hold of the momentum that was seemingly swaying in the Heat favor, and the Heat Now head on to the NBA finals where they're gonna take on the Denver Nuggets. Obviously that is a team that is very well rested, but the stakes have been against the Miami Heat before, and so while many people are already saying the Nuggets are gonna sweep through and take care of business, it's been said about the Heat before, and they came into a very hostile Boston environment and took care of business on a Monday night in this Eastern Conference finals.
