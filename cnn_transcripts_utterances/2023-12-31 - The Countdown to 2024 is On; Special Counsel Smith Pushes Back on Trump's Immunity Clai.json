All right. Let's go to the news now. A new court filing. Special Counsel Jack Smith is laying out one of his first goals of the new year, and that's to get Donald Trump's immunity claims thrown out for good. This is a new 80-page motion. Smith is asking an appeals court to move quickly. He writes that the arguments the former president has been making threaten to undermine democracy. CNN's Zachary Cohen picks it up from here.",

Those are set to be beginning in Washington on January 9th. The trial was initially scheduled to begin on March 4th, but Trump has been trying to delay that and his fight over the immunity claim really underscoring those efforts. But if the appeals court moves quickly, it could keep the original trial date from sliding. And with the looming presidential campaign only months away, it's clear that timing is critical for both sides in this case. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington.",

Lynn good morning to you.Let me start with a portion of this filing. I'll read it for you. Smith writes, it is the defendant's claim that he cannot be held to answer for the charges that he engaged in an unprecedented effort to retain power through criminal means, despite having lost the election. That threatens the democratic and constitutional foundation of our republic. This previews the oral arguments that are coming. It seems straightforward here, the approach that Smith is going to be taking. LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES:  Well, it does and it doesn't, because the argument that the president is not immune -- is immune from prosecution is a novel one, Victor. This has never been ever brought up in the history of the United States. So, what might seem straightforward may not be on some technical grounds that the justices may find, And that's the difference. And then one other thing, the president. is also arguing that he can't be charged with any crime under the double immunity jeopardy clause of the constitution. And here's what Jack Smith says to address that -- oh, and Jack Smith says that Trump cannot argue that because he had a second impeachment, he's immune from criminal charges because he says in the filing yesterday that being terminated from or prevented from obtaining a job is qualitatively different than facing a prison term or execution. So, it seems straightforward to us as Jack Smith says in the filing, well, it's just common-sense intuition may not be that way with the justices when surely it will get there.",

Specifically, the Intelligence Community growing increasingly worried about the possibility of those difficult to predict lone wolf attacks, these unsophisticated attacks that we've seen in years past. Just take last year for example in which an individual that law enforcement later described as a homegrown violent extremist attacked law enforcement officers at a security checkpoint. It's one of the reasons why authorities will certainly be operating with that heightened sense of alert according to the NYPD Super Patrol. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN M. CHELL, CHIEF OF PATROL, NEW YORK POLICE:  So, lone wolf attacks are very tough. But like you saw last year, unfortunately we had a lone wolf attack about 10:00 at night. But our cops were aware of their surroundings. They reacted quickly. It's imperative that our cops be aware of their surroundings, stand tall, and react quickly to training. And that's what they did last year.

They include large bags, umbrellas.

He's also, of course, addressing the United States, expressing his gratitude to the United States for its support of the U.N. Security Council and also for the provisions of weapons. And I suppose he's also addressing Hamas to tell them that this war will continue, that Israel will not relent in this war until it's achieved its objectives. But of course, at the same time, pressure is growing regarding the hostage situation. This was one of the few newish things that Netanyahu said, which he seemed to be implying that some kind of deal could be in the offing for another truce that would see at least some of those hostages returned to Israel. But he doesn't want to get everyone's hopes up. And indeed, this would be -- this would also reflect what we saw Axios reporting in recent days, talking about Qatari mediators telling Israelis that Hamas has agreed in principle to a truce of pause in fighting for up to a month in exchange for returning 40 of those hostages. So, talks at least seem to be moving in the direction of another truce. Victor.",

And then the Ukrainians come back with this attack over the Russian border to make it clear to Putin that he too would suffer civilian losses. And what worries me about this is that while it's completely understandable that both sides are reaching out in this way, this is how wars escalate rapidly.

While the Cowboys, the win means that they still have a shot at winning their division and getting a home playoff game. So, there's a lot of stake this time of year.I want to walk you through how this happened. Detroit was down by seven with under 30 seconds to go, and Jared Goff finds Amon-Ra St. Brown, who dives into the end zone for the touchdown. Now, rather than kick and tie it up, the Lions decide to go for two and the win. They pull out a trick play. Goff to offensive lineman Taylor Decker who comes down with it. But hold on a second. There's a flag on Decker for ineligible man-down field. So, the rule here is an offensive lineman must go to the referee before the play if they want to report as an eligible receiver. Now, referee Brad Allen said after the game that Decker, whose number 68, did not report. Instead, it was Dan Skipper, number 70, even though on the replay there, it looks like it was Decker going up to Allen. So, they replay the down, and Detroit goes for it again. No good. Now, Dallas is called for a penalty, so we do it again. Detroit going for two, and Goff here just missing a wide-open James Mitchell, so the Cowboys win 20 to 19. Campbell is still really upset after the game. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
