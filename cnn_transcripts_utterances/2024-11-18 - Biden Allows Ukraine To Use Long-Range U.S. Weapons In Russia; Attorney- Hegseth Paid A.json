Nearly a thousand days now since Russia first launched its full scale invasion into Ukraine, and the terms and conditions of this war changing once again. President Biden has now authorized Ukraine to use American made weapons capable of striking deep inside Russia. This is something, of course, that President Zelenskyy has long pleaded for. And while it has been under consideration for months, the decision comes as Biden prepares to of course, leave the presidency. Donald Trump will be taking over on January 20th, just 63 days from now. The move also comes as Moscow has deployed 50,000 troops, including some North Korean forces, on the battlefield in Kursk. They're fighting to take back the Russian territory, which Ukraine seized over the summer. CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen joining us now from Moscow with more. So how is the Kremlin responding to this decision from the U.S.?",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Erica.Yeah, yeah, pretty angrily as we're hearing from the Kremlin, but not just from the Kremlin. We've also been monitoring Kremlin controlled TV. Some of the state TV networks, pretty angry reactions going on there as well. One of them accusing the Biden administration of extending the war in Ukraine, as they put it, a war they say that Trump wanted to end as quickly as possible. As one of the hosts put it, you also have the spokeswoman for the foreign ministry who actually just came out a couple of minutes ago and said this changes the very nature of the war in Ukraine, and that also the response from the Russians will be felt. Now, we haven't heard any details as to what exactly the Russians plan to do, but from the Kremlin as well. The spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out earlier today and he accused the Biden administration of, as he put it pouring oil into the fire of the Ukraine conflict. Obviously, also accusing the Biden administration of allegedly extending the war in Ukraine. Of course, the administration itself says that it was the Russians who started that fire in the first place, as the administration put it. But if we look at the arguments that the Russians are making, they really are twofold. On the one hand, they say that or Vladimir Putin has said, I should say, over the past couple of weeks that the Russians believe that strikes with the weapons, like the ones we've been talking about, those ATACMS surface to surface missile systems from the United States that we've been seeing launch on our screens right there from some of that video he believes that that would not be possible to launch those deep into Russia without the support of the country that provided those weapons, in this case of course, the United States. And so therefore, the Russians have said that if these weapons are used to strike deep into Russian territory, that then the Russians will consider that to be a strike coming directly from NATO or directly from the United States. Now, of course, the Russians have drawn red lines in the past when new weapons systems were delivered to the Ukrainians, or they were allowed to use them in different ways. But in this case, of course, we know Erica weeks ago changed the very nuclear doctrine of this country for such a scenario where they say that if Russia is attacked by a non-nuclear state with long distance weapons, but with the assistance of a nuclear state, like, for instance, the United States, that the Russians could then answer with nuclear weapons themselves. Of course, we're very far away from that right now. Nevertheless, the Russians certainly setting the stage for that they believe, could be a big escalation in this conflict -- Erica.",

It's interesting, actually, that you asked that because the spokesman for the foreign ministry, and it's really a line that we've heard from many officials, has said this changes the very nature of the war, as she put it.Vladimir Putin has also said it changes the very nature of the war because he feels that a kind of internationalizing the war and essentially pits Russia against the United States and against other NATO allies of the U.S., as well. Whether or not that is actually going to happen, obviously, depends what's going to happen on the battlefield. But also, of course, the way things shape up in the next couple of weeks, the next couple of months. One of the things that, of course, everybody here is looking to like everybody in the U.S. is looking to as well, will be that change in administrations in the United States. [15:05:02] I actually spoke to a Russian political analyst who believes that the Russians might not do anything massively escalatory or, in response to possible strikes against their territory, hoping that the Trump administration will be more favorable to Russia once it takes office. Again, whether or not that's going to be the case, no one knows. However that definitely is one of those sort of waypoints that people are looking to as to where this war will go next -- Erica.",

Quite on the contrary, they stand they adopt a very tough stance against this brutal Russian aggression.

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, the explanation that we're getting from officials is that really the entry of North Korea into this conflict has changed really, everything about this war. And that is what the United States is weighing here when they decide to allow Ukraine to use these long range missiles to primarily right now for -- for now, strike targets inside the Kursk region, which is in the south of Russia, right there on the border with Ukraine.That is where Russia and North Korea, they have amassed tens of thousands of troops and they are conducting an offensive against the Ukrainians who occupied that territory, began to occupy it back in August. The U.S. does not want to see Ukraine lose that territory, because they know that when peace negotiations do ultimately begin, that is going to be a really important bargaining chip for the Ukrainians. And that is, of course something that the Russians do not want to see them hold on to. But now with the entry of the North Koreans into the conflict, giving the Russians even more bodies to fight the Ukrainians with, then that really puts Kursk at risk here. And so we're told that this is really the grand reasoning behind the administration's decision to allow them to use these long range weapons, again which the Ukrainians have been asking for since back in August at least when they first invaded Russia. But this ultimately is unlikely to actually change the course of the war, according to the officials we spoke to. It's really not just one weapon or one system that's going to make the big difference here, but they do hope that at least in Kursk, it's going to give the Ukrainians some momentum that they can hang on to, to use as leverage for future talks if that happens, Erica.",

And we know from open source intelligence most recently, Bob Woodward's book that there was a continuing concern about the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia.That -- I don't think that's been a risk that the administration can avoid addressing when they're talking about delivery of weapons that can strike inside of Russia. So there could be an immediate reaction by Russia in a very kinetic way, or as Natasha just said, and Fred said, you know, it could be a delayed reaction to see what kind of deal Mr. Putin thinks he can strike with Mr. Trump once he gets into office and how much will Zelenskyy play a part in that as well. Germanys chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of course, had a call with Putin last week, did face some criticism for that. But the next day we heard from President Zelenskyy saying that in his view, with Donald Trump in office, that this war will end sooner. You can't ignore the timing of those two events. So as we watch what is playing out here, it is. It is fascinating to watch the change in tone in many ways that we're hearing from world leaders, including President Zelenskyy.",

Moldova, Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria, you know, they've been in Georgia now for since 2008, and it causes a disruption in the government of those countries. When you're talking about Russia on the border of Ukraine being there permanently and even with a peace settlement, there are going to continue to threaten the territorial integrity of -- and the sovereignty of Ukraine, that's a dangerous situation to be in, to have a 700-mile border or, excuse me, a 400-mile border where Russian troops are literally face to face with Ukrainians. It's going to turn into a North Korea, South Korea type of environment.

Thank you.Well, on Wednesday, the House Ethics Committee is expected to meet as they consider whether to release their report on another Trump cabinet pick, former congressman now potential attorney general, Matt Gaetz. That meeting, of course, had originally been scheduled for last week. In June, the panel said it was investigating allegations that Gaetz had engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, and accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz has denied the accusations. CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz joining me now. So, there's been a lot of back and forth about this report because of course, he resigned as a congressman from Florida just ahead of us, learning that the committee was supposed to meet about releasing the report so where do things stand? What's in there? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, Erica, were just getting glimpses right now. Not yet. The full story of what the House investigators have, because the full story would be in their report, supposedly. But what has built that report appears to include some details from still secret depositions of women who were at parties with Gaetz, including the female victim whom he allegedly had sex with when she was an underage girl. So some of what the House Ethics Committee has comes from a lawsuit in Florida where these witnesses, these young women were making statements under oath in depositions these are the same women who also participated in the criminal inquiry into Gaetz that also has remained secret. He was never charged. But these women, they were at a party in 2017 where an alleged sexual encounter with an underage girl took place. They've never spoken publicly about what happened but in a deposition of a man who brought this lawsuit, a friend of Gaetz, attorneys were asking him about what the women had to say under oath about a then underage girl having sex with Gaetz while his friend watched about an array of drugs at the party. And we know this all because we can see that friends transcript, but not the others. So the friend of Gaetz, Christopher Dorworth, suggested in his testimony that the women made up their stories. And Gaetz obviously was never charged with any crime. But one source familiar with the congressional investigation has told CNN that if the House Ethics Committees work includes information from this lawsuit, this litigation presumably the part that's still secret, what the women were saying, it would be, quote, highly damaging for Gaetz. So, now, there's pressure in Washington. That is mounting on the House Ethics Committee. The question is, do they release the report or does the Senate get access to it or to the other documents that are in this? And if the House investigations work ended when Trump, when Gaetz was announced by Donald Trump as the nominee for the justice department and resigned, is there more they can do at that meeting on Wednesday? We're watching very closely what happens on Capitol Hill. But, Erica, right now, Speaker Mike Johnson, he is in the corner of not releasing the report. Here's a little bit more from the House speaker. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  My understanding is that the report is not finished. It's in a rough draft form, was not yet ready to be released, and since Matt Gaetz left the Congress, I don't think it's appropriate to -- to do so. There have been, I understand, I think two exceptions to the rule over the whole history of Congress and the history of the ethics committee, but I don't -- I wasn't the speaker at that time. I'm the speaker now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And there was a photo that was taken this afternoon that was essentially a photo for the Poverty and Hunger alliance, a group of nations committing new funding through the World Bank, whose president, Ajay Banga, was there on stage to take a photo to essentially signal the support around that effort.
