And that means that after nearly five months, the writers' strike that brought the television and film industries to a standstill could be coming to an end, while the union could authorize members to return to work as early as Tuesday, even before the agreement is officially ratified.Well, the exact terms of the deal have not been made public, but the use of generative artificial intelligence in production was reportedly one of the final sticking points. Well, this could pave the way for Hollywood to restart many productions that have been halted since May 2nd. CNN media critic Brian Lowry joins me now from Los Angeles. Brian, what more do we know about this and did everyone get what they wanted?",

PETER PHAM, DISTINGUISHED FELLOW, THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL:  Well, one would argue it was probably no longer tenable, especially for Ambassador Sylvain Itte some time back. In addition to all the baggage that being a French ambassador these days carries in Africa, he particularly had gotten somewhat into the muck with doing something probably most of us are tempted to do from time to time, but probably no better than to do, which is, you know, people will troll you on social media, you shouldn't probably respond to them.

We see this morning the damage, fairly significant. A passenger terminal was destroyed according to Ukraine, a hotel nearby, fires, also granaries hit as well, grain storage facilities.So, clearly this is part of a pattern. Odessa has been hit multiple times now. This comes as Ukraine is trying to unilaterally provide safe maritime corridors for ships to get its grain out to world market. It also comes as Russia itself is exporting record volumes of wheat, so essentially profiting from the fact that this disruption is causing Ukraine to export less wheat onto global markets. So critical to view it in that context. This is not a military target. This is an attack on Ukraine's economy. And as I said, more grain infrastructure hit this morning, Laila.",

But the focus, of course, will be on the new phones because, as you know, they used to be the world's second-biggest smartphone maker. But then that part of their business almost got wiped out because ofthe severe US sanctions imposed on the company basically starting in 2019, cutting off the company's access to advanced chipmaking tools that use any US technology because Washington has deemed the company to be a national security threat. That's something the company has long denied. But after laying low for a few years, just last month, actually coincidentally, or maybe not, while the US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo was visiting China, they suddenly launched a new phone model, Mate 60 Pro, that apparently, with 5G capabilities. That means the company has somehow found a way to work around all those export controls. And experts who have took apart the phone found the domestically produced advanced chip in it, along with two South Korean chips by the company Hynix. Now Hynix told CNN they have no idea how their chips got in the new Huawei phone because they have severed ties with the company because of the US sanctions. But all of that developments obviously alarmed a lot of people in Washington with Raimondo herself saying she was upset when she learned about the launch when she was in China, with a lot more members of congress obviously calling for even stricter export controls targeting China, not only Huawei, but the Chinese chipmaker SMIC that made that chip I just mentioned. But all of that also pointing to the loopholes of the sanctions so far. But for the Chinese, obviously they consider this a milestone moment in their tech history, in Huawei's company history.

Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.(END VIDEOTAPE) HARRAK: Italian media is reporting that a murderous Sicilian Mafia boss who was on the run for three decades before his capture has died. Reports say Matteo Messina Denaro was being treated for colon cancer when he died in a hospital in central Italy. He was arrested in Palermo in January after a 30-year manhunt. Messina Denaro was serving multiple life sentences for the murder of two anti Mafia prosecutors, for fatal bombings across Italy in the 1990s, and for the torture and murder of the 11-year-old son of one of his enemies. Florida has unveiled a new high-speed train service called Brightline Rail. It will travel between Orlando and Miami with a stop in West Palm Beach, at speeds of over two hundred kilometers an hour. CNN's Pete Muntean takes us onboard and tells us how the company plans to expand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The trains are polished. The stations are ready. And for the first time, passengers are seeing this 125-mile-per-hour view.

Her last regular season league game takes place in Seattle on October 6th.Now, an Ethiopian runner has smashed the women's marathon world record. Tigist Assefa finished the Berlin Marathon in just 2:11:53. And that result shaved more than two minutes off the previous record, though the time still needs to be ratified. By the marathon's halfway point, she was a minute inside the world record pace, finishing well ahead of all of the other athletes. She says while she did think she could break the world record, she didn't expect to break it by such a wide margin. Congratulations to her.
