Take a look at this map. The outage was massive. According to the website, Downdetector, these were the major cities, reporting outages.

Also, a massive outage leaving AT&amp;T customers, unable, to make or receive calls, for hours, including some emergency ones. What happened and why? Also, a dramatic touchdown hold-your-breath moments, as America lands a spacecraft on the moon, for the first time, in more than 50 years. We'll take you inside the lunar mission. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Alexei Navalny's mother says that Putin's thugs are blackmailing her, after they finally took her to see her son's lifeless body in the morgue. More on that in a moment. But in the meantime, in Washington, we're hearing from President Biden, who says that President Putin's punishment starts tomorrow. And he's sending an unmistakable image -- message, with this embrace of Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and their daughter, Dasha, meeting and morning together, as the President was in California today. It's an image worth a 1,000 words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're also meant to mark two years, since Putin invaded the country, next door.U.S. officials say that the sanctions are aimed at Russia's military, and also a new attempt to choke off Russia's ability, to get the goods, it wants, something that it's proven to be surprisingly resilient, in the last two years. But none of that is likely to push Putin, into handing over Alexei Navalny's body. I should note, Russia also is claiming now that he died of natural causes. Natural causes at age 47, a day after he didn't appear to be in distress, when he was in court, before being returned to the harshest penal colony, in all of Russia, that Putin uses, to lock away and torture his opponents. And that blackmail that I mentioned earlier? Navalny's mother says that she is being forced to agree to a secret burial, or else they'll do something with her son's body. And Putin is probably right to be afraid of that. A funeral could bring out masses of Navalny's supporters, and embarrass the notoriously thin-skinned Russian dictator. And then, there's the evidence that may be lurking in Navalny's body as well, about what really killed him. That brings me to my first guest, tonight, exiled Russian journalist, Mikhail Zygar. He was exchanging letters, with Alexei Navalny, just days before his death. He's also the Author of \"War and Punishment: Putin, Zelensky, and the Path to Russia's Invasion of Ukraine.\" When you hear what Navalny's mom is going through, what she says is blackmail that she's being told she has to agree to certain conditions, let a Russian authority transport her son's body. I mean, what do you-- MIKHAIL ZYGAR, EXILED RUSSIAN JOURNALIST, AUTHOR, \"WAR AND PUNISHMENT\": It's very predictable.",

He's citing religious doctrine and the Book of Genesis. I wonder where is the line drawn, between law and theocracy. DOUG JONES, (D), FORMER ALABAMA SENATOR: Well, Kaitlan, obviously with Chief Justice Parker, there is no line. I was listening to Governor Haley, saying Alabama ought to just get back to the law. Well hell, Parker doesn't worry about the law. All he worry about is his Christian philosophy. And that's nothing new, by the way. For those people, who were shocked at this, across the country? This has been his mantra, for years. He has been in public service for a long time. As you said, he's an ally of Judge Roy Moore. And so, this is nothing new. And it's really -- what's really sad about this, Kaitlan is not just all of the thousands of families that might be affected by this that ultimately could be affected across the country. But our business community's just not going to step up again. They didn't step up on the abortion bill. They didn't step up on the immigration bill. They're too afraid to speak out. Our UAB health system has got one of the finest health systems in the country, particularly their pediatrics and OB-GYN. Who the hell's going to want to come to Alabama, after this kind of ruling?
