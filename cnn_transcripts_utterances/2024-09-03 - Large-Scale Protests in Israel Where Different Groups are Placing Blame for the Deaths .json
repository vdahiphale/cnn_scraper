There have been 50 rule changes in the NFL the last two decades aimed at making the game safer and advancements in technology and equipment have accelerated. Inventions like Guardian Caps aimed at helping to prevent concussions weren`t around when I played in the NFL. We`re taking a closer look at their potential to make the game safer.

We go by She and today She is a non- profit that creates sustainable education and employment opportunities for girls and women around the world. Today, when a girl enters our program, she not only receives a new school uniform, but she receives a full tuition scholarship, full year of school supplies, and a year-round tutoring from our local staff. After we provided our first round of uniforms, we realized our students were outgrowing them very quickly. So that was where the uniform that grows was born. It grows six sizes and up to 12 inches in length. It adjusts in various parts of the body to provide a well-tailored fit. We employ 20 seamstresses in Togo. We intentionally hire women from low- income, low-education backgrounds who haven`t had the opportunity to go to school previously. We guarantee salaries on average 75% higher than minimum wage. We provide three-month paid maternity leave, unlimited sick leave, and kind of a whole host of benefits that ensure that women in the workplace can thrive. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
