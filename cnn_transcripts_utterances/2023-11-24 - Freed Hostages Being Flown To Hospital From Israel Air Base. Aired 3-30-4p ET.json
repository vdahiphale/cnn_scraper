I'm also thinking a lot about the hard road ahead, especially for these young children and their families, especially for people who may have witnessed loved ones being killed in front of their eyes before they were taken into captivity.So while there is a sense of, of relief and happiness for those individuals who have been freed and their loved ones, it's not a fate that they should have ever suffered and the healing from it will take a long time.",

Jason, actually, we're going to pause the conversation for a moment because those helicopters I mentioned a moment ago are now arriving. This is not Schneider's Children's Hospital were four children areexpected to arrive momentarily. Let's go live now to Clarissa Ward, who is there for us. Clarissa, walk us through what you're seeing and what we're expecting to see in just moments.",

But we are anticipating that a group of children will be arriving at that Schneider Children's Hospital or potentially along with their mothers.We know that a critical part in all of this, we're not only the sensitive nature of the logistics and getting them out of Gaza and back into Israel, but also the way that IDF soldiers were set to receive them. You mentioned the critical steps that have been taken at the hospital to ensure that their reintegration goes as smoothly as possible. And you mentioned that there are also crowds there that are cheering them on. What do we know, Clarissa, about what happens next once they're taken inside and what resources have been made available to these families as they try to piece together a new chapter of their lives.",

Some of them assumed to find out the extent of what occurred on October 7th.And as we saw their every potential measure being taken to ensure that their reintegration goes as smoothly as possible, those barriers being put up before they were loaded into that vehicle, and it departed the helipad. Clarissa please keep us posted on when you see the next helicopter that you mentioned approaching. I believe we still have Jason Rezaian with us who has a unique perspective. And Jason, as you're watching these historic images from the Schneider Children's Hospital, I'm wondering what's going through your mind, specifically when it comes to the challenges that these very young kids are going to face moving forward. Some of them are potentially orphaned.",

But the experience of those people who are just coming out, especially the children, it's incredibly jarring, they're in for such a difficult road ahead. And my heart just really goes out to them as it does to anybody being held hostage or who has recently returned from being a hostage.I just can't fathom what it would be like to be a child thrust into that situation, and then have to come back to the realities that are happening in Israel and in this war. So I think, you know, spare a thought for these kids as they start this long journey towards recovery, and healing, because it's not going to be easy for them.",

And, you know, no one can measure except the person themselves, how long that time needs to last.And unfortunately, situations like this don't provide that kind of, of privacy and space for people. There's such a great demand for their time. And people just want to see them. And even just the action of wanting to hug someone who's come back from being a hostage can be quite an interference on that person's space. So you know, I just -- I hope that they have the opportunity to to be away from the spotlight as much as possible and get the help that they need.",

What you can't argue is that they have had successes. They've had incredible successes. Dozens of Americans who've been wrongfully detained in countries around the world have come home during this presidency. And it's a continuation of a commitment by administrations Republican and Democrat. That, you know, hostage issues are not partisan. They're an American issue. We don't stand for our people being held around the world. So I would put our faith in, in in this administration, and its ability to effectively bring people home and I hope that that's the case as soon as possible for those Americans who are still unaccounted for.",

And I think one of the things that is, to me really important, and this pause can help us think through a little bit is how do you legitimately go after the perpetrators of this attack? That is a legitimate target to go after the people who organize this attack, but then have some bigger strategic plan for Gaza.I don't think it's possible to just get rid of, of an ideology through military action.
