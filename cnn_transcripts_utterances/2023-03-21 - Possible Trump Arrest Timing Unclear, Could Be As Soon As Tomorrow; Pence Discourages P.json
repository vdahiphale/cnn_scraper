We're going to show you what Tucker Carlson said. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, blow up our country.

You had Bill Barr who became the attorney general who really frowned upon what he perceived as a political prosecution in the courts as opposed to the actual substantive issue. That's number one.Number two, we're talking around the issue of prosecutorial discretion. Think about it as if you're driving down the highway. Most people probably are speeding, and the cops are seeing you as well. They decide who to pull over. And they decide that based on who might be the most egregious or beyond, here, this might not fall in the egregious category compared to January 6th and beyond, but the prosecutor has the ability to bring a case if a crime has been committed without regard to the other things that may have happened around it. And this Alvin Bragg, he doesn't have to follow what DOJ is doing, Erin, or what the Fulton county person.

And outside the walls of the Kremlin, Putin is now shutting down anyone who tries to talk about what's happening in Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Russia's Vladimir Putin rolling out the red carpet for his, quote, dear friend, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, greeting each other for their second day of meetings in Moscow. Despite skepticism from the west that the visit is more about supporting Russia and furthering Beijing's own self-interests, Putin and Xi signing an economic deal, deepening their partnership, and calling for an end to actions that increase tensions in the prolonged war in Ukraine. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Of course, we did not ignore the situation around Ukraine. We believe that many of the points on the peace plan put forward by China are consistent with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis of a peaceful settlement when the West and Kyiv are ready for it.

China has been propping up Russia's economy amid western sanctions by purchasing its energy, replacing western suppliers in electronics, cars, and aircraft, and providing an alternative to the U.S. dollar.In Russia, there is some cynicism about Beijing's motives, on a Russian state TV talk show, this military pundit said, China can have only one ally, China itself. China can only have one set of interests, pro-Chinese ones. Chinese foreign policy is utterly devoid of altruism. But Chinese state media is in overdrive, touting the benefits of the Russia/China relationship, and its all positive comments on China's heavily censored social media. This one says, cooperation and win/win, the next one says, long live China/Russia friendship. Disagreements, if any, are censored. By meeting with Putin, Xi wants to highlight his role as a global statesman that can offer an alternative to the current world order. (END VIDEOTAPE) WANG (on camera):  And, Erin, the real tangible outcome from this meeting is Beijing deepening ties in Russia in ways that benefits itself, the economic agreement they signed. That's going to likely give China even more leverage on its relationship. Chinese policy in all of this is a bit contradictory, but it really boils down to publicly declaring neutrality, supporting Putin, but paying no price. That's why analysts I speak to say it's unlikely China would provide weapons because they do not want to pay a price for this relationship -- Erin. BURNETT:  All right. Thank you very much, Selina.

A moment ago, I mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize-winning group in Russia, one of its leaders taken in for questioning today, released on bail for allegedly discrediting the Russian armed forces.

But the details matter. First, the visit was very secret. For example, not a single journalist in Moscow knew about the trip. Putin simply didn't take them with him. Second, there was a very limited list of officials traveling with Putin. This suggests that the trip was kept secret until the very last moment. And, finally, it's important that the trip took place at night for the sake of greater safety. And it shows us that the Kremlin was really afraid of information leaks.
