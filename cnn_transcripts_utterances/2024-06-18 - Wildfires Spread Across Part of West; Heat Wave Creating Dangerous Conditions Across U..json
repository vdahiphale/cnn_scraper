It's very difficult for us to deal with -- we just don't have the infrastructure to deal with multiple catastrophes playing out at the same time. And that's what we're starting to see.

Pyongyang is rolling out the red carpet with Putin's portrait lining the streets. You can see it right there ahead of his first visit in more than two decades. He's expected to seek support for his war in Ukraine as the two leaders also look to strengthen the alliance that has Washington on alert.Joining me now, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton and former chief of CIA Russia operations Steve Hall. Colonel, I mean, that was some fascinating video we just saw a few moments ago of the Putin banners lining the streets of Pyongyang. This is a little weird. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST AND U.S. AIR FORCE: It is. But when you go to countries like North Korea and Russia, they always pull out all the stops in order to greet a foreign leader of a like or similar ideology. And that that really, you know, kind of tells you all the things that you can see because there are so many aspects of, you know, how they run things that are very controlled, very tightly controlled. And when you see what, you know, the North Koreans do with their immaculate streets in that particular part of the capital, they are putting out every single aspect in order to make Putin's limousine travel unencumbered through those main avenues.",

I mean, who thought that we would have been in a situation where a former superpower like Russia, used to be the Soviet Union, has to essentially go sort of begging, to try to barter with North Korea to get more weapons to support their continued invasion of Ukraine. I mean, it's just pretty amazing.But the bottom line is that Putin is going more than just for, you know, to try to get weapons and other assistance from North Korea. He's also building this anti-democratic coalition that we're seeing coming out worldwide with, you know, countries like Iran, North Korea, and all these other places. So, yes, he's sort of got a two-pronged mission here.",

They get the possibility of having a place where they can actually deliver some exports, but they also get something where they get a lot from the Russians in return. Most importantly, technology, especially for their space and missile program, and that's the kind of thing that we can expect.We can also expect them to perhaps work together in the cyber area. Both the North Koreans and the Russians have very good offensive cyber capabilities. The Russians are, of course, far ahead in that area, but the North Koreans aren't too bad. Remember the Sony hack? And they are basically countries that are now on the other side of the global international financial system, and that will allow them to kind of flock together in this sense and create a -- the beginnings of an economic block along with China that may not directly challenge everything that we do in the west, but it gives them the capability of at least surviving with each other. And that's how they see that.",

But you know what I was saying earlier about, you know, things staying the same, you know, we all remember, all of us who've been around long enough, you know, the Cold War where it was the Soviets against western democracies.Now, it's simply transitioned into something that looks a little bit different. Western democracies against these autocratic countries. And then, you still have what used to be called the, the Non-Aligned Movement. Now, we call it sort of the Global South of these countries that are trying to figure, OK, are we going to go with the democracies or are we going to go with the North Koreas of the world? Clearly, North Korea has made up its mind who it's going to fall in with because they really don't have any choice. Russia is the closest thing that they can get in terms of a partner for where they see the world going forward.",

And Stoltenberg raised this issue of \"authoritarian powers\" like Russia, China, North Korea, all -- with Iran. Iran aligning in this challenge to the west. How serious of a security issue is that?

Now, history has some examples, you know, you look at the axis powers during World War II, you know, Germany, Italy, and then Japan coming together. And that's the kind of thing that we see with Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Those countries have a very core -- very much core interest in many cases, and they also are responsible for what amount to violations of the nuclear nonproliferation regime that had been established in the wake of the Cold War. That regime is gone.And we know that, you know, North Korea has nuclear weapons. We know that the North Koreans and the Iranians have been working together on nuclear issues and other military issues. So, that's the kind of thing that is a significant security issue, not only for this decade, but probably for the century.",

I mean, we should be talking about this more because this is critical to us national security and the fact that one of the candidates, Donald Trump, has already essentially said, look, I'm going to downplay NATO. I'm not even sure it should exist. I don't really care if an enemy of NATO attacks, you know, a non -- you know, a non-paying member of -- or, you know, paying less than the 2 percent.So, it's -- you know, it's everything that NATO's antagonists want to hear. It's everything that Vladimir Putin and the Chinese and North Koreans want to hear coming out of Donald Trump. The good news I think is, is that NATO leaders or leaders of NATO countries are trying to essentially Trump-proof NATO and other parts of the post-World War II security structure. We even saw by President Biden doing this when he tried to do the 10-year -- you know, the 10- year deal with Ukraine. So, there are some moves in that direction, which, you know, leaves us, I guess, some hope in that regard.",
