A judge killing his last-ditch effort to delay the hush money trial, and we have just obtained the jury questionnaire for Trump's criminal trial that begins in six days. We're going to go through that with you right now. Plus, a sight to behold. Nearly every single American could see at least parts of the eclipse sweeping across America if you had the glasses. Thirty-two million people though were in the path of totality, a stunning thing. One of the former NASA astronaut tells me its like nothing he's ever seen before. And Marjorie Taylor Greene linking the eclipse to the New York earthquake as, quote, signs to repent in America. This is her efforts to oust the House speaker are making her even more powerful in the GOP. Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with breaking news. Trump's last ditch effort to delay denied. A judge just rejecting the former president's request to delay his hush money trial, which starts in six days. Trump is trying to move the case out of Manhattan. And it comes just as CNN has obtained the crucial jury questionnaire that potential jurors will have to answer in Trump's first criminal trial. Our Paula Reid obtain them and they the offer a lot of important clues about the trial we're about to witness. You've got questions ranging on, you know, whether jurors have supported any fringe groups like QAnon to where they get their news, to whether they've ever listened to certain podcasts to whether they're married, all sorts of details, you know? And also questions like this. Do you have any feelings of opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case? So it is 42 questions in all. We're going to go through it, as Trump is throwing every piece of spaghetti he can find at the wall and a final effort to avoid his facing judge and jury in that first criminal trial in just six days. He's also frenetically trying every last ditch effort to get his Georgia election interference case tossed. Tonight, turning to the Georgia court of appeals, his team writing that the former president's quote, indictment wrongfully criminalizes core political speech and expressive conduct predict -- protected, I'm sorry, by the First Amendment. Remember, this is the case where Trump appealed to the secretary of state of Georgia to find him votes that did not exist. Listen.

She wants it to start in August.So let's get straight to Paula Reid on the breaking news tonight.

Harry, you've been going through this juror questionnaire and as Paula points out, some of the questions in here are ones we saw before in the E. Jean Carroll case, you know, whether you've worked for Trump for example, where you get your news. Forty-two questions as she points out. What stands out to you? HARRY SANDICK, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Sure. I think it's a very thoughtful approach. Many of these questions are typical in any jury trial about the background of the juror and what they do, where they live, those types of things. But then they're aimed at trying to elicit people who cant be fair because of course, Trump is entitled to have a fair trial of jurors who don't go in with a preconceived notion about his guilt. And the judge has said that anyone who says, I can't be fair, they'll just simply be excused, which will make the process take a long time. But will result one hopes in a fair trial.",

I mean, they've had pretty much the same set of goals since these indictments came down last year, to obscure the facts and also to delay this for long enough so that it starts blending in with him and the political calendar over the summer.The mere fact that we are talking about the hush money case and not the January 6 cases, the trial that's going first was considered a victory for the Trump folks. They wanted this case to kind of go for anything. Easier to the folks have actually ingested the facts here, but I think that as this comes on, we do see polling say that maybe people will change their opinion if a conviction comes or as the election gets a little closer.

I think that should be separate from that kind of legal questions PC here, but politically, Trump is going to try to use that to his vantage.

How things happen outside of our control especially in the context now, we worry so much about the environment and climate change.One of the things Bill mentioned in his report, right, there was a point in some places where the temperature dropped as much as ten degrees during the eclipse, so, in just a few quick moments. Now, we all feel that when a cloud goes over the sun, and yet somehow experiencing it in the context of what we saw today was quite different. I mean, what -- that's an incredibly its an incredibly large and swift a change in temperature -- it's a reminder of how dynamic and fragile things are, I think because when we said and when it gets cloudy out, it's a lot different than when the sun is shining on us. But it's really the same reason during the eclipse, it's just that less solar radiation is reaching the surface and reaching us. So it's cooler. We feel a cooler temperature. With the moon blocking the sun, it perfectly blocks it. The moon, the side is 400 times larger than our moon, and it's also coincidentally 400 times further away than our moon. So that when we get a total eclipse, like we had today, it perfectly blocks it out. And so, that were seeing a total blackout for those minutes of that reduction in solar radiation.

We know that Russia is propagating these false statements narratives about what's going on in Ukraine. We know that she is getting her talking points from Russia and we know that they're false and Mike Johnson is doing the responsible thing by trying to make sure we get a vote on Ukraine funding, make sure that Ukrainian people can fight for their freedom.

And then even though Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge overseeing this case, has said she would move pretty quickly. She would like to bring this as soon as possible. She still has to give both sides some time, perhaps a few months to prepare. So were talking about late summer at the earliest. So timing is such a critical issue here.
