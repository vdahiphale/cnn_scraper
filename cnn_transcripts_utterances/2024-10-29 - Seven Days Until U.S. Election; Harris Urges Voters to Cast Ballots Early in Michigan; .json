Bezos is saying that's not the case. He's doing this as a principled decision, but he's doing it on the eve of an election, and that's really the issue at the heart of this.He acknowledges maybe he had some poor timing, maybe he should have announced this earlier, but he's doing it because he wants to win back people's trust over time. In the short term, though, he's lost a lot of his audience's trust. There's hard pressure, a quid pro quo, a deal with Trump, and then there's a form of soft pressure. And the real concern I'm hearing from Post reporters, from editors, from columnists, is that there's a form of soft pressure being applied here. The author of On Tyranny, Timothy Snyder, has talked for years about the idea of obeying in advance, that in democracies that are sliding toward autocracies, people try to obey in advance, that wealthy businessmen, that media leaders, that powerful people start to give in to the aspiring authoritarian whims in advance.

And so the State Department says it would then fall to Israel to fill the vacuum and provide this humanitarian aid.Now, there's no indication that Israel is either willing or able to do that at this point while it's carrying out this military war against Hamas. And it is the fact that many of the humanitarian aid groups within Gaza as well have publicly stated that they alone cannot provide the humanitarian aid, the food, the water, the shelter, the health care that Gazans so desperately need without this very key U.N. infrastructure. So I think certainly there will be no decisions from the United States, as we know, for the next week at least before the U.S. election.

That led to him spending 120 days in a low- security federal correction institution in Danbury, Connecticut.
