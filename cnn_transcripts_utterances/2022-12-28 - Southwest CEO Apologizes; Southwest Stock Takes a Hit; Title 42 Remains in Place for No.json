And the premarket shares are off about 1.5 percent, but we will see what the day brings.Here is why it will likely be so expensive for the company to fix it according to industry experts that I have spoken to. Not only will it be expensive for them to return and reimburse all of these flights, more than 15,000 as you have pointed out since last Thursday. You have to also think about all of these employees, these folks who are working the phones, who are working reservations, they're going to likely have to pay them overtime. And then these upgrades to the information technology, the software scheduling system which the CEO acknowledged yesterday saying clearly we need to double down on our already existing plans to upgrade systems. Unclear how much that is going to cost for an airline as large as Southwest. Of course, the largest domestic carrier here in the U.S. So, all of these reasons making it increasingly clear that it will be expensive for Southwest Airlines to fix it.

There really is no line. There are no migrants here. And what you do see is the presence of the Texas National Guard. You see some National Guard vehicles and also the fencing. I just talked to one of their public information officers and they tell me that that's the message that they were trying to send here. And that is that individuals need to go through the ports of entry. They need to enter the country legally because it's not safe. The river that you're looking at is not safe. Believe me, I've covered multiple stories of how the river, even though is looks shallow, it can be very deadly. Adults and children have died. And this year there are record levels of individuals, migrants, who have died all along this river. Now, all this fencing does is it directs the flow of migration, it directs migrants to a specific point where they can turn themselves into border authorities. Now, I've talked to migrants on the U.S. side that have already done that and some of those have done it in very difficult situations. One couple that I talked to crossed the river overnight and the - their -- her parents, the parents of this one little girl that I interviewed, said that the mom had to hold her daughter tight to save her life because she was so cold.

And that is what he was pinpointing here.Now, of course, the Supreme Court said that they would hear arguments in the next session. That starts in February. So, in the interim, this stays in effect.

Well, for many when you talk to folks observing the White House, within the White House, this policy has somewhat become a sort of stopgap in the void of a sort of consistent functioning plan at the border. Title 42, while President Biden, and even during the campaign, committed to unwinding many of the Trump era border policies, Title 42 was one you didn't hear about as much, even dating back to the campaign. We know that throughout the past two years it's also been a point of tension for immigration advisers and the aides working on the border within the White House. You've had those that have argued that it does show a message of deterrence and sends a message that could try to deter a surge at the border, which has also been pretty dubious when you talk to career officials down there. Title 42 doesn't exactly stop people from coming, it just prevents them from staying in detention facilities in the U.S. and allows border patrol agents to rapidly turn them away. But it doesn't stop people from coming. So, when you talk to members of Congress, and when you see members of Congress now also using it as a sort of negotiating chip in these different congressional negotiations over immigration, when you see the White House continue to rely on it, now under court order, yes, what it really does expose in a way is this void of any congressional action when it comes to actually efficient border policy or a consistent plan from the White House as well.",

I think it's reasonable to have doubt that at least in the immediate months that they could come forward with a proposal, especially when the loudest voices in the room, you're hearing more so an emphasis on oversight investigations. You're hearing that it may be more likely that we see potential investigations into the homeland security secretary. Maybe him even call down to Congress as well. Immigration, at this point, and the border is still one of the political vulnerabilities of the White House and still one of the main sort of issues that the Republican Party turns to, to attack the current administration.

In two more conversations with former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, she said Meadows burned those documents during the final days of the Trump presidency.CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes has been following this story. And, Kristen, there's a lot in here, but give us some context on these burned documents. These are -- just to remind everyone, these are the waning days of the Trump presidency. There's a lot going on and he's burning documents in the fireplace.",

      "sentences": "Right. And also, just to remind everyone, there is a protocol for these kind of documents that are going in and out of the White House, and it is not to throw them in your fireplace.Now, according to Hutchinson's testimony, she says she witnessed him throw these documents into his fireplace in his office on more than a dozen occasions. Now, the key part here, though, is that twice, two of the times she witnessed this, was after a meeting with Pennsylvania GOP Congressman Scott Perry, who we know has been linked to efforts to try to use the Justice Department to try and overturn the 2020 election. That is a key there, just because of that meeting, because the context we know about Perry. Now, I do want to point out a couple of other things that we saw in Hutchinson's testimony but also in several other key players. Hutchinson, now we're actually starting to see that disconnect between her and her Trump-backed lawyer. This is playing out in these transcripts. The two of them are bickering. You're seeing that her loyalties are shifting at a certain point. He's stopping her. She's trying to talk over him. So, that's one key part. The other thing that I noticed here was something she mentioned about Meadows telling her and several other White House aides not to essentially put down all the meetings that were happening in the Oval Office, to keep a close hold. She says that she's not sure exactly what that meant, but that likely meant that they weren't showing up until the Oval Office diary. This is important because, again, it goes to the same thing about the documents. All of this is a record for a reason. It's the president of the United States. Now, the last part of all of these testimonies that I thought was most interesting was, one, Hutchinson talking about the rise of QAnon conspiracies that really went all the way up to the president here. And one thing she says, she had interaction with Peter Navarro, one of the White House aides, and she says, at one point I had sarcastically said, oh, is this from your QAnon friends, Peter, because Peter would talk to me frequently about his QAnon friends. He said, have you looked into it yet, Cass? I think they point out a lot of good ideas. You really need to read this. Make sure the chief sees it. And it was going all the way up, at some points, to the president. She describes a meeting with congress men and women where Marjorie Taylor Greene is talking about how her constituents are QAnon and they support the president. A lot of it focused around that 2020 conspiracy theories. And one thing I thought was also interesting was, not from her, but actually from White House aide Johnny McEntee, talks about those QAnon conspiracies, but actually just talks about all the fringe people who are coming in and out of the White House. And it really seems like this was the wild, wild west at some points. You know, people were barging in, they were sending McEntee messages saying I need to meet with the president. I want to meet with him now. People were having meetings that his closest aides didn't even know about until afterwards. So, it's really indicate here to certainly paint this picture of those final days of the Trump presidency. A lot of it was reported, but actually seeing the White House aides saying it in their own words, it's striking.",

I wonder what you make of being able to read Cassidy Hutchinson's transcripts where she says that she's watching Mark Meadows, then the chief of staff, burning these documents regularly in his office during a transition period. As Kristen just laid out for us, there is protocol. We all -- we all know, there are -- there's so much protocol around what to do with documents. It's there for a reason.

And if you had to destroy classified or other document, it went in the burn bag. There's a protocol.Meadows apparently didn't even trust that protocol. He destroyed these documents themselves. So, I think that it is concerning evidence. It's additional evidence. And, of course, the other thing that is very interesting in the Cassidy Hutchinson testimony is, we saw how she testified after she changed lawyers. And there have been very serious allegations about her former lawyer, Stefan Passantino, who -- and his ties to Trump world. And then when she gets her new lawyer, Jody Hunt, she's fully forthcoming. That's very important. She says I want to correct and extend the record. But information pours out, Jessica, incriminating information for Donald Trump, Mark Meadows and others.

So, we'll want to look for both evidence of possible tax fraud and broader frauds. We'll be looking at things like, is he taking proper business deductions or is he claiming losses that he doesn't really have? Is he making payments to his family, which he's trying to conceal as tax deductible, when they're not really tax deductible. There's controversies over conservation easements where he claims he's yielded his property for purposes of conservation. That's in New York. It's also in California. But did he really do it?
