And so, there's obviously a hope, by Hamas now, that the pressure will grow, on Israel, to perhaps back down a little bit, to lessen that pressure, that there will be more support, perhaps, for what Hamas is asking for. We did hear, from a Hamas spokesman, who said that they are willing to release the foreign prisoners, if they are able to get aid, into the Gaza Strip, and able to get a ceasefire out. Of course, those are terms that that Israel certainly has rejected. Now, they're not talking about peace. They're not talking about a ceasefire. So, the official reason that Hamas gave, earlier today, for releasing these two women, was humanitarian reasons. And it was to send a message, they said, to Americans, to counter what they call, the fascist claims, by the Biden administration. So, whether that -- this definitely puts Israel in a tougher spot.
