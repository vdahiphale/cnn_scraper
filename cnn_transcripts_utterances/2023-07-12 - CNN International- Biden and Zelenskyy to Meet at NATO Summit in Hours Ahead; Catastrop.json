Essentially, it's been offered Kyiv a pathway, a faster pathway, a one-step rather than two-step process towards NATO accession and no timetable. That was difficult enough to get to what is.What you are going to see today and it's kicked off already, is President Zelenskyy meeting with a number of key NATO allies and partners. Even now he's meeting with Olaf Scholz, the German leader. He's also then going to be meeting later of course with that bilateral meeting with President Biden. He's already had a number of commitments made from key NATO allies including France and Germany who pledged extra military aid. The French in the shape of long-term weapons that had so far been reluctant to give Ukraine. The Germans say, more than 600-billion-euro package of extra military aid, more Leopard tanks, but also that much-needed artillery.

Willis will now take those charging recommendations to one of these two grand juries in hopes of pursuing a potential criminal indictment against the president, as well as others who are under investigation.

It was posted by the Russian Investigative Committee on their website. It's pretty, traumatic. It shows some people coming out of someone's house. Eventually you see the alleged suspect himself. Now we obviously cannot independently verify the video.But the Russian Investigative Committee, and they named this man -- the alleged suspect as Serhiy Denysenko. He was born in 1959, apparently, they didn't say where, but the plot thickens. Right? We still don't know, really, why this guy was targeted. I think that's the key question. The Russian media are now saying that he might have been tracked by his Strava app. That the public profile -- we found the profile under his name. And again, can't verify if it was definitely him, but it shows that he regularly ran through this park. So that is a possibility. But why he was targeted at the time of his death he seems to have been a local bureaucrat, perhaps involved in military recruitment, head of the department of mobilization for the city Krasnodar. But the question is around when he was a submarine commander. We understand from his family he was at one point based in Sevastopol in Crimea where the Black Sea Fleet is. Was he involved in a special military operation? His family telling Russian media outlets, no, he wasn't. He filed for dismissal from the military before December 2021, and was eventually released in August 2022. So we don't know exactly. But meanwhile, the interesting part of this, is just how much detail the Ukrainian defense intelligence originally went into about this. They were the ones who originally sort of draw attention to this. They name the type of pistol used. They said that, you know, he was running at 6:00 a.m., the park says there are no witnesses. They are the ones who's given the most detail so far, haven't claimed responsibility. They've been accused of being behind this military blogger and things like that.
