      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.The southwestern U.S. is bracing for potentially catastrophic flooding as Hurricane Hilary churns off the Pacific. And we just learned moments ago that the storm has weakened just a bit to a category three storm with 125 miles an hour winds. And right now, it's lashing Mexico with strong winds and high waves. Forecasters warn that it could dump more than a year's worth of rain across parts of California, Nevada, and Arizona. The storm is expected to weaken as it moves north. But the threat is so severe, a tropical storm watch has been issued for California, the first ever for that state. And people there are trying to prepare as best they can. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar is joining us right now. Allison, I mean a new advisory has just been issued. While it may have been, you know, downgraded a little bit, that's still very threatening a category three.",

      "sentences": "Right. And keep in mind, the weakening was forecast. We knew that as it slid into some cooler waters, this was going to happen. So in terms of the forecast, it's doing exactly what we expected it to do. So right now, winds are sustained at 125 miles per hour. That's a high end category three storm. So still a major hurricane at this time. Forward movement has picked up speed to the north northwest at about 16 miles per hour.Now that is important because that means it's making its way faster, which means the impacts are arriving earlier. We're already starting to see some of those outer bands begin to spread rain into portions of Southern California, Nevada as well as Western Arizona. So, Yuma over towards Palm Springs, starting to see the beginnings of some of those showers and thunderstorms. The storm will continue to weaken even more as it continues to slide into that colder water and likely going to cross into Southern California as a tropical storm. Now, rain is certainly going to be the biggest concern with this. Not just along the Baja California, but even the state of California areas of Nevada and Western Arizona as well, because we get a lot of that heavy rain really settles in overnight tonight, lasts the entire day tomorrow before finally retreating out in the second half of the day, Monday. You're talking 48 straight hours of very heavy rainfall. So you've got a very high risk for excessive rainfall in this pink area here that includes Death Valley stretching down into Palm Desert. Then areas like Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Diego looking at a moderate risk of excessive rainfall. Widespread, these areas are talking two to four inches of rain. Keep in mind, that may not sound like all that much, especially if you live, say, east of the Rockies, but for these areas, that's a year's worth of rain in some of these spots, and they're just going to get that in one to two days. In a few of these areas, we're talking eight to even 10 inches of rain. So now you're talking multiple years worth of rain in just a very short period of time. Another thing to note, too, is there's another system right behind Hilary down to the south and then count them. Yes, Fred, four possible systems that we're watching in the Atlantic. It's that time of year again, so we will likely be busy and giving you some more updates throughout the rest of the day.",

He and 18 co-defendants are charged with plotting to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has set Friday, August 25th, as the deadline for the defendants to surrender. Trump's arrest will likely look different from his previous three criminal cases. Local officials have said that they will treat the former president like any other defendant.

They would typically wait around for their turn for hours to get their fingerprints taken and to get that mug shot. Also that they would have a thorough body search done by a jail deputy, although in the past, high profile defendants who have voluntarily turned themselves in have not been subject to a body search. They would also go through a medical screening and then a pretrial consultation to see if it's appropriate in their individual scenario to be released without bond.

They don't all have to be connected under the Georgia law. Georgia's RICO statute is extremely broad when you compare it to the federal statute. And for that reason, Trump and all the other individuals should be very afraid because this is a very serious matter, and they're coming up against not only Fani Willis, who is an expert in this area, and she's proven her track record to be very good at prosecuting RICO cases. She's got a chief assistant, Mr. Floyd, who's acknowledgeable or more knowledgeable than Fani herself.

But I would say that the jury pool is not going to be dispositive. There's an old attorney in legendary attorney in Georgia, Bobby Lee Cook, who said that when the jury gets the case, no matter what it is, the Holy Ghost descends upon them and they do the right thing.

True to forum, he is talking about making patriotism cool again and railing against these corporate diversity efforts. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spoke before Ramaswamy. And he talked a lot about school choice, strong foreign policy, and taking a very aggressive public safety position.Former President Donald Trump really not the focus of this event. He was not invited by Erickson to the gathering here. But after Christie left the stage, he did address reporters and he just really attacked Trump for not participating in the debate next week. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no other conclusion to come to that. He's both afraid of me. And he's afraid of defending his record. And if I had his record, I'd be nervous about showing up too. And let's face it, guys, by Wednesday, he's going to be out on bail in four different jurisdictions. That really, when are we going to stop thinking that's normal? When are we going to allow our country to understand again, that nominating someone who's out on bail in four jurisdictions is not a winning formula? (END VIDEO CLIP)",
