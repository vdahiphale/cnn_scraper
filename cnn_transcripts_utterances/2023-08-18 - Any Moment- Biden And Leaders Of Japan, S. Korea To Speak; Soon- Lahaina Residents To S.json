Less than an hour from now, residents of Lahaina on Maui set to address how officials responded and didn't respond to the deadly wildfires in their community. At least 111 people now confirmed dead, 1,000 people or more could still be missing, just shocking numbers. More and more pointed questions, including why Maui's warning sirens were silent as the fires spread. The island's emergency management chief, Herman Andaya, resigned one day after defending the decision not to activate those sirens. We're also learning that the ATF is on the ground, joining in the investigation of the fire's origins. So many hard questions that need answers now, Boris?",

Thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us today. Keani, what is it like on the ground right now, 10 days out from when this fire started? KEANI RAWLINS-FERNANDEZ, MAUI COUNTY, HAWAII COUNCIL: Aloha and mahalo for having me on. Right now on the ground, we still see a lot of our community being - working really hard to support each other, getting out all the supplies that are needed. We see the different islands sending boats with supplies, ice, generators, everything that the West Side community needs right now. You just see tremendous amount of love and unity and aloha and support for each other and it's what we need right now. But I also wanted to share a little bit about the distrust that is going on with some of what you just mentioned about what the government is doing and how it's responding or not responding, and the disparities that the different communities are being - like how they're being treated. I wanted to give voice to our Kanaka Maoli, our Native Hawaiians, that are feeling like they're - that this is an attempt to erase our people to physically remove us, remove Native Hawaiians from the land so that they can use this opportunity, this disaster to profit off of and realtors have been calling ...",

I guess this is called disaster capitalism, where they're using this disaster to - as people are suffering from the trauma and in a desperate condition to buy off property so that later they can build it for profit.

But I also think you can credit China and its actions here in Asia, that it has worried powers like Japan and South Korea, who are traditionally trading partners with China. It's made them worried and made them realize that they have to kind of come together.North Korea also pursuing its nuclear weapons program, firing missiles that threaten both of these countries. And, of course, Russia invading Ukraine and China cozying up to Russia, all of that has made the landscape in the region much more unpredictable and that's part of what is bringing these three countries together like this. One of the big concerns, though, is all of the leaders involved here are having some problems in the polls at home. And so a question is, how do you get the mechanisms that they're - we're expecting they're going to agree on to last if there is a change in power in Seoul or Tokyo or Washington.",

You had a Chinese warship cut off a U.S. warship. You had a Chinese aircraft coming quite close to U.S. surveillance aircraft.Here's the Chinese warship cutting off the U.S. destroyer just a number of weeks ago. The concern is these small instances turn into something bigger. Ah, let's go back to Camp David there. We could see President Biden approaching the podium with the leaders of Japan and South Korea. The Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida. So much history here, Boris. There's a reason President Biden chose Camp David. This is where, of course, Jimmy Carter sat down with the Israeli and Egyptian leaders to make peace. Now we have a new alliance here, in effect. SANCHEZ: President Biden is seeking to echo history with his choice of that location. It comes at an important time, too, when there are key questions about China's economic future. So look forward, perhaps, to some conversation about the economic security of these two powers and their relationship with the United States as well.",
