You can see the lines already building. This was the scene in Fletcher, North Carolina, near Asheville, as people lined up for a chance to get just a tank of gas, that along with water, electricity, cell service, all in short supply this morning. In just a moment from now, President Biden will deliver updates on the response efforts. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from the White House with the latest. Arlette, this is a massive disaster that federal and state officials are going to have to get their arms around. People are starting to lose patience very quickly and they're running out of those basic necessities.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. And President Biden, any minute now, is expected to lay out the exact federal response that his team has been taking to try to address the devastation that has spread across so many states in the southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene.Now, President Biden over the weekend was briefed multiple times by his FEMA administrator, Deanne Criswell. And a key priority for the Biden administration in this moment is trying to identify and determine how exactly they can ramp up support for those communities, especially individuals who are having a difficult time accessing some of these resources in those isolated communities. Yesterday, President Biden spoke by phone with Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, as well as North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. He's also been in touch with other local officials to hear about what they are seeing on the ground and what exactly they need to help these communities recover. Now, the president has already approved disaster declarations in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. And what those do is it gives survivors an ability to access food and funds much more quickly to try to obtain items like food, also a baby formula, and other key essential items for so many families in the southeast. You also have seen more than 3,300 federal government personnel deployed to this area to help with rescue and recovery efforts, that includes urban search and rescue teams, using number of people in these high-water areas. There are also more than 50,000 personnel working on trying to establish power for the so many communities that have lost power in the wake of these storms. Now, President Biden has said he plans to travel there as soon as he would not distract from any of the recovery efforts. Vice President Kamala Harris also has said that she plans to do so at some point. And I'll also note, Former President Donald Trump is down in Georgia today, all of them trying to show that they are trying to get their hands around this issue that's affecting so many Americans at this moment.",

If you have a candidate like we had with Geraldine Ferraro in '84 or John Edwards, who hadn't been through the primaries in the same way and wasn't as familiar with the issues, you set up a different way.I think that Vance being a senator and having done the senate debates, if you will, will be well prepared on the issues. Walz has been in Congress for multiple terms, but lately he's been governor. So, he'll study up, I'm sure, on the national issues.",
