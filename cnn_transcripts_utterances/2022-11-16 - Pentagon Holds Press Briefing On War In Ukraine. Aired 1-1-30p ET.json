How are you certain that this was possibly a Ukrainian air defense missile and was not a Russian missile? LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Thanks, Tara. First of all, the investigation is still ongoing. And Poland is conducting that investigation. We are assisting in any way we can. We do have some experts on the ground there helping, helping Polish leadership. We have full confidence in Poland's ability to conduct this investigation in a proper way. And, until that's complete, again, I think it's -- it'd be premature for anybody to jump to conclusions. And I know that Ukraine has offered to participate and help in any way they can as well. So we won't get ahead of what -- of the investigation, but our information supports what President Duda said earlier. His preliminary assessment was that this was most likely, most likely a result of an Ukrainian air defense missile. But we will let the investigation play out here.",

And exactly what the secretary said, the investigation is ongoing. There's professionals there to do the forensics, all the debris that's in and around the impact site and so on and so forth.

      "sentences": "Mr. Secretary, yesterday, it was kind of the reality of the speculation that has been going on for months about how NATO might respond if a Russian missile went into NATO territory.On the opposite side, the United States has been very careful not to provide weapons systems that might reach into Russia. What about Crimea? If the United States HIMARS -- supplied HIMARS systems are able to reach inside Crimea regularly, is that a concern, given what we saw yesterday? And the follow-up, sir, to your comments about -- earlier from last week about the possibility of discussions put on by a slowdown in the fighting, let's say, during the winter, it sounds like the comments that you're making today about the winter are that the Ukrainians are going to continue very strongly. Are you pulling back from your comments from last week that you see an opportunity for negotiations with the Russians?",

      "sentences": "No, I think -- I think the Ukrainians should keep the pressure on the Russians, to the extent that they militarily can.But winter gets very, very cold. And the natural tendency is for tactical operations are going to naturally probably slow down. And right now, what we're seeing is the lines from Kharkiv all the way down to Kherson, for the most part, are beginning to stabilize. Now, whether that means they will be stable throughout the winter or not, nobody knows. Nobody knows for certain. Come January, February, that ground probably will freeze, which could lend itself to offensive operations. So, there could be a lot of activity in the winter. But, typically speaking, because of the weather, the tactical operations will slow down a bit. And I think that President Biden -- and President Zelenskyy himself has said that there will be a -- at the end of the day, there will be a political solution. So, if there's a slowdown in the actual tactical fighting, if that happens, then that may become a window possibly -- it may not -- for a political solution, or at least the beginnings of talks to initiate a political solution. So that's all I was saying.",

      "sentences": "Yes.And I -- first, let me just agree with what the chairman just said in terms of, there is a -- there probably will be a slowdown in the fall and going in into winter. Fall is a muddy season, as you know, and so is the spring. So, when the ground hardens, trafficability will probably improve. And then we will be -- we may see more activity. But I would remind everyone that this war started in February. So, winter does not mean that we're going to stop fighting or the Ukrainians are going to stop fighting. I certainly, like the chairman believe, that they won't. And so we're going to do everything within our power to make sure that they have the means to accomplish their goals and objectives. And along that line, the goals and objectives of this fight are the Ukrainians'. They're not ours. And so we won't prescribe -- haven't prescribed to the Ukrainians what they can and cannot do. And so our focus is to continue to provide them the means to be successful in their endeavors. And so that's my response. To the question on Crimea, again, the Crimea is an issue to be thought through and sorted out by the Ukrainian leadership.",

What I am focused on is just making sure that they have the means to do two things. First is to protect themselves and their civilian population from some of the things that we have seen here recently with the aerial bombardments. The second thing is to enable them to achieve their goals and objectives on the ground as they continue to try to take back their sovereign territory. So, we're going to continue to support them. And, again, I think, to this point, we have seen him come up with very achievable goals and objectives. We have seen a very successful counteroffensive, both in Kharkiv and also in Kherson. And I think they will continue to keep the pressure on the Russians going forward. And in terms of what's a good time to negotiate, we have said repeatedly that the Ukrainians are going to decide that, and not us. And we will support them for as long as it takes. Now, we just spent almost four hours with our colleagues there in a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting. It was amazing to me how many ministers of defense on their own said, we're going to do this for as long as it takes. And so I continue to see unity. I continue to see resolve. And that's very, very encouraging. And I think it's encouraging for Oleksiy Reznikov and his team to hear that as well, because, as you know, they're in the meeting as well. So, yes.",

      "speaker": "AUSTIN",
      "sentences": "So, thanks, Carla.In terms of how long Russia can sustain their efforts, that's left to be seen. I think the chairman just gave a very accurate and compelling description of kind of where the Russians are right now. They're -- they have some problems. They have had problems since the very beginning of this trying to sustain their efforts. Those problems have only become more acute. They have lost a lot of people. And, as important, they have lost a lot of important military gear. So, the numbers of tanks that they have lost, the numbers of armored personnel carriers, pretty staggering numbers. As important, the numbers of precision-guided munitions that they have rifle through in this endeavor is striking. But they won't be able to reproduce those munitions very quickly, because there are trade restrictions on their -- that prevent them from rapidly gaining microchips and other things that are required to produce these kinds of munitions. And so it may take years for them to restock that inventory up to the point that they were before they started this conflict. We have seen them struggle with having enough munitions to fight the way that they want to fight. So they're reaching out to Iran. They're reaching out to North Korea. I do think that those countries will probably provide them some capability. And so, for that reason, I don't think this will be over anytime soon. Our goal, our requirement is to make sure that we continue to provide Ukraine with the means to do what's necessary to prosecute their campaign. And so they have to continue to keep the pressure on the Russians going forward. And I think, a winter fight favors the Ukrainians. We have pushed enormous amounts of winter gear into Ukraine, thanks to countries like Canada and others who have really been very, very generous. Russia, on the other hand, I mean, they're fighting in a foreign country. The Ukrainians have challenged their supply lines. It will be difficult for them to get the kinds of gear into their troops that they need to be able to fight effectively. And so I think the Ukrainians will have the upper hand in this fight, as they have right now, but that they will continue to maintain that upper hand going into the winter, just like we saw them operate in February of last year. They know the -- they know the land. They can -- they can pull things from the local communities. And they will be prepared for this -- for this winter weather. And I don't think the Russians will be as prepared, and they will continue to struggle to get things into their troops using the supply lines that they currently have. And the Russians -- Ukrainians will continue to pressure those supply lines.",
