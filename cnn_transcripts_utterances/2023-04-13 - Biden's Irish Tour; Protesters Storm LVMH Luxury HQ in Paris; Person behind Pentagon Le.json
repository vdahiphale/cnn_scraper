Misneach barked when the president was there, got called out by the Irish president, Michael Higgins, called out to come and meet President Joe Biden. Look, this is really a visit that is a lot about President Biden being able to come to visit family, a lot about President Biden exploring and reinvigorating his family roots and ties and connections to Ireland. But it will also be when he arrives here at the (INAUDIBLE) parliament, where he'll speak to both houses of parliament together, a chance to really elaborate and expand on the importance of the relationship between Ireland and the United States, that they see eye-to-eye on so many things, democratic values, not least among them. Over Ukraine, over climate, over so many issues, peacekeeping that both countries do a lot of around the world. That also, we understand, will be will be part of the discussions the president's been having today. Perhaps we'll hear some of that in his speech. But it will also reflect back where, we're told to expect on his trip to Northern Ireland, where he, again, was asked today, the importance that he felt of his trip there, the 25 year -- celebrating 25 years of the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. And again, he reiterated what he said, that he believes that, in building on that piece, you need to uphold and get back to business on one of those central pieces of the Good Friday agreement achieved and that is a power sharing government. So that was his message in the North. And I think we'll hear some of that echoed today because, of course, Ireland very much engaged in that process north of the border, trying to encourage and do what it can to facilitate in ways that it can and influence where it can to make sure that that happens. So a lot for the president actually to talk about in detail here. But as you say, this is, really early in the day at least, relatively light duty; this afternoon's speech a little bit more to the to the big meat of his visit south of the border here.",

Ahead of that, the judge sanctioned FOX attorneys for withholding evidence from Dominion and said he'd appoint a special master to determine if FOX deliberately hid key evidence. This trial stems from FOX's demotion of debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. FOX denies any wrongdoing.

Garbage workers are on strike. And the unions say they will not stop until president Emmanuel Macron's pension reform law is withdrawn. Let's get you Fred Pleitgen. He joins us live from Paris.

Any minute now he's expected to address Ireland's parliament. We will bring you that as soon as it starts. Before meeting with two Irish leaders earlier, Mr. Biden told reporters that being back home in Ireland feels like, well, being back home. On Friday, he is set to visit County Mayo and the town of Ballina, where his great-great-great-grandfather came from. Our very own Donie O'Sullivan is there and he joins us live. What's the atmosphere there ahead of the U.S. President's visit, Donie? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN TECH CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of excitement here, Becky. As you say, this is a sort of homecoming for Joe Biden. He is going to deliver a speech tomorrow night just outside the church here behind me. And there's already a lot of excitement and anticipation building on the keys of the river here. He'll, as you mentioned, he is about to address any minute now a joint sitting of the Irish parliament in Dublin. Tonight he will be attending a state banquet at Dublin Castle and then tomorrow he will travel across the country to here, to County Mayo on Ireland's west coast on the Atlantic Coast. And he's going to learn -- he's actually going to visit a heritage center here, learn about his family history. His, as you mentioned, great-great- great-grandfather left from this town in the 19th century, soon after the Irish potato famine. He's also going to visit Knock Shrine, which is a Roman Catholic pilgrimage site, here since the 19th century. And then, of course, the big event tomorrow night, along with some musical acts, he will be appearing here in Ballina.",

O'SULLIVAN:  Yes, and, you know, despite whatever his approval ratings might be in the United States, people here saying, you know, if the U.S. President wants to feel popular, they should come visit Ireland. President Kennedy started this tradition. He was, of course, the United States' first Catholic president. He came here 60 years ago this year, actually, and traced his family roots. And since then we have seen multiple U.S. Presidents -- Reagan; Nixon came back as well. And also, of course, Obama about 10 years ago, tracing their roots. So you're right. It's a totally -- this kind of mutual love affair between U.S. Presidents and Ireland. Of course, so much Irish immigration to United States over the centuries. And last night we were on the east coast of Ireland in County Louth in a town called Dundalk. Thousands of people there in the wet and rain, wet rain and wind, lined up for hours just to get a glimpse of the president. So big welcome here for Biden.",

Twelfth day of protests; the council debating this bill will meet tomorrow. So many demonstrators feel rightly perhaps that these are the sort of dying embers of their opportunity to protest.

Paris believes already reporting some arrests have been carried out. We've seen tear gas being used toward the front of the march flying at the police, who have heavily mobilized at least 4,000 police officers on the streets in Paris today. They are taking part in riot gear, using tear gas to disperse the crowd. This is expected to carry on for a couple more hours (INAUDIBLE) and there could be further violence and tension later on today, of course everyone focusing on the decision tomorrow to be taken by the constitutional council on the legality of this legislation.",
