I'm Boris Sanchez in Washington, D.C. with John Berman on the ground in Maine where an urgent manhunt is underway for the suspect in two mass shootings. And CNN just learned the name of one of the 18 people gunned down in that rampage.Tricia Asselin was a 53-year-old mother who worked at the Just-in-Time bowling alley, according to her brother. That's one of the two locations where gunfire broke out. The other was a bar and grill, just a few miles away, about a 10-minute drive. Police say 13 other people were wounded, and hospital officials say three of them are in critical condition. John?",

Hundreds of officers, state and federal, on the hunt for this alleged mass murderer, 40-year-old Robert Card. His family has urged Card to surrender. That is according to his brother. But that man has now been on the run for some 18 hours now, which has really shut down much of the areaEveryday life very much different today, as residents have been directed to shelter in place, secure your homes, secure your cars, is what officials are saying. And that order was just extended in the last hour. Now, this man, Card, Robert Card, is an Army reservist. Sources do say he was committed to a military hospital for a few weeks this past summer.

They'll go as a team. We've seen tractors when they're going into the woods. And then they're - they have other officers, some from the Lisbon Police Department, some from outside law enforcement, they go out.It's a small convoy of probably five or six vehicles. They go out together. There's also an ambulance, just in case if someone gets hurt. They have an ambulance attached to the convoy, and then they go out. And where they're exactly going, it's been all different locations. We were talking in the woods, then we were told back here it may be a building. We're starting to get to know the cops here. This is about - this is a police department of about 17. We've been out here since about 5 AM, so they're starting to get to know us. And so we're sort of showing up, and they're like, oh, you can't be here. But we've seen the activity certainly pick up. But there is not this sort of sense of urgency that you would see in other manhunts. I've been at other locations when there's been manhunts, it's not like that. This is more subdued. It's calm. It's very methodical. It almost seems like they know what they're looking for and what location and when to go. Yes, they get 911 calls. They get calls. People are worried that they hear something or that they see something and so they call, and the police are taking everything seriously and they go. But you're not seeing sort of this everyone's running and gunning and like this sort of urgency here. Things are calm.",

Pamela Brown, thank you very much.Again, the news there, part of it, he was committed for mental health reasons for two weeks over the summer after reporting hearing voices and threatening to kill people at a National Guard base. But after a couple weeks, was then released. Joining me now, CNN Law Enforcement Contributor and retired FBI supervisory special agent, Steve Moore. And Steve, I want to focus first on this manhunt here. What do you see as the threat to this community where I'm standing right now, where they have issued this shelter in place and told people to secure their homes and secure their vehicles? What's the biggest threat? STEVE MOORE, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRIBUTOR:          The biggest threat right now, what - from what I would see is, number one, maybe he has a desire to inflict more casualties. We don't know what the voices in his head were telling him. Otherwise, the other threat would be he has certain needs as a human being at this point. He needs shelter. He needs food. He needs water. If he planned this out carefully, he will have a supply of food and water for a while and may not need shelter. But if he hasn't planned it out, he's going to go looking for food and water and potentially shelter. That you get from population, from people, from buildings. And so he may attempt to get into buildings. He may attempt to get into homes. It's potentially the reality that he could have already done it. In cases before, we've seen that people locked down, police go around, check doors, make sure everything's closed. And the suspect has already gotten into a house and is holding people hostage. So that's one small possibility, but it is a possibility. The other is that he's going to go door knocking pretty soon and try to get his stuff. So I would say that this is a very significant concern.",

      "sentences": "Well, I've got some experience with that from my time on SWAT back when my hair was darker. What you do is try to figure out a plan on how you're going to eliminate certain areas of the perimeter that you're searching.I mean, if you went in and searched, say, this - an area the size of a football field and then left, that is no longer searched anymore. He could have come right back into where you were. So you not only have to search an area, you have to secure it after you've searched it, which means you're just using up people and the manpower requirements for this are just incredible. The other thing is these searches have to go at a pretty slow pace because - I mean, think about it: he's trained, he's a marksman and he has a long rifle. So the searchers are going to go in and no matter how good the searchers are, the person who is being searched for will see them before they see him. And so you have to provide a search pattern where there's crossing fire, protective fire in case they're attacked, and you have to determine a search pattern: are you going to search in grids, are you going to search in a big circle and move the perimeter in or are you just going to search an area when you get a 911 call. These are all hard decisions that are made at the command post level.",

But what the police are going to do, what authorities are going to do, while they're doing these searches locally, they're going to go to his social media, to his personal devices that he left behind and they're going to search his car to determine, did he have MREs in there, did he have equipment to help him camp, is there evidence that he took anything out of the back.That'll help them determine whether he is hunkering down in the area or whether he used that as just a place to pick up another vehicle and get moving faster.",

So they're still processing evidence here at this bowling alley. What we can tell you also is about the timeline of the calls that came in, the 911 calls that came in last night, just after the shooting took place. The first shooting scene was here, right behind me and the first 911 calls came in at 6:56 PM Eastern Time from this location about an active shooter. Then at 7:08 PM Eastern Time, just 12 minutes later, that's when the 911 calls came in from your location, John, the Schemengees Bar area of an active shooter there. So just 12 minutes elapsed between the 911 calls from this location and the 911 calls from the second location. We do have an account of a witness who was here at the bowling alley when the shooter came in. Here's what the witness had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
