      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, a terrible tragedy in Greece after a passenger train collides head on with a freight train. The latest details in just a moment.A new president elected in Nigeria, as Bola Ahmed Tinubusu -- Tinubu, rather, is declared the winner. But there are already calls for another vote amid corruption claims. And delicate and life-threatening work on Ukraine's eastern front. A close up look at a team clearing mines left by Russian forces. This hour, rescue workers are desperately searching the wreckage of a train collision in central Greece, hoping to find survivors. Fire officials say at least 36 people were killed when the two trains collided on Tuesday night. State media reports a passenger train switched to a cargo track before colliding with a freight train. Officials say the passenger train was carrying more than 350 people. One passenger described the utter chaos after the collision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STERGIOS MINENIS, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translation): We heard a big bang, it was 10 nightmarish seconds. We were turning over in the wagon until we fell on our sides and until the commotion stopped. Then there was panic. Cables everywhere. Fire. The fire was immediate. As we were turning over, we were being burned. Fire was right and left. There was panic. For 10, 15 seconds, it was chaos. Tumbling over, fires, cables hanging, broken windows, people screaming, people trapped. It was 2 meters high from where we jumped to leave. And beneath there were broken iron debris. But what could we do? (END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: Greece's Prime Minister visited the scene of the crash earlier. The government has declared three days of mourning for the crash victims. Elinda Labropoulou is following the story for us. She joins us from Athens. Obviously, the details coming out from this are horrendous and awful stories, but also the big question about how this was allowed to happen.",

Ukraine's President says Bakhmut presents the most difficult challenge across the front lines. More than 4,000 civilians are said to be still in Bakhmut, including dozens of children. One of President Zelenskyy's advisers tells CNN Ukraine's military will weigh all options, including strategically pulling back if needed. But a military official stresses that that decision has not been made yet. Alex Marquardt is in eastern Ukraine. Alex?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, there is fierce fighting up and down this eastern front and nowhere more so than in and around the city of Bakhmut. As you noted, President Zelenskyy is saying that this is the toughest fight in the country so far.He says that Ukrainian defenses in and around the city are getting absolutely pummeled by Russian forces. He does note that Russia is sending its forces forward with little concern for their wellbeing and that they are suffering a huge number of casualties. We do know of course Ukraine is suffering losses as well. The question now is whether Ukraine will pull out of the city. They do appear to be on their heels. That spokesperson for the Ukrainian military here in eastern Ukraine saying that so far, no decision has been made. But it is clearly something they are considering as this fighting gets tougher and tougher. Russian forces, primarily made up of experienced Wagner fighters according to that same spokesperson pushing towards and around the city. They appear to be trying to encircle it. They claim to have taken territory north of the city. Now CNN did speak with a Ukrainian fighter in the city yesterday who said that despite what Ukrainian officials are saying, the bleak picture that they are painting, that the actual reality is 100 percent worse than that. Now, in terms of context, Max, this is a consequential battle. It would be hugely symbolic for Russia in terms of a victory if they were able to take it. Ukraine now trying to make sure that it is not more of a strategic victory if Russia takes it. They are trying to fortify their defenses west of the city, digging in there west of the city. And they are trying to weaken that Russian force as much as possible in this fight in Bakhmut so that they wouldn't be able to advance much farther beyond that if they are able to take this city. At the same time, Max, we know that Ukraine is planning for a counter offensive at some point in the near future. When and where exactly that will happen? That remains to be seen. Max? FOSTER: Alex, in Ukraine, thank you. Africa's largest democracy has a new elected leader following its highly disputed presidential election. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria's ruling party candidate, was declared the winner on Wednesday. In his acceptance speech, he appealed to his political rivals to work with him. On Tuesday, opposition leaders called for a new election, claiming the vote was rigged. CNN's Larry Madowo joins me live from Lagos. What do the public think?",

He used to be governor of Lagos, and he will apply the same experience to running the country.But there are also many young people, especially, who are heartbroken by the loss of Peter Obi, who came in third, only 24 percent of the vote. He was seen as a promise, a fresh start for Nigeria, and he didn't have the same baggage that the other politicians had. And so that's the mixed picture that we see in the election today. But the opposition leaders, three main opposition parties walked out of that process. They say that this process was filled with fraud and they cannot endorse what happened. They've calls for a fresh election and a resignation of the chair of Electoral Commission. But for Bola Tinubu, who will now be the next president of Nigeria, he's been reaching out his opponents.

His family had flown over from the United States for the funeral. A very emotional moment for them. Many, many people at this funeral. Take a listen to what his mother had to say.

But this incident near Jericho, it is a very unusual incident for that area, because typically in years past, this route that Elan Ganeles was driving on is usually pretty quiet, and tourists often use it to reach tourist locations like the Dead Sea.But in the recent weeks and months of this violence, the cycle of violence that we've been seeing, that area has started to become a hotspot for violence. A few weeks ago, the Israeli military carried out a raid in Jericho that killed five Palestinians. And then there was another attempted shooting attack, actually at a restaurant not far away from Jericho where nobody was injured because the Israeli authorities say the gun jammed for the attackers. But then we see this attack along the road, the attacker shooting actually at several cars that were passing by. But only Elan Ganeles was shot and injured in this way. Obviously, a very concerning time here as this cycle of violence seemingly just continues with no end. Max?",

It's thought this fatal train collision is one of the worst in the country's history.Greek media are reporting that the passenger and freight trains were traveling on the same track for quite some time when they crashed head on at high speed. The collision occurred when the passenger train came out of a tunnel. Reuters reports Greece's aging railway system is in need of modernizing. People that have been there can probably testify to that. But Eleni Giokos joins us now with a closer look at what may have caused the train wreck. You know the country, but how do two trains end up on the same track for a long period of time, it looks like, without anyone seeing a collision happening?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So many questions, right? I've been watching Greek media all day, seeing the analysis, seeing experts trying to figure out how this could have happened. So let's just start from the beginning. You have two trains, one freight, one passenger coming from opposite directions and then colliding.So then you've got to ask the question, the electronic indicators that should have kicked into notice that there is another head on train coming in another direction, those didn't get activated. The station master would have perhaps had this information to their disposal. Was it human error? Was it a technical fault? And a lot of the analysis that I've been hearing, and even from experts saying there is an electronic key that then changes the direction of a train onto another track, and that seems to have happened. Usually it is done by someone, by a person. So, you know, the question then becomes, is it a human error? The other thing that we've been hearing is -- and many questions surrounding this and frankly, people weighing in going, well, the Greek railway system has actually not been maintained properly, has not been upgraded. There have been systems that haven't been working for perhaps over a decade. A lot of questions surrounding this. So big investigation around this. The Prime Minister just visited the site, saying that they will leave no efforts unturned to ensure that they figure out what happens so that it doesn't happen again. But in the meantime, there is major shock that this occurred on a very popular route and usually carrying university students from Athens into Thessaloniki and many questions surrounding how this possibly could have happened. Another thing that is really interesting here, Max, is just the sheer shock of this within Greece. People are calling it the death train. And, frankly, the fact that there were no warning signs that the trains were traveling at high speed. There was no slowing down of the train at least according to initial reports. We actually heard from the mayor of Tempi, which is just a small town outside of Larissa, saying that he arrived on the scene. He saw young university students in absolute shock, many of them injured with shrapnel, confused, not sure what happened. The passengers are saying some of them feltlike an earthquake had occurred when impacts happened. And then the people outside of the hospital saying they're waiting for their loved ones to be identified. Police and health officials saying that they have to use DNA testing because that fire that erupted in the first two carriages was that intense, causing severe injuries.",

Ukrainian teams are risking their lives to diffuse mines and traps left behind by Russian forces. CNN follows one such team when we return.

CNN's Alex Marquardt follows one team trying to clear the ground in eastern Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (voice-over): The hulking armored mine-clearer lurches into an open field. Over 40 tons, it spews exhaust, its tracks struggling across the muddy ground. Following close behind, the mine-clearance team called sappers. They advanced deliberately on the hunt for deadly explosives. This is delicate work. (on-camera): This was a Russian position, Russian trenches. And now these guys are working through here carefully methodically looking for mines, for booby traps and even Ukrainian ordinance that was fired at the Russians who were here. (voice-over): Last September, a Ukrainian counter offensive pushed the Russians out of these trenches. Now Colonel Maksim Melnyk's team has been charged with clearing any explosives. They have left many traps behind and many of our brothers, our sappers have died, Melnyk says. Russia doesn't obey international conventions. They put mines on top of mines, leave booby traps and use banned mines. Russian and Ukrainian mines are scattered throughout the Eastern Front, making Ukraine one of the biggest minefields in the world. Rockets and other explosives can often fail to detonate when they land, too. All of it posing immense danger to civilians. The sappers of Ukraine's DS&amp;S emergency service like Eduard Herasimenko, who is a father of a 10-year-old daughter are keenly aware of the danger. It's dangerous for everybody, he says. I wouldn't say we take more risks than others, everybody is taking risks now. Herasimenko was demining before the war started seeing what Russia has done to his country infuriates him. They are just animals, he says. There's no other way to describe them. He finds and carries an unexploded rocket propelled grenade to the side. Working day after day all across this country, deminers know how much they still have left to do. (on-camera): After the war, the soldiers get to go home but your work will continue for years. We will keep working for decades, Colonel Melnyk says. This will go on for decades. Alex Marquardt, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine.
