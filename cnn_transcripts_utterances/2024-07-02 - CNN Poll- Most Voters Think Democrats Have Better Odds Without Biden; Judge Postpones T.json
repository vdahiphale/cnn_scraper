Jerome Powell saying today that the last two inflation readingssuggests the economy is \"getting back on a deflationary path.\" Those are the markets and these are your main events. In a new CNN poll, the majority of US voters say Democrats, would have a better shot keeping the White House with someone other than Joe Biden. More than 200 candidates in France reportedly withdraw from the second round of voting. They are trying to tilt the contest against the far-right. And people were thrown from the seats and hit the roof. Passengers described severe turbulence that injured 30 on Air Europa flight. Live from New York. It is Tuesday, July 2nd. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening, tonight for the first time, a sitting Democratic lawmaker is now calling on US President Joe Biden to drop his re-election bid. Now, the announcement from Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett coming after the president's disastrous performance at last week's CNN debate. Now, his decision, a reflection apparently of the growing panic among Democrats as a string of new polls showed just how much the president's support has slipped in the recent days. Now, the latest one, a CNN poll, showing most voters believe Democrats have a better chance of keeping the White House if Biden is not the nominee. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has spent the past few days defending the president, admitted that questions about his health are legitimate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Now again, I think it is a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition? And so when people ask that question, it is completely legitimate of both candidates. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All of our reporting indicates that he has not only not reached out to some of these democrats directly, like former Speaker Pelosi or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, or others, he is largely insulated here. But we do know that they will be again, having that interview on Friday with George Stephanopoulos. It is hard to pick someone who is more credible, more rigorous than George Stephanopoulos. So he will be on the campaign trail with them on Friday. The president will be going to Wisconsin on Friday. He will be going to Pennsylvania on Sunday. So now he has to prove that he is up to this job of running for president and indeed serving for president, but the answers from his aides and whatnot have been lacking without a doubt. So they've really not only gone backwards in terms of getting beyond the age question, but actually opened up so many, many more questions about his fitness, but it is certainly, it is only Tuesday. I think more Democrats likely will come forward here. They are worried about their own races. They are worried about his impact on the ballot.

We do not know that Democrats by and large across the board could suffer the same fate as President Biden. We don't know exactly what will happen on the Trump side of things. One thing we do know, we have an unsteady president. We have a president who has to prove his ability to serve and run for office. And so far, the burden is now on him to do that. It is interesting, his campaign is much stronger than his candidacy is himself, so the questions are being asked, if not him, who? And that has been one of the things that have sort of slowed all this down.

Now, as I was just saying with Jeff, the limits of presidential immunity are being put to the test just one day after that landmark decision by the US Supreme Court. The judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money case has postponed the sentencing after the former president's lawyers challenged the conviction. Now, Trump's team cited the Supreme Court ruling, which gives presidents immunity from prosecution for core official acts. Zachary Cohen is in Washington now on what is a really complicated story, given the fact that now Trump's legal team feel that they have a new basis on which to even protest against this conviction.

It is a pretty remarkable delay in that case and the one case that has gone to trial before the 2024 election. And look, it is a direct result, this delay of the Supreme Court's ruling on immunity. Trump's attorneys are arguing that that immunity outlined by the Supreme Court for those official acts that the Supreme Court ruled, Trump was immune from prosecution for taking part in, that those could apply and result in his conviction being set aside in New York and the judge agreed to hear them out on that. They are going to file their memo outlining their case as to why the conviction should be set aside next week instead of a sentencing, then the DA's Office in Manhattan will have a chance to respond. Ultimately, Judge Merchan writing in a letter today that he will impose that sentence on September 18th. This is an important caveat. He also adds: \"If such is still necessary,\" speaking about a sentence.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (voice-over): Protesters back on the streets in Nairobi for a third straight week, braving tear gas, flash bangs and what they say a live round. Activists bringing empty caskets to the streets, symbolizing those killed since the protests began. Dozens according to human rights groups. The deaths fueling the anger here. Are you scared to be out here protesting when there are people getting killed, peaceful protests were getting killed?",

Yet the overwhelming fear is that no matter how loudly this generation speaks, the government is not listening. (END VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (on-camera): Paula, these protests are bad for business. If this is supposed to be a busy street, supposed to be rush hour, and it's empty here. There's so many businesses that are suffering from these, and especially when you see some looters now, some vandals taking advantage of the situation to damage businesses and that plays into President Ruto's criticism that there are some criminals taking advantage of legitimate protests -- Paula.",

Passengers described people but being thrown from their seats and hitting the ceiling. Video from social media appears to show one person being helped down from an overhead bin, if you can imagine. A similar incident took place aboard a Singapore Airlines flight a little more than a month ago. More than 70 people on that flight were hurt and one died of a suspected heart attack. Some scientists have linked a warming planet to certain types of turbulence. Paul Williams is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, and we are happy to have you with us as all of us look at these incidents and quite frankly are getting a bit nervous. I mean, you were involved in a study in 2017 that found that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere could cause light turbulence to increase almost 60 percent. Moderate, not so much really inconsequential. But moderate to severe turbulence you're saying would more than double at least from that study. What do you say now, given all the evidence that you're reviewing?",

So we havethe jet streams, of course, which blow from west to east across North America, across the North Atlantic, Europe, all the way around the world, in fact. And in the jet streams, you have a separation of air masses, if you like, between cold air to the north, with the northern hemisphere jet stream, and warmer air to the south. And what climate change is doing is that at flight cruising altitudes, it's actually warming the warm air to the south of the jet stream more than the colder air to the north. So that temperature difference in these clash of air masses that drives the jet stream is getting stronger and that's driving a more sheared jet stream. So that what we call the wind shear in the jet stream has already increased by 15 percent since satellites first began observing it, and it is essentially wind share that generates clear air turbulence. So that's the link there, from temperatures to winds to turbulence.",

And we know that for every three patches ofsevere turbulence over the North Atlantic today, one of those three is there because of climate change, the climate change that has happened since 1979. The other two would have been there anyway. And in future we could see two in every three there because of climate change. So clearly we have to do something. All I'm saying, and I have to emphasize this, is that there's more turbulence in the atmosphere. That doesn't necessarily mean there's more turbulence on flights because we're actually getting better all the time at avoiding turbulence through better turbulence forecasts, the aircraft designs are better now, they have a better dynamic response to turbulence. And there's actually a kind of technology that's a little bit experimental right now called lidar, which involves shining a laser out of the front of the aircraft. And in fact, it can get reflected back, that laser light, by invisible turbulence ahead. This could be a game changer if it gets rolled out. And it's currently a bit too expensive and a bit -- it's a big, heavy box which no one really wants in the nose cone of an aircraft. But as the technology gets miniaturized and the cost comes down, maybe in future we'll see it rolled out and that could really revolutionize clear air turbulence. There'll be no excuse for really any aircraft ever encountering it again. So quite some excitement there if this technology miniaturizes and the cost comes down in future.",
