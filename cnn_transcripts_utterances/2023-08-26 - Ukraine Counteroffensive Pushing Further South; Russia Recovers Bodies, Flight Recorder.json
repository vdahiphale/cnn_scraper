(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Shocked, if not surprised, supporters of Russia's Wagner mercenary leader, have been paying their respects, laying flowers and lighting candles at makeshift memorials across the country. For all his violent and foul mouthed outbursts, often critical of Russia's military leadership, Yevgeny Prigozhin struck a chord.

The organization's known for its cruelty. And this hammer here, it's very heavy. Pick it up. It's got Wagner written on it. Look, it's become a potent symbol of just how ruthless Wagner was, because it was with a tool like this that they executed someone they regarded as a traitor and they filmed it happening absolutely gruesome. But that video consolidated Wagner's image as a ruthless, hyper violent organization that would do anything to protect the motherland. CHANCE (voice-over): Even staged that dramatic uprising in June, marching troops toward Moscow in the biggest challenge to Kremlin authority for decades. Many Russians suspect Prigozhin's presumed death in this plane crash was cold-hearted revenge. But the Kremlin denies involvement. And few Russians dare say otherwise, at least publicly.

And this has been the case since he basically dismantled electoral mechanisms nearly 20 years ago in 2004. So for nearly 20 years, Russia has been staging something that they call elections but is not actually an election. But it always serves to both as an excuse to crack down and as a kind of source of anxiety for the ruling party, for Putin himself, which, is itself, an excuse to crack down. So everything adds up to additional crackdowns. I also wouldn't be surprised, if the plane crash in which Prigozhin apparently died, is also used as a pretext for further crackdown because it is quite likely that Russia is going to blame terrorists, possibly Chechens, possibly even liberals, possibly everyone at the same time for this plane crash and for Prigozhin's death and use that as a pretext for further crackdowns.",

This is a beautiful forest now turned into coal and dust and ash and air that's barely breathable. This is known as the lungs of Athens.This is what it's supposed to look like, virgin forest untouched and absolutely beautifully green. This forest would help regulate temperatures in Athens and clean the air. We've seen fires raging across the mountain since Tuesday afternoon, heroic efforts by the men and the women on the ground, working relentlessly nonstop with very little sleep. We've also heard many helicopters and airplanes towering above us all day long, trying to put out the blazes. Now in terms of the overall destruction, the E.U. is estimating that it's about 1.3 billion square meters but the Greek government says it's too early to quantify the actual damage. This is for the whole of Greece. Now in terms of one of the biggest fires in Alexandroupolis in the Evros region, it's estimated that 73,000 hectares have been damaged. There 19 people lost their lives. The Greek government have also arrested 79 people for potential cases of arson. In terms of short-term and long-term concerns, when you see a forest like this going up in flames, flooding and landslides, longer-term effects, warming temperatures, a much hotter city for Athenians and tourists alike -- Eleni Giokos, CNN, Parnitha, Athens, Greece.

Ecuadorians have voted to stop oil drilling in a major national park, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. And parts of the Amazon rain forest. The Ecuadorian state oil company has been drilling since 2016, producing tens of thousands of barrels a day. Rafael Romo is in Ecuador with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over): Yasuni National Park, Ecuador, a sprawling 2. 5 million acres or 1 million hectares in the Amazon rain forest, a UNESCO biosphere reserve. One of the most biodiverse places on Earth as well as Indigenous tribes living in voluntary isolation. But Yasuni is also an area rich in oil, especially one section of the park known as block 43, with revenue earning potential the government wanted to control. It was an environmental dilemma for an oil producing country, the dilemma voters faced in last Sunday's vote. In the end, nearly six out of every 10 voters chose to protect the Yasuni. \"We have saved the greatest biodiversity that has been recognized, nationally and internationally,\" the leader of the Indigenous community said. In 2007, then president Rafael Correa, proposed the international community give Ecuador $3.6 billion to leave the Yasuni undisturbed but the plan failed. In 2016, the Ecuadorian state oil company began drilling in block 43, an area that is only 0.01 percent of the national park but produces more than 55,000 barrels a day or 12 percent of Ecuador's total production. Over the last decade, environmental groups pushed for a referendum to protect the Yasuni, collecting signatures to comply with legal requirements.",

That paved the way for the referendum that the Yasunios, an environmental group, have been calling for.The group says that the oil must be kept underground and the Amazon rainforest untouched. ROMO (voice-over): Celebrities joined their cause, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who called the Yasuni \"a global biodiversity hot spot.\" \"The people and wildlife living here are threatened by the fossil fuel industry,\" he added. Ecuadorian energy minister Fernando Santos said earlier this month that depriving his country of the funding generated would be, quote, \"catastrophic.\" He estimates Ecuador could lose $1.2 billion a year in revenue, assuming a price of $60 per barrel. The energy minister said oil in the Yasuni could last another 25 years. Some voters agreed that Ecuador should continue tapping its largest oil reserve. \"Ecuador needs those resources to make ends meet,\" this voter said. But most were convinced by environmentalists, who say preserving the Amazon is more important than any money that could be made, like drilling in one of the richest ecosystems in the planet -- Rafael Romo, CNN, Quito, Ecuador.

The United Nations' next climate change conference, called COP28, doesnot start until November but with severe weather events everywhere, world leaders are already making plans to deal with the climate crisis. Becky Anderson has a preview. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST (voice-over): Big occult (ph) flooding, wildfires spreading a mile a minute and heat waves testing the limits of survivability, these are the new realities the world faces as we come to grips with the climate crisis. We are now just under 100 days away from the next United Nations climate conference. COP28 will kick off in Dubai in the UAE on November 30th, joining world leaders from nearly 200 countries and crucial negotiations. The UAE and the United Nations have laid out four key priorities: fast tracking the energy transition, focusing on lives and livelihoods, inclusivity and fixing climate finance. MAJID AL SUWAIDI, DIRECTOR GENERAL, COP28: We have been traveling around the world, engaging with many different stakeholders, talking about what are the challenges they face. And it comes down to a desire to take action. But in many cases that means we need to provide the finances for them to do so. Particularly in the developing world, where they are trying to grapple with development challenges, we need to make sure that finances made more available, more accessible and, importantly, more affordable. ANDERSON (voice-over): According to the International Energy Agency, annual investments in clean energy for developing economies need to more than triple in order to prevent the Earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Developing economies account for more than 80 percent of the world's population but less than half of the investments in clean energy are going to those countries. Back in 2009, richer countries promised to reach $100 billion in funding per year by the year 2020 for poorer nations to support climate actions. That goal has not been reached.",

They do believe that the lawyers in their legal maneuvering will be able to delay these trials. But they are not entirely positive that is the case, particularly as these dates start to mount up. I will show you what the calendar is now as it stands. These dates are subject to change. But October 23rd, 2023, is the proposed trial date for Georgia.

March 5th, Super Tuesday; the 25th, Stormy Daniels hush money trial. This gives you an idea why exactly they are having these kinds of conversations. When they talk about this, one thing they hope for is making this a media spectacle and capitalizing on it. That's something former president Trump is good at doing. They were happy with how the coverage went on Thursday. They felt they dominated the airwaves and sucked the life out of many of the other candidates, even though they were having their republican primary debate the day before. They talked about how former president Trump's good on capitalizing on when he has media attention, showing the fact that yesterday that he was going on Twitter, putting out his mug shot, for the first time since January of 2021. This is something people were speculating about. He is continuing to grasp onto the media narrative. They hope he can do that during these trials, Even though they say that it might help them politically, I have talked to a number of Trump's allies and Republican operatives, who say they believe this endless media coverage, no matter how Trump spins it, is just going to be exhausting for voters. Of course, we are still in these unprecedented times and it's going to be a waiting and seeing game. But right now that is how they are preparing -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
