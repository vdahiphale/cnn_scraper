A federal jury found Hunter Biden, President Biden's only surviving son guilty on three felony gun charges. It's a historic first-ever conviction of a sitting president's child. Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000 at sentencing. However, he likely will receive far less than the maximum as a first-time offender. Special counsel, David Weiss and prosecutors held a news conference in the past hour. Here is part of their reaction to the jury's verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to just walk through the grounds for appeal that we know that Hunter Biden, his legal team will now be focused on because it is debatable and we have already spent much time on this network leading up to this decision from the jury to debate the merits of bringing this case to trial. That having been said, even what we heard from the jurors who were reluctant or felt emotional or sympathy for Hunter felt that they were following the guidelines they were given, and that in fact, the prosecution laid out a strong case. Is it possible in the appellate portion of this, in the appeals portion to bring forward the argument that this case perhaps should not have been brought or wouldn't have been brought if it was anyone else other than the president's son?",

In that case, they held that gun prosecutions that are based on criteria that were not present when the Second Amendment that regulates the right to bear arms was adopted in the 19th century add-ons, more recent add-ons like conditioning gun ownership on drug usage are not constitutional. Abbe Lowell, Hunter's very capable defense lawyer, who helped deliver that initial 6-6 split that we heard about, he's already tried to get the appellate courts to focus on these constitutional infirmities. So, for sure, that's going to be one area where we're going to see battle done on appeal in this case.

Well, for political insight, we now turn to CNN presidential historian and former director of the Nixon Presidential Library, Tim Naftali, who joins us live from New York. I want to follow up on what we just heard, Tim, from Norm Eisen, where he said -- what we heard from President Biden is support and an embrace of the American idea of the rule of law.

Tim Naftali, thank you so much. Well, in just moments from now, President Biden is scheduled to give a speech on gun safety in Washington. It's an annual conference of a group advocating for tighter gun control. President Biden is expected to highlight his administration's efforts to curb gun violence. As we're waiting for the president to speak, I want to bring in our senior White House correspondent, Kevin Liptak. Kevin, what are we expecting to hear from the president? Obviously, it's not lost on anyone given the subject matter at hand, gun violence and as that relates to his presidency -- his son's conviction today.

For one, it's somewhat awkwardpolitical timing, this is a fluke of scheduling, but the president will be speaking under the event devoted to talking about curbing gun violence, but he is also just more generally been reluctant to talk about this case in public at all. It's obviously a very sensitive case for him, very painful moments that unearthed in that trial over the last week. So, I think that the president is most likely to leave it at the written statement that he put out earlier. We do know that the president has adjusted his schedule for the rest of the afternoon. Originally, he was meant to remain here overnight at the White House before leaving for the G7 tomorrow in Italy. But now, he will go to Wilmington, Delaware, which is of course, where this trial unfolded, but also where his family home is, and he will be there overnight, presumably with Hunter Biden, with Dr. Jill Biden, the first lady, sort of surrounding them and being around them at this very difficult moment as his son is convicted of federal gun crimes. Now, this event that he is going to be speaking at shortly, is for the group, Everytown for Gun Safety, and the president will be wanting to talk about a major reduction in violent crime that the FBI has just put out over the last couple of days, he will be announcing a number of convictions, 500 convictions under this new law that he signed into law a few years ago. And so, the president still wants to focus on his policy even if the subject matter is somewhat awkward, somewhat ironic.",

Hamas has given a response to international mediators about the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza. This is according to a Qatari official. We're expecting a statement from Qatar soon. Now, this news follows a meeting between Qatar's Prime Minister and the leaders of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Let's get more now from Paula Hancocks in Jerusalem, Ben Wedeman is joining us from Beirut. Paula, first to you, as we were hearing and reporting earlier today, it does appear that Prime Minister Netanyahu was more open to this deal, now, we're hearing from Hamas directly.

More discussions are needed though, according to this official, but they do say that it was a positive response. We are expecting more details from a Qatari statement shortly. Now, what we have heard from the Israeli side, I mean, recently, the Biden administration has been pointing out that they were waiting for a Hamas response because Israel had already agreed to this proposal, this three-stage proposal that was on the table. We have not definitively heard that from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but we have heard today with a government statement saying that they would only agree to a ceasefire if certain conditions were met, saying that hostages have to be released, saying that Hamas' government and/or military capabilities have to be destroyed, and that Gaza cannot suppose a threat in the future to Israel. So, on the face of it, it's not exactly the same as that proposal that we have heard really pushed now by the U.S. President Joe Biden, but it's potentially the closest Israel has got at this point to agreeing to this proposal in public. Worth pointing out though, this still isn't from the Prime Minister himself, Benjamin Netanyahu, he's been given some conflicting statements as to whether or not this proposal is one that they would agree to. But certainly, this is why the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been here over recent days, he's still in the region really trying to push this proposal, this ceasefire deal, this hostage deal over the line, because it has been stuttering significantly over recent months.

Basically, this gives an interesting insight if these messages are correct into his mindset, that basically that line you just read would indicate that Hamas is not displeased that Israel is basically bogged down in a quagmire in Gaza. Now for eight months, and they don't really seem to have a way out short of agreeing to a ceasefire. Sinwar also apparently said -- described civilian casualties, which are now -- well, we don't know civilian, but the total number of casualties in Gaza according to the authorities in Gaza is more than 37,000. He said that was a necessary sacrifice. Now, he said this in reference to, for instance, other national liberation struggles, referring specifically to Algeria, where in an eight-year war against the French, as many as 1.5 million people were killed. So, clearly, he sees the struggle of Hamas and the Palestinian people writ-large within the context of that. And now, Blinken today of course, did comment on this story in the \"Wall Street Journal\", and he did say that he doesn't know where Sinwar is, Blinken said he could be ten stories below ground as the people he purports to protect are caught in the crossfire. But he did say want something that I don't think anybody would disagree on, is that the final word on Hamas' position regarding a ceasefire does lie with Yahya Sinwar. Bianna?",

That they were concerned that this was going to become a more regional conflict. And when you consider, you have a number of different countries, of different groups that are involved in this at this point. So, this has been something that the U.S. President Joe Biden has been at pains to publicly declare he wants to prevent, and that's certainly one of the messages that Blinken brought today as well. There have been statements from Israeli officials saying that a decision on what to do when it comes to the northern border, meaning the border with Lebanon, time for decision is close from Israel's point of view. They have tens of thousands of residents that they have evacuated for the past eight months to try and keep them out of the range of rockets, it's certainly the same situation on the other side of the border as well with evacuations. And so, there does appear to be this sense, or at least, a public message from the Israeli side, that the decision day is very close as to what they would do when it comes to that northern border. Obviously, the Biden administration has been very clear that they do not want an increase in military activity when it comes to what Israel could do on that border, because that would certainly widen this conflict. So, at the same time as you say, he was talking to hostage families, he's talking about getting more humanitarian aid into Gaza. He is also looking to that border, Bianna.",

I want to bring in our senior White House correspondent, Kevin Liptak. So, Kevin as expected, no mention from the president on what had happened just hours ago.

The president very enthusiastic in that speech, very energized. I really think the one moment in that speech that really perhaps came closest and perhaps touched the Hunter Biden case, most was when he talked about the death of his own son, at least alluded to it in a vague way, talking about how he identified with parents who had lost their children to gun violence. He said, never give up on hope. And he acknowledged, of course, that that is such a hard thing to go through. And we do know that the addiction that Hunter Biden suffered that was at the center of this case really did start with the death of Beau Biden back in 2015. So, I think if there was any point during that speech, when President Biden would have been thinking about what has occurred in Wilmington, Delaware over the last week and this morning, that was probably it. But otherwise, this speech very energized, very enthusiastic. And certainly, the crowd -- we did see protesters related to the war in Gaza at the very beginning. And President Biden said that there have been innocent children killed, and he tried to tamp down any reaction from within the crowd. But we also saw very supportive interruptions throughout the speech, including at the very end, which, frankly, is not something you see much out of President Biden's speech. Usually, his speeches are fairly stayed -- fairly straightforward. So, this was sort of a setting for him and an environment for him that was, I think, very energizing, I would think. Now, after the speech he is scheduled to head directly back to Wilmington, Delaware. This was a change in his schedule earlier today. He is expected to be with his son, Hunter Biden, along with his wife, Jill Biden, and that large collection of family members who had been attending that trial over the last week or so. President Biden certainly very away that this is a moment to hold his close, to show the world that he supports his son at this very, very difficult moment. But certainly, this speech, the president, a little bit of an awkward timing. It was a fluke of scheduling that had occurred on the very day that his son was convicted of federal firearm charges. But the president keeping with the schedule and keeping with that very clear message that he and his aides really do believe is a political winner, certainly for younger voters, for women voters, they think that this is one of the clearest contrasts that they can paint with Former President Trump and with Republicans.
