      "sentences": "Good to have you with us. And we begin with the global economic uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump's second term in the White House. The U.S. Federal Reserve rattled by the possibility of tariffs that could keep inflation high for the next several years. The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter of a point on Wednesday, as expected, but the Central Bank is now forecasting only two rate cuts next year, instead of four.Fed Chair Jerome Powell says economic growth and the job market look good for next year, but inflation may not come down to two percent until 2027. Now that sent Wall Street into a sell off, the Dow fell more than 1100 points, extending its losing streak to 10 days, the worst since 1974. And financial markets in the Asia Pacific region appear to be following Wall Street's lead. Major indices in Japan, China and South Korea, are all in negative territory. You can see there the numbers. So, I want to bring in CNN's Marc Stewart who joins us live from Beijing. So, Marc, what stands out to you when you look at those numbers? MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, the declines that we have seen across Asia are certainly to be expected when the head of the Federal Reserve warns the future inflation, but the declines in South Korea in particular are very noteworthy. Close to two percent. That's a lot when you look at the financial scheme of things. Perhaps the political uncertainty facing that part of the world with the president there may be contributing. But nonetheless, no nation wants to hear about an inflation problem in the United States persisting even further, because what that really means is the cost of borrowing money is going to cost more. Especially for American consumers, but that could have global ramifications. So, for example, an American family that may be considering buying some electronics that are made in Japan or a car that is made from abroad. Those lending costs, those borrowing costs, are going to cost more. So that could certainly have global implications. And then, as you mentioned, certainly a lot of uncertainty about the new administration with the fiscal policies will be and what trade will look like. Will there be wholesale tariffs, as we have heard from the President-elect? All of those reasons are prompting the Fed chair to remain very cautious. Let's listen to some of his remarks yesterday he made in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Many thanks.Well, he's still a month away from his return to the White House, but Donald Trump is already having a major influence on business in Washington.

[02:05:07] In a social media post, Wednesday, Trump complained about what he called Democrat bills and whistles in the stop gap measure, and he even threatened any Republicans who backed the plan. His Republican allies have also criticized the deal, as well as House Speaker Mike Johnson, who negotiated the plan for giving into what they felt were too many demands from Democrats.

That gives lawmakers less than two days to come up with a new plan, address Trump's demands and somehow keep the government funded into March. Well, as we mentioned, tariffs are a central reason for the economic uncertainty here in the U.S. and around the globe.Donald Trump has promised specific tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico, with more general threats against countries that run afoul of his administration. A new report from the Congressional Budget Office predicts us tariffs plus retaliation from trading partners would be a drag on economic growth. It also says tariffs would make consumer goods and the assets used to produce them more expensive, with lower income households feeling the most impact. And I spoke earlier with Ryan Patel, a Senior Fellow from the Drucker School of Management at Claremont Graduate University.

And at this time, it's a little more broader, Rosemary. You think about, he's talking about India, he's talking about across all kinds of countries. And really, the main question here, it becomes, what does the other countries do back to the U.S. consumer?And that is still unknown. You kind of assume that there's going to be a higher rate of cost of goods sold, which then increases the prices for consumers. Then, to your point, causes it to be more expensive. It causes kind of this ripple effect to other businesses. And I think many of it is, you know, how resilient can be. And so, we've seen from the Trump presidency before that there is this talk that doesn't necessarily -- he's going to come through, how big it can be. So, I'm kind of a wait and see approach, to see how heavy handed will it be, and what kind of concessions are there. Is it a marginal or is it really heavy? To your point, to where, you know, Mexico and Canada are getting a little more nervous. Does that make sense or not? You know, we'll see.",

And so, to me, there was already some uncertainty within the market and investment world when it comes to the Fed alone. You add the policy on top of that. It does provide some filter to that and then maybe Jerome Powell was trying to get ahead of it, but I don't really necessarily think that he was planning to put the two rate cuts because of Trump's policy.

Russian officials have detained a man who allegedly confessed to planting the explosive device that killed Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his aide on Tuesday.CNN's Matthew Chance brings us the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Russian T.V. news that Moscow police have already detained a suspected bomber. This 29-year-old Uzbek citizen arrested in a village outside the capital, has now confessed, according to prosecutors to planting the explosive device that killed Igor Kirillov, one of Russia's top generals and his assistant. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): During interrogation, he explained that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services. Then arrived in Moscow and received an improvised explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance of the apartment building where Igor Kirillov lived. CHANCE (voice-over): Video released by the Russian security services purports to show the suspect setting up a surveillance camera in a car outside. The camera is said to have live streamed the attack to Ukrainian intelligence, which has indeed claimed responsibility for the killing. The suspects then shown on video, possibly under duress, saying he was promised $100,000 and a European passport for in his words, pressing the button. But the bombing on the streets of Moscow is only the latest in a series of assassinations of prominent figures supporting Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting with Darya Dugina, an outspoken advocate of the conflict, and daughter of a pro Kremlin nationalist killed in a car bombing in August 2022. Ukraine denied involvement, but the shooting just last week of Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian missile developer outside Moscow, was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence, according to a CNN source in Kyiv. As was the car bombing in November of Valery Trankovsky, a senior Russian naval officer in Crimea. There have been numerous other killings too, as Ukraine steps up assassinations far from the front lines, cementing a reputation for vengeance. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
