      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Max Foster, if you're just joining us here are today's top stories.So far, U.S. President Joe Biden's trip to Angola has been overshadowed by the announcement that he is granting his son, Hunter, a full and unconditional pardon for his felony convictions. The move has been widely condemned, even by many in his own party, since Biden promised earlier this year that he wouldn't pardon his son. Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi has been released from prison, and that's according to his international legal team. He was arrested in October 2022 for supporting the nationwide protests in Iran that were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini. One of Salehi's lawyers says his release is a time for celebration, but also vigilance. French President Emmanuel Macron is in Saudi Arabia for a three-day state visit. Mr. Macron met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Monday. They called for elections in Lebanon and a de-escalation of conflicts in the Middle East. This is the first state visit to Saudi Arabia by a French president since 2006. An exchange of strikes is testing a shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. On Monday, Lebanese authorities say Israeli strikes killed at least nine people in southern Lebanon, marking the deadliest day since the truce took effect last week. Israel says it's retaliating after Hezbollah fired two projectiles towards Israeli-occupied territory, but the Iran-backed group says it targeted Israeli military positions after days of repeated Israeli strikes. A source with a U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon says Israel has breached the ceasefire agreement approximately 100 times since last week. On the heels of that tenuous truce, there's a renewed push by the Biden administration to try to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer in Washington on Monday. Dermer didn't answer questions as he left the U.S. State Department, but we've learned that during the meeting, Blinken stressed the importance of a ceasefire and a hostage deal and the need for plans for a post-war Gaza. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us in London with the latest. If we could talk about Gaza in a moment, you know, it's not unexpected that this ceasefire with Lebanon may have some edge to it. I mean, people aren't saying it's over yet, but clearly it shows how much distrust there is on both sides.",

We're seeing a real state of insecurity and fear for many of those civilians who had been returning back to their homes in the south, many of them finding their villages completely destroyed.The Israeli government, the Israeli military say that they have been responding specifically towards threats by Hezbollah, that they have been targeting Hezbollah movements in the south and infrastructure. But again, officials and sources familiar with the negotiations tell us that unilateral Israeli military action against Hezbollah is not enshrined in that ceasefire negotiation. So there is expected to be mounting pressure on both sides to uphold their end of the deal. But again, it's very fragile.",
