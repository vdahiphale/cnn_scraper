I'm Eleni Giokos in London.Just ahead, Israel warns the war in Gaza is unlikely to end anytime soon, even as global pressure builds to calm the situation and do more to protect civilian lives in Gaza. Ukraine's bold strike against Russia's Black Sea Fleet coming as it faces potential setbacks in its ground campaign. Plus, a CNN investigation a California man scammed out of more than a million dollars. And it all started with a simple text message, we'll explain. Israel's military chief says the war against Hamas will likely go on for many months. The Israel Defense Forces says it's using ground air and naval troops to strike as what they claim are terror targets in Gaza. And on Tuesday, dozens of its fighter jets struck more than 100 Hamas targets including tunnels shafts and infrastructure, but scores of Palestinians have also been killed. Hamas controlled health ministry says the death toll in the enclave is now nearly 21,000. Though CNN can't independently verify those numbers. Here's a top Israeli military chief describing what lies ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HERZI HALEVI, ISRAEL CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF (through translator): The war will go on for many months. And we will employ different methods to maintain our achievements for a long time. There are no magic solutions. There are no shortcuts in dismantling a terrorist organization, only determined and persistent fighting. And we are very, very determined. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Will Ripley reports from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The terrifying sound of ongoing bombardment, Israeli shells hitting targets. Closer and closer to this U.N. run school in central Gaza. For thousands sheltering, here it's time to move again. Families forced to flee for their lives and this is not the first or even second time for many. Once again, they carry the war torn pieces of their lives in pursuit of elusive safety. Just days earlier, many here vowed they would never move again, never. A vow they are now willing to break, only because they know their children's lives are at stake. OM MOHAMED, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): There is no safety in the school. We are looking for a safer place. I'm leaving because of the intensity of the airstrikes and the suffering. RIPLEY (voice over): Everywhere else is crowded, there's no guarantee you'll find a spot. But what else can they do? Even if they have nowhere else to go, they can't stay here. They don't want to die here. The scene, a grim reminder of what their parents and grandparents endured, in 1948 when Zionist militias forced them out of their hometowns. In the cold winter, blankets and mattresses are precious commodities. Cars and the fuel that run them are scarce. Those who can't afford it hire donkey carts. For the rest, it's a long trek on foot. It's very tough back there, he says. Bombs are falling on people everywhere. People were injured there. We don't know where we're heading. Everywhere is under threat. We're just moving with the rest of the people. The destination for many, relatives homes, a roof over their heads even though they are neighborhoods already devastated by Israeli airstrikes. Street battles raging across Gaza, turning areas north and south of the strip into ghost towns. The scars of battle, raw. [02:05:03] YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We are in a multi-arena war. We are being attacked from seven different sectors, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea, and Samaria, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran. Anyone who acts against us is a potential target. There is no immunity for anyone. RIPLEY (voice over): Iran's allies in the region engaging a low level hostilities in response they say to Israel's war in Gaza. Yemen's Houthi attacking ships, ships they claim already Israeli affiliated, turning the Red Sea into a dangerous route for world trade. Iran's vow to avenge the killing of an Iranian commander in Syria, sparking renewed concerns of expanding the conflict.  Especially on the Lebanese Israeli border, artillery fire with Iran- backed Hezbollah keeping both countries on edge since October 8th. In Gaza, a race for survival between a routine of airstrikes rushing to hospitals and burials and the ongoing search for food and water and a pursuit of shelter for close to two million people displaced.

The launch has started early Tuesday morning and came from Houthi rebels supported by Iran and Yemen. As senior U.S. official says the Houthis have launched at least a hundred attacks in the past month.Meanwhile, Baghdad is condemning a series of U.S. airstrikes on Iran backed militants inside Iraq. More on that from CNN's Oren Liebermann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Rising tensions in the Middle East with U.S. fighter jets carrying out a series of strikes in Iraq against Kataib Hezbollah, one of Iran's regional proxies. The U.S. said the Monday strikes targeted drone facilities used by the militant group and its affiliates. Mourners leading a funeral procession through the streets of Baghdad as U.S. Central Command said the strikes likely killed a number of militants. President Joe Biden ordered the strikes after Kataib Hezbollah, recognized by the U.S. as a terrorist organization, claimed responsibility for the Monday drone attack on U.S. Forces in Iraq. The attack injured three U.S. service members, the Pentagon said, including one in critical condition. In a statement, the National Security Council said, the president places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm's way. The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue. U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been targeted approximately 100 times since October when the Israel-Hamas War started. The U.S. has tried to calibrate its retaliatory strikes to send a message to Iranian proxies in the region without sparking a wider war. Last month, the U.S. also carried out strikes against Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, killing at least eight of their fighters, according to the group. Iraq's government has condemned both of the attacks, calling them hostile acts that are unacceptable under any circumstances. The unrest has not been limited to land. Over the weekend, the U.S., as a one-way attack drone launched directly from Iran, struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean. No U.S. Navy ships were in the vicinity. The attack caused no injuries, but it did spark a fire on the ship, according to Central Command, as it raised concerns of a broader conflict the U.S. has been trying to avoid. (END VIDEOTAPE) LIEBERMANN (on camera): U.S. Central Command says according to their preliminary assessment of the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, there were no civilians affected. However, the Iraqi government says there were 19 people injured approximately, one servicemen and 18 others including civilians. So, that is part of the reason the Iraqi government is angry over these strikes. Again, also seeing them as an infringement of Iraqi sovereignty. An important point here is the U.S. operates with its forces in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon.",

Could you give me a sense of the latest and what more we know about his death? HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, of course. So Lee Sun-Kyun, his death was very sudden and very tragic in South Korea. We're still trying to confirm a lot of details surrounding Lee's death. But what South Korean police has confirmed to CNN is that his death is a presumed suicide. We also know that Lee was being investigated for alleged drug use. He was called into questioning three times, most recently in on December 23rd. When he was questioned for 19 hours, he was released on Christmas Eve. Now, it's very important to know that for all of the drug tests that Lee took, all the test results came back negative. He also claims that he was tricked and blackmailed into using drugs and he reportedly had a lawsuit against this blackmailer. Now, on social media, there has been an outpour of grief surrounding his death. As you mentioned at the top there, Eleni, he was beloved all across the world. And he really shot to fame internationally after the film \"Parasite\", which won four Oscars in 2020, notably the Best Picture award, which was the first award given to a non-English film. Now, in South Korea, his home country, he was also a household name. His career spanned two decades where he starred in a number of T.V. shows and a number of films. And as news of his death unfolds today, there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who are just mourning his sudden death.",
