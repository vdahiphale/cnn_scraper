What can they tell from the remains of the vessel and that type of thing. But then there's also a need for an internal investigation. What was happening within the company? What were they warned out? What steps did they take? What steps did they ignore? And one of the main ways you are going to figure that out is through legal investigation, either through -- if there are civil lawsuits here from the survivor family -- excuse me, from the surviving family of the victims, then I think it's very likely you're going to get the internal documents in the discovery process and those could become public and a very important part of the sort of educational process here. If there's a criminal investigation, then investigators will be able to subpoena that information and really see what went wrong inside the company -- engineering-wise, business-wise, innovation-wise.",
