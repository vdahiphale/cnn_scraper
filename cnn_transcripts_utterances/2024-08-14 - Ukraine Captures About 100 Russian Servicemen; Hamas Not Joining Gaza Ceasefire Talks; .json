      "sentences": "It's 5And wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" And a very warm welcome to \"First Move,\" and here's today's need to know. Ukraine says it's captured about a hundred Russian servicemen as it continues its cross-border incursion. A source says Hamas will not join Gaza ceasefire talks as international mediators make an urgent push for a deal. Japan's prime minister, Fumio Kishida, says he will step down in September. And yes, still stranded. NASA says it's more than a week away from deciding how to bring home two astronauts stuck on the International Space Station. That conversation and much more coming up. But first, Ukraine says its forces are on the move, seizing even more territory as their surprise attack inside Russia enters its ninth day. Ukraine's offensive is coming by land and air. A security source says Ukraine used drones to launch its biggest attack on Russian airfields since the war began. This says President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says 100 Russian troops have been captured. He says this could help accelerate the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war. He also says he has no intention of annexing seized Russian territory. Some Ukrainian soldiers, meantime, are relishing this chance to finally take the fight to Russian soil. CNN's Fred Pleitgen now on that report -- will have that report for us and more. FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A humiliating scene for the Kremlin. Ukrainian troops sweeping through a Russian village behind a U.S. supplied MaxPro armored vehicle. Kyiv soldiers taking down the Russian flag in another town, with Ukrainian TV reporting from the scene. Ukraine's top general telling President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the advance continues. Troops have advanced one to two kilometers in various directions, he says, and then adds, since the beginning of this day, we've taken captive about a hundred enemy soldiers. The Ukrainians say they want to create a buffer zone in this part of Russia to stop Moscow's army from attacking Ukrainian territory in the future. But the blitz offensive is also a major morale boost for Ukraine. A commander fighting inside Russia, tells CNN, catching the Russians off guard. They were shocked by such a rapid advance, he says. They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrendered to the defense forces. And then, every warrior, every soldier who defends their homeland probably had a dream of stepping onto Russian soil and destroying the enemy there. These feelings are impossible to forget. While the Russians claim they are stopping Ukraine's assault, releasing this video of their jets dropping powerful glide bombs, Ukraine says it shot down a Russian warplane, and a security source says it launched the biggest drone attack on Russian air bases since the war began. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has vowed a crushing response to Ukraine's incursion, but even Kremlin controlled TV acknowledging that won't be so simple. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Unfortunately, I must say that in some settlements, the enemy is holding their ground and we will need to fight them out of there. That will not happen as fast and as easy as we want it to. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Ukrainians have said they will continue to push forward and fortify the gains they've made. Hoping to withstand the massive counterattack that the Kremlin has promised. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Remember, they have been under that threat for month after month, depending on the intensity of horrors really Moscow wants to inflict upon here. But you have to remember also too, Paula, there is a limit to Vladimir Putin's strength. If there wasn't, then he'd be doing very differently in the longer-term war of attrition that we're seeing inside occupied parts of Ukraine. There's only a certain amount that his forces are able to do. Otherwise, they would have advanced faster and taken more territory and be doing even better than they currently are. So, he may be finding a combination of things. Officials telling him that things aren't as bad as perhaps they are. He may be finding that it takes longer to move forces, to bring them into play, to respond to Ukraine's movement. And above all too, they may be stretched quite thin and having to make that very difficult choice between whether they're willing to feel weaker and expose themselves on the larger frontline inside of Ukraine in order to project the strength they need in the Kursk area. But really this does, it puts paid to the notion of an impregnable Kremlin that are now leading the narrative in this war in its third year and it's, frankly, an enormous embarrassment to a Russian strongman who's always sold himself as being someone who sets the story as they wish.

But there is certainly still the potential for progress in these negotiations, and with that, the potential for the temperature in this region to be lowered. On the other hand, that also means that there's the potential for a lack of progress and for that to then hasten the Iranian retaliation that we have been waiting for about two weeks now. What we do know about these talks is that all the key players are going to be at the table with the Mossad director, David Barnea, who is leading the Israeli delegation. You'll have The CIA director, Bill Burns, the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Egyptian head of intelligence. But in terms of Hamas' attendance at these talks, Hamas is saying that they will not be participating, but that they will be willing to listen to hear out the mediators after they engage with the Israelis, if a serious proposal is on the table. And frankly, that is a lot of rhetoric, but it's not all that different from how these talks have been conducted in the past because at key moments they've held what are called proximity talks, where the Israeli delegation is in the room with all of those intelligence chiefs working out a deal. And then the mediators, the Egyptians and the Qataris, are going back and forth to another room where Hamas officials are usually stationed. But the Hamas position right now is that they want to see a deal based on the framework that was agreed to early last month. They don't want all of these additional demands that the Israeli prime minister has made over the course of the last month to be included as a basis for this current round of negotiations. Now, we are getting some indication that the Israeli prime minister is giving an expanded mandate to his negotiating team as they head to Doha, Qatar tomorrow, but my sources have told me that they are still uncertain about whether or not that will be enough to bridge the gap that currently exists with Hamas. No question, though, that if progress can be made here, we could see this region that is very much on edge slightly step back from the brink. That was the position expressed earlier today by Amos Hochstein, a U.S. special envoy who is in Beirut today, meeting with Lebanese officials. And what he said was that this is such a clear window of opportunity, not only to reach that hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza, but also that reaching that ceasefire deal could provide a window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as well.

And this is the latest court decision that brings even more political turbulence to the kingdom. The court says Srettha violated the constitution when he appointed a former lawyer who had served time in prison. The lawyer also once represented the powerful Shinawatra family. This is the politically powerful family that founded Srettha's ruling Pheu Thai Party. Now, Srettha denied wrongdoing and said that the lawyer who has since resigned was properly vetted. Now, with Srettha now dismissed, the first deputy prime minister will step in as a caretaker prime minister and a new government must now be formed. The ruling coalition will nominate a new candidate for prime minister for parliament to vote on. So, now the jostling and the horse trading begins. Now, the candidates include Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a leader of the party and daughter of the influential billionaire and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, as well as a former justice minister, interior minister, energy minister, and an influential former army chief who was involved in two coups. The process could take several weeks. The ruling comes just days after the court disbanded Thailand's most popular political party, the progressive Move Forward Party. Last year, Move Forward won a landslide victory as it drew huge support from across Thailand, especially among young people. But it was blocked from forming a government by lawmakers allied with the military. Its leaders are now banned from politics for 10 years. Both cases are raising concerns about political stability in Thailand. This is Southeast Asia's second biggest economy. And over the past two decades, multiple parties have been disbanded and governments overthrown in coups or court rulings, with the judiciary playing a key role in the relentless struggle for power in Thailand.

And officials are warning residents to stay on guard. Thousands of people have had to evacuate, and at least one person was killed. More now on our top story. Ukraine says its forces are now on the move, seizing even more Russian territory as their surprise incursion enters its ninth day. Ukraine's offensive is coming by land and air. A security source says Ukraine used to launch its biggest attack on Russian airfields since the war began. This as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a hundred Russian troops have been captured. We want to bring in CNN Military Analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton. Really good to have you on board as we try and figure out what's gone on here. I mean, how do you make sense of what you've seen in the last nine days militarily? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST AND U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yes, Paula, one of the key things about this is that the Ukrainians are looking at achieving some degree of advantage over what had been a very static battle space. And what we're seeing is a move in to capture some territory and potentially exchange that territory for territory that the Russians have captured in Ukraine. Now, of course, there's a big disparity between the amount of territory the Russians captured, which is about 18 percent of Ukraine's total landmass and the territory that we have here in the Kursk region in Russia. But nonetheless, it is the first time since World War II that a foreign force has actually been able to invade and capture territory in Russia itself. So, that's significant. But from another aspect here, which is also on the military side of things, this could very well be the point where the Ukrainians interdict or cut off some of the railroad lines that run through this area, you know, which are very important for the Russian war effort. And it's also a place where they can start staging into areas that have air bases and also military bases, army bases. So, it has a transportation component to it. It has a military component to it, and it also has an economic component to it, which, of course, feeds the war effort. And that economic component is really based on the gas pipeline that goes through that area, where the Ukrainians have actually been able to capture one of the metering stations that is really part of the engineering part that goes into pumping the gas into the western and eastern Europe. So, that becomes a significant factor as well.",

Now, the particular area where they're in right now, is opposite some other rural areas in the Sumy region of Ukraine, but it does have some significant agricultural use for the Ukrainians and some industrial use as well.

The other thing that has happened, of course, you know, more on the military strategy side is the Ukrainians are forcing the Russians to move their troops and we're seeing them move troops from areas in occupied Ukraine to Kursk area and other areas that they think they need to defend. So, when it comes to this particular moment in time, it couldn't very well be a pivotal moment.

They've been testing the systems on the Earth, over the last like two months to try to get to the root issue. They think they understand an overheating issue that is causing it but they want to make sure that once these astronauts undock from the space station, that there won't be any issues in that crucial period to get them out of space and on Earth safely. Now, that is a really big and important step. And as you said, Paula, if they have any doubts, they've got another spacecraft, by SpaceX, launching in late September. They could launch that half full with just two astronauts instead of four and have some seats for these this crew to come back probably in February, though, that's a very long time to have your mission extended.",

But there is a bit of a traffic jam that is in play right now at the space station. In order to launch the next crewed mission on Dragon, which is called Crew 9, in late September, they have to bring the Starliner spacecraft back to Earth because they need the docking port and other supplies to support that. But they can't do any of that until another crew launches on a Russian spacecraft. That's also supposed to happen in September. They're waiting on that. And at the same time, there's some cargo missions. SpaceX has already delayed an uncrewed cargo mission of its own. There's a Russian cargo mission launching tonight, actually that's going to the space center. It arrives on Saturday. And so, you have all these different visiting vehicles coming and going that need to be kind of accounted for to find the safe window.",

It's a record sixth win for Madrid in the Super Cup, which is played between the winners of the Champions League, remember, and the Europa League.

Paula, the Super Cup is kind of the curtain raiser to the European season, which isall going to kick off in a lot of the top leagues domestically at the weekend. But some people would say it's really kind of more of a friendly game and it's a nice way to break your way into the season. But don't tell that to Real Madrid. As you say, they've won this thing six times now. That is a record. That is one more than Barcelona and AC Milan. And this was a really interesting game because Atalanta kept Madrid quiet for the first half. They didn't have a single shot on target, but after the break, it was a different story. They could have scored, you know, half a dozen goals. That's Mbappe getting the second one. And again, what was interesting about this game was that this team is just a galaxy of stars. I mean, arguably they've got. Three of the best players in the world right now in their squad, but they really struggled to kind of see the ball make space gel. In the second half it came together. And I think when you hear what the players are saying about it, they could achieve an awful lot again this season. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
