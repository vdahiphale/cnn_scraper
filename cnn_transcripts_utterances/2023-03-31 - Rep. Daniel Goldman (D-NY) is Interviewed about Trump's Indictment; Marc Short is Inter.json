Nobody knows what the evidence is. Nobody knows what the legal theory is. There's a tremendous amount of speculation because there have been a few leaks and people just are taking those as true. And I can tell you, as a former prosecutor I used to always say, about 50 percent of the information and leaks is accurate. You just don't know which 50 percent that is. But if reports are true that this is more than 30 counts in the indictment, I think there's going to be more than just the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. And so, you know, I see my colleagues on the Republican side bashing the district attorney is partisan and that this is an attack on justice. They don't know what the evidence is, so how can they actually say that legitimately and on - and with any foundation when they don't know what the charges are?",

He's going to do the same here and he's going to follow the rule of law. And if he's - if a judge requires that he testify, then he will testify.As he's said multiple times, there's nothing to hide. He's written about it publicly. He's spoken about it publicly. He's spoken about his disagreement. He's spoken about how tragic the day of January 6th was.
