I'm Paula Newton, ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\"Averting a shutdown, Congress gets back to work and an old problem needs solving again. Muddy and messy, deplorable conditions at Nevada's Burning Man Festival. Thousands are wondering when they will be able to leave. And Ukraine shakes up its military leadership. How a new defense minister could make a difference in the war with Russia. The U.S. Senate returns to Washington today facing a packed schedule and a ticking clock. Pressure is building on the U.S. Capitol lawmakers as they are just a few weeks to make a deal and avoid a government shutdown. Members of the U.S. House aren't back until next week, but conservative Republican hardliners are already pressuring House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to stick to strict guidelines on any deal. They don't want to make any concessions, but McCarthy and the White House are seeking a short-term bill that would put a Band-Aid on the problem for now, moving the issue months down the road. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more details now on those negotiations in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They're also asking for a boost in funding for some key programs that provide assistance to millions of Americans.Now, separately, the White House is also asking Congress for a supplemental request, that is to provide more funds to FEMA, which has been responding to very expensive disasters across the country and whose funds are set to run dry by the end of this month, as well as more funding for Ukraine. Now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said the FEMA funds will be replenished, but there is pushback about those funds being linked to Ukraine. Now also there is disagreement within the Republican Conference about the spending bill. Republican hardliners have asked for an impeachment inquiry into Biden, action on border security, as well as cutting spending to pre-COVID levels as part of passing any type of spending bill. So that is likely to play out in Congress in the weeks to come, but all of this really a sprint to the finish in September when the fiscal year ends.

It's -- Now from my perspective, I don't think that A.I. can actually do a lot of the work that we're being told it's going to be able to do. I think the jury is out on that.But what we can see from a historical perspective and what is definitely the case in Hollywood, a new technology is introduced and that becomes the grounds to change how things are done and leverage against work. So if you're working in an office, if you're working remotely, If you're working in a creative field, if you write emails, you're going be told, whether true or not, that well, your job just got a lot easier because of A.I., so you don't deserve as much. I don't think that's the case. And I think that anybody who is concerned about making a living should follow these developments really closely and think about what kinds of leverage you have.",

It's very difficult to go for this amount of time without working, but I think what's really inspiring is writers seem to really see this as a kind of historic moment, to kind of really establish a fair, equitable framework for the craft of writing, not just for the next season of television, but for years coming, years into the future, when we'll have, of course, new developments in A.I. If they can lock down some fair things now, then the craft of writing will be protected. I think that we'll probably see the strike conclude probably beforethe end of the year, but we'll have to see. The main question is whether the production schedules for winter will be met. If they don't come to an arrangement soon, we'll have another sort of quarterly delay on production of new television and film.",
