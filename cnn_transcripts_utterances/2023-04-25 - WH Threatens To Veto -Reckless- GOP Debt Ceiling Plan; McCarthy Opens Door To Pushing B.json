The GOP proposal would raise the debt limit for a year, but it's paired with serious spending cuts to Biden's priorities. In a veto threat today, the White House called the plan \"reckless,\" saying the president will not accept such attempts at hostage taking. Let's go to CNN's Lauren Fox. She's at the capitol for us.

      "sentences": "As you mentioned, they're in closing arguments. The Justice Department, in their closing arguments, basically said, look, the Proud Boys were, as they put it, Donald Trump's army.They have gone through months of just witnesses on the stand. You also had, of course, five attorneys who had to do the case for each of the defendants, which is why this trial lasted such a long time, even longer than the previous seditious conspiracy trial against the Oath Keepers. This one lasting about two months so far. But we did, of course, hear from defense attorneys in their closing. And I want you to hear what we just got in from Enrique Tarrio's defense attorney. Most of the defense attorneys didn't directly after Donald Trump. That is not the case with Enrique Tarrio's attorney. He said to the jury, \"It was Donald Trump's words, it was his motivation, it was his anger that caused January 6th in your amazing and beautiful city,\" referencing D.C. to the crowd there who was from D.C. Now, he said they want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald Trump and those in power. That is perhaps the strongest closing argument against Donald Trump trying to say they're using Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat there. Of course, the prosecution would argue very differently in this case and have brought forth mountains of evidence in this case against several of the defendants. I do want to let you hear from Enrique Tarrio himself. To couch this, it was in February 2021. This is right after some of the Proud Boy members had been charged in this case. And Enrique Tarrio himself had not yet been charged. Here's what he had to say about his Proud Boys and what happened on January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
