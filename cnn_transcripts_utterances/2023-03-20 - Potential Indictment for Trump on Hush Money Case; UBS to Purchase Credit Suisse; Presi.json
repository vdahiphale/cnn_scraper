Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" the investigation into Donald Trump's alleged hush money scheme will soon have an unexpected weakness as the Manhattan District Attorney weighs indicting the former president. And if he is arrested, Trump's attorney warns of mayhem to come.On both sides of the Atlantic, major moves are being made to try to restore faith in the global banking system. Plus, China's president is making his first trip to Moscow since the war in Ukraine began. We will look at what both sides are hoping to get out of the business. Good to have you with us. Well, Donald Trump is bracing for what could be an eventful week in one of his legal battles. The former U.S. president has called on supporters to protest his potential arrest on Tuesday over a hush money investigation in New York. In the coming hours, we could learn new details about that probe when his former attorney, Michael Cohen, appears before a grand jury. Cohen's former legal adviser, Robert Costello, is also expected to offer evidence, which a source says would challenge Cohen's claims about the alleged hush money. If the investigation results in and indictment against Trump, his lawyer says, there could be unrest in New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the language that he's used on his social media platforms sound very similar to the language used to incite the riot that we saw -- insurrection, that we saw on January 6.So, I don't know if that's a credible statement or not. But we do know that Trump has the ability to cost thousands of people to, you know, to be galvanized and to engage in conduct that's counterproductive and violent. So, hopefully, unlike January 6, there is adequate measures being taken by all law enforcement agencies and they will be prepared if protesters take to the streets or do anything to protest what would be a lawful issuance of an indictment. I don't understand the logic. Somehow, he's, you know, supposed to be above the law. Other people have been indicted and there is no call for protests.",

So, at this point, that's just speculation.But in terms of what this could mean, obviously, this country has never faced this kind of what some are calling the constitutional crisis where a former president who is running for president again, has been arrested, has been indicted on criminal charges. So, it remains to be seen what this looks like. We know there is a huge security risk. This is not like going to knock on the door of Michael Cohen or one of the very many people in Trump's orbit that have been arrested because Trump does have Secret Service protection, any kind of arrest would have to be worked out with the Secret Service. So, there's lots of details yet to be, I think, worked out or disclosed as it relates to any potential arrest.",

We do know that federal prosecutors in New York looked at these potential charges -- or potential charges related to this hush money. And they decided not to indict. We know that federal election committee has also looked at these charges.So, there is some concern that state charges may not be that strong. But, look, Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States. And to the extent that this grand jury believes that it has evidence to indict, he is not above the law. And this notion that somehow the case involving the classified documents that were taken from the White House or the case involving the, you know, attempt to get the election results overturned in Georgia, that those cases are somehow better cases because they're being investigated, involving cases that, you know, involve federal law, particularly with the classified documents case, I don't buy that. If Donald Trump has committed a crime, wherever that crime has been committed, or wherever that crime, is he needs to be held accountable just like any other citizen would be held accountable.",

If he was indicted for taking classified documents out of the White House, not returning them, and then making false statements or his team making false statements about all the documents being returned, his base would, you know, object to that.There is not a case that can be brought against Donald Trump no matter how legitimate that case is that his base wouldn't respond to. So, this notion that somehow, if there were this hypothetical storm or case that his base would, you know, accept it, I think it's hypocrisy and it's a fantasy. His base is going to support him no matter what they believe that he is above the law and that they believe that he should be given special treatment. So, I think, the Department of Justice, the district attorney in Georgia, and the district attorney in Manhattan have to follow wherever the evidence leads them.",

UBS is planning to buy Credit Suisse at a fire sale price in an emergency rescue pact. The nearly three and a quarter billion-dollar deal is being brokered by the Swiss government in an attempt to stem market panic. Meantime, the U.S. Federal Reserve and several other leading central banks have announced dollar liquidity measures to ease the banking crisis. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now live from London. Good morning to you Clare. So, how are global markets reacting right now to this move by UBS to buy Credit Suisse and how will this takeover work exactly?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, this is a very fast-moving situation in terms of global market. It's only the Asian markets that are open at the moment. But certainly, we're seeing some jitters there in the banking sector in particular. This was, as I say, a very fast-moving situation.You'll remember last week off the back of what happened in the United States with those three-bank failure starting with Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse had its own separate issues. They sort of came to the floor, again, earlier last week with issues around its financial reporting, then its top shareholder said that it wouldn't put any more money in. And then we saw a real crisis of confidence in the bank. It's had years of problems, but it sorts of crystallized last week. The Swiss National, Bank, the central bank there, stepped in with more than $50 billion lifeline, but that did not stem the losses, both in the stock price and in terms of depositors. \"The Financial Times\" says that at one-point last week they were losing around $10 billion dollars a day in deposits. So, we got to the point this weekend when it was clear that Credit Suisse could no longer carry on as it was. And what we have in terms of this deal is really a sort of part acquisition, part government. I don't want to use the word bailout, that is a bit controversial in this deal. But UBS has come in and they're buying, as you say, the bank at a fire sale price, less than of half what it was worth that the market closed on Friday. The government is back stopping the deal as well with more than $100 billion dollars in credit. And they're also back stopping some potential losses at Credit Suisse. This is what the Swiss finance minister had to say about it. Take a listen. (BEGIUN VIDEO CLIP) KANIN KELLER-SUTTER, SWISS FINACNCE MINISTER:  The bankruptcy of a global systematically bank would have cost irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world. For this reason, Switzerland had to take the responsibilities beyond its own borders. (END VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN:  So, this was about preventing contagion, preventing that similar fate befalling on other banks. This is why we see the Bank of England, the fed, the U.S. Treasury coming out and welcoming the deal. Now, the losers here, Credit Suisse shareholders, they are getting a tiny bit back. They're getting one UBS share under the deal for every 22 and a half Credit Suisse shares that they own. And perhaps the most controversial is that the clash of bond holders in Credit Suisse, $17 trillion worth of bonds are being wiped out completely, $17 billion, rather, I should say. And that is going to cause some controversy. It's potentially going to ripple through the bond market, as well today. But, the key thing to take away here, Rosemary, is that a 167-year-old bank, systematically important, one of the top 30 in the world, under this deal will cease to exist.",
