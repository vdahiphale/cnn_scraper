This will be the first call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israeli forces killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen.White House sources say President Biden is, quote, angry and increasingly frustrated and is expected to make those feelings known to the prime minister. A CNN analysis of the aftermath video found the attack may have consisted of multiple precision strikes. The team was traveling through a de-conflicted zone in two armored cars and one unarmored vehicle. They had coordinated their movements with the IDF. Now, Israel continues to claim the strike was unintentional. This morning, World Central Kitchen is calling for an independent third party investigation into the strike. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House this morning. Arlette, we've been told the president is frustrated. What are you learning about how he will express that frustration in this phone call?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden is expected to directly convey his frustration and anger to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they speak in the coming hours.It really marks the latest tension point between the U.S. and the Israeli prime minister. The frustration levels here at the White House have been growing with the way that Israel is conducting their operations, especially in the wake of that strike that killed seven aid workers working with World Central Kitchen. President Biden made that plainly clear in a statement released earlier this week when he said he was outraged by that incident. Now, while the deaths of these workers is expected to be a large focus on the call, the president is also expected to broaden out the discussion a bit as well, to talk about protections for humanitarian aid workers. We also have learned that Biden administration officials have been stressing to Israeli officials that there needs to be changes in the way that they transmit information about working with these aid workers as they're stationed there in Gaza and trying to deliver aid. The president is also expected to talk about the ongoing discussions to try to reach some type of temporary ceasefire in order to release hostages and get more humanitarian aid in, as well as the concerns about a potential Israeli operation in Rafah. Now, ahead of this call between Biden and Netanyahu, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart yesterday. A Pentagon spokesperson said that in that call, he expressed the outrage over the deaths of these aid workers, but also reinforced the concerns that the administration has relating to that potential operation in Rafah. But even as we have seen this rhetoric really sharpen and heighten from the administration since the death of these seven aid workers, what we have not seen is any type of shift in the strategy and policy when it comes to U.S. support for Israel, especially when it comes to continuing to provide military aid. That is something a top spokesperson here at the White House spoke about yesterday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He heard some of that firsthand when he hosted Muslim community leaders here at the White House on Tuesday evening, people conveying their frustrations of his approach, his handling specifically of the situation in Gaza.And so, really, this could mark a major moment for President Biden going forward, as there are questions of whether the U.S. might change its steadfast military support for Israel, whether this could serve as a turning point in the U.S. support for the war. But at this time so far, even as that rhetoric is heightened, even as the administration is expressing outrage, there has been no signs that a shift in policy is imminent.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it is a truly stunning report from this Israeli Plus972 Magazine, noting that the Israeli military is using artificial intelligence, a program known as Lavender, to identify targets in Gaza, effectively drawing up kill lists of suspected militants that are then used to carry out the Israeli military's bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip.The military, according to this report, relied on this system to carry out strikes with the IDF systematically attacking militants, in particular, in their homes at night, resulting in significant civilian casualties. This is a section of that report which says, the result, as the sources testified, is that thousands of Palestinians, most of them women and children, or people who were not involved in the fighting, were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war, because of the A.I.'s program's decisions. Now, the Israeli military has responded, and this is part of their statement. They say that, contrary to the claims, the IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist. Information systems are merely tools for analysts in the target identification process. For each target, IDF procedures require conducting an individual assessment of the anticipated military advantage and collateral damage expected. And so what you can hear in that is not denying that they are using the system, but claiming that there are human checks on this system. But one source told Plus972 that human personnel effectively served as a rubber stamp, with oftentimes personnel devoting only about 20 seconds to actually review the targets that were selected before authorizing the bombing. And as you noted, this system apparently has a 10 percent error rate, which obviously resulted in civilian casualties. So, a really remarkable report, particularly in the context of the Gaza war, but also really when you consider the future of modern warfare, potentially.",

Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, but who also happens to be Benjamin Netanyahu's chief political rival, yesterday, in a public statement, calling for early elections. This is the first time that he has made this call since joining this unity government in the first days of the war.And he says that he would like to see elections by September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of those October 7th terrorist attacks, the one-year anniversary of Israel's war in Gaza. He says that he is framing it in the context of maintaining the unity that has existed in Israel in the wake of those attacks on October 7th. And that's particularly interesting, because by being in this unity government, he really has helped to give the aura of unity to Benjamin Netanyahu's government. And while his departure from this unity government wouldn't topple the government all together, it could potentially fracture that image of unity, which Benjamin Netanyahu very much needs in this moment.",

And, Sara, I mean, Donald Trump has really towed the line on this issue for over a year now and throughout the campaign trail, despite many outside people, people like Senator Lindsey Graham, his ally, Ralph Reed, even Kellyanne Conway pressuring him for months to take a more firm issue and firm stance, I should say, on this position. He's avoided doing so and also at the advice of some of his advisers.What he's really done so far has been to try to have it both ways, to take credit for what he argues was stacking the Supreme Court with conservative justices that paved the way for Roe versus Wade to be overturned, but then also both privately and publicly saying that he believes the issue of abortion is a political loser, and especially in a general election. But we have started to see him change his tune a bit in recent weeks. He started floating a 15-week or 16-week ban and has recently, as you mentioned, said that he plans to make a statement on this shortly. Take a listen to what he's been saying.

They were not anticipating that he would say that. And, really, it's because even though many people have been pressuring him to clarify his position on this, once he became the Republican nominee, essentially, they argue that maybe the politics of this doesn't make sense to come out with during a general election, when, really, it's an issue that Republicans are very vulnerable on. But now, it's really -- you know, he's put his advisers on the clock. And we do know that behind the scenes, his policy team has been quietly preparing a working on a policy memo led by his top policy aides to put something out on this. And, look, when I talk to Donald Trump's advisers, they essentially tell me that we wanted to avoid this issue. We know it's not great politics, but at some point, he was going to have to address this. And one of them even said, from a P.R. standpoint, it's better to do so earlier rather than later. So, that's where Donald Trump is right now. And I do just want to be very clear. We still don't know exactly what he's going to say next week. Right before he had made that comment about making a statement next week, his advisers had essentially put out a statement saying his position is that he believes the issue should be decided by the states.
