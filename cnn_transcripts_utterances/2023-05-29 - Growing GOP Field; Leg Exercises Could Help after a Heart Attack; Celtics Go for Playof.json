So - and in this moment you'll hear, he's not just going after Ron DeSantis it sounds like when we hear about culture wars, also, though, directly attacking the former president. Take a listen.

Never happened a bit. You know, former President Trump blew that one. Securing the border. Former President Trump blew that one. Fiscal discipline. He -- former Trump blew that one too.

They look back at 2008 and they see what happened to Hillary Clinton, for example, and Barack Obama came out o nowhere. And I think they're all just waiting for an opening. They're waiting for a lawsuit. They're waiting for something else. They're waiting for the other shoe to drop. And they're all going to kind of pounce. But I think DeSantis kind of has -- I think he -- he is looking at past elections maybe and saying there is more of an opening. I - I was the guy who won by 18 percentage points in November. I can do it again. Look what I did. And he's already kind of contrasting on Covid, on other issues and saying, look how I did it versus look at how former President Trump handled it.",

But this study shows, if you maintain your muscle strength, that's associated with better heart health outcomes.So, what the researchers did, they looked at data on more than 900 older adults. These are older adults ages 57 to 74 who did have a heart attack. Those who had low quadricep strength actually had a higher incidents of developing heart failure after their heart attack compared with those who had high strength, they had a lower incidence, 10.2 incidents rate of later developing heart failure. And the researchers say that this shows that having high quad strength is associated with a 41 percent lower risk of developing heart failure after a heart attack. So, these studies suggest that if you continue strength training while recovering from a heart attack, that can actually lead to better heart health outcomes.

But this year's squad (ph) has been a little bit different. They're even thought he playoffs at home. They've one five games there. They've lost five games there. And when Miami is playing well, they've proven to be a team that is not intimidated by that environment. So, that's really the big question is, which version of these two teams are going to show up? It is going to be the Celtics team that we've seen over the last couple of games that plays really tough defense, that is there at critical moments, that makes good decisions, or, you know, are we going to see the team that we saw through the first three games where they didn't look like a top seed at all in the conference.For Miami, Jimmy Butler is really their go-to player. He is a superstar with Jayson Tatum. These two are two of the best in the league. He has been a little bit off over the last couple of games. If he can show up and play really well, then I'm not sure the home court advantage will matter that much at all because of how tough this Miami team has been.
