Those are her words.She continually brought up warnings from Trump's former chief of staff reported in \"The Atlantic\" and referred to them as a -- quote -- \"9/11 call to the American people.\" But asked point blank by Anderson if Donald Trump is a fascist.

We heard Anderson pressed the vice president regarding the border wall and the fact that there's still $650 million allocated to that particular project, that project that was such a standard of the first time that the former president ran.

Donald Trump got a lot more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, and he still lost because voted turnout would have -- is this a sign that we're going to have more, another increase in voter turnout in the presidential year or is it just a sign that people are getting more accustomed to voting early and they're just getting it done?

They control it. It's within their campaign. They've got the money to operate it. On the Trump side, the opposite is happening. It has been completely outsourced to these outside groups, a lot of them funded by very large donors. Elon Musk is one of them. That changes the dynamic. It changes what they can do. It changes how much information they have and it makes it actually more expensive to do it from the outside.
