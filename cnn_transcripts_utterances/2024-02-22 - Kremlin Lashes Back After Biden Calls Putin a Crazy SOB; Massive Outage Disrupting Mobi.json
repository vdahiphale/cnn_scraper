This comes as Russia's fingerprints seem to be making their mark on American politics or trying to all over again. Right now, the Republican Party trying to salvage its faltering impeachment inquiry in the House into President Biden after a star witness and former FBI informant admitted and was indicted over not telling the truth and saying he got information from Russia. Joining us right now, CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us as well as Alayna Treene. Arlette, let me start with you. This isn't the first time that President Biden and Vladimir Putin and between the two of them have resulted or resorted to name calling. What do you see in this? What's happening?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Kate, I mean, Donald Trump has been very clear in his refusals to condemn Vladimir Putin, but also Russian aggression overall, not only in the aftermath of Alexei Navalny's death, but also more broadly in his rhetoric toward the war in Ukraine and also, as Arlette mentioned, his undermining of the NATO alliance. Just recently, I mean, he raised a lot of eyebrows and a lot of backlash when he called or really invited Russia to invade NATO allies that do not meet their spending obligations.But, look, I think to take a step back, it is remarkable to look at the transformation of the Republican Party under Donald Trump. It's become far more populist, you know, than embracing Donald Trump's America First agenda, but also what many critics argue is more isolationist. And I think if you think about the days of Reagan Republicans, even Donald Trump himself, are lionizing Reagan, calling him one of the best leaders the country had, he was the one who called on Russia to tear the wall down in relation to the Berlin Wall. We're not seeing that type of rhetoric now from Republicans. And I think a great example of that is just look at what's happening in Congress. You have Republicans refusing to pass more aid to Ukraine, something that is shown to help Russia in some of its battles in that war. And it's something as well that Congresswoman Liz Cheney -- former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, I should say, someone who I think is a great example of the traditional conservative who has been rejected under Donald Trump, it's something that she criticized. Take a listen to how she put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  When you think about Donald Trump, for example, pledging retribution, what Vladimir Putin did to Navalny is what retribution looks like in a country where the leader is not subject to the rule of law. We have to take seriously the extent to which you've now got a Putin wing of the Republican Party. I believe the issue this election cycle is making sure the Putin wing of the Republican Party does not take over the West Wing of the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think it's definitely something we're going to continue to see play out in the months ahead, particularly as I know the former president and his team are trying to pivot toward the general election. And a lot of this discussion over foreign policy, how to deal with Russia, is going to continue to be a flashpoint in those conversations.",

Of course, Donald Trump is doing the same thing. He's been campaigning here far less than she has. She's been on a bus tour really for the last several weeks since the New Hampshire primary, making the case to many of her voters, you know, her fellow South Carolinians to come out and register their support for her, but also that this race should go on from here.

There's so much sort of a disinterest in a rematch between Trump and Biden. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The voting still here is taking place on Saturday. In fact, some of it is going on behind me here. There's been a pretty steady stream of voters coming in here in this key suburban county just outside of Charleston. So, John, there's no doubt the former president wants to suggest this race is over. Nikki Haley says not so fast. We will see what the voters here say.

Let's get into a little bit more detail of what this 26-year-old is accused of doing before we get into sort of the back and forth between these district attorneys or attorneys. So, 26-year-old Raad Almansoori, according to the NYPD, committed a murder here in Manhattan in a hotel room earlier this month. And then police say he jumped on a plane and he went to Arizona, where authorities say he stabbed one woman while committing a carjacking. And he also allegedly stabbed a different woman at a McDonald's restaurant. Now, both of those women survived and then he was arrested. Well, just yesterday, the Maricopa County attorney took to the microphone and explained how she has instructed her staff to not work with New York authorities with an extradition.
