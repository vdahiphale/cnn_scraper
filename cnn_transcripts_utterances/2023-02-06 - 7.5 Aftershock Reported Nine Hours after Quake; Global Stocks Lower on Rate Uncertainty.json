The powerful 7.8 magnitude quake rocking Southern Turkey and Northern Syria early Monday with a major aftershock less than 12 hours later, more than 1900 people are now reported dead and with many more still missing that death toll are expected to climb. In Syria, the quake has claimed the lives of more than 800 people. Syrian state TV says that most of the damage and deaths were in and around Aleppo that's near Syria's Northern border with Turkey. Casualties were also reported in opposition held territory in Syria's Northwest. Right now desperate searches underway for survivors take a look dramatic video showing rescuers they're pulling an injured toddler out of the rubble in Northwest Syria. Elsewhere, cameras caught the moment one child was rescued from the rubble. Moments ago, we also got extraordinary footage of a child being rescued from the rubble in the snow. Take a look. You can see a little girl being pulled from that rubble alive there. She is in a town North of Gaziantep. Now we don't know more, anything more about her or her family. But these are the moments this right here. These are the moments that keep the rescue workers going. And as rescue efforts continue Turkish President Erdogan says that he has received offers of help from NATO, the European Union and scores of other countries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is even stronger at 7.5-magnitude than the earthquake they had back in 1999 in Northwestern Turkey. That killed some 17,000 people and left about a half a million people homeless. I just want to show you a piece of video this is from the city, a small City of Malatya. And there is this comes from a local reporter for station called A News when the shaking started a few hours ago, listen. I just translate what he's saying here. He said, as we were heading into the rubble of the film search and rescue efforts that were two consecutive aftershocks with a loud noise in the building you're seeing on my left was brought down to earth. There's a lot of dust, a local resident is coming. And he is covered in dust areas there. So a huge number of people live in this part of the country, the most populated city closest to the Epicenter is Gaziantep. That says 2 million people, that's where we're seeing the highest death tolls but they also have the most resources there. And so it's possible that as rescue crews make their way into the more, small towns and villages that they may discover that there are fewer rescue resources there. And again, the death toll may rise yet still, they are also trying hard, Rahel, to try to get mobile connectivity to some of these areas, electricity back on, the gas has been shut off for obvious reasons so that there's not fire starting amidst all of these aftershocks. After that 1999 earthquake, Turkey started to take really seriously the idea of beefing up building codes. And so buildings that did not meet code, the effort, there were efforts to try to tear them down and rebuild them. But obviously, this is a slow process that could not happen overnight. And so I think we're finding out today which of those buildings are up to code and which ones are not. Obviously there is aid coming into the country as well, many countries pledging it. But surely it cannot come soon enough, given the staggering numbers of victims and President Erdogan saying and frankly, they don't know how many people may yet be trapped underneath. But it is a very different story in Turkey, while they have been working to beef up building codes; the civil war has really less than the standards and those kind in that country and decimated the infrastructure there. And so they're all there are also two different authorities in Syria. There's the government in Damascus, and then there was also the rebel held areas in the Northwest sort of working in parallel to one another. And so it is very unlikely that there's going to be at least Western foreign aid coming in through Damascus and in Northwestern Syria, where the rebel held areas. They are pleading for international aid to come into those areas, because we're already seeing pictures of hospitals that are absolutely overwhelmed. The latest numbers that we have from northwestern Syria, for instance, is that more than 130 buildings have completely collapsed. And there are more than 270 that are damaged in some ways. And obviously, this is what we know at this stage of the game. But surely, all of these numbers are going to change as we learn more here, Rahel.",

For the most part, they'll be contained in a certain city or an area. But in this case, you are talking about so much devastation thousands of buildings that have been destroyed, according to Turkish officials all across these different cities and towns in these provinces making it very, very complicated for them to try and reach these areas earlier. You know, we were hearing that in some in a number of areas, the runways in airports had sustained damage. And so it was also making it hard for the search and rescue teams that are being deployed from different parts of the country. The military had also mobilized support, medical support, and search and rescue teams as well. And they were also finding it difficult to try and fly into these areas. In addition to all of this, Rahel, I don't know if you can see the weather right here. Turkey is facing this winter storm. It is freezing right now, it's snowing, it's raining. There are visibility issues; it's going to get dark soon as well. I mean, it's so hard to imagine what people on the ground are dealing with right now. People who are dealing with the trauma of this massive earthquake followed by more than 30 aftershocks really powerful ones are 7.5 magnitude aftershock and in addition to all of that, you've got people who have no shelter right now people who can be inside buildings because of these aftershocks. And now they're dealing of course, with the weather conditions, making it difficult for the teams on the ground, working this very delicate search and rescue operation to try and pull people from under the rubble. We don't really know how many people are believed to be trapped underneath, but the concern is and the fear is that it could be in the thousands so a very, very difficult time for the people of this country and of course, as well across the border in Syria, Rahel.",

Search and rescue operation just isn't fit for scope. Without a doubt, I think the next 24 hours really is lifesaving mode. And everyone you know, really throwing their all into to try and make sure that we are able to pull people out of rubble before it gets dark. It is almost night time here now and temperatures are supposed to go below freezing in the next couple of hours. Anyone who is left out you knows there is the risk of exposure. And for this area, you really have to remember that this population was already highly vulnerable. They have a huge amount of people who have been displaced sometimes as many as 20 times.

We might start to hear some calls from China to return that balloon, which they claim is for civilian purposes. Even though that claim is questioned not just by the Pentagon, but also by defense officials here in Taiwan, who have reported similar sightings of suspected Chinese balloons over this island just within the last couple of years, most recently, just about a year ago, in February of 2022. And so now that China might be wanting to balloon back without a whole lot of scrutiny from the FBI we have to look back at what has happened when the tables have been turned. And more than 20 years ago, when a U.S. Military spy plane had to make an emergency landing on China's Hainan Island. It took three months for China to return that plane to the United States. And it was returned in pieces it had been a disassemble that had been picked through. The Chinese can probably expect similar treatment of this balloon, which there yes, they're doubling down on this claim that it was an essentially a weather balloon. Despite all of the pushback from, you know, military experts who say the 90 feet of hardware in the bottom of it is unlike pretty much any weather balloon that anyone has ever seen. Nonetheless, China did fire the head of their weather service. And they say that all of this was a mistake. Now the claim that the flight path was a mistake is being challenged by certainly experts in the United States, and also some here in Taiwan. They believe that it might have been deliberately flown over those sensitive sites like the missile silos in Montana. But it could be a case of the military not talking to the Foreign Ministry, because China is just a massive bureaucracy. And so the military may not have been aware, may not have really cared that it was happening on the day before a crucial visit by the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Even though Blinken supposedly was going to meet with the Chinese President Xi Jinping so it just gives us you know, in this very, very obscure nation. China where there's almost no transparency when it comes to this sort of thing. We're left to guess whether this was indeed an accident. Was this diplomatic sabotage, tested U.S. Military's response time tested President Biden or a massive bureaucratic mix up? We may never know the answer, Rahel.",

This episode doesn't really I think, trigger very intense politics on the Chinese side, to be sure there is some reaction. But there are politics in China too. And if we were to see an episode, for example, over Taiwan, which is very sensitive, that's where you see an episode where the Chinese public is also reacting.

The Organization's Director said that teams will provide \"Essential health care for the injured and most vulnerable\". The earthquake knocked out power and internet connectivity in Southern Turkey and the region will soon be plunged into darkness with a setting sun at about 30 minutes time. While rescue teams are working against the clock in freezing temperatures to save thousands of people trapped under the rubble hospitals are operating at maximum capacity. At least 120 aftershocks had been recorded across the region. Some felt as far away as Israel and Lebanon. Witnesses in Gaziantep told CNN that up to eight strong aftershocks were felt in just under a minute after the quake. Turkey's President Erdogan said that the quake knocked down thousands of buildings resulting in that dreadful death pole. NATO, the EU dozens of other countries and aid groups are all mobilizing to help sending in search and rescue teams trained search socks and tons of equipment, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars for disaster relief and sending supplies like emergency generators, tents and blankets.

How will they have medical care brought to them? And of course, now that all - the other concern is further earthquakes, further aftershocks, you know, this region, specifically around Jerusalem, they've been warning that the hundred year earthquake that just struck Turkey apparently that they're expecting one for this region as well. So now they're trying to re up the advice to citizens what to do in the event of an earthquake? And actually, just last year, Israel released a new, what they call a somewhat early warning detection system that might give some people a depending on where the epicenter is just potentially even 30 seconds to be able to move out into an open area or move into a protected area. Let them use to at least have some sort of chance of survival. And I think a lot of people are refreshing the instructions on what to do in the event of an earthquake after seeing what happened in Turkey overnight, Rahel?",

They've says that they've specialized it they actually also sent a team to that condo collapse in Florida a few years ago. They sent a special military search and rescue team. So those types of teams will be going in. These are military people who will be going and trying to help with the search and rescue likely it's also going - I mean, we also know is going to be medical supplies. We know it's also going to be really just supplies against the elements. These are going to be things like tents, blankets, just sort of the basics to keep those people warm. And we're looking at these images now, of just entire neighborhoods, entire apartment blocks, and you also have to keep in mind that the same people who will be going to for help. Their local hospitals, their local rescuers, they themselves are going to be working out of damaged buildings. They themselves may be hurt themselves. And so this will also just be personnel, people who can supply medical aid. People who can just supply humanitarian aid, anything really they can do to help not only find survivors pull them out of the rubble but also treat the people who are as you can see right there out there in the elements like I said, it's cold, it's very cold. The weather conditions are not very good for anybody who's going to be out in the elements all night long. And right now it's just about question of speed. The Israelis say that they're sending planes as we speak. It's only about I would say a two hour direct flight if they could fly direct from Israel, it should be just about two hours before they could get there on the ground to potentially help. We're also seeing from Lebanon. A team of firefighters from Lebanon is going up there as well. I mean, these are the closest countries to where been most directly impacted. And hopefully they can get on the ground as soon as possible because as we can see, they need some help out there.",

This is what happens when we have a very large earthquake. We don't have an epicenter, so to speak, that's one spot. We have a line. We have an EPA line, where the entire area right through here shifts, and it was a strike slip fault. One part of the earth went one way, the other part went the other way, and they had been locked up in the same places for decades. And today, they decided not to be locked up anymore. And this is why we're seeing so much damage because of that push to the either to the East or to the West, depending on what side of this fault you were on? The reason why we're seeing so much damage is because we have three plates coming together the African plate, the Anatolian plate, and also the Arabian plate, and all of the damage that you're seeing is right there. And why was there so much damage? Well, because acceleration of the ground. The acceleration of the ground, pretend this is a building and all of a sudden the acceleration goes rapidly this way, the building shifts like this, the top doesn't shift with the bottom, because it just can't keep up. And we've seen so many buildings that just collapse this way. Possibly, if the top did catch up, it would have collapsed this way because the building supports those concrete pillars that are keeping those buildings that are keeping those concrete slabs aloft from storey to storey to storey were no longer any good. They weren't strong, they were broken. And they collapsed. And we call that panicking.

So the lessons that Ukraine can learn from these military training exercises here that by the way are just 170 kilometers from the Russian border are very significant because this NATO military exercise puts together the tanks and the infantry. So that they can punch through enemy lines and try to take territory which is exactly what the Ukrainians want to get their hands on these tanks to do.

French troops attack fictional front lines as Estonian troops pretend to hold them off all part of the Baltic Nation's annual NATO winter exercise to gel the multinational alliances into a singular fighting force. These military exercises feel different the French have bought in far more troops in the past.

Crude oil prices have not shut up since those December sanctions. SEBASTIAN (on camera): This may be harder though with oil products take diesel for example. Now Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters of diesel and last year 63 percent of those exports went to EU countries according to Kaplan. Now when it comes to crude oil Russia has been selling a lot of barrels that used to go to Europe to India and China.
