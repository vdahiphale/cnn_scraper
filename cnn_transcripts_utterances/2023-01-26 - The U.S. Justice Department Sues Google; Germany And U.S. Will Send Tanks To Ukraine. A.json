Now this complaint argues that Google has actively and illegally dominated the digital advertising market for many years as detailed by the U.S. attorney general in a press conference Tuesday. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  For 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.",

Secondly, the tools used by advertisers to buy that space. And thirdly, the largest automated ad exchange essentially linking the publisher with the advertiser. The U.S. government is calling for Google to be broken up and forced to spin off at least its online advertising exchange an ad server for publishers. Google responded with a statement saying: Today`s lawsuit from the DOJ attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising tech sector. It goes on to say their flawed argument with slow innovation raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. Google is not new to fighting antitrust legal battles. The DOJ sued Google for its dominance in web searches in 2020. The E.U. commission launched an antitrust probe into its conduct in digital advertising last year and has already fined Google three times in antitrust cases totaling more than nine billion dollars so far.

We turn now to Russia`s war in Ukraine. On February 24th of last year, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine and fighting there has continued in the now nearly year ever since. On Wednesday, Ukraine received what`s being called a major sign of support from the United States and Germany. The nations both announced that they`re sending tanks to the front line in Ukraine. Germany plans to send 14 tanks. And the U.S. is planning to send its special Abrams tanks to Kyiv. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the decision a turning point in the war and President Biden in a speech said the tanks will enhance Ukraine`s capacity to defend its territory and achieve its strategic objectives. The president also announced a group of 50 nations that are making other contributions in the form of military equipment and weapons. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He told them they`d be exempt from call up for military service in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of military-aged men fled Russia last year fearing conscription. More than 100,000 Russian servicemen already believe killed in Ukraine. It`s the most unpopular feature of Putin`s war so far. More recruitment may spur more resentment of him. But at the rate he burns through soldiers on the front lines means that this dilemma is only going to get worse foreign. His second biggest issue would be paying to feed the war. International economic sanctions are beginning to bite. If they chew into Russian citizens` pockets, then Putin has a problem. The dangerous high-wire walk Putin is trying to pull off keep the value of the ruble up, keep people in jobs, it`s only going to get harder. A cold winter next year, impoverished Russians on the streets risks a revolt against the war and Putin himself and this will play into Putin`s long- range concerns, an election 2024. In 2021, he signed a law allowing him to remain leader until 2036, but he has built a house of cards. Russian elections are neither free nor fair, Putin has snuffed out dissent, locked up opposition leaders, taking control of all media but even that requires mafia-style playing of Russia`s power brokers against one another. If he can`t make gains in Ukraine or worse starts racking up losses, his grip on Russia`s power game could weaken. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
