The candidates are hitting the campaign trail hard, trading barbs, sometimes personal attacks, as they look to pick up the support they each need to pull ahead of the race. This entire election likely to come down to just a handful of key battleground states. And that's where Harris, Trump, and their running mates have been today, where they and their surrogates will be laser-focused over the next two weeks.

You see the ferry in the background, the same one guests were trying to get to when the tragic collapse happened.

What we know, Jessica, is that the gangway collapsed shortly before 4:00 in the afternoon on Saturday as crowds gathered on Sapelo Island for a celebration of the Gullah Geechee community of black slave descendants. According to Walter Rabon, the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the gangway that led from the dock to the ferry collapsed when about 40 people were on it.

And then you realized once, you know, you can establish communications again and find out what's going on that it was not just here, not just our office, but the entire island, an island of 10 million people.And this is the fourth time now that you've seen a total collapse of the power grid. For many people, they've not have power come back at all. They've been now four days without power, which is very concerning because of course people's food starts to spoil. That's a real issue in Cuba because it's so hard for many people to get enough food on a regular day. When there's no power, that means there's no pumps to bring water to people's homes. A lot of people use gas to cook with and they're not getting the gas now from the gas lines so that is just, you know, a domino effect of problems. So when you drive around Havana you see people sitting outside their homes because it is so hot. People waiting in longer and longer lines for food and water, the few places. There's not really desperation just yet but there have been some protests at night where people go outside their homes and beat on pots and pans to show the government here how upset they are over the situation. The government that blames U.S. economic sanctions but, you know, some of these power plants, we were hearing today, are older than I am, and have not really been maintained over the years that the workers have had to make the pieces themselves to repair some of the things that break and then often Cuba relies on donations of oil from countries like Venezuela and Russia, donations that are just not coming with the same frequency as they had before. So it is a perfect storm of problems. And of course (INAUDIBLE) our lights going to be back on and whether they're going to be back on and stay on.

What's at stake? Because I hear you when you're saying it's not so much what was leaked, it's that, or what was breached, the information is probably the better word, but that it happened at all. COHEN: Well, the first thing that will be done will be the FBI will be called in. All of the intelligence agency will have to cooperate, certainly our collection of intelligence, those who had access to this information will be investigated. It takes time. It's an unlikely to be resolved soon and that's the danger in all of this. The Israelis may want to hold back and say, we're not going to share our, quote, \"attack plans.\" And let's be clear about this. The Israelis intend to continue to attack Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. The Iranian component, at least the attack upon Iran, is yet to come and President Biden and Vice President Harris have urged that the Israelis do not strike at oil facilities, do not go after nuclear facilities, because there's a fear that if they do that, the price of oil will skyrocket overnight. So people are concerned about the cost of groceries and gasoline overnight, those prices will go up. So we're concerned about the global economy and the Israelis need to take that into account. And I'm sure they're doing that. I'm sure they're listening to President Biden saying, OK, here's --we know you're going to respond, you should respond, but try to calibrate it in a way that does not provoke either the spread of the war throughout the region or a tremendous increase in recessionary pressures and inflationary pressures around the world.",

Their existence is under threat. Ours since World War II has not been except for the Cold War and the possibility of a confrontation with the then Soviet Union.So our standards may be very different than theirs, but we're asking them, please take into account the amount of innocent civilians you're killing because the sight of those innocent babies and children who have been killed and maimed is going to inflame world sentiment against you. The Israelis have to take that into account. I want them to take that into account. Even as they must defend themselves. So it's a tough spot that they're in but I think that Benjamin Netanyahu, who I have known over the years, I think he will listen to prime -- to President Biden, who is a friend of his, a friend of Israel, to say that please take care. The killing of innocent civilians, the potential starvation of a million people now in Gaza, that's something that the world is not sit on the sidelines. I am concerned that the Soviets, the Russians, or the Chinese, and others have not stepped in to say, hey, wait a minute, we have a concern here about what's taking place.

But we're hearing that everywhere. People coming together and really having a healing effect here in North Carolina.

The Navy has not identified the Zappers, that's the nickname for people in its Electronic Attack Squadron 130, and the Navy is investigating.Flash flooding is still a threat in parts of New Mexico after the state got hit with nearly six inches of rain overnight. We know at least one person died, nearly 300 people had to be rescued after that severe flash flooding near Roswell. Police and first responders were overwhelmed with rescue calls from people trapped in their cars. They were stuck on roofs. As you can imagine, a lot of cars were swept away, widespread showers and storms are expected again tonight, a flash flood watch remains in effect through tomorrow. And those storms will also bring the risk of large hail and tornadoes. A herd of elephants is getting ready to stampede the streets of New York City. Well, they're handmade life-sized elements actually. The art installation is touring the U.S. to raise money for conservation and each is modeled after a real living elephant from southern India. And each of them is for sale. CNN's Bill Weir has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the south hills of India, a conservation success story stops through the tea fields. A couple of hundred elephants living in relative harmony with a quarter million humans. The densest concentration of wild pachyderms and people in the world. RUTH GANESH, CO-FOUNDER, CO-EXISTENCE COLLECTIVE: They know all the elephants by name and personality. And they are the most incredible story. And if we could tell that story, we might be able to inspire a little bit more sort of close living with other animals as well.",

But when we started making elephants, they're the experts. They know the elephants better than we know it. So it's an amazing sense of pride and their kind of position in society has changed.
