It's set to resume, by the way, in about 40 minutes with cross examination.We also learned a New York appeals court has just denied the former president's latest attempt to overturn the judge's gag order against him. For more on this and other important issues, we're joined now by the former U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin. Judge Scheindlin, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, what's your reaction to this decision to, once again, deny Trump's lawyer's request to remove the gag order? SHIRA SCHEINDLIN, FORMER U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE: I'm really not surprised. They praised Judge Merchan for getting it right and for properly weighing First Amendment rights against the possible harm to the jury and to the witnesses. So they did what I expected they would do.",

So is it true that Trump was aware that this was a violation of the federal campaign finance law? And that's the underlying crime that has to be proved to turn it into a felony.

One of the things that we've talked about is that Donald Trump has this very complicated relationship with attorneys.Because he mostly wants them to act like Michael Cohen did. And Michael Cohen was willing to do that. Now we know one of the things that the defense is going to bring up, and probably pretty quickly, is how much Michael Cohen himself has benefited from his dislike of Donald Trump. He has built an entire brand around that for the last seven years. So how does that actually line up with the Michael Cohen that we just saw in court in front of the jury saying he regretted it, but there were some good times, this earnest person? And then you're going to have these social media clips of him just eviscerate Donald Trump, going after him on every front, saying essentially that he hates him and that he hopes something happens to him. Now all of this is going to be presented to the jury. And as you noted, Kaitlan, at the end of the day, these are the men and women who are going to determine this entire case. Do they believe Michael Cohen now or do they believe the defense, which is likely to say he lied to you then, why wouldn't he be lying to you now?",

Which is they are walking through each of the checks that he got from Donald Trump and where he would send an invoice to Allen Weisselberg from the Trump Organization and every check said, you know, this is for the retainer for legal services rendered. And Michael Cohen testified it was a false business document because there was no retainer and there were no legal services that were rendered on his behalf.

They walked through those checks once again.We've already been through those with two accounting officials from the Trump Organization. And I do expect that the defense is going to have to go through those the same way Michael Cohen did with prosecutors. But their question is going to be about Trump's involvement. They're going to remind Cohen that he submitted the falsified invoice. He received this check, and did he have any evidence that Trump was aware of this alleged scheme to falsify business records? They're going to really press him on that to get more specific and try to undercut the idea that somehow Michael Cohen has made the prosecutor's case and provided evidence that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Trump was aware that they were going to falsify business records to reimburse him. COLLINS: And there were also several moments where Michael Cohen -- I mean, he was he was talking -- he was talking about what it was like to have the FBI come and raid his house. And his -- he was staying in an apartment because his house was under renovation. His office at that time. I mean, the room was so silent, you could just hear everyone's keyboards clicking as everyone was typing exact quotes from what Michael Cohen was saying. As he was talking about how he was scared. He was frightened. He was angry the day that he pleaded guilty to his crimes to the Southern District of New York. He said it was the worst day of his life. I mean, he also seemed to kind of strike this, if not a sympathetic figure, but certainly someone who has this narrative that we all know is someone who gets caught up in Trump's world. And then as a result of it, ends up in a courtroom like the one that Trump is in right now.",

I think that there was a compelling part of his narrative as he went through the story.But I also think that he walked through kind of his falling out with Donald Trump, which was also part of this that was so interesting. Him, essentially, holding on to his loyalty with the former president, something that we know is really important to him. Talking about how he, at some point, stopped talking to him after that one phone call. Was the last time they ever spoke. And then he started having to go through Castello, who was going through Giuliani, and getting farther and farther away from the former president. But as you note, this is not the only person who has suffered from this fate, who has gotten this close to Donald Trump and then ended up in legal peril. This is something that happens to quite a few of these people. And one of the things we've been talking about all morning is this idea that, despite this, Donald Trump showed up today at court with a huge entourage of political -- politicians, political leaders, some of his family, them all knowing what happens to people who often get too close Donald Trump.",
