      "sentences": "In Ukraine, both sides are claiming some success as fierce fighting rages on multiple fronts. President Zelenskyy says the most intense fighting is happening in the south and the east with his troops repelling, he says, Russian attacks. A Russian-backed official in the Zaporizhzhia region claims that Ukraine has taken back at least one village in that area, but Russia's ministry of defense denies that saying it has kept the Ukrainian troops at bay.CNN's Ben Wedeman is live in the city of Zaporizhzhia with the very latest. Ben, you are not far from where we are told some of the fiercest fighting is taking place. What is the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we're just about an hour away from the town of Piatihatski (ph), which is the largest town so far taken by the Ukrainians in this counteroffensive. Now, there have been these claims and counterclaims about who controls the town, but I think at this point it's fairly clear by statements coming out of the Ukrainian defense ministry that it is now in Ukrainian hands.Now, just to put this in perspective, John, within the last week and a half or so since this counteroffensive began, the Ukrainians say they've managed to liberate eight settlements or about 44 square miles. However, if you go back to last September, when they launched an offensive in the Kharkiv region, in about the same amount of time they were able to liberate 4,600 square miles. So, clearly this offensive is getting off to a slow start. It's not clear if they're still involved in probing operations. It does appear that the Ukrainians have yet to commit the bulk of their forces to the offensive. But what we've seen, for instance, is that the Russians are putting up a fairly solid defense. Now, what we saw over the weekend was the use by the Russians of a somewhat new tactic. They loaded up a T-54 tank with as many as five tons of explosives. It appears that they perhaps put a brick on the accelerator and just pointed it at the Ukrainian lines. Now, about 300 yards from those lines it hit a mine and shortly afterwards it exploded. The blast, as you can probably see from this video, was massive. Now, it's not clear if the Russians were able to exploit this and actually break through the Ukrainian lines, but it does appear that this is a new tactic being used by the Russians, fairly crude in the grand scheme of things, but one that certainly is, if nothing else, quite dramatic.

He says that this act was intentional and that it targeted Republicans.Look, he says that the return address on the envelope was -- appeared to be from a constituent. That's the reason why he opened this letter so freely, really not thinking much of it. Now, he says that all of the recipients of these letters have so far been Republicans. He shared a copy of this letter with CNN and he pointed to two specific sentences. He says -- he says that these two sentences could be meaningful. It says, quote, to honor your recent accomplishments, it's important not to choke on your ambitions. Now, Owens says that this cryptic message could be a reference to the overwhelming majority of Republicans in the Kansas house and senate which overrode nine vetoes by the Democratic governor. Now, at least two of these were very controversial, one of them defined a man and a woman, and the other stated that -- that biological-born males could not participate in girls sports. Now, authorities are not saying that this is the motive here, but Owens is not the only lawmaker who feels that he's been targeted. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOLLY BAUMGARDNER (R), KANSAS STATE SENATE: There is some message. The message is somewhat unclear, but it was intended to be threatening. Everybody has to be concerned. Everyone has to take this and any subsequent threats like this very seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He faces extremism charges that his team says could extend his nine-year prison sentence by 30 years. The judge in the case has denied a request from the defense team to recuse himself, although it's not clear on what grounds they asked for the recusal. The team has complained about the format of the hearing, including poor audio quality on the court's live stream.Just days after being released from the hospital, Pope Francis leading Sunday prayers at St. Peter's Square before thousands. He thanked followers for their prayers during his ordeal. The Vatican says that the 86-year-old pontiff will keep a light schedule as he continues to recover from surgery. He is expected to meet with the leaders of Cuba and Brazil this week. And a ceasefire in Sudan appears to be holding for a second day as intense fighting in the country's capital of Khartoum has subsided, at least for now. The truce, brokered by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, came after at least 17 people were killed, including five children. This is after an air strike on a residential area in the city. CNN's Nima Elbagir is in South Sudan where a humanitarian crisis expected to get worse as hundreds of thousands flee the fighting in Khartoum. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This is Africa's largest refugee crisis. And you can see the conditions here for yourself. The people here are being largely ignored by the world. Aid agencies are doing what they can, but it is simply not enough. ELBAGIR (on camera): South Sudan is one of the poorest countries in the world. They barely have enough to feed and shelter their own returnees. And they're also being asked now to absorb fleeing Sudanese and other foreign nationals with limited support from the outside world. And it is almost impossible. With rainy season starting, what you see here, it's only going to get worse. So many of those speaking to us say that they feel a sense of humiliation, that the message that they're receiving from the world, from the international community, is that they are not worthy of support. And until aid arrives here in meaningful quantities, it's hard to argue with that. Nima Elbagir, CNN, Rank, South Sudan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, John, this was supposed to be an arrest operation to arrest two wanted suspects and it escalated into something much bigger that lasted 11 hours and only wrapped up in the last hour or so. Now, this took place in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank. This hasalready been a hot spot for militant (ph) activity and regular Israeli military raids. But what happened today was different. Not only because of how long it was, but because of the fierce gun battles, but also the use of new levels of weaponry from both the militants and the Israeli military. Now, we'll start with the militants. An IED detonated under an Israeli military panther command vehicle, essentially taking out its underside. We're seeing some dramatic videos where you really see the moment that -- what looks like to be some sort of pile or something on the side of the road blows up as this vehicle goes by. We do know that's where some of the Israeli -- seven Israeli injuries are coming from. But also from the Israelis, for the first time since really the second anti-fatah (ph), that means from the early 2000s. The Israel military used an Apache helicopter to fire on Jenin while they were trying to extract those soldiers who were stuck in several army vehicles that were rendered inoperable because of these gun battles, because of these IEDs. As we noted, soldiers were sitting there for hours waiting to be extracted. So, they brought in this Apache helicopter. Now, the Israeli military say that they fired on open areas to provide cover for their soldiers, but to see the site of an Apache helicopter over what is a very dense urban area while these gun fights are going on, that goes to show you the level of escalation that this is reached. Now, we know that five Palestinians were killed, at least 90 others were injured. We have the seven Israeli forces injured. We know that at least two of the Palestinians killed have been claimed by the Islamic jihad military group. But at least one of the other killed was a 15-year-old boy. And among the injured is a girl who was injured critically and a freelance photojournalist who was injured while he was covering what was happening. And from the videos we're seeing, he's very clearly wearing a press vest and a press helmet. But this just goes to show the alarming level of escalation and violence and especially the weaponry, the IED, the Israeli military say that's something new. They say that's something alarming for them. And then to see, again, an Apache helicopter over such a dense city, that is very alarming as well. John.",

So, if Benjamin Netanyahu wants to stay as prime minister, then something has to be essentially given to them. But 4,500 new settlement units were approved.

McIlroy needing to sink a 41-foot putt for birdie on 18 to catch him, but came up just wide.And that would put all the pressure on the 29-year-old from Denver.
