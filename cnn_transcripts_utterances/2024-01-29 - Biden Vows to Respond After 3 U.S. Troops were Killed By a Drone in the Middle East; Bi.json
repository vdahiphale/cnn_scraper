Plus, a bipartisan deal in Congress could lead to the first major immigration overhaul in decades. And what might be the broadest campaign promise we've heard in a while, Donald Trump claims that he'll deliver nothing short of world peace.Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, January 29th, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington where Intelligence agencies are working to determine exactly which Iran-backed militia to hold responsible for a drone attack on a small U.S. outpost in Jordan near the Syrian border that killed three American soldiers. Officials say at least 34 more troops were injured in the attack, it's a number likely to rise as soldiers report symptoms of possible traumatic brain injury. President Biden vowed that the U.S., quote, \"will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Kim, good morning, it's wonderful to have you on the show. So, how much credence is the U.S. going to give these Iranian denials? How much control do they actually have over these militias?",

And I don't think you're going to see the U.S. strike an Iranian target, say inside Iranian territory unless they can provide to the whole world that sort of case, unless they can make the case that Tehran itself ordered this attack.",

I'm calling on the Biden administration to strike targets of significance inside Iran.\" And then John Cornyn was direct in a post on act, he just said, \"Target Tehran\". He later clarified he was talking about the Quds Force and the militant wings. But I mean, these are pretty, you know, saber-rattling calls.

I'm told that UNRWA hasn't actually seen this Intelligence report coming from the Israelis, even though allies appear to have seen it. And they've seen it, and it's been enough for them to pull their monies. So, the U.K. for example doing that where I am right now. So, you know, on one level, you know, a horrible situation for people in Palestine -- in the Palestinian area sort of relying on this aid, but also, extraordinary, very serious accusations about members of the United Nations or at least are under the United Nations payroll being involved in the October 7th attacks. I mean, how on earth did that happen? Why didn't the U.N. have that Intelligence if Israel was able to get that Intelligence? Suggestions that they've just gone through the mobile phones of those people. So, and the accusations are absolutely immense against United Nations.

By and large, this storm is coming to an end, it is exiting off the east coast, maybe some light drizzle or light showers for Long Island and the I-95 Corridor going through New York City. But with the exception of Nantucket, Cape Cod, this storm will come to an end by mid-morning. We've got a clipper that will impact the Great Lakes through the middle part of the week. And then we focus our attention  on the west coast, because this is where it gets interesting, very busy, lots of moisture, and that is attached to the Pacific Ocean. So it is warm and it is filled with rain, and it will impact much of the west coast. It already is, radar very busy across the state of Washington at the moment where we've picked up nearly 7 inches of rain. Sea tack has already received about just over an inch and a half of rain. So you'll see more precipitation in the forecast. The middle part of the work week, we're going to focus our attention across San Francisco northward. That's where we anticipate the heaviest rainfall, only the highest of elevations across the sea here in Nevada will receive snowfall, because again, this is an atmospheric river with connections to the Pacific Ocean, so it will be generally warmer than average. Now, we see that rainfall shift to the southern sections of California, so the potential here exists for stream and urban flooding, even some mud and debris flows on recent burned scars, and don't forget about the wind factor that could take down some trees and power lines.
