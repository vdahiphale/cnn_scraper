And I'm not saying that you having kids or not having kids means that you can't be a part of this conversation, but the part that I worry about the most is whether or not it's a slippery slope.I think in this case, the charges are fair. Because even if this was the most responsible child of all time, why would buying a military- style weapon be a good idea to put in the hands of a 14-year-old, any 14-year-old? I don't care if they got straight A's. I don't care if they come home all the time, eat their veggies, say their prayers, it doesn't matter. That is not the type of weapon that belongs in any child's hands. But I do think that -- I think about how potentially something like this could be weaponized against the most vulnerable parents, and that's where I get a little bit concerned. But I think in cases of obvious neglect with this, what would happen in the case of Michigan with the Crumbleys and the school shooting there, yes, that makes sense, when you're knowingly putting these self-destructive things in the hands of children and you know they have problems, as a parent, you have to answer to that. I'm just not sure if the blanket answer is, all parents need to be responsible for what their children do.",

If I knew -- and I taught special education, and I had children that were emotionally disturbed. And if I had known that one of my parents bought one of my children, a gun and I called them my children because they were my students, I would be terrified, I would be calling that. So, to even know that -- nobody knew that, but for a parent to do that, for a child that has already been brought -- saying that -- if you listen to the audio the father says, I'm pissed off to know that my son Was talking about a school shooting. So, if you're pissed off to know that your son is talking about a school shooting, I'm pissed off that you bought him the gun. And the parents now have -- we have parents who will never see their children again. We have a whole 2,000 students who were traumatized probably for the rest of their life with PTSD. If you listen to the students that many of our anchors and reporters were interviewing, they were trembling with fear just having to relive that. But I don't think it's just about the parents being responsible. I think that this instance, this is the right case. And I think the Crumbley was the right decision. Why do they have an AR-15? And this goes back to why don't we have more mental health services? We always want to go to a one shot solution versus what -- I'm using the word poorly, but a one stop solution when there, we know that these issues are more complicated. And I just -- I've been thinking a lot about like what would I do if I was alive 50 years ago? But I also think what would people think about us in 100 years when they see children, year after year after year, getting murdered in schools, and us arguing about whether or not we should have taken the weapons away from them to kill.
