Now, as roads buckle and homes lie partially swallowed by the ground, scientists warn landslides are set to become more frequent as the climate fuels heavier rainfall and more powerful storms.

At a total cost of more than 100 billion bucks, the ISS holds the record for most expensive object in history. After what was supposed to be an eight-day trip, the Boeing Starliner capsule is finally home from the International Space Station. Nearly three months later, the spacecraft experienced thruster issues when delivering two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, to the space station in It returned to Earth without them on board. Now, NASA and Boeing have to start working on the issues that came up during the test flight before the space agency can deem it ready to carry out routine trips to the ISS. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And all of the issues that Starliner suffered while in space, the thruster failures, the helium leaks, did not prove to be a problem when it did the deorbit burn, pump the brakes, and reentered the Earth`s atmosphere. Those were the critical maneuvers that NASA was so worried about if Butch and Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, Starliner`s crew, had been on board. And so now, Boeing and NASA are going to be looking at all the data. NASA needs to decide if it`s going to require Boeing to conduct another crewed flight test before it`s fully certified to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As for Butch and Suni, they`re going to be up there until February of 2025 before they hitch a ride back on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. That`s essentially the backup here. But NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says that`s what this program is all about. The Commercial Crew Program. It`s about having a backup system. Redundancy. If one spacecraft fails, there`s another spacecraft run by a different company that can bring these astronauts home. So, this is what the commercial crew program was designed for. I just don`t think anybody thought that this backup system would be tested quite as early as it was needed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
