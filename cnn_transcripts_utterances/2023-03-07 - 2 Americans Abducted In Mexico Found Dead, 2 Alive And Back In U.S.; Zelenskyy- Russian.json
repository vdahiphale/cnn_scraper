The State Department isn't saying exactly who in the U.S. government actually has those bodies.But it's our understanding that they're still in Mexico, but they've been recovered by U.S. officials. When it comes to the U.S. working with Mexican authorities on this, I asked the State Department just how satisfied they are in terms of those joint efforts and they expressed a deep appreciation to Mexican authorities for working with them to try and get to the bottom of this, to recover these bodies and to get those other two Americans back home. And there are also questions now about justice and accountability. We've heard from the White House earlier today, we heard from the State Department just now pressing that the United States wants to see justice and accountability. What they aren't doing, though, is being very explicit about what that could look like. They're pointing to U.S. law enforcement officials to look at the contours of what justice could actually look like. And one reporter at the State Department briefing today asked if there's a possibility of actually deeming these gangs to be terrorist organizations. And State Department Spokesperson, Ned Price, said that those gangs right now are designated as appropriate and the United States will use tools available to them down the road if it comes to that, but not being very explicit as to if they're ruling in or out that possibility and that's a question that has come up. And we'll continue to watch for more information from the State Department on this. Of course, we have Josh reporting that the families of these Americans have been notified of the circumstances and what they have been through and I'm sure that we'll learn more from their families in the coming days and hours.",

This is airline by airlines. So certainly United Airlines will - I expect - will be banning him from flying on United. But that information is not shared. There's not a program to be able to share that across the industry. So if he is not in custody, he could potentially get on another plane. That is part of the problem that I'm calling out here. I also want to call attention to the fact that our planes are fuller than they have ever been, seats are closer together, which means that there's more passengers on those planes than ever before. And due to cost cuts, the flight attendant staffing has been cut down to minimum, so there's fewer of us, more passengers. Flight attendants are expert at handling issues and de-escalating and trained in responding to these situations. But when there are fewer of us, it's harder to get to them faster. It's harder for us to help and it's harder for us to direct passengers to help when there's an imminent threat of bodily harm.",

I think we need to look at that discussion again and flight attendants need to be given the training that we were supposed to have right after 911, which is crew member self-defense training.That is a training that is conducted by the Air Marshals. We have been able to get funding for that, but it's on a voluntary basis. So flight attendants have to go on their day off, they have to spend their own money to get where the training is occurring and the hosting costs for that. They're not charged for the training. But this is something that should be incorporated into our training right now because we should have all the tools necessary to be able to respond to this. We have not only been aviation's first responders responding to emergencies and the health of passengers on board, but since 911 we've also been aviation's last line of defense. And with the rise of violent events on our planes, it is time to renew this discussion about making sure that this is a mandatory part of our training, that there is a passenger banned list across the industry that federal government controls that includes a due process, so we're there - we're not violating people's civil liberties and we have a way to get off if you are improving your behavior and getting better. But this can be managed by the federal government and shared with the rest of the - with the industry so that we're not allowing these people back onto our planes. Those are severe consequences that we need to have to serve as deterrence. And then when these events happen on board, we have to have enough resources to be able to respond.",

It would not be a strategic victory for Russia. They would gain ground. It wouldn't be a strategic victory for Ukraine either.But Victor, we've been looking for the last several months at Bakhmut through a soda straw as one small town in a very large area. If the Russians do gain control of that city, and I don't believe they will, I'll caveat that a little bit, they will have the opportunity to conduct operations further to the northwest and south as you've just stated, but the problem is they can't hold on to it. And I would also agree with Gen. Zelenskyy, I guess I'm agreeing with both of the people who are posing conflicting view that this has become a psychological battlefield. For the Ukrainians, they have held this city, this relatively small city of about 70,000. There's only about 4,500 people in it now for almost seven months, Victor, and they have drained the Russian forces that have continued to attack wave upon wave. So as we've said so many times before, this has been a meat grinder for Russia. Ukraine has also taken a serious amount of casualties. But it is Ukraine's intent to say you are not taking any more of our ground, it must stop here. So it becomes a psychological victory for Ukraine having to hold on to this so long, much like earlier in the war, the Battle of Mariupol.",

They want to ensure that despite the back and forth, despite their efforts to have very clear competition, despite the reality that these are very clearly for the two superpowers at this moment in time, that if nothing else, they want to keep lines of communication open. For the most part, they feel like that has been reestablished in the wake of Xi and Biden's sit down in Indonesia last year.
