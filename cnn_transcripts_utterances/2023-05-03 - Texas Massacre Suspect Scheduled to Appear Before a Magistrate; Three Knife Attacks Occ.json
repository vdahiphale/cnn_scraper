Everyone knew he was wanted. This is a story that has been widely out there. And the woman that he lived with, who's described by authorities as his wife, has been charged with aiding and abetting, hindering prosecution, avoiding arrest.

Remember, they have the control of the House but the Democrats are in the minority.There are procedures in which they can force a vote on the house floor but they need 218 signatures, support from 218 members to actually force a vote. The Democrats currently have 213 seats, they need five to break ranks. And I spoke to several of those Republicans that could potentially break ranks, none of them have any interest in this issue. So, this continues to play out. Of course, the next big step is that closed-door meeting at the White House next week from the top floor, congressional leaders in the House and the Senate. But they're coming from completely different viewpoints and how this crisis needs to be averted. Republicans aligning themselves in the Senate with a House GOP effort to test spending cuts, a slew of spending cuts to raise the debt ceiling for one year's team, that passed the House last week. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, says, he is behind Kevin McCarthy and he does not plan to cut a separate deal on this issue. Democrats on the other hand are saying, this just simply needs to be raised without any spending cuts at all. Talk about those issues later. How it gets resolved remains to be seen. And in talking to senators this morning, it's clear that both sides are still digging in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD):  The president has wasted 90 days.

Look, you know, Kevin McCarthy is holding the nation hostage.

When Democrats and Republicans did it because it wasn't seen as a weapon you wanted to use because of the implications for the full faith and credit for the country. So, this is an artificial problem, self-created. And now, Biden is in a position where he does need to deal with it. He can't simply ignore it. This should be off the table for the good of the republic. But my guess is, if I had to say what the last page should look like, Biden should agree to a couple of, you know, proposals made by Republicans, the more reasonable ones. You know, in my mind that would be, you know, permitting reform for energy, calling back COVID relief, workfare requirements for Medicaid and say, we're going to do that in a budget.
