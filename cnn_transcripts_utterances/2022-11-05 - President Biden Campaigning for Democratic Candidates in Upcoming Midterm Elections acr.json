After months of campaigning, there are now just three more days until the midterm elections. The balance of power in Congress is on the line. President Biden hitting the campaign trail hard this weekend, putting his political weight into some of the most critical races, making campaign stops today in Illinois and Pennsylvania. CNN's Arlette Saenz is live for us in Illinois. So Arlette, what was Biden's message in these crucial final moments before voting?",

All of this coming as Democrats' control of Congress could be in jeopardy over economic discontent among voters.The president was here in Joliet, Illinois, on behalf, or appearing alongside a House Democrat in a competitive district, and he really zeroed in on his administration's plans to try to lower prescription drug costs and also preserve Social Security and Medicare, programs that the president has argued would be on the chopping block if Republicans get control of Congress. And the president, as he talked about Social Security and Medicare, also had some choice words for protesters on the issue of those who say Democrats are part of socialism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Generations of Americans have counted on it, and it works. If we didn't have Social Security, the poverty rate for those over 65 would be four times what it is now, four times. I love those signs when I came in, socialism. Give me a break. What idiots.

You heard the president over the past few weeks really try to sharpen that economic message, especially as he has tried to draw that contrast with Republicans, often touting the things that his administration has done. But one of the big questions is whether these efforts over the course of the past few weeks will really resonate with Americans as they are looking at their pocketbooks heading into Tuesday's election. Now, the president departed just a short while ago. He is about to campaign over in Pennsylvania with former President Obama. That's one of the few competitive Senate races the president has been able to go into during this campaign. The White House has been aware that some campaigns have not necessarily wanted the president there due to his lower approval ratings, but they feel that Pennsylvania is an area where he could be helpful. Of course, it has personal significance to the president as well.",

So both parties very zeroed in on this, and not surprising that we're getting another rally from Obama and President Biden that Arlette just mentioned over in Philadelphia later today. Now, here Obama really painted a stark contrast between Fetterman and Oz. I'll let you listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Listen, it's easy to joke about Dr. Oz, and all these quack remedies he's pushed on TV. But it matters. It says something about his character.

But also, they also want to continue to pitch Oz as a moderate. So we're going to see, it's going to be interest to see what he says on the stage, and also what the former president says.

You can forget back in 1994 Republicans elected a governor in New York in a year that was very bad for Democrats. In 2018, Democrats elected House members in Oklahoma City and Charleston in a year that was very bad for Republicans.The core problem that the president's party faces in the midterm is usually differential turnout. The side on the out of power is more motivated to vote, and that can create a problem even in states with a strong Democratic lean. Having said that, the last public polling does have her back over 50 percent. But there's no question, you can vote with your feet kind of thing. Look where they are sending all this fire power. And it's a closer race than they want.",

His national approval rating on election day may not be that different than Trump's was in 2018, somewhere around 45 percent.The difference was there were states in 2018 where Donald Trump, competitive states, was still over 50 percent in approval. In fact, Republicans ousted Democratic incumbents even in a bad year in four states in 2018, Florida, Indiana, and Missouri among them, North Dakota, because Trump was popular, still popular in those states. By contrast, this year's Biden's approval rating is pretty low almost everywhere, 45 percent or below, down 40 percent or below in some of the key swing states like Arizona and Georgia. There is not a lot of recent precedent for candidates from the president's own party winning in states where his approval rating is that low. And so you see Biden being deployed mostly to places where he is closer to 50 percent. New York state, as you mentioned, being a strong Democratic state. And in many ways I think Biden is being used less to drive kind of enthusiasm in any particular state than to try to set a national message which largely they have been unable to breakthrough and do.",

He said, \"Folks at Twitter, past and present, are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realize many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation. I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.\"What's interesting here is what he didn't say, which is the question everyone has, you know, going on right now around these layoffs is how will these layoffs end up affecting Twitter and its approach to the election? you have Twitter saying that its commitment to election security and election integrity hasn't changed, and neither has its content moderation policies. But you have civil rights leaders who say they worry that these mass layoffs could harm Twitter's ability to enforce the policies that it has on the books even if they are still there. So the question here going forward is how will Twitter be able to respond to misinformation or conspiracy theories that might arise while all of this internal chaos is happening all around it. And you also have lots of advertisers pulling their ad spend from Twitter, which is further putting pressure on the company to find revenue in a very sensitive time for the company and the country.

So I think in talking to democracy experts, many say it's the post- election period that is going to be more critical to watch and for Twitter to be vigilant about for misinformation and conspiracy theories.",

New York has not elected a Republican governor in 20 years. And the last couple of days have been just a complete flurry of campaigning by Kathy Hochul, trying to get out and talk to voters, trying to increase enthusiasm, because we have seen in some of the polls that enthusiasm has decreased among the electorate ahead of these midterm elections. Early voting, we have been talking about early voting and how it has broken records in other parts of the country. Early voting is still relatively new here in New York. And we have been looking at the numbers. More than 800,000 people have cast their ballots early across the entire state. So Democrats hoping for big turnout, that's what's going to be key here in New York, a place where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one. But there has been acknowledgment from some Democrats, including from the governor herself, that there is definitely a lack of excitement and that people may not come out and vote. That is going to cause a problem for her. So she will be here, as you said, rallying alongside former President Bill Clinton.
