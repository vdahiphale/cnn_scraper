Her campaign has pretty much indicated the decision will come by Tuesday. One person it will not be in North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who is with us now.And, Governor, it won't be you because you took yourself out of the running. Why? GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): Well, good morning, John. Let me say that I am 100 percent behind Kamala Harris in her quest to be president. I am confident that she will win. I don't think I've ever seen this much enthusiasm for a candidate since Barack Obama in 2008 in North Carolina. And as you know, Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008. I believe Kamala Harris will do the same thing. She has a wealth of choices. I know personally, and well, all of the governors who are reportedly in condition - in contention here for her selection as vice president. I don't know Senator Kelly that well, but I know that he is a patriot and a strong candidate as well. So, I feel comfortable that this is going to be a strong ticket. This was just not the right time for me or my state. And I informed the Harris campaign pretty early that I did not want to be in condition - contention for this. But I'm going to go across the country. I'm going to work for her. I'm going to work hard in North Carolina. We have the biggest governor's race in the country. We're trying to break our legislative super majority. I'm not personally on the ballot this time, but I am working as if I were because everything I care about is on the ballot this time.",

She's going to talk about things in North Carolina, like helping active military families get child support. She's going to talk about the fact that she and I are working together on a medical debt elimination plan that's going to help 2 million North Carolinians get rid of about 4 billion in federal debt by incentivizing the hospitals. She endorsed North Carolina's plan yesterday. These are the things that matter on the ground. These are the things that Donald Trump, not only doesn't care about, but fights actively against.

And, you know, as I've gone on TikTok and posted videos of my time on the campaign and what I know to be true of this candidate, I see so many people saying that they feel hope for the first time, that they see her as a real person and that they're excited to get to know her.

And I think that when we see moments like this go out into the sort of wild, wild west of the internet and be reinterpreted by the people who are there who are not digital strategists, right, but who are likely teenage girls sitting in their bedrooms creating these fan cam edits, making these memes, that we see a reinterpretation through their perspective. And that, to me, is really, really exciting as we look at this election and the power that young people hold, not only at the polls, but in defining the narrative landscape.And so, young people have really been able to take this on, take something that was sort of a dig and change it into something that's been a viral moment, a way of introducing her to a new group and really something that I think we'll be studying in the future.",
