I'm Laila Harrak.Bracing for landfall, parts of Mexico and the Southwestern U.S. -- Hurricane Hilary. The powerful storm could bring floods and catastrophic destruction. Ukraine says its pilots are already training on F-16 fighter jets, but just when those planes will be ready for use in combat is an open question. And who will get the trophy in the women's World Cup? We will find out just a few hours from now. A live report from Sydney, Australia, ahead. The Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico are bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Hilary. The historic storm expected to make landfall in the coming hours in Mexico's Baja California peninsula. But the region is already feeling the effects. Hilary is now a category 1 storm, but it remains dangerous with maximum sustained winds of around 85 miles an hour. It's expected to bring catastrophic and life-threatening flooding and California's governor has declared a state of emergency for southern parts of the state. Officials are urging residents not to underestimate the storm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGISTBut I'll let you know here's the advance of Hurricane Hilary, now supporting winds of 85 miles per hour. We've got an intermediate advisory. It is moving a little more quickly north-northwest at just about 20 miles an hour. Its position puts it about 480 miles south- southeast of San Diego. All right, here's some of that moisture moving across the southwest into western sections of Arizona and into Southern Nevada. This is going to have broad reaches. I did mention Southern California because that is its own test, because never before, or at least in several generations, have we seen tropical storm warnings out in Southern California. San Diego into Los Angeles, Bakersfield into Coachella into Palm Springs. This rainfall is going to be significant. And some of these coastal area, one to maybe three, four inches of rainfall. You get up into higher elevations, it will be more. And then those higher peaks into the Santa Rosa Mountains, the San Gabriel Mountains and into the Santa Ana Mountains, this is where the rainfall is going to be significant. Because Hilary's moistures orographically, and that's what we mean, there are orographic dynamics with this and will wring this moisture out to the tune of eight to ten inches of rainfall. Now, let me point out, these areas hardly get any rainfall this time of year, just fractions of an inch. And to see this volume of moisture that will materialize over the next 24 to 48 hours, Laila, this is potentially catastrophic. We could see infrastructure damage, power outages, the wind will kick up. Probably a tropical storm intensity, but because it's going to be here for the next 24 to 48 hours, that's the big problem. We'll keep you updated. Back to you.",

California does not typically experience hurricanes or tropical storms like this, but we're having a very unusual situation in which a hurricane formed off the west coast of Mexico, and it's traveling northward, whereas most hurricanes that form in that region travel westward out to the Pacific Ocean. So, they don't affect California regions so much. This one is traveling northward through relatively warm waters and it's prompted the first tropical storm warning in California history.

And so we have areas that are really unprepared for that level of rain even though it's just sort of five, six inches, which isn't that much for a hurricane these days.

At least seven people were killed and close to 150 others injured after a missile hit the city center on Saturday. While over in Kyiv, top military officials say Ukrainian pilots have started training on F-16 fighter jets. But who will provide the planes and when are still open questions.

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And, Laila, we saw some delay on that front. There were questions around the timeframe of when we would begin to see Ukrainian pilots receiving that crucial training on the U.S. main jets.Now, according to Ukraine's Air Force, that training has begun. They are receiving training from U.S. instructors within Ukraine. And, of course, typically, this sort of training on these advance jets would take months, according to Ukrainian officials. Typically, it would something around 32 months. But they say this elite class of Ukrainian pilots set to take part in this training program can master the operation of this jet within just four months. Now, we've also heard from Ukraine's defense minister, he's given a slightly longer assessment saying it could take a minimum of six months. And, of course, that will be a blow to Ukraine's air defense and military aspirations over the coming months, particularly in the harsher winter months as they continue to grind on with that counteroffensive. But this training will prove crucial and the hope for Ukraine is that the supply of these jets will mark a shift in their counteroffensive, give them that all-important edge in the skies. And, of course, there still remain a couple of questions. We've heard the Ukrainian defense minister saying it remains to be decided what weapons these jets will be kitted out with once they're supplied to Ukraine. We know, of course, that the U.S. has expressed its commitment to approve the supply of these jets as soon as that training is complete. And, of course, there are still talks ongoing between the U.S. and its European partners over what other countries might potentially supply Ukraine with these U.S.-made F-16s. But, of course, we also know that President Zelenskyy has been in talks with counterparts in Sweden over the possible supply of the Swedish-made Gripen fighter jet. That is expected to be an ongoing discussion. The hope there is it will bolster Ukraine's air defense operations and also, of course, offensive operations as they continue to battle Russia's ongoing encroachment in the eastern region. Meanwhile, those talks are ongoing, but Ukraine and Sweden appear to have agreed on a statement of intent on the supply of Swedish-made armored vehicles to boost Ukraine's counteroffensive capabilities on the frontline.",

Whether or not they actually will walk through Lahaina, the burn zone, or just fly over the scene, Deanne Criswell, the FEMA administrator, could not say but promises the president will stand with the people of Maui and lend an ear to local leaders who are very concerned that the reopening plans, the rebuilding plans, anything going forward, won't include them as has been the case here for generations. The number of people in shelters, though, is going down as more move to hotels around the island and off-island as well. And there's a lot more personnel. We're hearing there are now over 1,000 personnel here, both state and federal. That has been a big cry early on, mostly a citizen-led response, now seeing more of the official response, and they're trying to fold those folks in but meeting some resistance from the locals who have pretty much said, look, we set this up ourselves, you're a little too late.

Now, we've heard from officials here, including the sheriff, Patrick Labat, of Fulton County, that Trump and his codefendants are going to be treated the same as everybody else. So, let me walk you through what the normal booking process would look like here at the jail for a newly charged defendant. And that process would involve hours of waiting, simply waiting for their turn to get fingerprinted and get their mug shots taken. Also, there is typically a body search that is conducted by a jail deputy. Although in the past, high-profile defendants who have voluntarily surrendered have been able to forgo that body search. A medical screening also typically happens and a pretrial consultation to determine whether it's appropriate for someone to be released without bond.

And that is because a judge could choose to conduct that arraignment virtually or choose to allow them to waive that right to an arraignment.

It was actually an armed robbery at a sports store nearby and five suspects were detained. Officers also confiscated two firearms, sports merchandise and cash. The attack was so close to the restaurant that it rattled not only the candidate and his family but also everybody there.The shooting happened only ten days after Fernando Villavicencio, 59- year-old outspoken anti-corruption candidate and former investigative journalist, was gunned down after a rally in Quito, the capital. And it also happened a day before the Ecuadorans head for the polls on Sunday for the first round of presidential voting. In another development, the family of Villavicencio, the murdered candidate, has filed a legal complaint against the government. They accuse the state of murder by willful omission for failing to protect the life of Fernando Villavicencio, knowing that he had received threats from various criminal groups.
