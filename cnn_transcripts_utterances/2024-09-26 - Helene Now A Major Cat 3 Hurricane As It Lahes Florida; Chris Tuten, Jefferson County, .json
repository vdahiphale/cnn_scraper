It just pushed into that threshold as it is lashing the Florida coast before it's expected landfall later tonight.Right now, every county in Florida is under a storm warning, watch or advisory. We have Meteorologist Derek Van Dam live for us in Apalachicola. Derek, what are things looking like there?",

      "sentences": "Yes. I think it's important to note that this now is a major hurricane. This will be the fifth major hurricane to strike the Florida -- Florida in the past since 2017. So this is a significant development.The hurricane hunters here finding winds near the surface strong enough to make that call to a category three storm. Now, we're in Franklin County here in Apalachicola. We're facing a multitude of threats, storm surge warnings. We have a hurricane warning in effect. But we also have a flash flood warning and also a tornado watch very near us. We've had over seven inches of rain in the past 36 hours. And this isn't even directly associated with Hurricane Helene. It's tropical moisture surging north. But the heaviest rain is still yet to come. So I think, once we look back at history books with this storm, we're going to see that the catastrophic flood potential with it is going to be a big player. You can see on this map here, the highlighted area in pink is known as a high risk from the Weather Prediction Center. And it is so rare that they actually issued these about 4 percent of the time. But 40 percent of the fatalities and 80 percent of the damage occurs within these very rare high-risk events. That stretches from where I'm located, the Florida Panhandle, right through Atlanta metro and into the southern Appalachians. Asheville, they're facing a one-in-1,000-year flood event potential. Now here in Apalachicola, locally, we've just been having to steady rain since last night. This is not residents' first hurricane, obviously. They've done all the typical preparations, boarding up the businesses, their homes, their windows, putting down the sandbags as well. They know what these storms could potentially bring and they're focusing so much on that exact track because they know that this is a game of miles. A shift west, a shift east determines who gets the worst impacts. But one thing's for sure, this is going to be that significant surge into this very low-lying Big Bend area of Florida. It is such a low sea level region. We're only six feet above sea level here. As the storm continues to not only grow in intensity, but balloon in size. Brianna, this storm has the potential to have one of the largest tropical storm wind fields in modern record keeping across the Gulf of Mexico. And that means that impacts will be felt well away from the center. And it's fast-forward speed is also crucial to this weather forecast because, as it moves inland, it doesn't have the time to dissipate and weaken. So it's going to bring tropical storm force and hurricane force winds well inland to central portions of Georgia as well as into South Carolina. I mean, as a meteorologist, I've never seen the entire state of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina under a tropical alert like what we have right now. This system is going to not only bring these destructive winds inland, but also, again, that catastrophic flash flood potential. The National Weather Service is coming out of Greenville, North Carolina, calling -- actually comparing this to the flooding event of 1916, also historic in nature. The list of adjectives are endless here with this potential of the storm as upwards of over a foot, even 15 inches locally of rainfall could fall out the sky before the storms all said and done -- Brianna?",

You said that he had a compassionate look, so I was curious to delve more into that.But I do want to ask you, the CBC Chair Horsford, you said, was part of that exchange that you had with Higgins. He's called on Higgins to be censured. He thinks he should be referred to the Ethics Committee over this. What do you think about that process? CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK: Well, I believe that the CBC chair, Steven Horsford, he handled the whole situation masterfully. Because we can't sit by the sidelines and allow hate to reign, especially in our congressional chambers. There must be a sense of decorum. There must be a sense of action. And we cannot allow hate to take the floor, especially in this environment we're seeing more and more violence. And so I believe, and I stand by him, throughout the whole conversation because, as we were going forward, he asked me, are we going forward? I said yes. So I appreciate him standing up, not just for us or black people, but for every Haitian-American who's in fear right now. So definitely, we have to take a closer look at this when it comes to ethical standards. But we have to actually understand, who are we as Americans? This not -- should not be a CBC issue where the CBC is standing up or Chairman Horsford is standing up. Every single member of Congress should be outraged. There is no place in these United States to have any kind of weaponization to innocent people. There's no place for misinformation. There is no place for dehumanizing comments. And there is especially no place for any kind of white supremacist comments. And so we need to take a stand and end this now.",

And if you would for the Higgins matter as well, which, albeit, is a very different one. Do you see that as a good forum for both of these things? CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK: I believe that whatever is going on right now, we respect the process and we're cooperating and we're trying to see what's going on. But the two cannot be compared because what we're looking at are derogatory comments towards an innocent group, where we're using federal funds to actually put out these derogatory comments and to also weaponize the power of the seat that the American people trust in to target an innocent group. Those are substantially different things that we're looking at. It should not be tolerated. So even having the conversation at the same time and bringing them together shouldn't happen. You know, we're one nation and, in one nation, we have certain principles that we abide by certain principles that we actually believe in. And we have to stand tall for those principles, for every single group. Today, I had a conversation with one of the ambassadors from Alandra (ph) and she said, you now, she'll be careful in these moments because these moments are actually precursors to when you have violence against communities. Especially when you're saying dehumanizing language, when you're blowing the blow horn, saying peoples' I.Q.s are lower than the Americans. These are the actual steps that we see from white supremacists that lead to violence. And we must take a seriously and look at it for what it is and not conflate the two issues.",

Yesterday, we had -- as you said, we had a G-7 loans and grants for Ukraine's reconstruction with more in contrast with the speeding. And it was a truly helpful for us. We must restore normal life. And we greatly value your leadership, Mr. President. We also have 26 bilateral security agreements with partners based on the G-7 security operation. We have a strong security agreement with United States. And we are grateful for it. And we will fully implement it. And it's very important that we share the same vision for Ukraine's security future in the E.U. and NATO. And Ukraine is going that. Mr. President, its number performs on this path. And today, we have a new support package, $7.9 billion. This will be great help. And I raised with President Biden the plan on victory. Today, we are preparing to discard the details to strengthen the plan, coordinate our positions, views, and approach. Our teams will work together to ensure that implementation of our future steps. And today, in the morning, I've met with both Senate and the House. And thank you for them. And may very bipartisan support and to all American people together, we have to win we will win. Thank you.

During Covid, some people we're getting mortgages for under 3 percent.But this is definitely moving in the right direction. This is the lowest level in two years. And it's a big relief to all of those frustrated first-time homebuyers out there who are dealing with this historically unaffordable housing market. Now, home prices are still at record highs, but at least borrowing costs are going down. And this is really the clearest evidence yet of how the Fed's big moves are having a real-world impact, right? Because just a week ago, the Fed had that jumbo-sized interest rate cut, the first since Covid. And let me show you exactly how this plays out for people who are out there with a mortgage. So say you we're trying to buy a $500,000 home with 20 percent down last fall, when mortgage rates were really high. Now, your monthly payments are actually $460 less than if you had tried to buy a year ago. Now that may not sound like that much but it really adds up. That's $5,500 less over the course of a year if it's a 30-year loan. So it's $166,000 less. And another thing that we're seeing is a lot of people who already have mortgages, they are scrambling to take advantage by refinancing. There's been a spike in demand for refinancing. And, Danny, don't forget the Fed, they've signaled they're not done cutting interest rates yet. So this could continue to help all of those first-time homebuyers out there and people who have a mortgage, but they have a high rate -- Danny?",
