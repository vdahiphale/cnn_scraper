She said she wouldn't have worked there for 34 years if he didn't. And this is the first time Trump is apparently smiling, kind of laughing. He seems to be enjoying this now. Again, she worked for him for decades. He's also paying for her lawyer.But to your question about emails, what's amazing to me is that the heart of this case are documents, business records, a paper trail, something Trump is famous for never leaving, the way he speaks, even that someone could recount a conversation and tie him to something. He's very careful. Not a texter, not an emailer, is always very careful not to leave a paper trail. So the fact that we're here on a case about falsifying documents to help in a campaign, of all the criminal investigations into former President Trump, I'm surprised it's this one that brings us to trial for the first time.",

You're going to see a softer touch for this particular witness. She's talking about her experience with Donald Trump. She is the role for the defense to humanize him. You hear a lot about the myth of Donald Trump and, of course, all the bravado and what you think might happen in Trump Tower. Her role is to demystify all that and portray him as somebody who is approachable, which she talks about saying of Trump sometimes he would peek his head into her office and say, go home to your family, which I thought was very thoughtful of him. Talked about him being a fair and respectful boss, that he respected her intelligence. Now, you're looking at a woman testifying about this. Well, don't forget the power of optics. All this time we've been hearing about the tabloids of Karen McDougal, of a Stormy Daniels and the perception, of course, within the Access Hollywood tape that's being referenced, although not actually played because it's too prejudicial, according to the judge, is painting the picture of somebody who's not respectful of women, somebody who is, in fact, disrespectful of women, somebody who would have perhaps misogynistic viewpoints. This is a woman testifying about a 34-year professional relationship where she is respected for her intelligence. Where she is being treated fairly.

Wolf, so clearly the Donald Trump's defense lawyers are using her as a mini character witness, which you're borderline allowed to do, but it's the kind of thing that can slide through in most cases. But the reason they called her as prosecutors is simply to get in these documents and it's also important to note when we're thinking, about the pacing of this case, witnesses can be four days long, we just saw with Pecker and they can be 20 minutes long, like we're seeing with Rhona Graff.So there's going to be days where we get through not even one - one witness is on stand all day. There's going to be days where we could have three, four or five witnesses on the stand. What prosecutors need to do now is present these documents to the jury in a way that they can understand. This is a - prosecutors are bad at this. Prosecutors do not know how to stage things. And so they need to - we used to say you need to think about it like you're putting on a theater production. How am I going to show these ledgers in a way where the juries can understand them, can make sense of them and you're going to need somebody to walk you through them. I thought they might try that with Rhona Graff, but somebody else is going to be the tour guide through those documents. Would it be Michael Cohen? I'd be really reluctant to do that.

They don't have to prove - they - all they have to prove is that there was some basis tied to the election that made Donald Trump's team nervous enough to try to pay and falsify business records.

But, the ultimate question of whether they had an affair are different. But then, Graff says that she vaguely recalls hearing Trump say that she was one of the people that may be an interesting contestant in talking about Stormy Daniels, but that it was all part of the office chatter. I mean, just keep in mind this person, Rhona Graff, sat on the platform for the inauguration. That's how important and how close she was to Donald Trump. And she says of the - of his - of her presence, that's why she assumed that she was even at Trump Tower.
