And I should note that Donald Trump has really all but erased Harris' gain with Hispanic men in this country. And so this has been a huge focus for the Trump campaign, and they're really trying to, you know, hone in on that message in these final days, even as they're receiving so much backlash for some of those comments that were made by people who they gave a platform to at Madison Square Garden, and you have yet to hear Donald Trump himself address it or condemn those remarks publicly.

Independent voters, likely voters in North Carolina, you see that Harris is four percentage points ahead of Trump in our poll. A poll is different than exit polls, but when you compare that to what Biden did four years ago, according to the exit polls, it looks about the same.Now again, Biden lost North Carolina, so she'd probably like to be doing better with independence, but look at black voters, guys. Harris in our current poll among likely African-American voters in North Carolina is 59 points ahead of Trump, obviously a big category for her and important. But Biden four years ago had an 85 point advantage among African- American voters in North Carolina. You see in Georgia, a similar situation, perhaps not as dramatic there among black voters. If you look at that middle line, Harris and Georgia has a 71 percentage point lead in our poll over Trump. Biden won them by 77 points in Georgia four years ago. But look at the independent voters there in Georgia at the top. Trump is running seven points ahead among likely independent voters in Georgia in our poll. Biden won them by nine when he won the state of Georgia, which was a big flip from a Republican state to a Democratic state, and that, Harris is definitely going to want to improve on what our polls show in terms of her performance with independent voters if she's going to be successful.",

They're casting votes 10 percentage points higher than our men.That's a little bit lower, just a tick below the spread, the gender gap spread in early vote at this point, six days out, five days out from the election in 2020, where women had an 11 percent of win advantage over men in terms of participation in the early vote. It's about 400,000 fewer votes this time around, the gap between women casting votes and men casting early votes that occurred four years ago. I would not read too much into that because that could be made up on Election Day vote. We don't know. We will see.

And they've tried to do it all kinds of ways. They are trying to fact check him on the X, formerly Twitter platform. They are trying to plead with him on the platform.

And I just want to give you an idea of sort of how much they're trying to do this outreach. This is an example of a Stephen Richer tweet. It was from earlier this summer. Elon Musk is basically saying that the only thing that's safe is paper ballots and voting in person for one day. And Stephen Richer says, \"Can I please give you a tour of our election facility and mail voting process in Maricopa County, Arizona? You can go into all of the rooms. You can examine all of the equipment. You can ask any question that you want. We'd love to show you the security steps already in place, which I think are very sound.\" And then he goes on to say, essentially, please give us your recommendations after that. We'll run them up the food chain. We'd love to put your very entrepreneurial brain to good use. But you see there the mismatch.
