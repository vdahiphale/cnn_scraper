Yet it happens far too often. We must drive of the inequities that contribute to violence against LGBTQI+ people. We cannot and must not tolerate hate.\" I want to bring in now presidential historian Jon Meacham. He is the author of \"And There Was Light.\" He also occasionally advises President Biden. Jon, great to see you as always. It seems like, you know, every week, we report on stories of violence, we report on stories of political violence, we have so much toxicity, obviously, in our national dialogue. It feels like the worst it has ever been. I know, well, maybe you'll tell me it isn't, but can you put this in some historical context for us?",

This is going to sound rather grand, but what we saw in this incredibly sad story that had an element of heroism is the best in the worst of it (ph). And it is tragic and terrible that we have to have horrible things unfold for us to see this kind of heroism, but that is the nature of reality.What we -- the way the life of the nation works, I think, is the way our lives work. We are called to do the right thing. We are called to accept others. We are called the love our neighbors as ourselves as scripture and every moral tradition orders the folks to do or encourages folks to do. And it is incredibly difficult. And the extremity of this kind of mass shooting is the worst manifestation of the darkest impulses in human nature. And so, our answer has to be, overcoming darkness with light. I was thinking about Dr. King this weekend, his sermon after the terrible church bombing, 16th Street, church in Birmingham in 1963, the fall of 1963. And his refrain in that sermon for the funeral, for those young women, was -- by the way, the subject that day was the love forgives and it was youth Sunday and they were on their way to conduct the whole service when (INAUDIBLE) dynamited the church. He talked about how we had to find some way to bring good out of the -- I think the story of the heroes of this tragedy are examples of that.",

And it is up to all of us to say no, that that cannot be the way we are. But if we don't love our neighbors as ourselves, we have to attempt to do so and to fight against and stand against -- I don't want to use the fight -- we have to stand against the objectification of other people.

There are -- the way presidents speak about these things does matter because it does set a tone. And the people can be skeptical about that. I understand that. Even President Biden at one point said it is time -- we are past thoughts and prayers.Just to put in one quick thing here. I'm a gun owner. The safest place to be (INAUDIBLE) is somewhere near me with a gun. But my view is these assault weapons, these weapons of war, they've come to our streets and our nightclubs and our schools, must be restricted to the military. It is not particularly a debate, it seems to me. And for those who, in my native region in particular, south, say, oh, no, this is an encroachment on the Second Amendment, my test is this: What if one life is saved because these assault weapons are made more difficult to obtain? Just one. What if it is your spouse or your friend or your child? And so, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good for that. Our president's manners, our president's tone can affect the temperature. You mentioned it before. President Biden, I'm honored that he's a friend and I help him when I can, I think he is particularly well equipped to do this. I think President Clinton did it after Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City is actually a pretty good example here because President Clinton had just had a terrible election partly because he had banned assault weapons in 1994 in a bill that Joe Biden was critical in doing. And there is the terrible attack on the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. President Clinton goes. He takes this moment and talks incredibly well. That same season, George Herbert Walker Bush, who had just been defeated three years before, resigns from the NRA because the NRA had put out a fundraising letter referring to federal agents as jackbooted thugs. And so, Bush, the senior Bush, resigned from there in a very important letter. So, yes, it can make a difference. What would make the biggest difference is if we all remember that what runs America, what should run America is the declaration of independence. The declaration of independence begins with that majestic idea that we are all created equal and we're all endowed by our creator no matter our color, our sexual orientation, no matter what. And that is our mission statement. That is what we said we wanted to be. No one forced that on us. That's what folks who look like me decided to say they believe in the late 18th century. We are now in the 21st century.",

And there is something going on and it is not just guns and it is not just racism. It is something insidious in our culture.

I think that we have to draw a sharp line and say that no person should ever be harmed because of who they love or how they live. No person should ever feel as if there is not a safe space. To your point, that if you cannot be gay in a gay bar, then where can you be gay? But certainly, I think, again, the problem has become that all of this has been conflated as to one thing.

It only took in $2.3 million, which is much less than it was supposed to and less than the other movies from this weekend. Why? That's what Hollywood wants to know.Back with that is Mara S. Campo, Joe Pinion, and Charlotte Alter. So, it's about the sexual assault and harassment that Harvey Weinstein subjected people to. Why is this movie not doing well? MARA S. CAMPO, JOURNALIST:  Yeah, and you would think it would do well because it's also about empowerment. You know, these two female reporters who bring him down and he gets his, you know, just do. But I think part of it is that we're still too close to. Not because we are traumatized and we can't bear to look at it, but it's still playing out. Harvey Weinstein is still in courtrooms.
