But he said he would only do it if his doctors recommended it. During Thursday's news conference, Mr. Biden reiterated that he's already taken three neurological exams whilst in office, with the last one done in February.He also responded to a reporter question about comments he made on the 2020 campaign trail.

That could be when Trump announces his running mate.But ahead of that, the Republican candidate is having to respond to the controversy surrounding Project 2025. It was put together by the Conservative Heritage Foundation, which describes it as a roadmap for the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency. That starts with a call to recruit and train thousands of loyal conservatives to fill federal government positions. Other points include reversing federal approval of the abortion pill, Mifepristone, eliminating the Department of Education and defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which the Heritage Foundation accuses of being unfair to conservatives. CNN's Steve Contorno looks at what Trump has to say about Project 2025 and who exactly is behind it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "When Donald Trump claimed he had no idea who was behind Project 2025, we decided to take a look. Who is exactly involved in this effort? It turns out a lot of people Trump should be familiar with.140 people who worked in the Trump White House or his administration helped to write, produce, contribute or edit Project 2025's signature achievement, a 900-page playbook for a next Trump term. It includes people who reached the highest levels of his government, including six cabinet secretaries, four people who were appointed by Trump as ambassadors, many individuals who were involved with the execution and architecture of his immigration policies, as well as several high- ranking officials. There are dozens of others who are involved with organizations that have been overseeing Project 2025, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. And when we took this information to the Trump campaign, they said, yes, we acknowledge that a lot of people who work for Trump have helped out on Project 2025, but they don't speak for Trump now and they may not work for him again. They said, if you want to know what Trump believes, you should look at his website. His entire agenda is posted there, as well as the Republican Party platform. Trump himself tweeted overnight that, quote, I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it. And unlike our very well-received Republican platform, had nothing to do with it. He went on to claim that this is all an effort orchestrated by far- left Democrats to tie some of the more controversial policies from this Heritage Project 2025 effort to Donald Trump. Trump trying to keep it at arm's length, but obviously that is made more difficult by just how closely involved many of the people who work for him have been with this project.

And those temperatures aren't really going to go down anytime soon.Now, that will change in the West, though. We've had all of this heat in the West where Vegas at 120. So now we're going to see a hot day today. A little cooler tomorrow. But then notice what happens by Sunday. We really lose a lot of this intense heat. You can see it really on the temperatures. The four day forecast here from Fresno from 111 down to 103. Now, 103 is still hot, but it isn't 111 or 115 where you've been. Even Bakersfield cooling down a little bit. But Phoenix still more days in a row above 100. But by Monday, only 108. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Authorities across Western United States are reporting at least 28 suspected heat related deaths since the heat wave began on July the 1st. 14 deaths are being investigated in Santa Clara County, California alone. The medical examiner says two of the individuals were unhoused. That can pose an additional risk since people who may have nowhere to go to escape the heat are more vulnerable.A toddler in Arizona died on Tuesday when her father left her in a car with no air conditioning on. And a motorcyclist died last week in Death Valley, California, where temperatures soar to 128 degrees Fahrenheit or 53 degrees Celsius. Now, a nation in shock and the community in mourning. British police have still not been able to talk to the man they say he murdered three women in an attack involving a crossbow. Details next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

There's no clear motive just yet, but several U.K. media outlets have reported that Kyle Clifford, the suspect in question, may have had a romantic relationship with one of the two daughters. The BBC suggesting that they understand that Clifford had a relationship with the youngest of the two daughters, Louise Hunt, who, again, was just 25 years old.The police have said that they believe Clifford was known to the three victims. But, again, we are still waiting for more details on that. The police have yet to comment on any specific romantic relationship between Louise Hunt and Kyle Clifford. But, again, this has drawn widespread tributes, not only from sporting figures, colleagues of John Hunt, again, BBC sporting commentator, but also from members of the government. We've heard from the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper. She has said that the loss of three women's lives in Bushey is truly shocking and shared her condolences with the family and the community. FOSTER: Yes, but, I mean, the country's been really engaged in this story, haven't they? I mean, initially, it was the crossbow because we've had similar incidents in the past. We don't have a big gun crime issue in this country compared with other countries. But knives, crossbows, other weapons appear to be increasingly used.",

      "sentences": "Well this new study from the American Cancer Society looks at cancer cases and deaths among adults age 30 and older. And it estimates that 40 percent of cancer cases and 44 percent of cancer deaths could potentially be preventable. They say they're attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors.Now, what are those risk factors? Well, the leading one probably won't surprise anybody. It's cigarette smoking. They estimate that that contributed to 19 percent of cancer cases and 29 percent of cancer deaths in this study. The next is excess body weight followed by alcohol consumption. Also a big risk factor up there is exposure to UV radiation. The risk for skin cancer, of course. They also looked at people's diets, not eating enough fruits and vegetables or eating a lot of red meat or processed meat, as well as cancer-causing viruses. Now, they found that the cancers that were most linked to these potentially modifiable behaviors, the top one is lung cancer, that connection to smoking. The second is female breast cancer. There are links there both to excess body weight and to alcohol consumption. Skin melanoma, of course, from sun exposure, and colorectal cancer. Now, the researchers told us that there's actually some good news here, which is that folks think maybe it takes a long time to reverse your risk for these kinds of cancers. But actually, changing behaviors, they say, can start to reduce risk pretty quickly. So on a personal basis, it's the things we hear about all the time. Don't smoke, maintain a healthy body weight, cut back or stop drinking alcohol, exercise, and, of course, use sun protection. But the researchers here also focused on the importance of things happening from a societal level, policy changes that can make it easier for people to live healthier lives. For smoking, for example, they said the thing that's been the most effective in reducing smoking rates is making it more expensive through excise taxes. And they point out that a pack of cigarettes in Missouri costs about half as much as a pack of cigarettes in New York State. And if you look at cancer rates for those two states, they are dramatically higher in Missouri than they are in New York for lung cancer. And so the takeaway here is there are things we can do to try to reduce our risks, but there are also things that need to be done on a bigger societal level to try to make things healthier for everybody.
