South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol says he will lift his emergency martial law order after hours of chaos. It was the first time since 1980 and the first time as a democracy South Korea was under martial law, throwing the country into political uncertainty. Now, hours ago lawmakers unanimously voted to request President Yoon lift the decree, ruling it invalid. Under South Korean law, the president is obliged to comply with the national assembly's request, and it does appear he will do so. President Yoon, though, plunged South Korea into political uncertainty late Tuesday night when he addressed the nation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden, who is currently in Angola on a separate trip, is being briefed on the situation and the U.S. is monitoring all developments out of South Korea. I want to bring in CNN's senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee, who's with me now. And as we've said, you know, a lot has happened over the past few hours. Pretty fast moving story here. Yoon now saying he will drop the martial law order. I mean, what are you hearing from your sources here obviously, South Korea is such a key ally for the United States. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Frankly, Omar, the Biden administration was completely surprised, taken aback and shocked by the developments overnight in South Korea. This was completely unexpected for folks here. Not to mention, of course, people in Seoul as well. Initially, the National Security Council at the White House had said they were seriously concerned by the scenes that were unfolding and they did make a point of saying that the White House never got a heads up from Yoon and his government about this announcement I think to make the point and to emphasize that there was no coordination and certainly the U.S. was not expecting this kind of move from the South Korean president. We are waiting to get just a more fulsome response from either the president himself or a White House official on even just the decision by Yoon Suk Yeol to declare martial law, even though now he has said he would drop it and some of the reasons that he initially cited for doing so, he was talking about the need to, you know, protect the country from communist forces in North Korea, eradicate anti-state forces. We did just watch a briefing at the Pentagon, where the Pentagon spokesperson did confirm that as you know, while the U.S. and ROK government officials have been in touch, there has been no change in U.S. force posture in South Korea. Of course, as you know, there are nearly I think, some 30,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Now that Yoon has said that he is going to lift martial law, we are waiting on any kind of reaction to that latest development. I suspect that the U.S. will basically say that that is a welcome development, given that they were watching the initial scenes unfolding with a lot of concern. You know, Paula was just talking about the backlash that is clearly expected inside South Korea against Yoon. I think a big question right now, Omar, is what kind of backlash is there going to be coming from the Biden administration when again, we do get just more of an engaged response from the White House. You know, we haven't gotten sort of a direct response from the president on all of this. The one thing that he told reporters earlier -- earlier today was confirming that he had been briefed.",

He is the director of the Hyundai Motor Korea Foundation Center for Korean history and public policy. You know, thanks for being here. You know, President Yoon obviously now saying he will lift the order, but really, there's no going back to politics before this order. I wonder what you sort of see happening next in regards to South Korean politics and in particular, President Yoon's future? TROY STANGARONE, DEPUTY DIRECXTOR, INDO-PACIFIC PROGRAM AT THE WILSON CENTER: Well, the first question will be, what steps the national assembly takes next? We've already heard some discussion, as was mentioned in the opening about potential impeachment. There will be questions about whether he lawfully took and implemented this emergency act. If you look at the details, it would seem as though he tried to present this as an act to where the national assembly was the one causing the impairment of the government, and it doesn't seem as though that is what the act is written for. And so in that context, the question will be whether Yoon took these steps to resolve a domestic political problem rather than to take and resolve an actual emergency. And so, in that context, if he is viewed to be seen as exceeding his authority, I would expect that eventually there will be a push towards impeachment.",

President Yoon won by just a tenth of a percent in the last election over Jae Myung. But compared to a lot of other democracies, South Korea is very turbulent, very energetic, but ultimately, it's a democracy at the end of the day.And this idea that they would be turning the page and going back to something seen under the dictatorships of the '60s and '70s and early '80s, I think was something that is going to be a real shock to the system in South Korea, because had he not lifted the order, that's where we might be heading.",

Is he in a weakened position? Which is likely the case if he does survive.If he doesn't survive and is removed from office either by resigning or by taking and being impeached, what is the next political leadership look like? How does that take and impact policy towards the United States in the region? And I think this is a very delicate time. When President Trump first came to office, South Korea had gone through the impeachment of Park Geun-hye, you had a weakened political leadership that made it difficult to try and deal with an incoming Trump administration. And it seems as though we're going through that pattern again. And even if Yoon isn't impeached, he's still going to be taking and approaching the Trump administration from a weakened position. And I think that will make it more difficult to take and manage alliance relations.",

In a statement, the president also requested the national assembly to immediately stop its reckless actions that paralyzed the functions of the state through repeated impeachment legislative manipulation, and budget manipulation. Now, I was quoting from his statement there. He declared martial law Tuesday night sparking hours of political chaos and really uncertainty in the country.

You have the opposition party that controls parliament, the opposition party of the previous president, Moon Jae-in that was very much about pro-engagement with North Korea.But then you have President Yoon's administration, which takes a very hard line stance and wants to bolster its military. And every time that North Korea tests a missile, you know, South Korea responds with a -- with a military act of its own. So the tensions on the peninsula have been rising. President Yoon's policies have been deeply, deeply unpopular. His approval ratings tanking and he has essentially blamed the inaction, the gridlock on North Korea and North Korean operatives infiltrating his opposition. That was essentially his argument for declaring martial law in the first place, which his opponents kind of quickly dismissed as not being based, really, in reality. It wasn't about an external threat as much as internal politics. But no doubt over North Korea for -- for months, ever since President Yoon took office, they've been trying to inject as much division as they can into South Korea, even putting out statements praising his predecessor while criticizing him. All of this, you know, with the hope of injecting instability, political instability. But the bigger issue here is the vulnerability of a democracy. South Korea's democratic institutions have survived this, but this raises a lot of questions about the stability of what had been considered for the better part of 40 years, a very stable democracy in South Korea with the peaceful transfer of power, even if ex-presidents ended up having to go on trial and even go to jail for corruption charges. You know, the power was always transferred peacefully. This martial law has brought people over 40 back to a day when things were very different in South Korea, people under 40 that grew up taking their democracy for granted. Now all of a sudden had a real wake up call, but for people in authoritarian countries, leaders of authoritarian countries like Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia, yes, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, this is just going to give them ammunition in their own state media propaganda to point at the vulnerability and the chaos and the dysfunction of democracy, which is the argument that these strongmen leaders have been making as they continue to kind of work together to form this anti-West coalition. And, of course, South Korea in this region is a crucial U.S. ally you have almost 30,000 American troops stationed in South Korea, not to mention 50 plus thousand stationed in Japan. And the fact that the U.S., like everyone else was broadsided by this, it completely came out of left field nobody -- almost nobody, except for perhaps the closest members of Yoon's inner circle were expecting this to happen until it did. And now here we are, hours later, the chaos subsiding, but the serious questions really do remain, Omar.",

South Korea is more known for its K-pop and cultural exports as well as its cars and phones than this kind of seemingly crazy act in a democracy.But we have to keep in mind that South Korea's democracy is still young as Will, your correspondent in Asia, already mentioned. It is only about 40 years old, only starting in the late 1980s, did Korea slough off or break out of the chains of authoritarian dictatorship. Korea had three dictators from 1961 to 1987, 1988. And it was a very, very difficult time with massive human rights abuses and all sorts of suppression of civic voices, and this is not something that South Koreans or the rest of the democratic world want to see. I think the fact that the South Korean National Assembly, the big majority, came together in a unanimous vote in the middle of the night speaks to the strength of South Korea's democracy. It's important to remember that the head of President Yoon's own conservative party, the Peoples Power Party, the head of that party, which is not necessarily President Yoon, the leader of the party, condemned right away this declaration of martial law and worked with the opposition, Democratic Party leader, to gather the votes, gather the national assembly members to put down this kind of a disruption of democratic process.",

The President Yoon's cabinet was already in trouble prior to last night and today. Even at the end of November, he publicly was saying that he might be reshuffling the cabinet and other top positions.So I find it strange that he was trying to lean on his cabinet to come together and trying to follow some semblance of protocol. After having declared martial law in order to end it, because the national assembly mandated it. It seems odd that he's trying to restore some procedural law and order when he's already been so weakened, and the cabinet members themselves, their positions are, you know in a big question mark situation. As far as the relationship with the U.S. goes and what it means for an incoming presidential administration in January, again, a question mark. I think it's possible that if we have a Trump administration dealing with this situation perhaps -- I don't know, maybe there would have been a little bit more leeway -- I don't know what the Biden administration did or say, but I'm sure I can guess that they were or demonstrating or expressing deep, deep concern and a return to democratic rule and a lifting of the martial law declaration as soon as possible. I cannot imagine South Korea and I can't imagine the South Korean public, given its history of dynamic civic activism to support and sustain democracy. I cannot imagine that public being silent or being silenced, even through martial law. So the way that it ended very quickly doesn't really surprise me.

Have you ever wondered if your boss secretly wishes you'd just pack up and head out the door?Well, I'm sorry to say, sometimes they actually do. Now, don't get me wrong. Employers generally want to attract and keep talent. Who doesn't love a loyal, hard working employee like yourself? So why would they want you to leave though when you're doing a great job? That's a big question, but that's why we've got CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who is here to shed some light on why this might happen. She does a great job. We don't want her to go anywhere. Vanessa, what is going on here? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Right back at you, Omar. But you know some companies do want their employees to leave. And this is largely because companies maybe have over-hired and they need to get rid of some people, but they don't want to fire them, and they don't want to have to lay them off, because if they do, then they have to pay severance and they have to pay benefits. And that's money getting employees out the door. But a couple of ways that we've learned that companies are actually trying to get people to quit on their own are they're saying, hey, guys return back to the office. Five days a work -- five days a week in the office. No more remote work. That may send some people out on the quitting lines, reducing workloads. I mean, for some people, yeah, they don't want to do a lot of work but for others who are overachievers, probably like us we want to be doing some work in the office. We want to be working. And then excluding employees from key projects, so not putting people on the big projects of the day or the year. And then if your employer is giving you a poor performance review or you're not getting a raise, that may have you thinking twice about whether or not you still want to work for this company and that may have you looking elsewhere and those things ultimately have gotten some people to quit to the employer's big smile, Omar.",

They don't have any other protections.And employers can make your life really difficult if they want you to go and it is not illegal. However, what is illegal is if you feel like you're being pushed out the door for reasons of discrimination. So if your employer is discriminating against your age, your race, your natural national origin -- these are things that if you do feel like your employer is doing, you do have a leg to stand on, a legal leg to stand on. So it's important to notice if you feel like those things are happening. But ultimately, Omar, is this good for the business at all? Is this good for companies at all? The answer really is no because this could essentially backfire. If word gets out that you're trying to get people to quit, what happens when you actually want to hire people? At the end of the day, I spoke to an HR recruiter yesterday because I wanted to understand more, and Laura Mazzullo, who runs East Side Staffing, told me, she said quote, getting someone to quit is not a good employer brand strategy, exclamation point. Word gets out fast and people will not want to work there going forward. It will have a long tail of bad consequences. So yes companies may be doing this for their bottom line, but at the end of the day, people talk Omar and someone is eventually going to find out that some of these companies may not be doing good business. And then they run into this scenario where they wish that those people who quit actually maybe stayed at the end of the day.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, some companies certainly are. They feel like workers are more effective in the office. They also feel like they have a lot of real estate. They have a lot of office space. They want to be able to justify having all of that by having employees back in the office. But there have been a lot of studies, particularly in Europe, thatshowed that actually four days a week workweeks in general are better for morale, better for employees. They feel better about the company, but also that remote work actually really helps people feel good about working for the company. So there's a balance. There's a balance. Some companies may find that they can retain really good employees through hybrid -- hybrid work, but some on the other hand, say, you know what? At the end of the day, we need to justify having this large workforce and these large office spaces. We need them back in their seats in the office -- Omar.",
