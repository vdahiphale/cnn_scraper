Now, the supporters of Issue 1 say that they won by trying to keep this as nonpartisan an issue as possible, urging voters that this was about keeping government out of their lives. The group that was against Issue 1 said in a statement that is heartbroken but it will regroup and aim to 2024 in battleground states. And in regard to those battleground states, it's sending shockwaves through states like Arizona where abortion rights advocates there are also trying to get such a measure on that 2024 ballot.

So, it's incumbent upon Republicans to recognize we need to change the conversation to more on abortion limits. And what is an acceptable level of limiting abortion? Some say 15 weeks, others say more, other say less but make sure the conversation is about abortion limits and also about what we can do to help the mothers in these situations. The women who are pregnant and need help from whether it is the government or from the private sector. And that's where the conversation needs to go. Look, I think when it comes to Democrats, you look at Virginia, Democrats took over the House in the Senate. And the concern with that, for those who wonder who cares about the state of Virginia and how the House and Senate --- House of Delegates and Senate is traditionally how the Virginia Senate votes in the year before a presidential election, that candidate win.

Polls this far out are not predictive of the outcome, especially when you have such a great night for such a critical issue that has been front and center for democratic wins since Roe v. Wade was overturned. We saw this happen in 2022, Rosemary. And I'm sure Alice and I were on your program when so many we're predicting a red wave right before the 2022 elections.Except for me, of course, I knew that abortion and threats to democracy were going to be key going into the 2022 midterms when Democrats also had a great night. And I think that's going to exactly be the case in 2024. And I think the problem with Republicans and my dear friend Alice just demonstrated it is that they shouldn't be talking about anything except for letting women make decisions about their own bodies, with their families, with their doctors, and with their faith. If that is something that they adhere to, period. That's it. No one should put a limit on that, except for women. And women are standing up to say no politician, no government official, no elected leader should be in the room with me while I make a decision that is critical about my family, about how and when I should raise a child. That is one of the most personal intimate freedoms and rights that we have as Americans. And until Republicans understand that they're going to continue to lose elections. And so, going into 2024, there's no question that Biden has work to do with all of his coalition. But that is exactly what the campaign is focused on. They're rolling up their sleeves. They're having a great night tonight celebrating but then they're going to roll up their sleeves and focus on communicating this message along with threats to democracy and continuing the job of boosting the economy going into 2024.",

We're not punishing the women or punishing the doctors.We're not making this an issue where a woman who is in this situation is the victim, is the bad person here. And let's look at where can we agree because the alternative -- and Maria, I'm sure my dear friend will push back on this. And some Democrats are fine with abortion up until the nine months and the third trimester abortion. That is absolutely something that should not ever happen. And people say that that's not an option but it is. If you don't put a limit on it, there's -- there is no limit. So, it's important to make sure that we discuss where can we agree on this issue. But also, we also have to have Republicans make the concession, the necessary concession, there has to be exceptions for the case of rape, incest, and life and help of the mother because we cannot steer from that. There are situations where people -- whether it is a victim of rape or incest or life or health of the mother, those decisions need to be taken into account when we're talking about legislating such an important decision.",

That that is just a lie, a misinformation that Republicans are spreading. And that is absolutely not true. And Americans understand that this is a decision that should be in the hands of women and their doctors.And look, the reason why women see any limit like 15 weeks, as frankly, a ban on abortion is because so many women have different circumstances. One woman is completely different from the circumstance of another woman and you cannot legislate the uniqueness of women's bodies and the -- and the tragic things that might occur later on in their pregnancies. You just can't legislate that. So, you have to give women and their doctors the freedom to decide what is best for them, for their lives, for their babies, for their families, period. And again, until Republicans understand that, they're going to keep losing elections. So, you know what, bring it on. Continue to make this a focus of their elections and Democrats will continue to win. And that's exactly what Democrats are going to do going into 2024, Rosemary, to your question about how we're going to harness this one, the same way that we have up until now. By not making it a Democratic issue, by not making it a progressive issue, by making it an American issue focused on personal freedoms and personal liberties which Republicans are trying to take away which Republicans as an extremist position, are trying to tell women what to do and women and men and families and Americans across the board including a good sliver of Republicans are standing up to say no.",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, we heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu which has sparked this whole discussion when he was speaking yesterday. Talking about how Israel would have, in his word's overall security responsibility for an indefinite period. Now, I think those words were deliberately vague. One to give Israel maximum flexibility as to what does come the day after this war is over.And also, because he probably doesn't really know himself exactly what is going to happen inside the Gaza Strip after this war is over. Now, we heard from the defense minister there saying that it's not going to be Israel governing the Gaza Strip, and it's not going to be Hamas governing the Gaza Strip. But assuming that those two things occur, what are the other options? Well, I suppose the most convenient option would be to have the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli occupied West Bank to come back into the Gaza Strip which it lost control of when it was violently arrested from it by Hamas in 2007. But of course, Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, is anyway lacking in legitimacy among the Palestinian people. He's now in his 19th year of a four-year term, and you can hardly see him riding in the metaphorical slipstream of Israeli tanks into the Gaza Strip to take control. Although he did say, in conversations with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken over the weekend that that would be a possibility, but only if there were major strides towards an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Right now, of course, that seems pretty fanciful. So, what are the other options? Well, maybe some kind of peacekeeping force with the U.N. or friendly Arab states could be a possibility as well. And I suppose there's also the possibility for perhaps a period of time for Israel to take control. But although there are far-right ministers in the governing coalition who would like nothing more than for Israel to reoccupy the Gaza Strip on the ground, as it did from 1967 until 2005. That also seems incredibly likely. And we had that warning from the White House against the possibility of this happening, but I don't think there are really any easy solutions or any obvious solutions that are likely to happen. And I think that the cold reality is that while Israel is focused on this military campaign and entering Gaza City which it sees as a kind of headquarters for Hamas and to try to free those 240 hostages that are still being held by militants in the Gaza Strip, that is the focus. And I don't think a huge amount of thought, Rosemary, has really gone into what happens the day after this war is over.",

And the way I look at this, is that the polls are telling us one thing that is real. And that is that Americans are dissatisfied with President Biden's leadership, they're unhappy about the economy, and they question whether he has the physical and intellectual capacity to do the job for another four years. But what these elections are telling us is that even when all of those doubts are present, when you have an actual campaign that focuses voter attention on whether they want to entrust Republicans with power, they may choose to vote for Democrats anyway. Despite all those doubts about Biden. And that instinct is especially powerful in the large metro areas, the urban centers and inner suburbs that were the consistent threat in the results tonight whether it was in Kentucky, Virginia, Ohio or Pennsylvania for the state Supreme Court election.

I think, right now, the polls are telling us that we are seeing a lot of dissatisfaction with Biden. That is primarily what is being registered in the polls. What these election results are telling us is that when you have campaigns that can focus voters on the choice, and ask them to also consider, whatever their doubts about Democrats, whether they want Trump-style Republicans in position to implement their agenda on abortion, on book bans, on voting, and other issues, you can get a very different result in a broad array of states.

More than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law that legalized abortion, voters in Ohio have handed a victory to reproductive rights advocates. CNN projects Ohio will approve a measure that enshrines abortion rights into its state constitution. Abortion advocates are working to get similar measures on the 2024 ballot in other states, some of which have restricted access to abortion, including Arizona and Florida. And that has become one of the big takeaways from Tuesday's elections. Abortion rights matter to many voters in crucial swing states. CNN's Jeff Zeleny explains.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFFREY ZELENY CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): For the next year, as Republicans try to win the senate, keep their narrow majority in the house, and indeed win back the White House, abortion will be front and center in their strategy. The lessons of Tuesday night's elections in Virginia, in Ohio, and in Kentucky certainly serve as a reminder that abortion is still a very potent issue. And now, it has become a motivating factor for Democrats. Of course, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs decision a little more than a year ago, there are so many examples now, election after election where Republicans are largely on the losing side of this argument. We're going to see much of this discussion at a Republican presidential debate here in Miami on Wednesday. There has been a difference of viewpoint to some degree about the way forward on abortion. Nikki Haley for example, the former South Carolina governor has tried to strike somewhat of a middle ground. Now Donald Trump, for his part, will not be participating in the debate. But he has tried to not dwell on abortion. He believes it's a losing issue in the words that he has spoken to some of his advisors. But look for Democrats to try and turn this to their advantage over the next year, in fact it could be one of their big motivating factors. So there is no doubt, as Republicans try to win control of the senate, hold their narrow majority in the house, and win back the White House, abortion will be front and center.

We haven't forgotten that they took away our reproductive rights. They took away our bodily autonomy. And it's been more than a year, but the pain is still there. And it's going to propel us to victory in 2024. And despite all the naysayers, despite all the doubts, this rest (ph) at the heart, the core of what it means to be a woman, we're not going to soon relinquish the importance of that. This is something that lights a fire under the bust (ph) of women, young people, allies, everybody.And this isn't just about women's rights but it's also about having -- it's also about gay marriage, it's about privacy, it's about making decisions. It's about birth control. It opens the floodgates to everything. So this impacts every facet of American life.",

But Democrats have won in all six states that put abortion on the ballot and now, of course, Ohio can be added to that list. So, how might these wins change the trajectory of the fight for reproductive rights at the state level?",

We saw this in Kansas where pro-forced birth interests spent $3 million and more trying to ban abortion. They lost. We saw this in Ohio just today. They lost. So we're going to keep doing this again. And one should also be aware that Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, promised to pass an abortion ban if he were able to win a trifecta in Virginia. Tonight, he was denied that trifecta. And so, he's not able -- he will not be able to implement the abortion ban that he promised.Governor of Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear who is in a ruby red state promised to keep abortion legal which demonstrates that wherever Democrats run on abortion, they win. This is about life, this is -- if you cannot control your body, nothing else matters, this rest (ph) of the core of humanity. So this demonstrates that reproductive rights will continue to be a winning issue everywhere. And this is the very issue that Biden and Democrats need to propel young people, who are otherwise unsure, to the polls. This is no joke.

It was 234 to 188. There were four Republicans who voted against it. Essentially, there is a public reprimand of Rashida Tlaib.

RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY): When you're uttering phrases like \"From the river to the sea,\" you're not simply advocating for the creation of a Palestinian state, you're advocating for the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state. And that crosses a line that no member of Congress should ever cross. It's hate speech and Congress has a right to condemn it. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA) It is outrageous. I am embarrassed for those Democrats who voted to censure their own colleague, who voted against free speech. It is an embarrassment.",

This is now the least affordable housing market in almost 40 years, according to research from the Intercontinental Exchange.
