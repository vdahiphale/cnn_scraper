The former president, a felon, a jury tonight finding Trump guilty of 34 felony charges, the first American president to be found guilty of a crime. And this is a moment in history. This -- this is the official signed verdict sheet, page after page, three of them, guilty as you can see on all 34 charges related to falsifying business records in order to conceal a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Now, just a short time ago, Trump left the courthouse back to Trump Tower, arriving there, that's what you're looking at on the screen. Supporters greeted him there cheering, others were there chanting, quote, lock him up. Obviously, an echo of what he had said about Hillary Clinton. Just moments ago, the New York district attorney speaking out for the first time celebrating his victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've been raising every objection, trying to preserve every constitutional issue.The strategy, Erin, has been described to me as, quote, death by 1,000 cuts. The idea is to rack up all of these objections and possible problems and then throw everything at the wall in the hopes that maybe something will stick and overturn this, but are in given this verdict, the way it was all 34 counts unanimous from this jury and the lack of success that they've had so far and litigating these issues.

This was scheduled exactly six weeks out. That's pretty much the average sentencing date here in this jurisdiction. But given its proximity to the convention, I would expect that his legal team might follow up with the request to push that back. I will also note that the gag order is still in effect a bit of a surprise that Todd Blanche didn't try to get that removed.

And they are trying to fund raise off of this.Now, they do believe leave. There is some silver lining and the fact that the WinRed fundraising site that they use for donations crashed after this verdict came out. They are believing that that is because there were so many people visiting, so they will try to get a financial boost out of this. But, politically, this could be very harmful for him in November. When you talked to his senior advisers, they say they have been setting themselves up for a potential conviction since long before this trial ever started, saying that it was election interference, that it was rigged, that was political persecution. So they say because of that, they don't believe it's going to affect them in November. But to be very clear, they do not know. This is different from every other legal issue that he has faced. This is an actual conviction and if you look at the most recent polling, even when you look just among people who say that they want to vote for Donald Trump, 7 percent of that group said they were less likely to vote for him if he was convicted. That is a very big deal for Donald Trump's campaign, who believes that Donald Trump's base will always show up to vote for him. Its also a big deal because both Biden and Donald Trump believes if that in November, that election is going to be decided by such a small number of voters that 7 percent of a base could be very significant. Now, we are likely to hear Donald Trump's rants, his calls for election interference again tomorrow, he has called a press conference at Trump Tower at 11:00 a.m. and, of course, Erin, we will be there to ask him questions about what exactly he feels about this verdict.",
