      "sentences": "Good morning. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We are following several developing stories this morning. Caught on hidden camera, one of the co-authors of Project 2025 says despite Trump's insistence, he has nothing to do with the conservative blueprint, and the former president actually supports them. Plus wide ranging hacking, Google is now revealing the alleged Iranian hacking operation in the presidential campaigns is ongoing and bigger than previously known. And soldiers captured, shocking video shows Russian prisoners of war lined up along the road, as Ukraine says this is the largest capture of Russian troops at one time. But we begin with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the administration's plan to lower costs for you. The president and vice president will put the focus on the economy when they share the stage in Maryland later today. Polls show inflation and the economy are still number one with voters. From 2019 to 2023, food prices rose by a whopping 25 percent. They grew faster than both housing and health care costs. Biden and Harris are also expected to tout Medicare's new power to negotiate prices and the billions that could be saved on popular prescription drugs. Take a look at this, from 2022 to 2023, the average drug price increase was more than 15 percent. That's about $590 per drug over the course of that year. Let's bring in CNN Correspondents Arlette Saenz and Meg Tirrell. Arlette, we do know that inflation has been coming down, but yet Americans are still concerned about prices on all kinds of products out there. And this is the first joint event, we should note, for Biden and Harris since she became the nominee. This is a big rollout, seeing both the president and the vice president together on stage today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really is, Jim. And President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are teaming up to promote one of the economic policies that they believe is helping Americans, and that specifically relates to efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The Harris campaign is well aware that the economy remains a top concern for American voters heading into November. And so what they're trying to do at this moment is highlight not just existing policies but also policies of Harris' that she is set to roll out in the coming days.It all will really highlight one of the key challenges for Harris going forward, as she's seeking to run on parts of the Biden agenda, but also chart a course of her own. President Biden and his overall Bidenomics plan did not fare well in polling with voters, but there are elements of Biden's economic policy that do sit well with voters. That includes efforts to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs. Now, for Harris' part tomorrow, she's also set to deliver a major economy speech in the battleground state of North Carolina. Her campaign says that she will roll out plans to call for a federal ban on price gouging when it relates to food and grocery industries. It comes at a time when the high price of groceries has been a key concern for voters as they have battled the inflation in this country for several years now. Now, Harris also at this time is enjoying some polling that shows overall enthusiasm about her candidacy. If you take a look to how the enthusiasm around the Democratic nominee compares to when Biden was in the race, there's a significant jump in that enthusiasm support between February and this time now. A key challenge for Harris going forward is continuing to try to capitalize on that enthusiasm and that momentum. She's hoping to carry that through the Democratic National Convention next week and in the weeks to follow. But for this week, the campaign really drilling in on the economic policy and the way that they can tell Americans that they are working to address some of their individual concerns as the economy remains a chief issue for them heading into November's election.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, this is a pretty big deal. I mean, I've covered the drug industry for 15 years, and they have been fighting the ability for Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and they continue to fight these provisions, even as the first ones are getting announced.So, in this first round, there's ten drugs included. These will go into effect in 2026. The White House this morning saying that this should lead to at least $6 billion in savings in the first year based on 2023 numbers. That's about 22 percent to seniors directly out of pocket. They say it will be $1.5 billion. These first ten drugs include blood thinners, drugs for diabetes, heart failure, arthritis, cancer, chronic kidney disease and psoriasis. And we're going to see more drugs added to this. Now, in terms of the impact to seniors themselves, the administration is giving a hypothetical example, because everybody kind of does have different plans and there are already some discounts on these medicines in Medicare. But they give the example of one of the drugs called Stelara. This is for psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders. They say, hypothetically, right now, based on the price of this drug, if seniors are paying a 25 percent co-insurance on the drug out of pocket, they'd be paying $3,400 a month for that. Under the new negotiated price, they say that would come down to $1,100 per month until they hit a cap on out-of-pocket spending, after which they wouldn't pay anything more. So you can see that's a 66 percent discount that they've negotiated. Now critics of this, I've heard from folks on the right this morning point out there are already discounts baked into some of these Medicare drug prices, so the overall amount isn't quite as large as the discounts off the list prices. But, overall, the administration says 22 percent in terms of what's coming down in savings, Jim.",

Now to the campaign, Kamala Harris has been making sure to tie Donald Trump to Project 2025 while out there on the campaign trail, even though the former president still maintains he has no connection to the controversial conservative playbook.

If we're going to have legal immigration, can we get people that actually believe in Christianity? Is that something? Or do we have to have, you know -- are we not allowed to have, ask questions about Sharia law? So, I want to make sure that we can say we are a Christian nation.

And like I talk about often, my dad talks about the price of whiting at Piggly Wiggly, people talk about the cost of school supplies. There is an issue with costs that we have to tackle. But this administration has a great deal of success and there is a certain demographic that still likes Joe Biden way more than they like Donald Trump. Those are individuals, particularly over the age of 65. Those are white, non-college educated individuals in the Rust Belt. He can go out and talk to these people and message because this is Joe from Scranton and he doesn't have anything to lose and he's not running. So, yes, I think it's a great idea. And tomorrow, the funny part about this is this man got up there and gave an incoherent speech about Tic Tacs, right? And Republicans are saying, oh my God, is the next godsend of economic policy. But tomorrow, they're going to come on air and try to pick apart a speech that is heavy on detail, heavy on policy that Kamala Harris is giving in the Raleigh Durham area.
