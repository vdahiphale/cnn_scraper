It's 6:00 p.m. in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia where a major weekend of diplomacy is about to kick off. We'll look at the latest on the efforts to stop the carnage in Gaza. Well, CNN has been witnessing rocket fire targeting Israel from Gaza today, while the Israeli offensive against Hamas is very much ongoing on the ground and from the air. Civilians once again finding themselves caught in the crossfire. Israeli strikes reportedly hit two hospitals in northern Gaza. Videos showed casualties at a third hospital in Gaza City which was obviously hit by something, the source at present undetermined. Well, thousands more people fled the violence on foot today. Israel opening what they have described as an evacuation corridor to the south for a period of six hours. That is now close but U.N.'s top human rights officials questioning the strategy of driving people to flee to so-called safe zones. He says nowhere in Gaza is safe right now. CNN's Nada Bashir joining me now from Jerusalem. Let's start with the strikes on the hospitals. What are the details as we understand them?",

The heads of the UAE and Qatar urging an immediate cease-fire to allow in humanitarian aid. The UAE also calling for an open briefing today. They are asking the director-general the World Health Organization to brief the United Nations Security Council. Of course the UAE is a revolving member of that UNSC at present. Meantime, Iran's president will be at a meeting in Gaza -- on Gaza in Riyadh this weekend. Also this weekend, leaders of Arab nations meeting in Riyadh. There is a real concern that this conflict could spread further, and a renewed push regionally for a solution. Leaders will be in Saudi Saturday for what is an emergency summit of the Arab League, the group calling for a complete cease-fire. Well, the situation on Israel's northern border with Lebanon is one of the areas that are of real concern to this region. When I say this region, I of course am broadcasting to you from our programming hub here in Abu Dhabi. Hezbollah and the IDF exchanged crossfire -- cross-border fire again today.

Well, we've alreadyheard from the spokesman for the Arab League, that the Arab League is demanding an immediate cease-fire and not a humanitarian pause. Now this is in complete contradiction to what the United States is saying. Now we did hear Secretary State Antony Blinken in New Delhi today saying that far too many Palestinians have been killed. But yesterday we also heard President Biden say that no, there's not going to be a cease-fire. So the Arab leaders will be meeting in Saudi Arabia tomorrow. What they're willing to accomplish is not at all clear. Now you'll recall back in October, 1973, when King Faisal was the king of Saudi Arabia, he was behind the Arab oil embargo which really did jar the United States into looking a little more closely at its Middle East policy. But it appears that at the moment, the Arab leaders are satisfying themselves with beseeching, begging the United States to intercede with Israel. But they don't seem to have any tools they're willing to use to change Israel's behavior on the ground. Now we did also hear from Mohamed Bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who also called for a cease-fire and an end to the forced displacement of Palestinians within Gaza itself.

And there was real concern and palpable worry among many people here in Lebanon. Now we're expecting another speech. It's going to be marking what's known as Hezbollah's Martyrs Day. And there's no indication of whether he's going to up the temperature or lower it. Now what we've seen today by my count in the last eight hours, there have been at least 14 cross border strikes between Israel and Hezbollah. And what we've seen in the last few days is at least Israel seems to be using larger bombs or explosives than it's used in the past. Today, Hezbollah announced that seven of its militants had been killed. We don't know where or when, but at this point, the death toll for Hezbollah itself is almost 70. And so obviously he has to address -- Nasrallah has to address his followers to explain why 70 of their fighters have been killed since the 7th of October. One interesting thing we've noticed is that now every time Hezbollah puts out a statement about its attacks on Israel, it says this is in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza and their resistance. So this is perhaps laying -- putting on an extra layer of rhetorical support for the Palestinians. But in terms of going any further, if we're talking about escalation, many people really doubt that Hezbollah has the desire to drag Lebanon into a war that would most people would expect would be much worse than the war of 2006. Much worse. Because of course Lebanon is in terrible economic shape. And we have heard repeatedly from Israeli officials, including Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, he even before this war said that if Hezbollah engages in another war with Israel, Israel will bomb Lebanon back into the Stone Age -- Becky.",

I mean I think that people are expecting the president tocontinue putting pressure on Netanyahu, to try to get these corridors open for longer periods of time, to get not only the civilians out but also allow for the release of the hostages. But, look, this is something that the administration has definitely shifted its messaging on over the last several weeks. We saw Secretary of State Blinken say just this morning that far too many Palestinians are being killed. And again, urging these humanitarian pauses to allow for them to get safely to the south and out of the Gaza Strip. So this cable that you mentioned, that is something that is really kind of driving the administration's messaging on this. They understand that there is broad anger in the Arab world. And this cable just kind of drives that home, something that the second highest U.S. official in Oman told the National Security Council just this week, on Wednesday, based on that official having numerous conversations with well-trusted sources and people who would know of course in the region how the sentiment is being expressed there, and said essentially that the U.S.'s support for Israel and its kind of unwavering support for their operation in Gaza is, quote, \"losing us Arab publics for a generation.\" And the cable went on to say that, quote, \"We are losing badly on the messaging battle space.\" And it warns that the U.S. support for Israel's actions is being seen as, quote, \"material and moral culpability\" in what they consider to be possible war crimes. So the Arab public, they are apparently, according to this cable, seeing the administration here as complicit in Israel's war and the resulting thousands and thousands of deaths that we have seen of Palestinian civilians. So now the question is, of course, what is the limit? That remains to be seen. The president has, according to our sources, not placed any red lines on Israel and on its operations but of course, in private conversations, is pushing them to do more to protect civilians.",

Now it's not expected that there will be an immediate thaw in U.S. and China relations, but officials here at the White House believe the fact that the two men are sitting down, it would be the second time since Biden became president, they see that simple fact as being a positive step. Now officials hope that this meeting will lay the groundwork for a potential framework that would maintain a competitive relationship with China while also trying to avoid any misconceptions or surprises in the relationships. But aides are realistic heading into this meeting and aren't expecting a long list of outcomes or deliverables from it, but they do say that President Biden is ready to bring up a host of issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping. One thing that's of key interest to President Biden is trying to reestablish those military-to-military communications, something that China pulled down about a year ago. The president is expected to really push Xi on that matter. They are also expected to talk about the conflicts in Israel and in Ukraine at a time when the administration has really pushed China to try to take a more constructive role in these conflicts. Additionally, they'll talk about issues where they agree on, things like climate change, but also talk about those differences. The officials say the president is prepared to raise human rights issues as well as the issues surrounding Taiwan, which has been a lot of the tension that has bubbled up between the U.S. and China in relation to handling that. Of course we have seen these various moments of tension over the course of the past year, just think back to that Chinese spy balloon incident where things really started to deteriorate. You've seen over the course of the past few months and the lead-up to this meeting, the U.S. dispatching top officials, people like Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, to talk with their counterparts in China as they try to lay the groundwork for this meeting that really could potentially affect the future of the relationship as President Biden is trying to offer some stability to it at this time. Of course, it's also come in at a time of great political turmoil as the president is also grappling with those crises in Israel and Ukraine.

On Thursday, the IDF chief of staff and the head of the country's Internal Security Service entered Gaza and promised strength through cooperation. Everyone is doing everything, said General Herzi Halevi, just so you can be as strong as possible. Along our path in northern Gaza, the signs of civilian life have given way to the constant hum of drones and the distant echoes of artillery. Our time with the IDF began at the coordination base for the border crossing, the first international media to visit the site. The terror attack on October 7th hit hard here, the scars of machine gunfire and RPGs still visible. The base was mostly empty on the holiday but not entirely. The IDF says nine soldiers were killed here and three kidnapped. It took 12 hours for Israel to regain control of the base. Now it's one of the main gates to Gaza. (Voice-over): We stopped an overlook near the town of Jabalya. One of the things uncovered here on this hill near Jabalya is a meeting point of three different tunnels. And you can see if you take a look that's one, two, three, they came together here and it let Hamas move underground quickly below the feet and out of sight. (Voice-over): Colonel Tal (PH), the tank commander, says there were many explosives here, there were many trenches. There were a lot of weapons and ammunition. We found here a storage site with many explosives against tanks, RPGs. Even from a distance the scale of the destruction is stunning. Apartment buildings, homes, neighborhoods decimated. Colonel Tal (PH) says the area is almost completely evacuated. We don't see civilians in our eyes. We see sometimes terrorists but the majority of civilians haven't been here in a while. They've all gone south in the direction of the heart of the strip. As we talk, we hear rocket fire and see the trails of the launchers, triggering red alerts in Ashdod. After about 90 minutes inside northern Gaza, we make our way out hugging the border wall for safety. Even here so close to the exit and stop briefly so the dust clears, we can make sure the way ahead is safe. In the distance once again, the smoke from another strike. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A pause in fighting that is being negotiated at present between Hamas and Israel in order to get the release of these hostages that are being held in Gaza. And that is very different of course from these calls for an immediate cease-fire. On the release of these hostages, I noted what I thought was a very interesting poll today. And I just want to get your sense of it. Let's bring it up. This is how the Israeli public feel about what is going on at present. And this is about -- Israelis polled on hostage negotiations. 38 percent, Oren, say Israel should negotiate while fighting. They have said that they will not negotiate until Hamas release the hostages, as it were. Twenty-two percent say Israel should not negotiate at all. Ten percent, one in 10, say Israel should negotiate only when the fighting is over.

An example, for five years when Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was in Gaza, the Israeli government didn't know where he was. And I've seen no indication the Israeli government knows where approximately 240 hostages are now being held in Gaza. So the only way to get them out, at least as of right now from where we stand, is through some sort of negotiation probably mediated by Qatar. Does that weigh on the Israeli government? Certainly. They have said at least publicly that that's one of their stated goals. But you also see the extent of the military campaign there. And at some point it may be very difficult to do both, to try to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages. It's not clear that the Venn diagram completely overlaps. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be trying to figure out a way to do that, but the longer this drags on, the longer the hostages are in Gaza, the more public pressure is created to get to a point of negotiations and a willingness perhaps for a prisoner exchange, for a hostage exchange, for something that he's effectively ruling out as of right now.",

Diaz and his wife Cilenis Marulanda were kidnapped last month in their hometown of Barrancas in northeastern Colombia. Marulanda was released alone within a few hours. But a few days later, the National Liberation Army, Colombia's oldest active guerrilla group, confirmed they were behind the kidnapping. We deployed 150 men with aircraft and intelligence capability. We are optimist. It prompted a massive military operation and marches demanding his release. Diaz Sr., a well-known figure in the community, spoke to CNN last year saying he wanted to open a soccer school for underprivileged children in Barrancas and keep living in town despite the security risk linked with his son's fame. Northeastern Colombia is one of the poorest regions in the country, with documented presence of criminal groups that profit from trafficking over the border with Venezuela. On Monday, the kidnappers demanded security guarantees in order to free their hostage. And the Colombian Army stepped aside. Thursday morning, Diaz was finally handed over to two Catholic bishops and a commission from the U.N. A few hours later, he was home. Welcome news for the Diaz family. But the kidnapping of the father of one of Colombia's most popular football players lays bare the hurdles to secure a durable peace for the country. Seven years after signing a historic peace deal with left-wing governments, Colombia is far from pacified. This month rebel groups suspended negotiations with the Colombian government, and the National Liberation Army appeared to defend their tactic of ransom kidnappings to finance their armed struggle. Even President Gustavo Petro, a former rebel who was elected pledging to open talks with guerilla groups had to concede that some of his hopes for negotiations were premature. While the match to bring Diaz back home ended with a success, the future of Colombia's peace process remains far from decided. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
