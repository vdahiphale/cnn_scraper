Well, the U.S. and Panama have signed an agreement to stop illegal migrants passing through the treacherous Darien Gap. Last year, a record 520,000 people crossed the mountainous rainforest region, which connects South and Central America through Panama and Colombia. The number of people risking their lives to cross the gap is increasing. Under the agreement, the U.S. will cover repatriation costs and provide Panama with logistical support. Here's what Panama's new president said ahead of that announcement on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSE RAUL MULINO, PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): we cannot continue to finance the economic and social costs that massive illegal immigration generates to the country. Panama will no longer be a transit country for illegals. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Human rights groups accused police of shooting dozens of unarmed protesters, including some who were fleeing. No one has accepted or denied responsibility for the killings. Our crew filmed the shocking scenes. Like here, left of your screen, a man running away is shot in the back with a tear gas canister at close range. These protesters standing over a man who's apparently dead, police fire a non-lethal round directly at them. Nairobi's police chief seen here, commanded the operation, his officers clearly contravening their own rules for the use of force. CNN analyzed the deadliest two hours when most of the protesters are believed to have been killed. Keep an eye on the man in white overalls waving his arms earlier in the day. 25-year-old Ericsson Kyalo Mutisya was supposed to be at the butcher's shop where he worked, his mother said, but ended up here. CNN's camera captured him dancing until shots ring out. Police advance towards the protesters. More shots and people run away. Amid the chaos, we spot Ericsson again. He is lifeless on the sidewalk. Around him, other protesters are also on the ground. As the smoke lifts, one man has been shot in the head. People rush to help, but police keep firing at them. A bag is thrown in the air as the smoke grenade goes off, but that protester escapes. We were on the scene as this unfolded. There are three bodies lying on the ground After we heard live ammunition coming from parliament. a police truck is on fire, and the protesters appear to be pushing the police, overwhelming them, getting closer to Parliament. Unknown to us at the time, Ericsson's body was being carried away behind me, his white overalls soaked in blood. We obtained his autopsy report. Ericsson was shot in the back and bled to death. Moments later, another injured protester is carried away, but he is lucky. He survived. That protester is 26-year-old Ian Kaya, who was also hit in the back.",
