Nichols is pulled up by his shoulders and then kicked in the face twice. After being pulled up into a sitting position, Nichols is hit in the back with what appears to be a nightstick after being pulled to his knees, Nichols is hit again. Once pulled his feet, the video shows officers hitting Nichols in the face multiple times while his hands are restrained behind his body, after which he falls to his knees. Less than a minute later, an officer appears to kick Nichols again. More than three minutes after the encounter is first seen on this camera, officers let go of Tyre Nichols, and he rolls on his back. One minute later, Nichols is dragged along the pavement and propped up in a sitting position against the side of a car, where he's largely ignored by officers for the next three and a half minutes. Some 10 minutes into the video, a person who appears to be a paramedic finally engages with Nichols. The U.S. Department of Justice has said it is conducting a federal civil rights investigation of Tyre Nichols death. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, from the very beginning, the officers were acting in a manner that was inconsistent with any training that I am aware of. They began yelling at the individual, pulling him out of the car. If anything, Mr. Nichols was the person trying to deescalate the situation. It was not the police officers. And after they pepper sprayed and tased him and he took off running, then it became very personal because, you know, they were upset and angry because he had the nerve to run away, although he was running because he was in fear of his life.And, of course, the pole cam is the most damning evidence of all. I mean, when you look at the pole cam video and the constant strikes, blows, kicks, the use of the ASP (ph), all those things justify the charges that the state's attorney placed against those officers. I mean, this is tragic in every way. Imaginable, totally uncalled for, and doesn't reflect the profession at all. The shame of it. Part of the shame, aside from the tragedy of a man losing his life, is the fact that, you know, most police officers feel just as disgusted about what they're seeing as anybody else. I mean, it's bad. In my opinion, this is just as devastating for the profession of policing as the Derek Chauvin video.",

By that I mean disciplinary action taken against some additional officers. Those that actually had a physical confrontation with Mr. Nichols, those are the ones being charged criminally. And, of course, it's up to a state's attorney to determine whether or not it rises to that level beyond those five. But certainly, there will be some administrative action. No question in my mind.",

      "sentences": "Right. Chief, I want to get your perspective on this Scorpion Team. It's a specialized unit that's involved in so called hot spot policing. All the officers that have been charged in his death were members of this unit. Do you think that played a role in the intensity and the brutality of the attack?Well, there's a couple of things that I'd like to mention about that. First of all, the name of the unit, I mean that's not unusual to have a unit that is named in a way that you would kind of wonder why, you know, Scorpion. Scorpion, I mean, is a, you know, predator with a deadly sting. I mean, why would you want to name your unit Scorpion to begin with? But aside from that, the officers that are chosen for some of these special units that really work in high crime, high intensity areas like that are some of the officers who make a lot of stops, make a lot of arrests, things of that nature. But you have to carefully screen the individuals that are going into a unit like that. Looking at their history, do they have complaints of excessive force, whether they're sustained or not sustained? You have to look at that, and you have to pay particular attention to the supervisors, particularly first line supervisors that you bring into that unit, because you want to make sure that they're being properly supervised. And I didn't see a supervisor at the scene there. There could have been one, but I did not see one. But you have to have tight supervision in a unit like that. Do you need to have units exist like that? We do have a legitimate crime problem in this country, and it is concentrated in some areas, unfortunately. So you need to be able to take some action, have some flexibility, but you can reduce crime and police constitutionally at the same time. You don't have to do one at the expense of the other. And so their actions were totally inappropriate. I'm sure that particular unit is going to be disbanded, but that won't get rid of the problem. OK. You have to look at the people that are in a unit like that and make sure that they're closely monitored, that you do thorough investigations, that there are complaints to make sure that you don't have something like this occur. And I would recommend that every chief across the country, especially large departments that have these specialized units, take a close look at the supervision, at the personnel that are there and make whatever changes they have to make, because this could very well happen again and it would be just one more tragedy that we're talking about. SANCHEZ: That is one of the things that Tyre Nichols family is calling for, not only for this unit here in Memphis to be disbanded, but for departments everywhere to study these kinds of specialized units and make sure that no abuses are taking place so that this doesn't happen again. Chief Charles Ramsey, thank you so much, as always, for your expertise.",

No doubt, the defense, when it does cross-examination on Monday will use that to continue its theme of an alleged sloppy investigation. Amara?  WALKER: Wow, so many fascinating details there. Randi Kaye, thank you for your reporting. Joey Jackson is a criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst. Joey, I know you've been quite busy, so thank you so much for joining us this morning. First off, Joey, I mean, it seems like there's a lot of smoke there. What did you make first of all what we heard from that officer who was first respond at the murder scene, and how he said the -- that Alex Murdaugh didn't cry when he saw him, and that he immediately offered up a possible motive.",

That's what the prosecution is alluding to. The fact that he tried to clean himself up. But then on the other hand, right, you're the police, you've conducted an investigation.Did you attempt to make any efforts to determine whether there was blood you didn't see? Did you do any other investigation to see whether or not there was blood on any other parts of his body? Did you get a warrant to make an assessment as to his home or anything else? Did you look at other areas for which you might suggest that he could have wiped the blood off? Did you find the cloth? Did you do anything else? And so, I think that there's always two narratives just like your other question, was he setting up an alibi? Or maybe instead of setting up an alibi, he was simply trying to determine what was going on and giving you information so that you officers could get to the bottom of it. Maybe, instead of wiping off blood, right? He actually just based upon where the spatter was, there was not the blood and that particular location, right? Of the wrist of where he was trying to do it. So there's innocent explanations and then there are nefarious explanations. Trials, Amara, are about prosecution pointing to the nefarious and the defense pointing to the innocent, and the jury making a determination as to which of those two narratives make sense.",

How are you suggesting without evidence with respect to eyewitnesses that he did, without surveillance that he did, without blood on his -- all about his body parts.Now, look, here's the point. When you heard the cross-examination that we did of his defense attorney, Amara, he was pointing out that. In the event that there's splatter and some, you know, I mean it's pretty graphic that I won't get into, but if people -- you're shooting him in the head area, you would expect blood to splatter? So, was it on his shirt? Was it on his face? Was it on his pants? Did you make any analysis? Did you make any assessment? So what do we have? Circumstantial evidence because you think he's guilty? That's not enough, ladies and gentlemen. And I think that's where the defense would go and continue to hammer away in the case.",

Two of those adults were shot and hit.They are in hospital in serious, but stable conditions, and the 13- year-old boy was also taken to hospital as well. So, he was injured, but not killed. And obviously, this is just merely adding to the tensions that are prevalent right now between Israel and the Palestinians, the Israeli police talking about boosting security.
