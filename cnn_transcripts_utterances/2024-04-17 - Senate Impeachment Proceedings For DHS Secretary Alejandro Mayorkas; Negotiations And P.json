And this is impeachment is still rare, although getting more frequent. And we have not seen a cabinet secretary impeached in well over 150 years. So let's go to Michael Gerhart now. And Michael, just to sum it up, I think we've got it right here. But essentially, the Senate majority leader put out kind of a plan, a roadmap for how they could do this that would allow Republicans to bring amendments to debate. There would be equal time split between the two parties. And then it was Senator Eric Schmidt of Missouri that objected to that. And now they are, I believe, taking a roll call on just the premise on which they would be able to move forward. Is that correct?",

He said, if we can get everybody, all 100 to agree, then we will proceed in the following manner, which would have taken several hours. Almost immediately, there's an objection from the senator from Missouri saying he's going to object, that he's not going to agree to that, in which case everything that Senator Schumer just proposed falls to the wayside. And then Senator Schumer was prepared to move forward. With the point of order, the point of order is something that is immediately taken up, it supersedes any other pending business.And a point of order is concerned with whether or not the Senate understands and is following properly its own rules. So, the point of order that Senators Schumer made was, well, in that case we need to vote on whether or not the first article of impeachment made against the secretary is constitutional. I think we know where that's going to go. I think a majority of the senate will likely vote it's not constitutional in which case it's effectively removed or dismissed.",

Two Republicans who have bucked their own party for when it comes to matters of impeachment. So we are expecting that this effort right now which is to kill that first article of impeachment, is going to succeed. And the question here is whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. That is something that Democrats and some Republicans have argued does not meet that very high bar and very high standard. They said this is more of a policy dispute that Republicans are just using as sort of a political punching bag to make their point over the border.But, of course, you're seeing this all play out on the Senate floor right now. A very rare moment, we should say, to see an impeachment trial of a cabinet official. This is something that has not happened in nearly 150 years. So even though we know how this is going to end, it is not going to result in a conviction based on all of our reporting. There is a question of just how quickly they get there. And we should note that at the top there, Chuck Schumer did try to make this unanimous consent request. He tried to get an agreement here that would have set up some floor debates, some speeches, some votes that Republicans could have taken. He could have taken on amendments. But a Republican senator objected to that. They are pushing for a full trial, something that Schumer and Democrats have made clear is not going to fly. So we'll have to watch this all play out on the floor. A lot of arcane procedural moments right now. But a big moment here as we watch them take the vote to kill this first article impeachment.",

And again, just to remind everyone, this is impeachment is pertains to high crimes and misdemeanors. Constitutional experts have said that this case does not meet that.

This Senate trial that we're watching is evidence of that. Walk us through the path forward that Mike Johnson faces, because even getting to this point was a challenge for him.",

He's got this group of Freedom Caucus members who don't want him to cut any deals on Ukraine, on aid to Ukraine. And so he's caught. And these are some of the same people who want to impeach Mayorkas. And it is because they are more interested in issues than in governing. And when you become the Speaker of the House, a part of you has to say, look, it's my responsibility to govern. And this is what Mike Johnson is saying. This is what some Democrats are saying who say they might vote with Mike Johnson, even though they don't like him. They'll hold their noses and do it if they have to to get that money for Ukraine. And what you're seeing play out in the Senate is really about this issue of immigration.I mean, Mayorkas is just the vehicle here. But the more Republicans can talk about the failures on immigration, the maladministration, as it's called, of immigration policy, the better it is for them. And the White House understands that. And Mayorkas is just the vehicle for it. So we see this playing out really in both houses and also all around the country in down-ballot races. And so we know that it's going to be one of the biggest issues heading into this next election. And one of the reasons Republicans want this debate on the Senate floor is they want people to pay attention to it and they want to draw attention to it. And when you have an impeachment debate on the floor of the Senate, people tend to sit up and listen.

They are setting up a vote to effectively kill the first article of impeachment. So we are waiting to see that kind of play out. And Gloria Borger is here with us in studio.

And once the debate gets going, maybe people will pay more attention to it. But I think in the end, they'll be interested in the result, which will be that he will not be impeached and that perhaps it will be the whole issue will be found unconstitutional. I mean, if there were to be a different result, I think you'd have public standing up and paying a little bit more attention. But he's not the president of the United States. And I think, you know, the question you might ask is, well, what does this have to do then? How does this bode for any potential impeachment of Joe Biden? Right. You know, we're talking about Mayorkas today. And there are people in the House talking about a potential impeachment of Joe Biden. And so far, they haven't come up with much to do that either.

Michael, as we're watching right now, bring us up to speed on what we're waiting for. There's going to be a vote at some point based on the point of order that Majority Leader Schumer made regarding the Constitutionality of one of these articles of impeachment.

And for senators who are institutionalists, who care about the integrity of the institution, they want to be sure, not just now, but for the historical record, to demonstrate that they are remaining faithful to the rules and processes of the Senate. And so Senator Schumer, the majority leader, who clearly cares about the institution, is trying to demonstrate in virtually everything he's doing here that he cares about the integrity of the Senate. And he wants to be sure the Senate crosses its T's and dots its I's appropriately. The other thing I might just add is something to underscore the political-the partisanship of the attempt to impeach Mayorkas.It's a distraction. What's going on now as well in New York is a criminal trial of Donald Trump. And so another motivation for Republicans to push the impeachment against Mayorkas is to distract from the trial of Donald Trump. Nothing but political and partisan reasons for the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas. And I think that's yet another reason why Senator Schumer and the Democrats want to cut this off now.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, look, this is part of the nature of the United States Senate. This is why it's the world's most deliberative body, because they actually have to agree to a set of procedures on how to move forward here. And that's exactly what we're witnessing here. The reason why the Senate is not moving ahead at this moment is because there are negotiations that are happening about trying to structure a series of votes to allow Republicans to make their points on the floor of the Senate. That would require, that would include calling for a full-blown trial, among some other issues as well. That agreement, as you saw before this led to this situation, we're in a bit of a stalemate here. They tried to reach an agreement, but a Republican objected to it. You saw Senator Eric Schmidt of Missouri come up and said he does not agree to this because part of that time agreement that Chuck Schumer tried to lay down in the Senate included a motion to dismiss these charges overall.Republicans are trying to push back against any effort to dismiss these charges, which forced Chuck Schumer to say, OK, let's just kill these proceedings altogether. We'll kill this first article of impeachment. When he says a point of order and it doesn't rise to the constitutionality, that's really just a fancy way of saying, let's kill this first article and be done with it. And then they would move in immediately almost after that vote, which would succeed because they have the votes in the Senate to kill that first article. Then they would do the same thing in the second vote. So the reason why they're in this position right now is because Republicans don't want to end this right now. They want to try to delay this as long as they can. Some of them, particularly the ones who are arguing that there needs to be a full-blown trial or make their points that Democrats are not handling this effectively, have essentially stalled action in the Senate. So the question is going to be when they eventually get out of what's known as a quorum call, which is the thing you're seeing right now where the Senate is really doing nothing other than talking behind the scenes, what will they do to set up additional votes? Will Republicans be satisfied with what Chuck Schumer is proposing to give them some votes? Will they not be satisfied? Will it lead to this more stalemate? But at the end of the day, despite the votes that are going to happen, we know the ultimate outcome, Alejandro Mayorkas will not be convicted by this Democratic-led Senate. The only matter of time is how to get there. But Senate being the United States Senate, you need all 100 senators to agree on having a vote. And if any one senator has their own idea, then that doesn't happen. So that's what's going on right now, guys.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, just in the last few minutes, another attempt to bring this repeal bill to the House floor has failed. That's a couple of attempts today to bypass procedural rules, because technically a bill has to be heard in a committee before it goes to the full floor. So as of right now, it does not look like this repeal can be considered by the full House. This has been attempted before. If you're asking why it took until right now to try to appeal a law from the 1860s, it has been attempted before and also failed to get any traction. So that's where we are. This has happened today because of the state Supreme Court ruling last week that was an attempt to clarify or harmonize the existing laws in Arizona, because just a couple of years ago, Arizona passed a 15-week abortion ban, and yet you also had this law on the books dating back to the 1860s that outlaws nearly all abortions, except in the case of saving the life of the mother.And so that decision last week was to say that that law holds. And this comes with a potential punishment of two to five years in prison for abortion providers. This morning, we saw a lot of people, about 100 people gathered from the Right to Life group. They entered the gallery to try and speak. A lot of them told me how much they value life and that they are pro-life. And yet when you ask them details about what they support, whether they support any exceptions for rape or incest, which this 1860s law does not, whether they support prison time for abortion providers, you'd get slightly different answers depending on whom you ask. So I think that reflects just how difficult and nuanced this conversation is in the state of Arizona and nationwide, because even if 100 people there say they're all pro-life, that may mean slightly different. different exceptions or allowances depending on who it is and so we are monitoring what's happening on the floor now. You know even if they did bypass procedures to be able to take a vote on the repeal let's say hypothetically if the house did repeal that, it would still have to go to the other chamber the senate. And the senate would have to hear this three times before they take a vote. So we are watching this incremental process of course in a state where the Republican majority in both chambers is razor thin at the moment. Just a majority of two Republicans in both House and Senate. We are also talking about a state that has since 2020 gone Democratic for the senate races, the gubernatorial race and so a lot has changed here this is a dynamic situation. You also have a group of people gathering signatures to try and put an initiative on the November ballot to try to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. A lot of the folks here today in the Right to Life group told me how seriously they are concerned about that. So that is bound to be another fight in the months to come. Boris, Jessica.",
