What we've heard from the family is that Hannah Kobayashi was last heard from on November 11th. Now, that's really more than two weeks ago now with a strange set of text messages, which we can show again on the screen here, where she texts a friend saying deep hackers wiped my identity, stole all of my funds and have had me on a mind F since Friday. I got tricked pretty much giving into giving away all my funds for someone I thought I loved. Now, in the recent interview given by her sister to News Nation right before Thanksgiving, her sister, Sydni Kobayahi, says, in my mind, it feels like someone is controlling her. Her sister said that may not have even been her. The family also mentions surveillance video that they have seen showing Hannah Kobayashi at a downtown metro station. It's unclear exactly when that footage was taken. But, again, all of this is coming from the family. The police have not released any of this footage. Everyone is being very careful and tight-lipped despite all the massive amounts of tips that we are aware that police and the family are getting.",

This move comes despite the commissioner of their conference already ruling that the player in question meets the eligibility standards to compete. The controversy has not only divided the volleyball world, but the Spartan team, including one player who filed a lawsuit to prevent their own teammate from competing in that conference tournament.

This was a glimpse we got, Jim and Boris, thanks to the French president making his seventh and final visit to what has been a construction site now for more than five years. In fact, he described it to the many thousands of workers who were involved and who gathered inside to hear him today and to hear his thanks as the construction site of the century. And so the cameras followed the French president inside.It was extraordinary. He went to visit, for instance the forest, as it's known, which is the part in the roof of the cathedral where this fire began. We still don't know how, by the way, several years of investigation, still haven't told us whether it was a cigarette of a workman or an electrical fault, and the investigation's now been closed. Whatever started it, it was up there in the timbers, the beams of the roof that it quickly picked up speed and took on such life. He visited those timbers, lovingly restored 2,000 oaks felled and used in the reconstruction of the cathedral, which is exactly as it was, and yet so much better. I got the chance of going in earlier and it is a completely different experience than what it was going in before the fire. Although it's been restored precisely as it was, the Crown of Thorns, one of the greatest relics in the catholic religion repositioned, but this time in a golden sculpture that you can see it better and that it should be better displayed. Although all the details of its construction have been respected and they've sought to rebuild it as it was, the fact that it is now clean and the stones are gleaming and the artwork has been restored, the colors are what they were not just five years ago but before they got journeyed by several centuries of wear and tear, the gold the statues, the works of art entirely restored. The impression is quite different to what it was when you would go in five years ago, where if you'll remember, it was quite somber. There was a darkness about Notre Dame. You could guess a lot of the artwork you could see it, but you had to get up quite close. It is entirely transformed. And you get a much greater sense of the extraordinary construction that it is. It is even more awe inspiring than it was before it caught fire, Jim and Boris.",
