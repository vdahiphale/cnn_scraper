And that is why the two teams for here at the White House, but also Trump's incoming team have been working increasingly closely -- closer trying to achieve some type of ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. That is part of the reason why National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is in Israel today to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, trying to talk about ways to potentially advance these talks. Now, as you noted, there are negotiators for Hamas in Israel, back in Qatar, so far, the White House hasn't, you know exactly described what their expectations are of those talks, or spend any specific optimism around this -- these talks. But it does come as the U.S., the White House and the Trump side are both eager to try to push this along. There have been calls from the American hostage families for the two sides to work together. We know that President Biden and Trump talked about this personally when they met in the Oval Office last month. And National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan has said that he has remained in contact with Trump's incoming National Security Advisor, Congressman Mike Waltz, to keep him abreast of all the developments in the Middle East, but also specifically on the status of a potential hostage release deal. So, for president Biden this would certainly be a final feather in his cap, if he were actually able to achieve this hostage deal. But many are simply now preparing for the arrival of Trump. Trump is trying to leverage his own relationships, his own team, to try to get this across the finish line, and so we will see whether any of this coordination that the two teams --",

And that is the reasons why the Qataris are sort of back in the effort again. Because, of course, they had pulled out some weeks ago saying there was no good faith from either side as far as they were concerned. They, of course, are a key mediator in all of this. Let's leave that file for the time being. I'm sure many of our viewers will say we've been here before we have and we've been talking about trying to deal, the effort to get a deal done for months and months, of course, but it does sound as if things are really moving in the right direction at this point. On Syria what's the message from Jake Sullivan and the Biden Administration, two regional allies, including Israel. Of course, we've got Blinken on the move and Jake Sullivan on the move around this region where I am.",

Donald Trump being honored at the New York Stock Exchange to help celebrate the President-Elect being named Time Magazine's \"Person of the Year\". Let me bring in my colleagues, Stephen Collinson in Washington, D.C., and Anna Stewart in London, who joined me ahead of this opening. And we've got about 90 seconds before the President-Elect will ring the bell. He's flanked by some of the folks who will be working closely with him going forward. Not least, J.D. Vance there on the left-hand side of your screen, his wife, of course, I can't see whether that is -- I was thinking that was Lutnick, but it's not. I think that is the -- that is the CEO of Time Magazine as well. This is a 78-year-old billionaire. He was Times' \"Person of the Year\" in 2016. He's just been joking that he feels like this is the 2024 moment is a better one as far as he is concerned.

He's got Howard Lutnick in as a pick for his Commerce Secretary, a big guy on Wall Street, of course. And Scott Bessant in as his pick for Treasury Secretary. We are expecting him to get down onto the floor. Let's have a listen to the way that he is being received and the New York Stock Exchange. Chants of USA, USA, there I was speaking over that.

This is why we're seeing highs. It's good for things like Crypto. That's why we've been seeing Bitcoin highs. However, Becky, what will be interesting is what a Trump Administration might mean for the economy. In many ways, he will be inheriting a pretty robust economy. GDP growth is strong, unemployment is low. That said, the unemployment picture is cooling and inflation isn't going down as quickly as many economists would like. There's likely to be another rate cut next week from the Federal Reserve. And of course, many of Trump's policies could actually be quite inflationary, particularly when it comes to tariffs, Becky.",

He was joking about some of the invitations that he has extended for his inauguration on January the 20th. CNN learned some sort of 25 minutes before that, that the president-elect has invited, as we understand it, the President of China, Xi Jinping, to that inauguration. If that is who he was speaking about at this event earlier on, he said, let's -- you know I've extended some invitations. Let's see who turns up. What do you make of that invite for the Chinese President after all, we've had these threats of huge tariffs against China?",

      "sentences": "Well, there were so many contradictions in everything surrounding Trump. There are people in his administration, Marco Rubio, thedesignee for Secretary of State, for example, and Trump himself, in many ways, who believe that China represents an existential economic and national security threat to the United States. That's why there's talk of tariffs against China. It's less about a trade war. These people see tariffs as a tool of national security policy, yet Trump invites Xi Jinping to his inauguration. He often spoke on the campaign trail that he had a great relationship with the President of China. Obviously, it would look to the rest of the world if Xi decided to come to the inauguration that he was coming to pay tribute to Trump. That is the kind of situation Trump likes when we have negotiations with China, and when the relations probably will get worse when Trump takes office. All of that could be undermined by Trump deciding that he wants to meet Xi and do a deal. That's what happened in the trade war on the first term. That's what happened with his policy, hard line policy towards North Korea. Look at Trump there on Wall Street. This is another contradiction. He came to power. He won re-election by highlighting the pain, economic pain, of everyday Americans with high grocery prices. He's transformed the Republican Party from a Wall Street party to a populist working class party, but there he is holding court in the New York Stock Exchange. So, you never know what you're going to get with Trump. Any assumptions ahead of time you make are likely to be contradicted by his behavior.",

This is a strong, or certainly relatively robust U.S. economy Stephen, that the U.S. President is inheriting, despite what he has been saying during the campaign. He's right to suggest that in the end, it was how people felt about the cost of living, which is -- you know primarily one of the -- what, certainly one of the reasons that he won the election the way he did.

We'vealready seen mortgage rates recently go back up and the housing market tightening. Part of that may be due to the fact that it's winter and fewer people buy houses at this time, but there has been no relief. Even the economy is doing very well there's this gap between the way the economy is performing and the perception that people have. Having said that there have been some interesting polls out this week showing that Republicans now believe that the economy is doing much better, and that tells us that people's perception of the economy tends to align with their political views. And Donald Trump right now, CNN poll this week said that about 55 percent of people are happy with the way he's handling his transition and are optimistic. So, a lot of this is about the feel of the economy as well. But Trump, right now, he's effectively behaving as president. Biden has pretty much failed from the scene. He's still basking in the glory of his election. In a month's time, everything he does will have a political impact. He will be responsible for everything and when things go wrong. So, we're in a little bit of a honeymoon phase. If Trump behaves the way that he normally behaves, it probably isn't going to last very long.",
