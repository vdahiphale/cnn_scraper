But in terms of the operation itself, the fact that this took place in a tunnel, that Al-Qadi was rescued from a tunnel would make this the first such successful hostage rescue operations since October 7th. You have had previous successful operations, the most recent one in June when four hostages were rescued. But this would be the first time that a hostage was rescued from a tunnel. As you noted, the IDF spokesman saying, based on intelligence that Israeli forces received. And you had a collection of forces involved in this, including special commando units, including -- and this is notable -- a combat engineering unit, an elite combat engineering unit that is tasked specifically with operations targeting those tunnels and not just hostage rescue operations, of course, but operations going after Hamas fighters there. So that is significant but it also, that, that number that Hagari mentioned, weighs heavily over all of this and that 108 remain left behind. And the sad fact is that many of those 108 are no longer alive. Israeli officials have acknowledged that. They haven't said exactly how many but perhaps dozens are already dead. So any hostage deal that is being negotiated now as those talks continue, involve -- would involve, in the best-case scenario, right, the return of both living hostages but also hostages, the bodies of hostages who have already died in captivity in Gaza.",

We have learned a little about this operation described as complex by the IDF. We know that there were quite a lot of assets involved in this, not least an engineering unit. We know that this hostage was rescued from underground tunnels on the back of intelligence. Piece together, if you will, for us, the information that we have. What sort of -- what sort of story, what sort of rescue are we talking about here? Is it clear? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, it's not quite clear yet, Becky. But what we do know is that there are several units, as you and Jim have just mentioned, that were clearly involved in this. And one of those is the Yahalom special engineering unit. This is a special operations unit that is designed to go into very complex areas like those tunnels. And Yahalom working in conjunction with the Israeli equivalent of the Navy SEALs. This is an organization known as Shayetet 13. And that organization is absolutely a very top-notch commando unit. So in conjunction with that, other intelligence units as well as IDF units, they put together a very complex operation that was designed not only to find the hostage but also to pull him out. And that takes a lot of daring, a lot of very operational movements. And it was designed really to do this very, very quickly. And it seems like this was done basically in broad daylight. So that is also a significant factor in this operation.",

This is Kaid Farhan Al-Qadi, rescued earlier today byIsraeli commandos from a tunnel in southern Gaza, abducted by Hamas on October 7th. He was working as a security guard when he was kidnapped. He's lost some weight, it has to be said. We've compared the image that we had on file of this hostage and where you see him now but clearly relieved with his family at the hospital, where he is receiving medical treatment. They, the IDF said his condition is certainly stable. And certainly there, a father of 11, I can't tell you whether that was one of his kids that he was holding there. But you can only imagine how relieved he is after 326 days to get to see his family and his little ones. Earlier -- Cedric, stay with me. Earlier I spoke to Colonel Miri Eisin, a member of the IDF reserves, to get her reaction to this release. And while she understands at the celebration in Israel, she said this rescue gives her more of a sense of relief than joy. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. MIRI EISIN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES RESERVES:  Every single one of the hostages that comes back is part of what Israelis want and need to understand and to feel this could be any one of us. This is a man in his 50s, a citizen of Israel; as said, a Bedouin Arab, both a citizen of Israel. And he has been in captivity for 10.5 months and I'm just happy for him, for his family. And I want that same closure for all of the other over 100 Israelis and non-Israelis held in captivity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this is something that preoccupies the IDF and the intelligence forces in Israel all the time, because what you see underneathRafah, Becky, is a large system of tunnels. And that really is characteristic of most of Gaza and something Israelis have found as they've gone in after October 7th. They've found that these complex tunnels are very difficult to eradicate, very difficult to find. And once you do locate them, it becomes very difficult to go after specific targets, whether it's Hamas entities that they're looking for or weapons caches or hostages. And that is really what is driving the Israeli efforts. So when you look at the things that they're looking for, they're looking for not only where the hostages are but also, when you're talking about Rafah and the southern part of Gaza, what kind of connections are there toward Egypt, for example? Because the Egyptian border is right there. And that is the kind of thing that is necessary from a military perspective for them to go after. So they have a very complex task. They're trying to make sure that no resupply efforts can make it to Hamas. And they're also trying to find the hostages. And in this particular situation, we were obviously lucky in getting to the hostage and making sure that he could be -- could be not only (INAUDIBLE) but also rescued in the sense that they've been able to transport him back to Israel and to the level of care there. But the other thing that they're looking at is how do you repeat that, now that this hostage situation has occurred, where they've been able to rescue this hostage? We can assume that Hamas has increased its capabilities to at least their vigilance to guard against similar Israeli the efforts. And for a while, it'll be a bit harder for the Israelis to rescue hostages like this. That will then wear off because of time and just the general propensity to loosen your guard after (INAUDIBLE) after a certain time. But that is, I think, one of the complex aspects of what the Israelis are doing in this particular case. And it's a very, very difficult operation.",

He endured 326 days of captivity before he was rescued in what the Israeli military has described as this complex operation involving its elite, Shayetet 13, of forces that is the equivalent of the Navy SEALs. After he was rescued in Gaza, we saw -- we just received images actually of him with the head of Israel's southern command in what appears to be a home inside of the Gaza Strip. After that, he was taken by helicopter to Soroka Medical Center in the southern Israeli city of Be'er Sheva, where he was evaluated to be in stable medical condition and where his family members rushed in to be able to hug him for the first time. They emerged from that hospital room saying that he appeared to be in good condition, although he did seem to have lost quite a bit of weight during his time in captivity. He was quickly asking about his family members, asking about their well-being as well as his mother's well being and was told that everyone was doing fine.

The hostages and missing families forum calling this rescue operation a miracle but emphasizing what so many here in Israel knows to be true.

An ice cave in the Breidamerkurjokull Glacier collapsed on Sunday, killing one American, injuring another. The couple was touring the glacier in southern Iceland when disaster happened. The collapse prompted a major search for two additional tourists believed trapped under the ice. SVEINN KRISTJIAN RUNARSSON, CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT, SOUTH ICELAND POLICE (through translator):  It's difficult to get equipment to the area. The rescue missions are therefore mainly done by hand, digging and breaking the ice. So yes, these are very challenging circumstances. VAUSE (voice-over):  But no one was found and police have since confirmed there have been only 23 people on the tour, not 25. The collapse though is now raising questions about the potential role of human-caused climate change. Iceland is warming roughly three times faster than the rest of the planet because of burning of fossil fuels and carbon emissions. And the renowned Breidamerkurjokull Glacier has been melting since 1930, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tourism brings in billions of to Iceland's economy. And tourism officials there are now said to be drafting a new report on glacier tours in the wake of the collapse.
