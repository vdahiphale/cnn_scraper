Remember, I think the senator referred to Republicans kicking out the speaker. Well, no, eight members used a tool that should be used very carefully. They used it, I think, very callously, and instead of being lectured too by the senator, it would have been helpful, I think, for Democrats to respect the institution and not engage in an effort to undo the Republican leadership.",
