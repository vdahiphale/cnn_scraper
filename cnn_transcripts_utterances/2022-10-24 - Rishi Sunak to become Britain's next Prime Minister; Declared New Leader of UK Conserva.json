Extraordinary, isn't it? He got quite a welcome heading into Conservative Party quarters just moments ago, after the Tories picked him as their leader. We'll now be watching whether Sunak can unite the party and the drama where the British public as well as it's his job really to turn around the British economy. He is looking at how the pounds reacting. Let's see it. I'm sure he'll come up at some point. It's down slightly. But there are many factors playing into that not a dramatic move, I guess this case of wait and see all those financial analysts really waiting to hear that statement from him as much as we are. My next guest tweeted this unfortunately, some people will insist this good news is proof of a global coup, referring to Boris Johnson's exit from the race and the calm tone on the UK financial markets as Investors bet that Rishi Sunak will stick to his economic policies that have helped the markets in recent days. Joining me here outside the UK Parliament is Tim Montgomery Co-Founder of the Center for Social Justice and creator of the conservative home website, which is where so many conversations have been had in recent days. First of all, what you understand happened in the last 12 hours or last 24 hours when Boris Johnson literally pulled out then Penny Mordaunt pulled out leaving Rishi Sunak to be crowned really, Prime Minister? TIM MONTGOMERY, CREATOR, CONSERVATICEHOME.COM: Well, I'm going to say something extraordinary to you Max, but I'm not sure we necessarily heard the full truth from Boris Johnson when he said he had the numbers and he thought he could win. We don't fly back from the Caribbean from the holiday. And just on the chance that you might consider running. He definitely wanted to run.

Rishi Sunak making a brief public statementjust a few minutes ago, it was all hugs and smiles just before as the former finance minister went into Conservative Party headquarters, but amid the backdrop of division, not to mention an economy on the precipice of a recession. We'll see how long the good cheer lasts, frankly. Bianca shows us now how Rishi Sunak made his way all the way to number 10? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After making the runoff in the second leadership contest in as many months its second time lucky for Britain's new Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak but that is where his luck runs out. Sunak inherits an economic nightmare stoked by soaring inflation war in Europe, a party at its lowest level of popularity in a generation eating itself alive, changing prime ministers at a pace never seen. The last Liz Truss became Britain's shortest serving leader ever at a mere six weeks. But the former chancellor has not sugar coated the challenges Britain faces assuring that he has the economic credentials to steer the nation through the crisis. SUNAK: We have to be honest, but borrowing your way out of inflation isn't a plan. It's a fairy tale. NOBILO (voice over): The predictions he made about the impact of Truss's tax cutting economic plans were vindicated. On to parents of Indian descent Sunak is Britain's first person of color to become prime minister. But his path to power is a tale as old as time, educated at one of Britain's most exclusive schools, Winchester College on to Oxford University like over half of the country's Prime Minister then into the finance industry. After being praised for slick performances during the pandemic he was tipped to become the next leader. Then his political fortunes took a nosedive. Sunak's resignation as chancellor in the last days of the Boris Johnson government was seen as being instrumental in Johnson's downfall. Then Sunak lost the leadership contest to replace Johnson after his popularity had taken a battering, with many Johnson supporters blaming him for Johnson's end. The London police had fined him for attending an illegal gathering and lockdown and his wife Akshata Murthy, the daughter of the Indian billionaire founder of Infosys, came under fire for her non-domicile status, sparing her a huge tax bill on her massive foreign income. Sunak ranks among the UK's richest and has been labeled out of touch with ordinary voters.",

And he did all the right things. He played it by the book, he paid tribute to Liz Truss, he's still currently Prime Minister said that he was humbled and honored to have won the leadership contest that being Prime Minister will be the greatest achievement of his life, the greatest honor and privilege of his life and that he wanted to create a government of all talents. And that part's key, because I know that you've been discussing with your guests as well, the challenge ahead for Sunak will be uniting the party governing in a way that restores confidence. And there's been a lot of chatter about needing to bring in a broad church of opinion, the most talented assets that the Conservative Party has to show for itself from all the different wins.

However, as a prime minister, he doesn'tenter Downing Street from the position of strength of a prime minister that's just won a big majority in election. After all, he hasn't done that. So he will be buffeted by the various different policy priorities and agendas of people within his own party. At the moment, the party looks like he is willing to try holding together because they know that they would face electoral oblivion if they didn't, and they have to try and restore some of the public trust in them. But Sunak is still in a very difficult position. And in fact, the Labor Party who had been pushing for a general election to take place now, the Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said that Rishi Sunak has been crowned this time saying barely anything about how he would lead the country going forward, or about the economic crisis that it faces and what he would do. And indeed, the economy has deteriorated significantly from when Sunak was last running against Liz Truss. And we heard a lot more about his economic beliefs. And even though people describe him and do it in a relative sense, yes, that's true as a safe pair of hands, and a clever political operator. Actually, he's still relatively untested in the great historical arc of Prime Minister's because when he was Chancellor during the pandemic, he didn't have a blank check, but it was unprecedented circumstances. And he was allowed to do quite a lot of public spending, because this was a once in a generation once in a lifetime issue that the country was facing, also people hope. So we haven't really seen how he's going to navigate the new political terrain. And also, let's not forget that he was Boris Johnson's Chancellor. So a lot of the media attention and scrutiny and focus naturally were absorbed and encouraged by Boris Johnson. And he was somewhat sidelined in that respect. So we will learn a lot more about Rishi Sunak because there's still plenty of an obscure area when it comes to policy and how he's going to approach this Max.",

He said that Ukraine will be a firm friend and a long term friend of Britain that he wanted to increase the cultural and economic links continue to support the fighters continue to provide aid. And he sent love from his family to the families in Ukraine. So it was quite a powerful and empathetic statement to the Ukrainians, which was well received there. So we can expect that kind of commitment to continue in terms of how he operates with other leaders, I think you'll be more playing with a straight bat. Then Liz Truss, for example, and understanding the importance of alliances like - Francis Emmanuel Macron, when Liz Truss famously said some fairly controversial things, and other leaders on the world stage Sunak is more predictable. He's a slicker operator. He's more planned, some would even say robotic about what he says.

But I think the expectation from the markets is this will be a much more stable government with much more support from both within the party and hopefully in Parliament as well.

If Jeremy Hunt is included, and if he is Chancellor and that is the general expectation. Right now all we really know in terms of that economic plan is to just reverse what Liz trusted. Well, Sunak said in the first leadership contest was essentially that, while he would like to lower taxes, he wasn't planning to do anything of that measure into inflation was under control. Now, inflation is absolutely not under control, it's got a lot worse since he was chancellor, that's Rishi Sunak now at double digits, and we've had more data out today suggesting the UK is heading for a deep recession. So the challenges here are huge. And I think first of all, we'll get the fiscal statement on Halloween, October 31 assuming Rishi Sunak keeps with that plan, with perhaps Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor. After that point, it will be interesting to see once the sort of emergency situation is over what the economic policies will be going forwards, but I don't expect was here huge amount of that in the initial few days.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): Women life freedom, a rallying cry that is only growing stronger as protests in Iran enter their sixth week sparked by the death of 22 year old Mahsa Jina Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police in September. But as the regime intensified, its brutal and deadly crackdown on protesters, it's also scrambling to control the narrative, jailing at least 40 journalists as protest first began, according to the CPJ.",

Just a short while ago, the former finance minister also mentioned the profound economic challenge facing the UK. Once he meets with King Charles, Sunak will become Britain's third Prime Minister in two months. Downing Street has reportedly confirmed that that won't happen today. So we'll expect that to happen tomorrow. We're waiting to hear how he plans to achieve this unity turn around the economy. Let's go to Bianca. I mean, it's extraordinary, isn't it that Boris Johnson was just looking he was in power last month, and then we had Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak.

So Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party will be hoping that his election as leader will be brought will bring a certain at least stay of stability for them to try and figure out how they're going to tackle the crises that are ahead of them.

But you do wonder what else she would speak about it sounds brutal, but with such a short premiership and one which brought so much extra turmoil to the British economy divided the party further may Britain in some respects a laughingstock in terms of international partners. What she would say, maybe she will want that last opportunity to have the seal of Prime Minister in front of her and speak to the nation. Perhaps she's got something left that she wants to address. Who knows? But as far as we're aware, Max, yes now King Charles the third will be coming back if he isn't back already to Buckingham Palace in London. So he's physically here and able to receive Liz Truss for resignation and Rishi Sunak to appoint him as prime minister and invite him to form a government that will in all likelihood take place tomorrow.

We can't say that.
