Joe Biden and Xi Jinping meet for the first time as presidents. Task number one, Taiwan and backing both countries off the ledge of a possible new cold war.Plus, we are still counting votes, still undecided the House and a critical governor's race in Arizona. But Democrats keep the Senate, which is a giant midterm win for the president. And is Donald Trump about to pour salt in open Republican wounds. He has a big announcement tomorrow, even as more and more Republicans say Trump is to blame, and that this time they really, really mean it when they say the GOP must move on. Up first though, a handshake and heavy global consequences. Today, the most important meeting between the two most powerful leaders on the planet, the American President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping. The session ran three plus hours. Mr. Biden emerged cautiously encouraged among the issues to climate, human rights, and of course, Taiwan. President Biden telling reporters the talks were \"open and candid\", blunt was another word he used and making clear he wants to stop a slide into a new cold war. And the president asserted again, no change in his view in the status \"towards Taiwan.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan, and I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all.

He seemed to express some measured optimism that U.S. Chinese relations, which had really reached a low point could be mended. He said that the two leaders found areas where they could work together on issues like climate change and ensuring that Russia doesn't resort to using nuclear weapons.And notably on the issue of Taiwan, President Biden saying that he believes that he and Xi came to an understanding, as he emphasized that the U.S. is still committed to the one China policy. And he also told reporters that he doesn't think there is an imminent threat of China invading Taiwan. This is more of what he have to say on that front. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. BIDEN: I am absolutely believers, need not be a new cold war. I want to be clear, and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping. That I mean, what I say, and I say what I mean. So, there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they really hope that the two leaders could land on some common areas and themes, and also that these lines of communication could get open. But I do think, John, it's going to be weeks and perhaps months before we learned for sure if this summit was the beginning of real improvements and U.S. Chinese relations. John?",

They both had a relationship in the past.And if the result of this meeting is to put the relationship back on a more diplomatic plane, in which instead of kind of beating each other up, they can begin a dialogue on the kind of issues that need to be dealt with.

China has made quite clear that it is prepared to take Taiwan. Now the president United States saying, he did not see that as imminent.The president United States also facing some pressure from conservatives back here at home, including the Wall Street Journal editorial board saying, Mr. Biden can't afford to show weakness in the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense. Mr. Biden is harming his own policy, they say, and U.S. interests by lacking your critical economic policy and strategy with Taiwan. Do you buy that? Is that just pressure on the president? Or does the United States, if you're going to convince Xi, we are serious? Does the United States have to do even more to help Taiwan now?",

And I think what he was trying to do in this meeting is to in indicate that our approach to Taiwan remains the same in terms of our one China policy. But he also made clear that if Xi does - do anything to go after Taiwan, we will be there to confront them.And the other the other part of this is that I think Xi has learned from what happened to Putin in Ukraine, that you can talk about invading another country. But it's another story as to whether or not you'll be successful. And I think that has put some hesitation into Xi and whether or not he would invade Taiwan.",

I don't think China wants that. I think the president was right to raise that issue.

Biden's approval ratings being fairly low. They really expected to perform much better than this.And there's just a lot of finger-pointing right now, I think frustration at Republican leaders that there was not a clear agenda for them to run on that they didn't really put forward much of a policy platform frustration that they didn't do enough to fend off some of these Trumpian candidates, far-right candidates who many believe simply were not electable at the end of the day.

The most likely outcome here is a very narrow Republican majority. But I can just put up the dates here. Alaska and Maine, we expect the Democrats to win in both those states, they have so called rank choice voting. And as you see from the dates there that will come in later this month, California and Oregon, where there are still some races, Jeff, where A, Democrats are leading they need to lock up but a few where Republicans are leading, and they could possibly flip.
