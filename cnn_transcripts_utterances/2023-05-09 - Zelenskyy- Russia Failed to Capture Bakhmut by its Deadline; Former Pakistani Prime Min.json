And debt debate in Washington, President Biden sits down with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other Republican leaders. Their first face to face talks on raising the debt limit. The two sides are far apart right now with time certainly running out to find a solution. On financial markets U.S. futures are lower as investors await the outcome of today's negotiations and brace for important inflation data tomorrow CPI is coming out tomorrow Europe also under pressure as well after mixed Asian handover. Chinese stocks falling amid news that imports plunged almost 8 percent last month. The data showing China's economy is struggling even after the end of COVID- 19 locked down. So much to get through this hour, we begin though, with the latest from Moscow and Ukraine earlier today Russians marked the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two while the war of course in Ukraine still rages on. The Victory Day celebrations were significantly scaled down with only one tank and under tight security after a reported drone attack on the Kremlin itself. Last week, President Putin delivered a defiant speech to the crowd and said that Russia is the victim of its war with Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Basically, that this was a war that's been orchestrated by the West, this isn't really a battle against Ukraine. This is a battle against all the Western powers are using Ukraine to try and destroy Russia. We've heard it time and again, and Vladimir Putin used this platform on Victory Day in the center of the Russian capital in Red Square to restate that narrative, again, but he was presiding over a shrunken parade. It was still a big display of military Mike, don't get me wrong. I mean, there were 8000 troops there. But last year, there was something more like 12,000, the year before it was even more than that. There was no aerial display this year. And it wasn't for weather reasons. It was cancelled. It was for some other reason, probably security reasons. And as you mentioned, there was only one tank at the intercontinental ballistic missiles were at the center of the display as they are every year, a reminder that Russia has this nuclear power, this nuclear deterrent, there's nuclear threat, if you'd like it chooses to rattle its nuclear saber, quite often. You know, but, again, a much shrunken spectacular than what we've seen in previous years. And that's partly to do with the security situation. There has been an upsurge in attacks against key Russian installations, particularly on the Kremlin. Just a couple of days ago, just last week, drones, according to the Kremlin struck the Kremlin in what they called a Ukrainian assassination attempt on the life of Vladimir Putin. But there's also speculation that Russia, which is heavily engaged in Ukraine, which is preparing for a counter offensive by the Ukrainian Military simply doesn't have the forces to bear to bring to Red Square to put on display, which is why perhaps there was only one old Second World War era tank, and none of its latest newest military equipment.",

Time is running out to resolve the debt ceiling with the Treasury warning its cash reserves will dry up early next month by June 1 approximately. That leaves America at risk of defaulting on its debt for the first time ever. And President Biden announced Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could not be further apart.

That's extremely slim and that is because both sides are so dug in right now. What you have from the White House is this argument that they are willing to have a conversation about spending cuts and the federal government's budget. But they want to do that on a separate track separate from the debt ceiling increase. Meanwhile, you have House Republicans who are walking into this meeting today, with Speaker McCarthy having more leverage than maybe anyone else in that room ever expected him to have. That is because he passed legislation. It is the only bill that has passed a chamber of the House of Representatives in which he increases the debt ceiling. And it's accompanied by trillions in spending cuts. He's arguing that he's shown he has the votes for a deal, of course, that legislation has no chances of passing and the democratically controlled U.S. Senate. So all sides walking in today, really no closer to reaching an agreement, the hope is that the fever can perhaps break and perhaps everyone can find a way to have this conversation about some kind of two track plan one, to cut spending, the other to try and increase the debt ceiling to ensure that the country does not default on its debt. And of course, it's important to remind everyone, this is not new spending. This is the bills that the U.S. has already incurred. And that is the argument that you're hearing from Democrats over and over again, that in the past, they don't negotiate on this issue. And this is really harkening back to a standoff that happened more than a decade ago now in which both sides of the aisle found themselves in a very similar negotiating positions pushing this deadline right to the brink with the markets reacting in a way that finally brought everyone back to the negotiating table. It's about three to four weeks we expect that they have to work on this legislation.

We also saw last year there were 151, at least military vehicles. And today, we think there are about 50. So it was a small, small number of vehicles. And the parade itself was less than an hour long. And we haven't seen that in years in years. It was also a small crowd.

And also it limits our creativity as well just walk us through how AI can tackle all of that?",

      "sentences": "You bet, let's take a big picture for just amoment. Of the people that we surveyed 31,000 people 64 percent of them told us that they just don't have the time and energy to get their work done. And then when we probed a little bit ask them well, what's going on? They told us that they were just struggling under this weight of work, this burden of work. So we looked into the telemetry, we found that they were spending as we looked at what they were doing about 60 percent of their time communicating that's meetings, chats, emails, only about 40 percent of their time creating or being innovative. And that's that digital debt that we're talking about. So there's this sense that there is a kind of a heaviness associated with work, some people tell us they feel like they've been have two jobs. Now the exciting thing is employees are more optimistic than they are fearful of AI. And we see AI as a way to lift some of that digital burden that they feel and get them out of the communication business and back into the innovation business. And that's what's exciting for us.",

      "sentences": "See, it's interesting, because when you think about, you know, just as you point out how everyone is inundated with emails and that sort ofthing, and sort of taking some of that burden away will allow us to be creative. There are many people who think that improper use or overuse of AI, will actually limit our creativity. How do you strike that balance?",

      "sentences": "Well, we think that the way to think about this is that AI is essentially a kind of an assistant. We call it a co-pilot at work. Soyou're still in charge, you still are the pilot. It's your job to get the work done. But AI can come in and help you with those tasks first, that really are about communicating and finding the signal from the noise. I use it personally, for instance, to have more efficient meetings, I use it to not go to some meetings, which I love. I use it to never start with a blank slate as I start to do work in something like Microsoft Word. So when we really look at how people are using AI today, we're finding it that allows them to cut through that digital debt, it allows them actually to then use the power of AI these large language models to be more creative.",

How can you sort of pass that on to other consumers of AI, especially in business in the workplace, so that they also use AI thoughtfully because obviously there are risks associated with it as well?",

      "sentences": "Well, the interesting thing about AI is that it isn't always right, at least these large language models that have been in the news somuch recently. And that is new, most people are used to using a computer where they punch in, for instance, an equation a math problem, they get an answer out, that's always right every time. We like to teach people that these large language models, even when they're wrong, are usefully wrong. What we mean by that is they're helping you get closer to your goal. But that means you have a new set of skills to learn, you have to learn how to fact check. You have to learn how to make sure you understand the big picture enough to recognize when it might not quite be right. And so that new set of skills that knew -- what we would call AI Aptitude is important for everyone. It's going to be an important set of skills that we're all going to have to learn.",

Whatwe've essentially done is we've taken these large language models. We've combined it with the power of the Microsoft apps, that's Word Excel, PowerPoint, Teams and Outlook, the things that literally billions of people use every day to get their work done. And we put it at the point of work. So no longer do you have to go to some other place to get AI to help for right within your inbox. It's summarizing emails. It's helping you to draft replies. Right within your meetings you can ask it hey, you know, summarize the decisions we've made and what's still outstanding that kind of like at the point of work, insertion of AI, we think that's the best way to scale. We just make sure it's available for people. And we're really excited about that.",
