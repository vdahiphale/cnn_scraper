      "sentences": "And straight from THE SOURCE tonight.He is on a roll. Hours from an expected Super Tuesday blowout, Donald Trump has just won big at the Supreme Court. But inside the unanimous decision, there's a blistering warning, about the consequences that were just unleashed. Also, a shot across the bow of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Vice President meeting behind closed doors, today, with a top member of Israel's war cabinet, who just so happens to be Netanyahu's biggest political rival, in Israel. And also, there was not a dry eye, in the City of Brotherly Love today, as Jason Kelce bid an emotional goodbye to Philadelphia, with Travis looking on in tears. But there's not a whole lot to cry about for these two. Our friend, Bob Costas, is here live, on the business of being the Brothers Kelce. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. The Supreme Court has not played this direct of a role, in a presidential election, since Bush v. Gore. And tonight, the ruling is unanimous. That's how history will record Donald Trump's 9-0 victory today. But inside that same ruling, it is exposing deep cracks, in that united front, on the Supreme Court. The justices offered very different ways of explaining the same result. But they did, in the end, agree that Donald Trump will remain on the ballot. And of course, this came just 24 hours before the first Super Tuesday polls, are about to open now, just about nine hours from where we are, at this moment. The biggest primary night. And Donald Trump is expected to rack up blowout wins, and buckets of delegates, from coast to coast, putting him within reach of the Republican nomination. The question of whether he engaged in an insurrection? Remember the one that the Colorado courts found? Well, that was left untouched, entirely today, too hot for the High Court, kind of. Put a pin in that because we have a lot to discuss. And we'll get to that in just a moment. The other thing that stood out from this, though, was how Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided, at one point, with the court's liberals, and their uneasiness, about the potential consequences of the reach, just how broad it was, of this ruling. But she also chastised Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson, for their language, warning about turning down the national temperature, not cranking it up. She wrote, at one point, quote, \"This is not the time to amplify disagreement.\" But we are hearing from our sources tonight that Trump's bigger concern is not what happened today. It's of what's to come from the Supreme Court. His claim of absolute immunity, of course, looms on the horizon. But right now, it's really giving him what he wants, from this court, more time, to delay his potential trials. That's why it was so surprising to hear him today, hours after we found out what the Supreme Court had decided, praising them, for moving so quickly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They worked hard. And frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about a 100 years from now, and 200 years from now, extremely important. I have great respect for the Supreme Court. And I want to just thank them, for working so quickly, and so diligently, and so brilliantly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They didn't want to go there. And you can see that sort of the terror, in the opinions, in the concurring opinions. I mean, Justice Barrett was just, you know, it just -- her opinion just exuded fear, of the political consequences of the decision. And frankly, the dis -- the concurring opinion, I know, they, you know, they're perceived as having attacked the majority opinion, for going too far.

I don't think there's anything in that opinion that actually holds, and that couldn't be, because it's not -- it wasn't presented by the case, that there is -- that somehow insurrectionists are completely immunized, from any kind of federal action, to apply Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.

He's got three children, unlike Travis, who is a carefree bachelor, connected to perhaps the world's most famous single woman. So, there's a difference between the two of them, there. Also, a difference in the position they played. Center is a brutal position. The game itself is brutal.",

He was always kind of underrated. He always had to prove people wrong. It's not a glamour position.And here he is, likely five years from now, to wind up in the Hall of Fame in Canton.

So, they're never on the field against each other. They're never going to collide, with each other, head-to-head.And it was a very close game, as you may remember. And Kansas City won it over Philadelphia. And then, you see that scene of the two of them embracing.
