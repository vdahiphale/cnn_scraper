And one of the things they say is, look, the Russians have had a long time to build up a lot of those minefields and trenches in the south of the country, which, quite frankly, makes it very difficult for them to advance. But I was able to speak to a presidential adviser to the Zelenskyy administration. And he said, look, one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that, when this war started, when Russia started that full-on invasion of Ukraine, everybody was afraid of the Russian military. And now what we have is, we're talking about a large-scale Ukrainian counteroffensive on multiple fronts and the Russians simply on the defensive. That is certainly something that many people would never have expected. So the Ukrainians believe that they can continue that. They say the momentum is on their side. And, certainly, when we look back at the past week of the events that have been unfolding, Jim, we do see that, around the Bakhmut area, the Ukrainians say that they have made some gains which are small in scale, but certainly very significant for them. They say it will help them to take under fire some of the logistic routes that the Russians have near Bakhmut. And, certainly, if you look at the Ukrainians right now, they believe the momentum is on their side. And they certainly right now say that they want to take back all of their territory. It's probably one of the messages that Zelenskyy is going to be putting out there as well, Jim.",

They want to see broader spending contours before they sign on to any deal. They are trying to work through this right now with members from all different corners of the Republican Conference. But there is a long way to go. And as you noted at the top, House leaders had to pull a planned procedural vote for this bill, teeing it up for Thursday. Now, it's very unclear what the schedule and timing would be. Meanwhile, you have some Republicans who are beginning to signal to their conference that they may try to cut a deal with Democrats if Republicans are not going to get on board. Now, they would have to use a very arcane procedural step to do that. It would be a very big long shot for Republicans to take that gamble. And you can bet that any moderate who crossed the aisle and tried to force a vote on the floor with Democrats, they would face intense backlash from conservatives, but it is a potential option if Republicans can't find a way forward on their own. Right now, of course, it doesn't look like they can, and this is just a continual issue we are seeing from the Republicans over and over again.
