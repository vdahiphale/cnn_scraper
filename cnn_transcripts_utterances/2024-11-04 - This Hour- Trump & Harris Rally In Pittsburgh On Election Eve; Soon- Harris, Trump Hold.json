Katy Perry is set to get on stage at the Harris rally, in just a few moments. And later this hour, Donald Trump will be headed to, yes, you guessed it, Grand Rapids, Michigan. That is where he closed out his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. It's where he'll finish this one as well, very late into the evening, I should note. Meanwhile, Vice President Harris is set to finish off her campaign, in Philadelphia, tonight, where the Founding Fathers gathered, the site of the signing of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. A very symbolic nod, as she is giving that speech, at the famous Rocky Steps. Expect to see more celebrities on stage with her, later this evening. Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, Oprah also expected to be there. Trump's finale comes after a final sprint, today, that included a stop in North Carolina as well. As CNN is learning from sources tonight that his exasperated aides and allies are urging him to stay on message. They fear that he has strayed from that message at times, including that rally in Pennsylvania that we discussed, last night. And given the dark and inflammatory rhetoric, one thing is safe to say. These candidates are leaving it all on the table, with two very different visions. My lead source tonight is the Independent senator from Vermont, who has been out campaigning for Vice President Harris. Senator Bernie Sanders joins us now. Senator, I mean, the only thing that everyone can talk about is what's going to happen, tomorrow. It's obviously an incredibly tight race, based on the polling that we've seen. What is your sense of what we're going to see, happen tomorrow? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): I can't tell you anything different than you already know. It's going to be a very, very close race. And for all of those people out there, who believe in democracy, who believe in women's rights, who believe that climate change is real and not a hoax? Don't sit it out.

That's not the case for many young men today, of all ethnicities, not just White young men we focus a lot on, but all young men. And so, I think the Republican message of traditionalism, wanting to provide some level of economic advantage to men, is appealing to many who find themselves dislocated.

There are many Democrats from inside the Harris campaign to just rank-and-file who do believe that Donald Trump can win. So, that is a major difference here. Of course, so many differences as well, so many things have changed. The Supreme Court decision. The Dobbs decision. But talking to a variety of senior advisers tonight, there is apprehension and anxiety in the ranks of the Harris campaign. I was just talking to a senior adviser a few moments ago, and they said there is no over-confidence. That loses elections. So, for all the talk of the good vibes, for all the talk of the optimism, there is some optimism. But they also know that tomorrow, right here in Pennsylvania, they need to get more than half of the votes go out on Election Day. So, that is what we are going to hear from Vice President Harris, when she arrives here. So yes, Lady Gaga is important. But the whole idea of this is to energize volunteers to get them to get out the vote tomorrow. So Kaitlan, it feels different than eight years ago, no doubt, but for a variety of reasons.

But the fear is that he says anything that is incredibly disrespectful, insulting or even inappropriate, which he has some history of doing, as we know, that that could keep voters at home. And they are very aware that this election is going to be decided in the margins, by a very small number of voters. They need every single vote that they can get. And they don't need Donald Trump essentially stepping on himself, at this point in the campaign. He has been at multiple rallies, rambling some, but still trying to keep away from some of those incredibly insulting remarks. But one thing I want to notice here is that one of the other things they told Donald Trump, is that he needs to keep his speeches shorter and be on time. We're here at this rally venue, in Grand Rapids, which is almost full. It's still filling in. We'll see what happens. But one of the reasons being that Donald Trump doesn't like it when people report that they are leaving, that guests are leaving his rally. Well, part of the reason that they leave his rallies is because he's often very late, and goes on for a very long time. He is expected to be roughly an hour and a half late tonight.
