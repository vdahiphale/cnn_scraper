I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner. This is CNN News Central.So, Hollywood is effectively shut down. For the first time in 63 years, two major unions are now on strike at the same time, movie and TV actors now joining writers and heading for picket lines coast to coast. Overnight, Hollywood's largest union comprised of roughly 160,000 actors made the big decision after talks with the major studios and streaming services fell apart. They now join the 11,000 members of the Writers Guild who have been on strike since May. These fights are now hitting very hard, and hitting very far and wide. Upcoming film releases, new TV shows, they won't be coming soon. Releases and premieres will be delayed and the stars of those shows will not be out promoting their work. Perfect example is what just happened. The stars of the new movie, \"Oppenheimer,\" met with the likes of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, actually walked out of the UK premiere for their film last night just after the strike was called scenes CNN's Chloe Melas has more on this for us. So, Chloe, where do things stand today?",

But, Kate, I want to also point out that it's not just actors that are being affected, it's the security, it's the craft services. It's all of the people behind the scenes that are making these productions work. And they're all going to be out of jobs now and I've been hearing from a lot of them. So what's at stake here? The actors and the writers are asking for better pay. They're asking for streaming residuals. And artificial intelligence is a major sticking point here. One of the major issues was AI proposal. And this was something that we heard about yesterday, that we know that the negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers were going back and forth on.So what they're offering when it comes to AI is background performers, so the extra. So, you know, when you see those scenes, like for instance in \"Game of Thrones\" where you have all of these actors in the background. What they want to do is they want to scan these actors and get one day's pay, and then they would use their likeness in perpetuity without paying them any more, right? So that is a sticking point. And we heard from Fran Drescher, who is the president of SAG-AFTRA, at a press conference yesterday, really come out strong about why they did not come to any sort of agreement and why it has now led to a full on strike. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA: You cannot change the business model as much as it has changed, and not expect the contract to change too. We're not going to keep doing incremental changes on a contract that no longer honors what is happening right now with this business model that was foisted upon us. What are we doing? Moving around furniture on the Titanic? It's crazy. So the jig is up AMPTP, we stand tall. You have to wake up and smell the coffee. We are labor and we stand tall. And we demand respect and to be honored for our contribution. You share the wealth because you cannot exist without us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The options are getting very slim when it comes to what you can watch. September usually brings a brand new season of the shows you watch, but don't count on that this fall.What you can expect, more reality shows and maybe game shows, in other words things that are not scripted. When the writer strike was looming, services like Netflix prepare. CEO Ted Sarandos said back in April, we had to make plans for the worst. We do have a pretty robust slate of releases to take us into a long time. But network productions for daytime soap operas, for example, they can still happen. So writers are typically not members of the union and the actors have a different contract than the one that has expired. As for movies, any remaining production will stop. Meaning the release of next year's big summer blockbusters like \"Gladiator 2\" and \"Mortal Kombat 2\" could get drastically pushed. The only exception to movie making right now is independent films. They are not tied -- that, excuse me, are not tied to any major production studio. Live theater will continue.

It is the ripple effect. And Chloe spoke about this a little bit. It's the impact to janitors. It's the impact of craft services. It's the impact to Uber drivers, deli owners in the area where these productions happen. And also prop companies who supply so much for these productions. And then, this is now no longer just a US economic impact. This is going to have impacts on other places internationally. Because US production studios, they film abroad, so we could see impacts in the UK, New Zealand, Australia,. And then, Kate, anywhere that we see studios doing post production work. And we heard from Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, yesterday on CNBC and he says that this strike is going to have collateral damage on other industries. Kate, just to put this into perspective, the last writer strike we saw was in 2007, lasted 15 weeks. That's on economic impact of $2 billion.
