Tonight, President Biden will speak from the Oval Office to explain why he's not running again. And a not-so-warm welcome. Protestors filling the Capitol rotunda and nearly 90 members of Congress saying that they won't attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address tonight. Plus, outdoor rallies could soon be a thing of the past for Donald Trump. A warning from the Secret Service after the attempt on his life. All right, it's 6 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at the White House as we continue to cover one of the most unprecedented campaigns in any of our lifetimes as now, Donald Trump battles Kamala Harris to get the chance to live there for four years. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Forget the rematch. The new 2024 presidential campaign is joined, and the race to introduce Kamala Harris is on. Here she was at her first campaign rally as the presumed Democratic nominee touted her record as an attorney general and a prosecutor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll dig into that in a moment.But first, if the last three weeks have taught us anything, it's that 24 hours can be a lifetime in politics. And the reality right now is one even the Trump campaign just can't ignore. Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio wrote this in a memo. He's trying to get ahead of what he dubbed the \"Harris honeymoon.\" Quote, \"We will start to see public polling, particularly national public polls, where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump.\" Well, here it is. A new Reuters/IPSOS poll shows Kamala Harris two points ahead of Donald Trump. That is within the margin of error. So here at CNN, we characterize that as having no clear leader. But let's compare it to the same poll, the Reuters IPSOS/poll, conducted on July 16 so that you can see how this poll has moved. So, look, there on the left of your screen, it's July 16, days after the assassination attempt against Donald Trump. Trump is up by two points. Of course, again, no clear leader in that poll. But look at the movement July 22, July 23, Harris plus two. That's a swing of four points. Now, Fabrizio, the Trump pollster, argues it's going to go away as the Trump campaign works to tie Harris to Joe Biden. But this is a reality shift for former President Trump. Now, he did not have a public event scheduled, but apparently, he feels the need to get into this conversation here. This was a rare move from a candidate. He used a press call to try to launch an attack on his new opponent.

We don't want to underestimate the impact of third-party candidates on this race. And so, in this instance, you see Harris actually pretty much holding -- she drops from 44 to 42 in this one. But Donald Trump drops from 40 to 38. So, he's lost four points to her 2 points. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. polling at 8 percent. I think we should note this doesn't include some candidates that might pull from Harris, including Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate; Cornel West, who's also running in this race.

There are question marks about whether RFK Jr. would take away more from the Democratic side or take away more from the Republican side. Certainly, it makes you wonder if that call between RFK Jr. and Donald Trump would have been any different if this kind of polling was clear. That and maybe it was.

And of course, this is all a result of the wildfires that are ongoing, not only from Western Canada, but into the Pacific Northwest, specifically across the state of Oregan. You can see kind of the evolution of the smoke going forward, much of that smoke concentrated across Eastern Oregon. We have poor air quality alerts, including Denver, stretching Northward towards the Canadian border as nearly 70 active large wildfires continue to burn. Here's our risk areas today. This is where we're concerned about dry lightning that could spark off more fires. This is, of course, on the backdrop of extreme heat.
