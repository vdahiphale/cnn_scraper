According to a transcript just released by the special counsel, this is what happened when an unnamed White House employee told the President that the networks were airing the riot.He was like, what do you mean? I said, it's like they're rioting there at the Capitol. And he was like, oh, really? All right, let's go see. I'm taking off his outer coat and I get the TV ready for him and hand him the remote, and he starts watching it. And I stepped out to get him a Diet coke. Come back in, and that's pretty much it for me as he's watching it and seeing it for himself.",

Obviously, I can't see through the redactions. But I can tell you this. Here's the kind of thing prosecutors ordinarily would redact. One, anything relating to an ongoing investigation that could jeopardize sources or witnesses. Number two, as Katelyn said, grand jury materials are typically supposed to remain confidential at least until trial. Number three, anything that may reveal personal identifying information about a person, Social Security number, a date of birth, that kind of thing. And finally, prosecutors generally try to avoid putting information out in the public that could reflect poorly on somebody other than a charged defendant.

I believe that Jack Smith, I know that Jack Smith and Judge Chutkan reversed the ordinary course or procedure here in these filings, ordinarily, the way it works under the rules or procedure is that the defense makes the motion first and then the prosecution responds. Jack Smith went into court back in September, said to Judge Chutkan, I want to reverse that. I want to go first. Judge Chutkan said that that request was, quote, \"procedurally irregular,\" and then she granted it.So that's the reason we're seeing this now. Now, Judge Chutkan is in a little bit of a different position, though. Jack Smith is bound by DOJ's policy against doing things that might influence an election, too close to an election. Judge Chutkan, as she points out in her ruling yesterday, is not. She's a judge. She's not bound by DOJ's policies. And she decided that the public needs to see this.

It's really just in the eye of the beholder, Alex. I think Donald Trump's team says, why wouldn't you just keep this under seal for 18 or 20 more days, not have to deal with the election? That's actually what happened in the hush money case. The judge over there said, I'm not going to sentence you a couple weeks before the election. We're just going to punt it till the end of November. Trump's team said that Judge Chutkan should do the same. Judge Chutkan disagreed.

And then in the last few months, has been the person who stood in the way for Hamas in getting a ceasefire.There have been at times over the course of negotiations where there were other senior officials in Hamas who wanted to move forward with a ceasefire.

But bringing home the remaining 101 hostages, including, importantly, seven Americans who are still held hostage in Gaza, is another critically important strategic objective. And we continue to believe the best way to do that is through an agreement that allows them to come home and then sets the conditions for real security for Israel.
