And finally as a pop goddess who's inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when the one and only Cher told me about reinventing herself and her incredible career. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. President Biden has been in Europe for his last ever meeting with the European quad of leaders as the U.S. inches closer to deciding his replacement and the next leader of the free world. And while there's no question that it is on a knife edge, Americans aren't the only ones on the edge of their seats. Foreign governments and citizens worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of this election too. So every vote remains crucial as that formidable vote getter and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows all too well. She spent this week here in the U.K., whipping up votes with Democrats abroad, warning U.S. citizens that the stakes in this election are higher than at any other time in recent history. And she came into the studio earlier this week to lay that out. And also to talk about her new book, \"The Art of Power\". I started by asking her though, to react to events in the Middle East where Israeli strikes hit U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon and the country's continued bombing of Gaza has forced the Biden administration to reiterate its strongest calls yet for Israel to let humanitarian aid in. I spoke to her before reports of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's death were confirmed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We cannot -- we -- war has to be outlawed as a resolution of any conflict or disagreement. But right now, we have to live with the circumstances that we have. We've all been talking about a two-state solution for a long time, for Israel and for the Palestinians. The current leader in Israel does not agree to that. I don't know if Netanyahu wants peace.

So they could see, you know, that they had experience and that they were still -- that they had experienced or steeled for it. There's -- there's also a signaling thing going on here knowing that we're going to come back, we're going to talk about this. The Japanese leaders that we met with all said, we're prepared to work with anybody. This is incredibly important, we'll work with Trump, we'll work with Harris. The other thing that really came out in spades though, was the deep disappointment across both sides of the aisle with what America has to offer when it comes to economic policy, market access. They understand, I think that this could be much more difficult, disruptive with a Trump administration that we'll see a return to the tariff wars, that the instability, that the rhetoric, that the language, the style of diplomacy would be difficult.

We have a modest advantage in the battleground states. We're closer to 270 than Donald Trump is. And I think that the confidence that we have is that a. since the Dobbs decision in the spring of 2022, Democrats have continually overperformed polling and expectations. Republicans have continually underperformed polling and public expectations that there is this reticence as there was in Europe in France to vote for the far right when it came to the day of actually voting. And you've seen this incredible unprecedented effort by Republicans and by former Republicans to push Republicans towards Harris. And I think it's going to matter on election day. But the second reason I think we have quiet confidence that we'd much rather be us than them is that we just have much more money and a far more sophisticated ground game to close strong in these final few weeks. I mean it's close now. But if one of the two parties is likely to push the election towards them, it's us because of our advantages in terms of we're going to have more ads on the air. We're going to be talking to voters more. And our candidate is much more popular and is seen as much more favorable and likable, than their candidate.

Sinwar told me clearly in 2004 that they would be ready to sign a hudna, a truce, for 20 years because the State of Israel is currently a strong state. But he also told me that in 20 years, he estimates that we will be weakened because of internal struggles between us within Israeli society. And as soon as they recognize that we are weak, they will attack us. And they also said clearly that we, as Jews, have no place on these lands, on the lands on which the State of Israel is located. These are Waqf lands. These are Muslim lands. These are lands that do not belong to us. Therefore we, as Jews, have no right to exist on the lands. Therefore, there is no compromise. There is no compromise on the 1967 borders or 1948 borders. It's either us or them. Therefore, it's only a matter of time and timing that they will act against us and try to expel us from the place where we live. This is a worldview that they did not hide. He told me that explicitly. But his way was much more extreme than others. His thought that this conflict can only be resolved by force and the struggle they are waging against us, that Hamas is waging, is a religious struggle. The war is a religious war. It is not a nationalist war. It is not about establishing a Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel, it's all Palestine. He only said this more bluntly than other Hamas leaders in the West Bank. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
