Now just one day after being shot Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is addressing his country from the hospital in Lahore. He reportedly said he was hit by four bullets in what he calls a plan to kill him. On Thursday, the Former Prime Minister was writing a tapa truck at a rally when shots rang out. He was hit in the leg and was rushed to a hospital in the - police have one man in custody who reportedly confessed. The incident sparked protests like this one in Lahore where protesters gathered outside the governor's home and burn tires. They also blocked roads in Quetta, one of at least four other cities where protesters are taking place. Here's what angered them. Sophia Saifi has been following the story since it broke about 24 hours ago and she joins us now live from Islamabad. As I've been saying, Sofia Imran Khan speaking out in the past 30 minutes there from Lahore. What has he been saying?",

Now terror against the energy sector those words used by Ukraine's President to describe Russian attacks against energy facilities. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the attacks have left four and a half million people across Ukraine without electricity. Kyiv's Mayor says 450,000 in the capital have faced power disruptions Friday. Mr. Zelenskyy says Russia has turned its focus on attacking energy infrastructure to make up for its failures on the battlefield. Well, CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour is joining me now live from Kyiv this evening. And Christiane this attack on energy will of course make the situation incredibly desperate for Ukrainians there as we head into these winter months?

How they're trying to make, do how they're trying to build up and stock up, and winterize and how they're really quite dreading a cold winter under fire here? Nonetheless, they are absolutely clear; they say that this does not break their spirit, even if the Russian intention was to do that. They say that they are still absolutely committed to the fight. And the civilians in the city anyway, some of them telling us that these as they call them, small sacrifices are part of their war effort for the troops who are enduring so much more on the battlefield. Meantime, and this is important because not only the president, his people, they have been asking for increased and better air defense systems. Well, I spoke to two U.S. Senators, who were here on a special trip a co-delegation from the United States, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Coons and asked them about stepping up the air defense system of protection. And this is what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): One of our most advanced air defense systems, the - system is about to arrive here within the next coming days.

The U.S. Security Council is set to take up the issue in the coming hours. North Korea held multiple missile launches this week including a possible ICBM. The U.S. and South Korea responded by extending their joint military drills to Saturday, North Korea warning that those exercises will be followed by \"Sustained counteraction\".

And so when these military drills were extended after North Korea's unprecedented ballistic and cruise missile blitz this week, followed by their attempt to launch their most powerful ICBM over Japan for the second time this year triggering air raid sirens in Japan, it is unsurprising that North Korea will try to match the number of 240 war planes in the south by getting as close to that number in the north with 180 war planes. And so it's a tit for tat kind of escalation both sides showing force. The question now though, is where this goes from here, because North Korea does have in their back pocket that potential seven underground nuclear tests that nuclear tests had upon gaiety despite North Korea's claims when I was at this site four years ago and wants to blow up tunnel entrances, that it was irreparably destroyed. The overwhelming intelligence from the U.S., South Korea and Japan is that the site has now been repaired and is ready for action really, with just the push of a button all that they're waiting for is the order from Kim Jong-Un. Will that order come before the conclusion of these operation visual and storm exercises? Or will the test happen at a later date? But pretty much every analyst every expert that I've spoken with Christina does have the view it's pretty much a consensus that with all of these missile tests, they're all leading up to that final test, which is going to be a nuclear test to complete this cycle. The question is when does the cycle complete? And what will the South Korean U.S. response will be? Undoubtedly that will be a key topic of discussion at this meeting in the coming hours.",

One of those protests turned violent when demonstrators threw rocks at police vehicles after officers attack them. An Iranian rapper, who's become a prominent voice of the ongoing protest, is under arrest. A state run media report Toomaj Salehi accused of encouraging these demonstrations. Jomana Karadsheh spoke to Salehi's family who are growing increasingly concerned about his safety.

The Iranian rap artist was arrested last weekend, charged with crimes punishable by death, including cooperating with foreign governments forming legal groups to destabilize the country and propagandist activity against the government but his real crime, his music, calling on Iranians to rise up and remove their repressive regime. Toomaj has also proudly posted these videos recently showing him out at the protests leading the chance for change. Family members say he was arrested along with two friends in a violent raid on Sunday. His uncle tells CNN they have information he was tortured. EGHBAL EGHBALI, SALEHI'S UNCLE: We still do not know anything about Toomaj's health or condition. The family tried hard to even hear his voice. No one has given us any information. We don't all of Toomaj and his friends are alive or not? We want to know what happened to our boys and what torture has an Islamic government given them? KARADSHEH (voice over): This short edited clip released on state media Wednesday claims to show Toomaj expressing remorse. Outraged Iranians say it's a statement made under duress. His uncle and others believe it's not even Toomaj. The underground rapper has been a rebel for years fighting repression through his politically charged lyrics speaking out against corruption, poverty and impunity. He was briefly arrested last year but this time is different. The regime struggling to contain the national uprising is unleashing all its brutal tactics. Thousands have been arrested, more than 1000 of them indicted. Many protesters accused of waging war against God and corruption on earth, facing the death penalty in what human rights groups say are sham trials.

The idea behind this intelligence report is that Iran now seems to be seeking Russia's help to create kind of a side deal an alternative to an Iran nuclear deal, which really seems like it is more and more out of reach at this point. So the idea has been that Iran over the summer, when a deal looked close, they were actually engaging with the Russians trying to see if the Russians might be willing to help them kind of reconstitute their program should a nuclear deal not last, because that is one of their main concerns as well is that even if a deal is reached, a future administration might actually pull out of that deal as the Trump Administration did. So right now, it seems like Iran is trying to hedge its bets. It is unclear, though, how much this Russian help and even whether they've decided to help because it is unclear how Russia has responded to this, but how much those nuclear materials and that nuclear fuel would actually shorten the breakout time that it would take for Iran to create a nuclear weapon. It depends on the kind of reactor the fuel goes into, and a lot of other different technical things.

It's unclear whether Russia would be willing to completely kind of sacrifice the future of the Iran deal to do that.

But that was cooler than we saw in the month of September; we also saw September was revised up.

And we know that companies wouldn't be generating new jobs, creating new jobs if there wasn't strong support for their demands and services. So that doesn't indicate that indicates that we're not on the brink of a recession. On the other hand, it appears, you know the Fed has been raising rates since March; the medicine doesn't appear to be working without really seeing a significant slowdown. And by the way, Christina, we also got some employment data earlier this week here in the U.S., which showed that job openings actually tick back up. So there are 1.9 open jobs right now for every American looking. So Jay Powell has talked a lot about that imbalance. He would actually like to see that ratio closer to one to one.

Youcan join us Tuesday for an in-depth special coverage of the crucial U.S. midterm elections which will determine control of congress. It starts at nine in the evening here in London and 1a.m. in Abu Dhabi. Now thousands of nervous Twitter employees are right now waiting for an email to drop in their box to tell them either good or bad news. They're staying or they're gone. The new billionaire boss Elon Musk sent a memo to staff saying lay-offs will begin Friday morning. The staffers who get sacked will find out via email by the time this hour is up. Several Twitter employees have already filed a class action suit they claim the firings violate U.S. law. Well, Musk says Twitter has seen a massive revenue drop as some advertiser's pause their ad spend to see what other moves he makes. But he hasn't addressed any of the lay-offs today. CNN's Oliver Darcy, as you can see here is joining me with more details. What are you hearing about the scale of the cuts that could be coming Oliver?",

And the big picture, of course here is that this is coming right before the midterm elections, you know, days before the midterm elections when foreign adversaries tried to manipulate the conversation to sow discord in the U.S. And also U.S. political campaigns and people who support these campaigns have in the past been willing to spread misinformation, disinformation. So Twitter, this hugely important communications platform has now been thrown into chaos days ahead of this all important vote for the pivotal midterm elections.",

The reason is that Ecuador is not used to this level of violence. It's not used to drag at warfare. It's not a country that produces drugs such as Colombia and Peru, which are its neighboring country. And up to a few years ago, it was not a trafficking country because of changes in the drug trade and better law enforcement here in Colombia where I am. And in Peru, drug cartels have become used to use in Ecuador as a launching point for its drug trades towards North America, Central America and in some cases, even the Far East. This means that competing drug cartels are fighting to control those profitable drug routes. And that fight takes place in the prisons where gangsters from different cartels spend day to day next to each other. And that is why Ecuador is struggling to come up with a coordinated response because it's a level of violence that the country has not seen in its history. It's something that we've seen more used to see in countries such as Mexico here in Colombia, but not in Ecuador and the government declared time and time again state of emergencies try to come up with a coordinated response. But until now, it hasn't been able to stem this violence, Christina.",
