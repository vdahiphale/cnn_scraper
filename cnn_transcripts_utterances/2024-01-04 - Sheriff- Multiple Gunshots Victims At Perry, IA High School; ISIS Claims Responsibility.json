      "sentences": "All right, the breaking news out of Perry, Iowa. We heard from law enforcement just a few minutes ago, they confirmed there was a shooting at the Perry High School. It happened before 87:37 a.m. is when they got the call that there was something going on. Police arrived seven minutes later. They found multiple shooting victims at the school. We do not know the condition of those victims. And we do not know how many. However, police did say that because it happened so early, there were not that many people at the school as it happened. We also know that -- they know the identity of the shooter. They say there was no current threat. The situation is over. Back with us, Juliette Kayyem and Andrew McCabe. Again, law enforcement, Andrew, said that later today, they're going to tell us more. More, I imagine, would be the identity of the shooter. If there were fatalities, we're very much hoping that we're not, but we just don't have word on that yet. What other information do you expect next time we do hear from law enforcement?",

We -- as you mentioned, we want to know about the offender. So, the shooter has been identified. Presumably, his identity will be released to us at some point, you know, then we'll start to understand whether this was a fellow student or --",

So, we now have that information from a law enforcement official through our reporter who gets it right every single time, Evan Perez. That's where we're at, at this moment.

They talked about seven minutes between the time of the first alert, the zero alert to the time of someone in law enforcement being able to get to the -- to the school.And so, what they are -- you know, obviously, you know, the question about the victims, of course, but the issues around family unification at least are at play in this school shooting because the school really wasn't totally in session. And then you are going to look to the -- to the perpetrator. And then potential motive. This is the first day back after a long while away. I mean, our kids have been out of school for 10 or 12 days. And so, the question is going to be what happened before, or did anything happen over the holidays that might explain why the day one of return would be the day that the -- that the shooter decided to enter this facility? And then, of course, who or what was his target? Understanding that given the timing of it, this is someone who, if they knew the school, would know that it was not at max capacity. But if they were an employee or were focused on a club or something like that, that would be something that you would look into in terms of an investigation. SIDNER: Yes, whether or not there was a target, and this is a targeted shooting. Although, we now know that there are multiple people who have been shot according to the sheriff.",

One, what is happening in Perry High School in Perry, Iowa, where there are multiple people that have been shot at a high school there. The shooter -- we have now confirmed through a law enforcement source through our Evan Perez that the shooter has been killed.We do not know the status of any of those who have actually been shot. Who they are, whether they are students or faculty teachers, we do not know that information yet. The sheriff is holding that for right now as he tries to contact the family members. We know what happened around 7:37 that the police got there about seven minutes later. So, we are still waiting for information on those who have been injured. But another mass school shooting, the fourth so far this year. So, one each and every day if you look at the statistical calculation there, which is just a complete tragedy. Now, to the Middle East. ISIS is now claiming responsibility for that deadly twin blast in Iran that happened on Wednesday. The explosions were at a memorial for Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed. At least 84 people and injured 284 others in those blasts. You can see the pictures there from Wednesday. That is from one of the Iranian news agencies. It is the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.",

Whether they're responsible or not, they are claiming responsibility, even with the details being off what they're saying. Why would they jump into this now knowing that there is already the potential of a regional war? Is it to try to blow that up, or are they just trying to get attention from the world that they're still around?",

So, they may have seen that as a -- as an opening of opportunity.You know -- and I think when we look at the threshold of the level of attacks that have been hit Iranian interests, the Hamas leader killed under the noses of Hezbollah, a senior Iranian commander killed in Damascus, and what appears to have been, although Israel has had not one of our airstrikes, and then the killing today of a senior Iranian commander claimed by -- a senior Iranian-backed Iraqi militia commander by the United States in Iraq. These all fall below the threshold, if you will, for an escalation from Iran, that this attack by ISIS may have just been trying to jump on and destabilize the situation further.",

And the vast majority of that sum that was totaled up by House Democrats came from China.And so, these documents do show that the Chinese government and state- owned Chinese entities did pay -- make payments that totaled around $5.5 million to Trump properties while he was in office. That includes properties in D.C., and New York and, in Las Vegas. And look, the concern here is that these payments were made in an effort to influence Trump's foreign policy. You know, there's actually a part of the Constitution that addresses this concern. And so, it's been something that we've been aware of for a long time. But Democrats say -- and they draw a parallel between some of Trump's foreign policy decisions and the countries that were making these payments. You know, the Trump Organization insists that Trump didn't do anything wrong. That he actually donated all of the profits that he received from any sort of foreign payments. But at the end of the day, it's impossible to tell what, if any link, that exists between foreign policy decisions that the Trump administration made, and those -- that outreach and those payments that were coming from these countries.",

Here, the Trump lawyers are insisting that the special counsel, Jack Smith, and some of his prosecutors be \"severely sanctioned because they keep making filings in the federal election subversion case.\" Now, of course, making filings, well, that's just what lawyers do. But the federal case is currently on hold. The judge overseeing that case has put a halt on \"all substantive proceedings -- substantive proceedings.\"Now, the special counsel understands this. He notes this in the briefs that he continues to file. He says, look, I know this is on hold. But I want to continue to make my filings, to make my arguments so that when this case resumes, once all the appeals are resolved, he believes there'll be resolved in his favor, they can get going. He wants to bring this case to trial before November 2024. He's made that clear publicly. He's made that clear in his filings. But the Trump team, they see it differently. They argue that this is political. They accuse the special counsel of \"trying to score cheap political points by continuing to make these filings,\" many of which are very critical of former President Trump. They're even arguing that the prosecutors are making the docket. So, where all these filings end up? A political arm of the Biden campaign. Now, it's unclear how the judge will rule here, John. We know that Judge Tanya Chutkan is also eager to move this case along as quickly as possible. But again, she can't do anything until these larger questions -- Constitutional questions about any immunity Trump may have until those are resolved. And at this point, it's unclear how long it'll take to resolve those. And if this trial will go before the 2024 election.",
