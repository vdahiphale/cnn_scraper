      "sentences": "Well, \"The Detroit News\" has some recordings of President Trump telling officials in Michigan not to certify the election. That's tonight on LAURA COATES LIVE.Well, there's a huge story coming out pretty late tonight. It's about \"The Detroit News,\" and they're reporting that it has recordings of President Trump putting a lot of pressure on two Wayne County canvassers not, not to certify the 2020 election. Now, on that phone call back on November 17th of 2020, Trump tells the two Republicans -- quote -- \"We've got to fight for our country. We can't let these people take our country away from us.\" Hmm. \"The Detroit News\" says the chairwoman of the RNC tells them -- quote -- \"If you can go home tonight, do not sign it. We will get you attorneys\" -- unquote, to which Trump then says -- quote -- \"We'll take care of that.\" Well, that's something, especially for someone who is under multiple counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States and its voters of the rightful outcome of the 2020 election. Now, don't forget, this was a tight race in Michigan, Biden winning while by the skin of his teeth, some would say. It is the latest piece of information that we are getting of many, a fire hose worth of details about what Trump was doing to actually stay in power. And it makes you wonder, what else is out there if we're learning about this late December, 2023? Special Counsel Jack Smith, I wonder does he have something else up his sleeve? We learn more information outside of those indictments? Because right now, Smith is fighting, and I mean fighting for the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump has presidential immunity when it comes to the charges in connection with January 6th. He is telling the court -- quote -- \"The charges here are of the utmost gravity. This case involves -- for the first time in our nation's history -- criminal charges against a former president based on his actions while in office.\" Now, Trump's lawyers are trying to do the very opposite. They're asking the court not to intervene, to delay, delay, delay. But the high court is going to have to act whether it wants to wait in 2024 politics or not. It will need to decide if Trump is, in fact, immune, and a decision, we are learning, could be imminent. Here's law professor Steve Vladeck. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It will need to decide whether a federal obstruction law can be used to prosecute people involved in January 6th attack. It's going to need to hear Trump's arguments about gag orders.And he now wants them to weigh in on a civil suit against him for defaming E. Jean Carroll. That's unlikely, of course, but he's asking. The question is, why is he asking? Well, because a key priority for Trump in his presidency, a key focus was the judiciary, appointing judges. He appointed more than 200 federal judges and, of course, we know three Supreme Court justices, justices that he had a habit of referring to as his -- quote, unquote -- \"judges\" as if maybe they're indebted to him. Just so we're clear, they are not indebted to him or as if they work for him. And to be clear, they do not work for him. And while he has moved the federal judiciary to the right in many ways, the conservative court has not always ruled in his favor. In 2022, it rejected his attempt to keep the House January 6th Committee from getting presidential documents. Remember that? And, of course, remember this? The court gave the go-ahead for Congress to get a hold of Trump's tax returns, and he fought tooth and nail to shield them. Now, they have to face this firehose worth of Trump cases. It's coming in so quickly and coming in hot. Will they be his judges or will they be their own? I want to bring in Jonathan Kinloch. He was a Democratic member of that Wayne County Board of Canvassers back in November of 2020. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here tonight.

And so, knowing that they were under a lot of pressure, when we reconvened, we voted to certify the election, and then we also voted to waive any reconsideration of the action that we took. So, they knew they were going to be under a lot of pressure, but there's no way in the world would I or did I or anyone in that room know that the president of the United States would be calling into the parking lot to talk to two members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, never would have imagined it. But when we did find out that they had spoken with the president, when I asked Monica Palmer what did he talk about, why did he call, she said to me that he just thanked them for their service.

And so, I just left it there.And so, I never would imagine that the president, the purpose of that call was to interfere with the election. Of course, you know, he was denying the election and all that, but I did not believe that he would actually interfere at that level. We've never had -- and that's one of the things that I mentioned to Monica Palmer and William Hartman, we've never had any interference from our party officials, Democrat or Republican, the secretary of state, governor or anyone, have we ever had to worry about them calling us and trying to weigh in on certifying an election. Understanding this, that certifying an election was not about us determining anything. It's a ministerial duty here in Michigan and there was nothing for us to decide. But for some reason, they felt that they could -- I'm talking about they being the president of the United States and Ms. Romney. They believe that they could actually stop the process from moving forward. And that's just amazing, that with all of the people around them, that they did not understand Michigan election law, and especially Ms. Romney who family have long ties with Michigan political politics or political systems, that they would not know this.",

You know, remember during the Mueller investigation, we knew about the Justice Department policy, it's just a policy, not a law, that you can't indict a sitting president while he's in office. What Trump appears to be saying is you can't indict him when he's out of office either. That can't be right. You can't have one citizen in America who can't be indicted ever for crimes he committed.

For inmates who do eventually get out when their sentences are up, re-entering society can be a real challenge. Actress and activist La La Anthony is trying to change that. She has been running a program for the last year and a half that provides mentorship and life coaching for young men incarcerated at Rikers Island in New York City. It's a prison where more than 6,000 people are held. The troubled facility is required by law to close in 2027, and the negative headlines about it just keep coming. A federal judge held the NYC Department of Correction in civil contempt just last week after it failed to be transparent about the opening of a new facility for people who set fires. Now, while Rikers faces criticism on the outside, La La Anthony is doing her part to help rehabilitate people on the inside.

So that instantly -- that gravitated something with me because who's coming in that type of environment to see a bunch of, you know, young juvenile kids or whatever with these crazy cases with their mom. So, when I first seen that, I was like, all right, she obviously here for a good cause and I wanted to know why. Because at the time, you know, I didn't know who La La Anthony was. But honestly, like honestly, really speaking, the program, it was -- it was very -- it was very -- it was fun because a lot of us, as males, you have to put up this guard. You have to be tough. You know, you have to carry on this weight as males. And a lot of us, we carry on these weights since we were kids. And a lot of us don't realize how that plays effect into the sentence we make as we get older. So, La La was kind of like -- she was very down to earth with us. And a lot of us wasn't expecting that. She's a celebrity. She has been on TV. We weren't expecting her to be so -- treat us like she knew us our whole life. I think that was one of the main things that really gravitated with us. And also teaching us things like how to present ourselves at court. A lot of us thought that just going to court is a regular thing. She was telling us about how to sit up. Make sure you say good morning. You know, things like that. Make sure you come in, you're presenting yourself. Make sure you sleep early. She was telling us things like that.
