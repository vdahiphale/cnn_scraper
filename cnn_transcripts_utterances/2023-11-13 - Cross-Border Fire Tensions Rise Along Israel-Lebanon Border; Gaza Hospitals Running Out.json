There is a lot of targeting around the hospital. BASHIR (voice-over): Under a near constant barrage of airstrikes, it is impossible for both patients and staff to safely evacuate. Doctors are overwhelmed, morgues now long beyond capacity. And with communications frequently cut off, contact between medical teams on the ground and with the outside world is growing increasingly difficult. Hospital officials say thousands of displaced civilians are still thought to be in the compound taking shelter in what once was thought to be a sanctuary in the midst of this seemingly unending nightmare. UNKNOWN (through translator): We thought the hospital was a safe place but it wasn't. If we had stayed another five minutes we would have been killed. They started to bomb us and we ran away from Al-Shifa. BASHIR (voice-over): The Israeli military says it is now enabling passage from three hospitals in northern Gaza, with an additional route said to have been opened to allow civilians to evacuate southwards. UNKNOWN (through translator): This is another form of torture. We have about six kilometers to go, no less. She got a stroke that caused her brain damage. She can't speak and is paralyzed. BASHIR (voice-over): But the United Nations itself has raised doubts over the so-called safe zones outlined by Israel, warning that nowhere inside Gaza is safe for civilians anymore. And for those too injured, too sick, evacuation is impossible. Many doctors on the ground, vowing to stay beside their patients no matter what. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on-camera): And we've been hearing from medical teams saying they are still seeking guarantees that these evacuation corridors that have been established from hospitals are indeed safe. There are fears amongst medical teams and patients around even moving between hospital buildings on the Al Shifa complex because they feel they are surrounded now by fighting on the ground and also, of course, the airstrikes which are edging closer and closer. And when it comes to that fuel shortage, which is a crucial part of all of this, we heard from the director of the El Shifa hospital saying today that supply of some 300 liters of fuel which couldn't get to the hospital because doctors were simply too afraid to go outside and bring that fuel in. That 300 liters according to officials is only enough to really power the hospital for about 30 minutes. What they're seeking is 600 liters of fuel for each hour and of course the vast majority of Gaza's hospitals are now out of service. If fuel isn't urgently allowed in to get to these hospitals to power these hospitals we could continue to see even more hospitals -- the last remaining operational hospitals completely collapsing.

Moving images, carefully staged and choreographed by Hamas and by others of babies that I, as a person, as a father, see and am moved by, but not a single word about why all of this is happening. And I find that really amazing that we are all in this charade together, orchestrated by Hamas in a war that has now been going on for 38 days, which wasn't started by Israel, was started by Hamas in a violent and unprecedented, unprovoked attack inside Israel. And there are still 239 Israeli hostages held in Gaza. That is why we are fighting. And the unfortunate, sad situation on the ground and the pictures that you're screening, which probably are true, are the unfortunate result of Hamas choices.

The U.S. seems to agree with that assessment. There are other foreign governments that also agree with that assessment. But as you know, Jonathan, there are a lot of people on the ground, especially in Gaza, who are very skeptical. I understand that it's complicated when it comes to revealing intelligence.

They are trying to use the civilians and their suffering in order to create pressure on Israel to stop our military operations, because they, Hamas, are under pressure, because we are beating them on the battlefield. We are killing Hamas in their tunnels that they're hiding underneath the civilians. We are getting to them. They're feeling the pressure. And as a result, they are using the blood of Palestinians. Innocent babies are being led to, allowed to die just in order for them to get a propaganda victory against Israel. And I want to say one more thing. Let's roll back the watch a few -- or the calendar a few days. We have been asking, pleading, and telling for more than two and a half weeks, the northern part of Gaza to evacuate. And we didn't say it just for the fun of it. We said it because we're going to conduct major operations. And I ask people now that are disturbed, rightfully disturbed by these moving images.

We told the manager of the hospital that the eastern exit from the hospital is open. Al-Wahda Street is open, and we even guided them where exactly they should go in order to be in relative safety. We are honest about our intentions of getting people out of the battlefield. And unlike Hamas, we actually care about civilians. We don't want them in the combat zone. We want to fight the murderous enemy that butchered our children and raped our women and massacred our people and took our people hostage. Those are our enemy, not the civilian population.
