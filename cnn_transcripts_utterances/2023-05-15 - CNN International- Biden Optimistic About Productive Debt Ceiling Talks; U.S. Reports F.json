And now we have the U.K. with this air defense systems, and adequate missiles and attack drones.So, clearly, look, they're heading into this counteroffensive. The statement from Downing Street literally says that this is coming as Ukraine prepares for an intense period of military activity. So, they're trying to step up support so that Ukraine has what it needs. There was an interesting part of the statement though, there's been a slight shift in planning when it comes to fighter jets -- western- style fighter jets like F-16s. The last time that Rishi Sunak pledged arms was the U.K. in February. The U.K. was very clear that it was going to train. It came out and said we're going to train fighter pilots. That this is about Ukraine's long-term capabilities. Now we have a statement saying they're going to start an elementary flying place for a cohort of Ukrainian pilots this summer. This training, the statement says, goes hand in hand with U.K. efforts to work with other countries in providing F-16 jets. Ukraine's fighter jets of choice. So, it looks like the U.K. is stepping up pressure. It is the country that likes to come out in front with these things. And I think for Zelenskyy, this is also really clearly about optics. He has done this all along. He wants to be seen as taking his place among these NATO countries, among these EU countries, and of course, this is coming ahead of a G7 Summit this week, the really important NATO Summit in July. So, I think that's part of it as well.",

And I am told that modest progress has been made. But there is still no deal yet. The two sides remain far apart but they have begun to identify key policy area where they could find common ground.Some of these topics include looking at permitting reform. Resending unspent COVID relief refunds as well as looking at some spending cuts. Not the Biden administration has repeatedly said that spending cuts should not be part of a potential deal. But I am told increasingly that people in the West Wing recognize that something they'll likely have to cave on. I did speak with one source close to the negotiations and the told me that if the talks were taking place in February, months ago, they'd be bullish about the prospect for deal. But the reality is they don't have months to negotiate. We are 2 1/2 weeks away from June 1st. And that is the deadline that the Treasury Department that the government could default on its debt. It's also a timeline that was backed up by the Congressional Budget Office on Friday which predicted that a default is likely within the first two weeks of June. The Deputy Treasure Secretary Wally Adeyemo was on CNN this Sunday, warning about the perils to failing to reach a deal. Let's listen to what he had to say. WALLY ADEYEMO, U.S. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: The president made very clear that the speaker in their first meeting that he's happy to talk about a fiscal path forward. The president has laid out a plan, that includes $3 trillion of debt relief over 10 years. And he's happy to the speaker about things that we can do to implement the plan and to make sure we are able to meet our commitments to our seniors, to our troops and to the men and women and the American people. But we shouldn't be here. We shouldn't be paying the American people's bills day by day with the idea that we would have a debt limit default if Congress didn't lift the debt limit.",

And really, guys, the bigger question is when will this happen again? Because really what we saw in the past few days has not really changed the situation. I should note that last night there was one rocket fired from Gaza into Israel. And Israel responded by shelling what it said one militant outpost along the border. There were no injuries reported on either side. It was sort of a brief break in the cease-fire that had been holding for about 24 hours. And a security source in Gaza telling the CNN team there that this was a malfunction. And it seemed to have been an one-off and a cease-fire does appear to be holding and life is returning back to normal. This after nearly 1,500 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel and several days of Israeli air strikes that killed more than 30 Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli military saying most of them were Islamic Jihad militants. But we know of at least 12 civilians were also killed. Two people killed in Israel were killed as a result of rocket fire. One of them an Israeli woman and one of them actually as fate would have it, a Palestinian from Gaza who happen to be in Israel working at the time of this rocket fire. He was killed, his brother is still injured and in hospital. But at the end of the day, we are in the same situation now as we were a week ago, before this started. Really, nothing has changed on the ground. And even Israeli military officials that CNN has spoken to have admitted as such. Now while the Israeli military sees this as a tactical success, they say they wiped outside something like 11 senior commanders of the Islamic Jihad. They say they targeted more than 400 Islamic Jihad targets in the Gaza Strip. Islamic Jihad is still standing. They're still there. For the people of Gaza, the blockade still exists. Their life is essentially returning to what it was before. For the Israeli civilians who live in the south, the threat of rocket fire still very much exists there as was before. And Hamas, the military group that runs Gaza essentially almost got the best of both worlds. Because they express support for Islamic Jihad in what they were doing. They supported this armed resistance. But they themselves were not targeted by the Israeli military. And they were essentially able to stay out of it and keep their hands clean. And the question for right now is, when will this happen again. Because these militant groups in Gaza still have arsenals. They still express the same feelings towards Israel. Israel still says it has the same modus operandi towards Gaza if any sort of rockets are fired again. And so, it's just sort of this endless cycle and hasn't really changed the situation on the ground. But what has changed interestingly, is in Israel, the political situation has changed. Because before this last round of fighting, part of the right-wing flank of Benjamin Netanyahu government actually had been boycotting votes in the Israeli Parliament, because they believe that Israel security response to what happened in Gaza was weak. That party is now back in, and Benjamin Netanyahu's poll numbers, they are up after the latest military operation.
