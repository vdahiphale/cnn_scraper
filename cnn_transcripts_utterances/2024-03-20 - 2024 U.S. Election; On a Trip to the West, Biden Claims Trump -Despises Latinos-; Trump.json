The thing is, everyone, thinks that if they're not X category, they're not going to be touched by an autocrat. Everybody's touched. So, in this case, he's talking about -- he's raising the old antisemitic trope of, you know, Jews not being loyal citizens because their real loyalty is to Israel. And he's done this many times before. I want to add to something that Tom said, though, about the bloodbath. There's a real intent here, and that is -- and Trump's been doing this. All autocrats do this. If you want to get people riled up enough to either commit violence for you, January 6, or accept your violence, you need to get them into a state of existential fear and dread. And so, on January 6th, he said, if we don't fight like hell, we won't have a country anymore. With Strongman, it's always me or the abyss. Me or the apocalypse. So, when he's talking about social slaughter, he's telling people that they have to defend themselves. And he's done this many times in his rallies and now in his campaign.

And he -- you wrote, Trump uses his rallies and other public occasions to sell strongman rule to his followers so Americans begin to see autocrats as positive and glamorous figures. It's aspirational on Trump's part. When does it -- I mean, in your view, when does it become a threat to democracy, a threat to the country? Perhaps it already is. BEN-GHIAT:  It's already a threat to the country. Even before January 6th, it was a threat to the country. So, it's easy to laugh at, you know, these -- this and think it's bluster when he says, oh, I fell in love with, you know, Kim Jong Un. This seems ridiculous. But he's both holding these people up. These are murderous dictators. He's holding them up as positive models so that if he does even something similar on that line that it will be seen as normal.

But I think the Fed's also going to indicate that they will be cutting rates later this year. You know, they do this dot plot where each dot represents the views of each of the members of the committee that makes the decision. And I think those dot plots would suggest three rate cuts later this year, a quarter point each time. And that will provide some relief. If you have a credit card, if you have a consumer finance loan, if you have a home equity line of credit, you should see some relief on those interest rates pretty quickly.
