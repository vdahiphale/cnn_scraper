      "sentences": "Yes, so Max, privately we understand from Israeli officials that they are telling their U.S. counterparts of their, quote, deep disappointment of the move. They say that it could jeopardize hostage negotiations at a pretty critical moment. That's privately.Publicly, we've just heard, as you mentioned, from the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations who said in an interview with Israel's public broadcaster, quote, that the pause may be preventing Israel or at least significantly harming Israel's ability to achieve one of the main goals of this war, which is the overthrow of the Hamas government. Now he says that the U.S. doesn't have bad intentions but could provide a morale boost to Hamas. And look, throughout the course of this war, the United States message to Israel over and over again has been pretty firm that it needs to do more to protect civilians inside of Gaza. But it has never put any firm conditions on that until now. So now you have this shipment of 3,500 bombs, about half of them are those 2,000 pound, extremely deadly, not anything resembling a precision weapon that has been put on hold. And the status of it, we frankly just do not know. But the message from the United States is pretty clear though, that look, we will make sure that Israel has everything that it needs defensively, but offensively, we're not going to go along with what's happening in Rafah without any kind of a clear plan to get civilians out of the way. What impact ultimately will this pause have? The IDF spokesperson sort of deflected that question yesterday, you heard him there, going on to defend Israel's actions inside Gaza. And frankly, the Israelis may be soon doing even more defending of their actions and whether or not they're within international law. Because yesterday, Max, was the deadline for the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to present a report to Congress, which answered the question of whether assurances given by Israel that U.S. weapons that they're using are being used within according to law, whether those assurances are accurate and reliable. That deadline has come and gone. The State Department says that the report will be released within the coming days. And surely a lot of people will be watching it closely because we know that there have been some internal disagreements within the State Department, some people who seriously doubt that those weapons are being used within the letter of international law. And if the report does in fact find that surely this will set off a pretty furious reaction from the Netanyahu government. And ultimately, it may answer that question as to what will happen with this shipment of weapons, which at the moment is sort of hanging in limbo -- Max.",

Obviously, Israel is still getting weapons from a handful of them. The biggest backer obviously is the United States.But if that flow were to be cut off, this would be a very different situation. And surely Israel would need to play by a different set of rules. And, you know, you heard in that interview with President Biden, he also discussed what happens the day after. And the day after plan that Israel has put forward at this moment looks vastly different than what the rest of the region is discussing and what the rest of the region is hoping for, which is a pathway to a two state solution. And so perhaps that could put more pressure on Israel to do more to actually work toward that goal and work with some of the regional partners to actually get it done -- Max.",

He's -- and the way he managed the end of the -- his last year when we were dealing with COVID. A million people died. He would tell people, inject bleach, and that may do it, it wasn't a real problem, when he did an interview with one of your colleagues where he just flat out acknowledged he knew how dangerous it was, but he didn't want to speak to it. You know, it's a -- I just -- and look at what he says he's going to do if he gets elected. He says he's going to do away with what I have done on Medicare, reducing the price of Medicare drastically. He said he's going to do away with the Affordable Care Act. He said he's going to do it -- and just down the line. So we have a very different view. I look at it from a position -- not being facetious -- from a Scranton perspective. He looks at it from a Mar-a-Lago perspective. He wants to give more significant tax cuts to the super wealthy. You know, we have got 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what their average federal tax is? 8.3 percent. He talks about if I -- I want to raise it to 25 percent. That would raise, that would raise $40 billion, $400 billion over 10 years.
