These are essential items that Congress needs to pass during this lame duck session, that session we call after the midterm elections, before the new Congress comes in. And the main issue, Amara and Boris, that Congress needs to address is funding the government.Right now that is set to expire on December 16th. If there is no funding for the government that will trigger a shutdown. Government employees will not be able to go to work, will not get paid. That is crucial for Congress to address. Before then Democrats and Republicans here on Capitol Hill have not been able to agree on a government deal. That is part of the problem. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling you last week that if they're not able to agree on a deal they could possibly trigger the same spending levels next year and do another continuing resolution. Democrats, of course, not wanting to do that but they need to reach a deal. The other thing that is currently running up against the clock is the debt limit. You mentioned that. It seems that Democrats are not eager to address this during the lame duck. They want to toss this possibly to a possible House speaker Kevin McCarthy who is expected to -- who is running, of course, for house speaker, Republicans are taking the majority next year. And it's not clear when the nation will run up against its debt limit. That clock we're not entirely sure about that. But it does seem unlikely that Congress will address it during the lame duck. Another thing Congress needs to address is the National Defense Authorization Act. It is legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, triggers funding for the Department of Defense. That is why Democrats and Republicans need to address that before the end of the year, another thing they are doing. So lots of agenda items crucial. And I didn't even mention the same- sex vote to protect same-sex marriage in the nation in the House on Tuesday. Of course, that is expected to pass and it will go to President Joe Biden's desk so that is at least one thing that we know this week is happening. Boris, Amara.",

They were pessimistic that they would have a surplus of seats like they do now.But the real question -- what we've seen so far in the early vote is turnout. And the fact that this is not -- the outcome of this race does not depend on whether it controls the Senate may have affected how the turnout has shaped up. We've seen a slightly lower number of African-American voters than in past elections in this runoff right now. I don't really know for sure if that is an advantage to either Walker or Warnock. It's a bit of a surprise to me given that Democratic enthusiasm coming out of this midterm election is higher than expected. But look, the other thing about this is that Democrats are framing this as more a referendum between Warnock and Walker, and less about control of the Senate or sort of their ability to pass their agenda. This is, in their view, an argument between an incumbent Democratic senator who is experienced and qualified for this position, and a former football player who is out of his depth. And that's the argument they're making right now. Again, given that we know who the next governor of Georgia is going to be, we know that Democrats control the Senate, we shouldn't be that surprised if turnout is slightly lower among key groups for Democrats than I think their party would have expected or like going into this runoff.",

This was after the release of some internal Twitter emails showing that there was deliberation inside the organization in 2020 over how to handle this \"New York Post\" story about materials that were found on Hunter Biden's laptop.If you recall, during the last runoff election, Republican turnout was hampered by Donald Trump, you know, making all these claims about election fraud.

That's really the big tell here that he is not -- he's either too much of a liability to risk what energy he might inject into Republican voters in Georgia or that he's just not bringing the crowds and the enthusiasm that he used to for Republicans.",

And they've been so impressive.Of course, it didn't go their own way against the Netherlands. And really the difference was the finishing. Because the U.S. actually had the better amount of possession in this game, they had just as many shots on target as the Dutch but Holland just knew how to pull the ball away and the American team didn't. They came into this tournament knowing that they lack really an out- and-out striker, somebody who can get in goals. And although they got that late one from Haji Wright, which briefly made it interesting, they really were just in a different class to the Dutch team who now go on to play Lionel Messi and Argentina.

Coy, there is one team in particular that is sweating it out this morning.COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It's not your Syracuse Orange, Boris. They're long out of the equation. But the question is what happens to number three TCU? They were burned by the College Football Playoff Committee once before, left out back in 2014. Now, they're hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Check out quarterback Max Duggan leaving it all on the line, rallying his team from 11 points down in the fourth. The senior from Council Bluffs, Iowa lost his starting job in the preseason due to injury, but he's fought his way back to being a Heisman candidate. 95 yards rushing on the game time drive, completely exhausted, Duggan completes the two-point conversion to send the game to overtime. But that's where Kansas State would pull off an incredible goal-line stand. Twice they were denied from the one-yard line. Then they turn around, Kansas State, and pulls up the game-winning field goal, ending TCU's perfect season. Duggan crushed afterwards, but hoping they still make the playoff. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Like, mountains of potatoes in someone's backyard or milk just being dumped into the dirt. And we would see lines of people miles and miles long, thousands of cars lining up to get a bag or a box of groceries. We called up, my friend, and we just said, why don't we join forces calling food banks, calling farms. We called a whole bunch, a couple of hundred.
