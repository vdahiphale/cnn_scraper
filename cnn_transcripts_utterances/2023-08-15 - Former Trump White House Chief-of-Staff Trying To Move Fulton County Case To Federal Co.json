      "sentences": "Tonight on 360.Just hours after being indicted for trying to overturn election results in Georgia, the former president promises that this time years later, he has really got evidence of election fraud. No, really. He's claiming that. Also tonight, breaking news on his former chief-of-staff and current co-defendant, Mark Meadows, who now wants the trial moved to federal court. Plus, the latest from Maui where President Biden is pledging every federal asset needed and the need is enormous. Good evening, thanks for joining us. We begin quickly with the breaking news in the wake of last night's RICO indictment in Georgia of the former president and 18 others. One of them former Trump chief- of-staff, Mark Meadows, filed papers late today asking to move the case to federal court. Rudy Giuliani facing 13 counts said this afternoon he'll seek to do the same. We'll talk more in a moment about this and the case to be made for it with our legal experts and whether the former president might join in. Right now though, he appears to be rushing headlong into the past, two years and seven months since leaving office for criminal indictments and 91 felony charges later, Donald Trump now says he can finally do it. Do what all his attorneys and all the Motley cast of characters he had around him were unable to do in dozens of court cases around the country in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, namely prove election fraud. Posting on his social network this morning, he announced a press conference next Monday at which he'll present a \"large, complex detailed, but irrefutable report on the presidential election fraud which took place in Georgia.\" And by the way, if you think you have heard this before, you kind of have. Let's go back, the date, January 4, 2021. The place Dalton, Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And after a string of court defeats in Georgia and elsewhere, 61 in all, including the Supreme Court.So now almost three years after losing, he says, he is going to produce in his words, some irrefutable report that shows he is right. Can't wait. Today, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican and Trump supporter in 2020 weighed in on it tweeting: \"The 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen. For nearly three years now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward under oath and prove anything in a court of law.\" It doesn't sound like he will be on the edge of his seat either waiting for Monday's mishegoss.

VANCE: Well, if he ultimately was charged in federal court and convicted in federal court, yes, I think it would negate it because the state case would be presumably dismissed, and then it would become a federal action. But I think, clearly, the importance of these state prosecutions, our investigation that took us to the Supreme Court twice to get the records from Donald Trump, my successor's case, now DA Willis, these are important backstops, and I'll tell you tell you why as an example, if I may, we started our investigation into the Trump Organization, finances and the like and the US attorney in New York who is a wonderful person asked -- their office asked me to stand down with our case.

None of those things necessarily are dissuading factors for Donald Trump.

MARC SHORT, FORMER CHIEF-OF-STAFF OF VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I think one name that's obviously not in that indictment is Mark Meadows, who was kind of the ringleader of all of this.

Georgia is a different ballgame and it's always been with him. When you look at especially laying this out, you know, as the conspiracy charge, as the RICO charge, he falls very clearly into that and the actions that he took.

There are things that affect the presidency that have not been tested in these state courts the way that in a federal court they are prepared to handle. Someone like Meadows -- listen, he deserves to be charged, but he's got the best case you're going to have about executive privilege and about, you know, conversations he is having, an advising role with the president.

And so Biden's team is agreeing with that where they are not on the same page still is on this deal to resolve a felony gun possession charge. And in that case, Biden's team is saying that they think this deal is valid and binding because it was signed by prosecutors and it was signed by Hunter Biden, even though the judge did not sign off on it. But prosecutors today saying it's missing another important signature and that is the chief of the probation department for the District of Delaware. She did not sign off on it, so they said, therefore it did not go into effect and it is not binding. Both their points of view are before the judge, and again, as I said, she didn't like this deal.

The weapons are remote controlled. And tonight for the first time, you're going to see the video feed from that sea drone during the attack.Nick Paton Walsh got access to the footage. Here's his report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice-over): It's become the most beleaguered symbol of Russian occupation. This weekend, Moscow saying this incident was just a smokescreen foiling, a Ukrainian attack on the $4 billion Kerch Bridge, the link between Russia and occupied Crimea that Putin seems to dote on. Now CNN has obtained exclusive footage heralding a new way of warfare of another earlier devastating Ukrainian seaborne drone strike there in July. From the Ukrainian security services, the SBU, who say they did it and more will follow. This is exactly what the drone pilot saw. Thermal imagery, the water rippling as up to a ton of explosive approaches the bridge. The feed then obviously went dead as it hit the concrete. Russian officials said two civilians died in the attack. Cameras on the bridge captured the first blast on the road section. The cursor shows the drone moving in. And another on the railway tracks at about the same time. Ukraine has been coy. Some officials saying these huge blasts are from, quote, \"unidentified floating objects\", but no longer the head of the Ukrainian security services told CNN, this is just the start. VASYL MALIUK, HEAD OF SBU (through translation): Sea surface drones are unique invention of the security service of Ukraine. None of the private companies are involved. Using these drones, we have recently conducted successful hits of the Crimean Bridge, a big assault ship, Olenegorsky Gornyak and SIG Tanker. WALSH (voice-over): This another Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian amphibious assault boat, the Olenegorsky Gornyak, on which Ukrainian officials said 100 personnel were on board. It was a remarkable feat carried out by a growing fleet of what they call the sea babies. Hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian bases, and right in Russia's coastal heartland. It put the black seas east, suddenly at risk. MALIUK (through translation): These drones are produced at an underground production facility in Ukraine. We are working on a number of new, interesting operations, including in the Black Sea waters. I promise you, it'll be exciting, especially for our enemies. WALSH (voice-over): Ukraine's ingenuity again and again toppling the lumbering Russian Goliath. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
