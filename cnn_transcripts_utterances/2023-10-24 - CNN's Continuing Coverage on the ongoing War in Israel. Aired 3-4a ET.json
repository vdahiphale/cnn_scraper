I'm Rosemary Church.Well the Gaza-based militant group Hamas has released two more people who had been abducted from southern Israel earlier this month. The hostages identified as Israeli citizens Nurett Kuper and Yocheved Lifshitz have been taken to a medical center in Israel to be reunited with their families. Both women were among the more than 200 people captured by Hamas in a deadly rampage on October 7th. Israel has been responding to that attack by bombarding Gaza almost non-stop. The Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza says at least 28 people were killed in southern Gaza in overnight strikes. And in the northern part of the enclave, Hamas says a hospital has lost electricity due to fuel shortages. The group is holding Israel responsible, calling it a crime against humanity. And journalist Elliot Gotkine joins us now live from London. Good morning to you Elliot. So two more hostages freed Monday. Can we expect to see more hostages released while the ground incursion appears to be on hold at least for now?",

So we would expect and certainly there's a hope that these releases now and these are the third and fourth people to be released by Hamas since it took all of those people hostage on October the 7th.So there is a hope and an expectation that more will be released and it's really being helped by both the Qataris who of course host some of the political leadership of Hamas in Doha and also the Egyptians and of course the Red Cross and in a statement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointedly thanking the Egyptians and the Red Cross, but avoiding thanking the Qataris for their association with Hamas, although we do know that they are involved in getting some of those hostages released. There's no word really about more being released or when or what kind of timeline that will happen on. There have been reports that Hamas was trying to negotiate fuel in exchange, fuel deliveries to the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of a large batch of hostages, around 50 or so. But when he was asked, Mark Regev, who's a senior advisor to the Israeli government, said that even if all of the hostages were released by Hamas, they would not allow fuel to go into the enclave for the simple reason that Israel believes that it will be pilfered or taken by Hamas and help them in their war with Israel.

Israel's saying that every time Hezbollah strikes or fires anti-tank missiles or any other projectiles towards Israel, that it will retaliate.And in some circumstances, it's also taking preemptive action. What we've also seen in the arena of Gaza is that Israel has further ramped up its strikes, carrying out more than 400 strikes overnight. It says hitting Hamas militant operatives, some of whom were on their way to fire rockets towards Israel or on their way to carry out terrorist attacks, in its words, against Israel. They also say they destroyed a tunnel, among other parts of Hamas infrastructure, which they said provided fast access for militants to the coast. So there seems to be a ramping up of the airstrikes in the Gaza Strip as well, which we assume means that we are inching towards this much expected ground evasion. Another indicator perhaps, Waze and Google Maps disabling temporarily live traffic updates for Israel and the Gaza Strip. Rosemary.",

Blocked by Israel, it says over concerns it will be taken by Hamas. Hundreds of trucks are waiting along the Egyptian side of the border.

It's a really sad situation, and I think it exemplifies this whole conflict. Hamas has no regard for human life, Israeli or Palestinian, and they're willing to sacrifice, massacre, murder, burn, rape, and even their own people. This is the sad truth.

And there is an expectation, as we expect from ourselves, that we will operate within the realm and the boundaries of the laws of armed conflict, and that is precisely what we do.When we are calling the people from Northern Gaza Strip to evacuate and go to the south, and still people are not evacuating, there are still people that have remained in the north, it's in order to distinct them from the terrorists. Hamas has made the Gaza Strip a fortress of terrorists. It has positioned all of its capabilities within the civilian arena, whether it's been drones on the rooftops of houses that they proudly yesterday distributed a video of that how they position this and how they're launching a drone with explosive towards Israel and it's launched from the rooftop of a house. They don't care who lives in that house. We try to evacuate the people. We try to get people out of harm's way while they are trying in order to keep them in harm's way. So yes, we are going out of our way to try and minimize the civilian impact in accordance to the laws of armed conflict. And indeed, when we are making announcements that we're going to strike, where we're calling on people, sending them text messages or phone calls, encouraging them, you have to leave for your own safety where Hamas is doing exactly the opposite and telling people to stay, and then when they're not listening to them, erecting cross- checkpoints, preventing them physically from evacuating. This is the sad truth. This terrorist organization is holding 220 Israelis hostage in Gaza. The people of Israel in the southern Israel, they're also trying to hold hostage, and the people of Gaza, they're holding hostage.",
