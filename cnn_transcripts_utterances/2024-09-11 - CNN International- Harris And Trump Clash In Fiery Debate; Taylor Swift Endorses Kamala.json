      "sentences": "Yeah, very much so. And I think you got the sense of that like literally in the seconds after this debate ended, when they sent out a statement calling for another debate with Donald Trump. That probably gives you the best indication of how they were feeling, as this debate was happening last night. But, I also think you got almost an immediate reaction from the Trump campaign as well when Trump himself went to the spin room there in Philadelphia, and you know, Erica, that's a pretty rare thing for a presidential nominee to go into the spin room after his own debate. And I think both of those reactions give you a sense of how each side was processing what occurred there on the debate stage.Now, this morning, I think what you're hearing from the Kamala Harris campaign side is that this is not necessarily going to determine the election. They're very careful about guarding against any kind of overconfidence within themselves, but also within their supporters. And in their messaging and in their emails and in their solicitations to their own supporters, they're making the very clear case that this race is not won by any means, that there are a lot of days left in this campaign, and certainly, while they think she had a very, very good night against Donald Trump, they don't want anyone to sort of be lulled into any sort of complacency. They do say that this race is still very much a close one, and that she remains the underdog. On Trump's side, what you're starting to hear is certainly going after the network and the moderators that organized that debate, ABC News, Trump saying that they should lose their license for some reason, giving you a very clear indication that he does not think that that debate went particularly well for him. [11:05:00] Of course, in public, he is saying that he won, and certainly his campaign is saying that they think that he did a great job. But, in an interview this morning, he himself suggested he may not be willing to do a second debate, and I think that probably gives you every indication of how he thinks this debate went for him. Of course, the most important question is how this debate resonated among voters, and in particular, the very small slice of undecided voters in the seven battleground states that will determine this election. Of course, we've seen some focus groups, the voters think that Harris won the debate. But, I think the real sort of effect that this will have on the race is still a few days out. It will still take a few days for this to really sink in and for us to get a good gage of how this race might be affected, if at all.",

Kevin, appreciate it. Thank you.Well, as we see, we wait for some of those other numbers. We do have some early numbers from registered voters who watched the debate, as Kevin was mentioning. And among those voters, they broadly agree Kamala Harris outperformed Donald Trump. Take a look at this CNN poll. 63 percent of debate watchers say the Vice President turned in a better performance than the former President. CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten joining me now to crunch these poll numbers. All right, Harry. Walk me through. We saw the 63 percent to 37 percent. What more did we get from these voters?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, look, I got the 63 percent to 37 percent right here. You get a graphic in the screen. I put it up on the magic wall. What I should note what's interesting about this figure, right, who viewers thought want, was this 63 percent, this sample actually leaned more Republican than the nation as a whole. When you asked those viewers before the debate who they thought would win the debate, it was basically a 50Now, let's put this into some historical perspective. All right? So, this is the first debate winner margins. These are all of Donald Trump's general election debates. Look, we got it right here, Kamala Harris winning by 26 points. What a difference that is from where we were back in June in that Biden-Trump debate, where viewers thought in that particular debate Trump won by 34 points, basically the exact inverse of what was going on back in June. What we see right here is very similar to the first debate in 2020 when Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in the debate, viewers' minds, by 32 points. Harris' margin, 26 points here, double that of Hillary Clinton back in 2016. Of course, the big question, and Kevin was kind of hinting at it was, what is this going to actually mean for the polls? We don't know exactly yet. But, here is what I'll note. If we look back at the first debates, right, and look at all the winners of those first debates, did they, in fact, get a poll bump after winning the first debate? You go back to 2012. Mitt Romney won that first debate over Barack Obama. He saw a polling bump. Hillary Clinton won that first debate back in 2016 over Donald Trump. She saw a polling bump. The same for Joe Biden in 2020, and of course, back in June of 2024, Donald Trump saw a polling bump and actually knocked Joe Biden out of the race. So, basically, if we look back over history, they also debate bump of about two points at least after the first debate. So, we're in such a tight race right now. That could, of course, put Kamala Harris in the lead in the national polls, and maybe put her in the lead in, of course, those key battleground states, of course, Pennsylvania probably being the most pivotal of those. Of course, that was where that debate was last night, but we'll just have to wait and see. Of course, Erica, you pointed out, you may get a polling bump after the first debate, but does that mean you win come November? Well, not necessarily, not necessarily, because lost the first debate, won the election. George W. Bush in 2004 lost that first debate to John Kerry. He won in November. How about Barack Obama in 2012? He lost that first debate to Mitt Romney and then won in November. And of course, Donald Trump in 2016 lost that first debate to Hillary Clinton, and he went on to win in November. So, right now, good news for Kamala Harris, based upon the first initial signals. I would, in fact, bet that she get a polling bump. But, who is going to win in November? Erica Hill, if I knew the answer to that question, I would go out and buy a lottery ticket, because the bottom line is, at this particular point, it is simply put too close to call.",

Part of what she needed to do was introduce herself and her policies a little bit better to the American voters, to those who aren't as familiar with her, and there was a real opportunity there when it came to a question about why she had changed when it came to certain policies, talked about that she would get to all of them.

She has to talk about her policies. She is never going to be everything to every person. But, she knocked it out of the park last night.She -- Donald Trump, again, denied the outcome of the 2020 election. He doesn't think that Ukraine should be winning the war against Russia, which sent shockwaves through democracies all around the world. I mean, she showed that she was presidential. She showed that she is willing to take on a bully. There are a lot of things that she accomplished last night that I don't think people were expecting from her and ready to see. But, I do think that she did lay some traps for Donald Trump that he walked into, and not accepting the results of the election again and again, that is something that swing state voters and these moms and these suburban -- in the battleground states just cannot understand. Their toddler has to take responsibility for their own actions, and he just refuses to do it. And I think the more that they can hammer those types of things home, and over the next 56 days, I think that she will have a very good chance of winning in November.

But, I think she needs to continue to talk about the issues and where she stands on things, and I think that's what people need to hear. And I think the more you say it and the more you keep reminding people who you are and the things that they've done, the Biden-Harris administration has done for you, I think people will get to see a real difference, and continue to draw the contrast between you and Donald Trump and the character argument. Nobody wants a President that is going to be extremely volatile and yelling all the time regardless of what their policies are.

The final moment at 10(VIDEO PLAYING) In New York, the families of victims of both the 2001 terror attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing have been reading the names of their loved ones for the past several hours. Earlier today, I spoke with Jay Winuk. His brother Glenn was killed on 9/11. He was an attorney, a first responder, a volunteer firefighter, and EMT. In the wake of his death, Jay founded 9/11 Day. It's a nonprofit which also helped to make September 11 a National Day of Service here in the United States. Here is part of our discussion earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY WINUK, CO-FOUNDER, 9/11 DAY: In the wake of 9/11, when the attacks happened, the nation came together in remarkable ways. We weren't red states and blue states then. We were all Americans, and it didn't matter where you lived or how much money you had or any of the things which typically separate us. We all came together as Americans, and some of us in the 9/11 community wanted to try to create a ritual in this country where at least on 9/11, at least on this one day each year, we put aside our differences. In fact, we embrace our differences, come together as Americans and do good deeds, be kinder to each other, remember what's really important that we're all in this together, and when we work together, we can be very productive and move forward. So, that was really the instigation for this. Certainly, my brother, Glenn, who was not only an attorney, but a volunteer firefighter and an EMT, lived his life and died in service to others. So, he is my personal motivation for having started this initiative. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just walk us through what we've seen this morning. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh yeah, Erica. When those bagpipes play, especially, it feels so heavy here. Let me tell you, right now, what's happening is the continuation, the reading of those names of those people who lost loved ones by their loved ones. And it's just remarkable to hear those little stories that come out when they say their loved ones' name. For example, we just heard from a woman who was talking about her father, who she lost, and she told him, you know what, dad? You became a grandpa this year. I mean, it is little things like that that really tug at your heartstrings, because these people are living with this every single day. Now, look, all the dignitaries have left at this point. Right now, all you can mostly hear is the sound of that water in the reflection pools while those names are being read. And we're just watching, as people, those family members, who this day is about as well, are just taking a moment. I just saw a man sitting on a bench over there for quite a while praying, others putting flags and the names of those who were lost. And not too long ago, during those moments of silence that you mentioned, an entire company from the FDNY saluting during that moment of silence. Remember -- we have to remember the fact that there are hundreds of firefighters that lost their lives after 9/11 just from 9/11-related illnesses, many more suffering from cancer because of that day.

As you said, inflation rising 2.5 percent annualized, that was a bigdrop from what we saw last month, which is welcome news. It's also the lowest level that we've seen outright in more than three years. What it means on an individual basis just in terms of what it's driving is rent. Housing costs are still an enormous pressure point. They rose half a percentage point on the month last month. Airline ticket prices, another price pressure, after five months of declines, some -- late summer travel, perhaps filtering into these numbers, and car insurance costs continue to rise, and that's a huge chunk now of simply owning a car. On the brighter side, what's helping bring inflation numbers overall down is energy costs are falling. Oil prices came under pressure again last week. So, that's going to filter in further. According to AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas is down double digits over the past year. So, this is welcome news. Also, if you're a car buyer, your question to begin is the important one, what does this all mean, I think, for the Federal Reserve? I think it is right that they're emphasizing jobs and protecting jobs now rather than inflation. But, I do think what we're seeing in the markets today is disappointment that we're not going to get a big half a percentage point cut next week. In fact, they believe, investors at least believe that we're probably going to get a quarter of a percentage point.

So, let me explain. This Ohio city he is talking about, Springfield, is a faded manufacturing community that has been revitalized in part by thousands of Haitian immigrants in recent years. But, there have been the usual immigration tensions. And recently, someone there posted on Facebook, they had heard a third-hand account. They attributed it to their neighbor's daughter's friend that immigrants are stealing other people's pet cats and cooking them for food.Now, after this post, numerous prominent Republicans, including Trump's VP nominee, J.D. Vance, who is an Ohio Senator, promoted this obviously dubious claim as if it was proven truth, but in fact, it is nonsense. The Springfield government and its police department both said there have been no credible reports of such a thing happening. And yesterday, before the debate, Vance acknowledged that the cat rumors might turn out false. But then, yesterday night, Trump, you heard, repeated them as gospel, and he added this dog's claim for good measure. Now, let's turn to an economic claim he made. He is proposing across- the-board tariffs on U.S. imports. And here is what he said about those tariffs.

And that's normal. That is what happens. Tariffs are taxed on imported products. The tariff payment to the U.S. Treasury is not made by foreign countries like China. It's made by the importer who brought the item into the U.S. In many cases, that business passes on some or all of the cost to the final U.S. consumer.And we have study after study, including one from a bipartisan federal commission that found that Americans bore almost the entire cost of Trump's existing tariffs on China. So, when Trump says he took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China through tariffs, know that money was from Americans. It's just not true.",

He is meeting with key Ukrainian officials while he is there, and we expect them to repeat their repeated ask for those long-range weapons to be able to be used to strike deep inside of Russia.Now, the Secretary of State is there, as pressure is building here in the United States for the administration to lift those restrictions, even from members of the President's own party. The Senate Foreign Relations Chairman, Ben Cardin, just put out a statement today, saying that Vladimir Putin's relentless attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure is nothing short of horrifying, and that in light of those ongoing attacks, now is the time to ease the restrictions on Ukraine's use of those .US.-provided weapons. Yesterday, we saw a letter from the Ukrainian caucus in the Senate and the House. That is a bipartisan body there on the Capitol Hill. We saw a group of key House Republicans also calling for those restrictions to be lifted. So, this is a growing chorus here within the United States, Erica, calling for these restrictions to be lifted. The U.S., of course, is not previewing any changes. They have argued that there is no one capability that is going to be a silver bullet in this war, and that they have provided a number of capabilities to assist Ukraine in its fight here. Erica.",

The language that the IDF are using at the moment is saying that they are investigating, and it's the preliminary investigation that President Biden appears to be talking about.But, it does seem that President Biden is putting pressure on Israel, because he said, so far, we've had access to that -- or the results of the investigation as it is going forward, but he said how much credibility we put in the investigation will depend on essentially that continued openness and sharing of information as it comes forward. Now, her friends who were with her at the time say that Israeli forces were 200 yards away up a hill. They believe that she was targeted by a sniper, and this was significantly worse than the President has described it as a tragic error. They believe that she was targeted when she was shot in the head, and the IDF has said that they were shooting towards a significant troublemaker who was throwing rocks, instigating violence. But, President Biden, it is clear here, he has toughened his language, how much clarity United States gets from Israel in its investigation, how many details will be released? It's not clear. But, I think there is a high degree of skepticism in the IDF's own investigations of its own troops firing on a protester. They have a significantly poor track record and a significantly low credibility standing among the groups, be it Palestinians, be it international protesters and their families and supporters who have been killed when they have been putting in place investigations into those deaths previously.",
