      "sentences": "You understand how this shooting. This really changes the approach that law enforcement has to take to him. They're always going to go into cases like this moving as quickly as they can.But look at the terrain around here. Maine is one of the least populated states in this country. I've been up in this area. This is all an awful lot of rural area, an awful lot of wooded areas where pursuing someone is very different than it is in an urban environment. Authorities largely are saying to people to stay locked down. But think about the distances we talked about before, 8 miles in here. They've locked down all the schools down here in Portland. They've told kids to stay home. They've closed them all. Because this is expanding by the hour. How they will track him down in this environment? Remember, the Androscoggin River runs right through here. If he has access to a watercraft of a new type, he can come straight down and go right out through here. Many, many ways, he can move away from this. And I will tell you this, Dana, one of the challenges for law enforcement is because they don't know where he is, the search area itself, again, by the hour gets more complicated. If he got into a different car, after he got rid of that other car that he had a short while ago, if he got into a different car than the one that they found at one location out here. If he got into a car and started hitting at highway speeds, and just went in one direction, he could easily be well beyond Cleveland, Ohio at this point. Does that happen very often? Doesn't seem to but it certainly could. And it complicates the equation for all these authorities looking for this man who they say should be seen as armed and dangerous. And it makes you understand why so many communities far away from this are paying attention and actually should. Dana?",

I know that you have been meeting this morning with the current governor and other officials there, including law enforcement. What can you tell us at this moment about Robert Card, this suspect, who, of course, is considered armed and dangerous? SEN. ANGUS KING (I), MAINE: I don't think I can add much to the reporting that you've already had, Dana, that he is armed and dangerous. It was interesting last night on all the press reports he was referred to as a person of interest. This morning, he is referred to as a suspect. Warrants have been issued for his arrest for murder. So that -- and you've covered all the mental health of the Army Reserve, the skill with a gun. But Dana, there's a very important context point here. And you were you were talking about it a few minutes ago. Ironically, on Monday, the FBI designated me in the safest state in the country. And although we have a very high percentage of gun ownership in the state, one of the highest in the country, I think the last figures I saw we were the second lowest in the country. So that's why this incident is so shocking. As I say we were the second lowest in the country until last night. And this is because Maine has a tradition of firearm ownership and use.

The news of this strike comes after the IDF conducted a raid in northern Gaza. IDF spokespeople said it was targeted and intended to create better terms for ground operation.Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to rain, quote, \"hellfire on Hamas\". As Israel inches closer to that potential invasion, one factor on everybody's mind is the more than 200 hostages still being held by Hamas inside Gaza. One of those hostages is Edan Alexander. Edan is 19 years old. He grew up mostly in New Jersey. He graduated from Tenafly High School in 2022, and then volunteer to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. He was taken hostage by Hamas during the terrorist attack on October 7th. I'm joined now by Edan's mom, Yael and his sister, Mika. Thank you so much to both of you for coming. You have a picture there and we have photos of Edan. I know you haven't been out very much talking publicly about your son, but now you think it's important. Why? YAEL ALEXANDER, FAMILY MEMBERS MISSING: Yes, I think it's important. I think it's important people to understand that my son is only 19 years old. He just graduated last year from Tenafly High School. We live in Tenafly, New Jersey. His sister Mika is a senior now in the high school.
