But I do want to make one thing clear about this rally at Madison Square Garden. His rhetoric was the exact same of what we have heard on the campaign trail for the last several weeks.Sure, it felt like it was on steroids because of the fact that we're at Madison Square Garden. But he has been saying the same things about Democrats being the enemy within, about immigration, using this kind of dark tone, this dark rhetoric. But that hadn't changed. What was really remarkable was that pre-programming. These several speakers leading up to Donald Trump that really set the tone for the former president in some such a negative and dark way that you were almost wondering what Donald Trump was going to say. When it came to the former president, he delivered on the same kind of messaging that he has. He's talked about immigration incessantly, talking about how it was harming the country. They believe that is a winning issue for them. Take a listen to some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For better or for worse, when it comes to the Trump campaign, obviously we know Kamala Harris, one of the things that she has been saying is that she wants people to go and listen to what Donald Trump and his allies are saying.But I will also tell you that a lot of Donald Trump's allies are very angry about what they saw on the stage last night. Not from the former president himself, but in that pre-programming. They don't understand how some of these speeches, particularly some of these lines, and particularly that comedian, whether or not you think that was a joke, he says it was, was allowed to say something like that up on the stage, completely tainting the messaging from the former president as he stood up there. And I do want to say one thing. The crowd was incredibly receptive to everything that Donald Trump said. They were kind of receptive to that pre-programming. But all of the things that we have talked about in terms of immigration, in terms of crime, in terms of this fear based rhetoric, they were standing on their feet clapping for him. He sold out Madison Square Garden. So it's just something to keep in mind that while we are talking about all this rhetoric, it is resonating with his base. Now the question, of course, Jim, does it resonate outside of his base? Is he going to actually be able to expand the electorate to get the votes he needs to win on November 5th? That's just not something we're going to know until Election Day.",

Now the campaign had also put a clip of those proposals by -- spoken by the Vice President on social media. And Bad Bunny had grabbed those clips and shared them to his 45 million followers. Now I am told that Harris campaign officials had been in touch with Bad Bunny's team in hopes of him at some point in this election lending his support for the Vice President and her plans for Puerto Rico. Well, that happened yesterday still to the surprise of many when they saw it and certainly they were happy about it because he is this -- the Puerto Rican rec -- recording artist is very famous. He's a superstar among Latinos and around the world. And certainly he carries influence when it comes to the Latino vote and especially Puerto Ricans. And in a state like Pennsylvania, where Puerto Ricans are a sizable portion of the voters there, this comes as welcome news for the Vice President and her team as they try to lock down that battleground state, a state that President Biden only narrowly won. So certainly the message from the campaign has been that the rhetoric at the rally -- for the former president's rally should come as no surprise. But they are trying to use it now as a contrast to what the Vice President was doing yesterday in Pennsylvania in speaking directly to Latino voters, to Puerto Ricans, and also amplifying and elevating those celebrities that have since come out in support of the Vice President.",

It was a joke about a black guy in watermelon.Now, I did speak with some folks from the campaign and they did tell me that they vetted the jokes that they thought the guy was going to stick with. And this guy decided like a complete moron to go in front of thousands of people with cameras that were broadcasting this across the country and turn off very critical groups that the former president, at least if you are to believe some of the polling was doing fairly well with. Now let's look at a place like Pennsylvania. There are 456,000 Puerto Ricans there.

I mean, you even had Rick Scott, the former governor of Florida, condemning it, talking about his great work with Puerto Ricans throughout the state of Florida.So, look, if you find somebody out there that's saying this was OK, then I think all of us on this panel would probably agree that a person who would not condemn this certainly doesn't belong in a public space.
