Number two, if he gets that big win, he will do something that is simply unprecedented in a contested primary. He won Iowa. He won New Hampshire. He won Nevada. He won all of those pretty big margins. He's expecting a very healthy margin here.In the end, Jake, the game is about delegates, 50 at play tonight, Donald Trump expects to get most. Some people think he could get them all.",

And right now, we can make a major projection.CNN projects that Donald Trump will win the South Carolina Republican primary, defeating former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley in her home state and securing his fourth major early victory in the GOP primary season. The former president taking another critical step toward winning his third Republican presidential nomination, and continuing his dominance over the race. Ahead of the all-important and delegate rich Super Tuesday contests just 10 days from now. We're able to make this projection based on exit polls that CNN and other news organizations conducted with thousands of South Carolina voters after they cast their ballots. Again, CNN is projecting Donald Trump will be the winner of the South Carolina Republican primary. Let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes at Trump headquarters in Columbia, South Carolina. Kristen, what is the mood there after this news, this very quick CNN projection?",

The question, of course, being how large is that margin going to be. The recent polls have had it up a roughly 30 points. Now we are told that Donald Trump is going to come out shortly and speak to thank all of his supporters here, and he will be on a plane back to Florida later tonight.Now, again, as you noted, as John noted, this is a sweep for Donald Trump. It is all for early states by huge healthy margins and what they are hoping that this does -- you can hear people cheering now. They're getting the news behind me. There's a lot of excitement. But they're hoping what this does is with this fourth win particularly here in South Carolina, that this is going to help urge Republicans who are on the fence, who believe that there might be an alternative to Donald Trump, to get behind the former president. They also hope that this will help with some of those holdout donors. What they really want to be doing now is pivoting to the general election, building out their campaign in various states, particularly, I'm told Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan. Now it's harder to do that if he is still competing against Nikki Haley. But that's what they are hoping to do. They were also hoping a huge margin here might put more pressure on the former South Carolina governor because this is her former home state, because this is another state that she has lost, to drop out of the race. However, as you have reported, as we have continued to say, Haley says she is not going to drop out until every primary ballot has been cast. It is again, though, it looks like the Republican Party has really started to come around completely for the former president as he wins this fourth early voting states.",

That's one. Two, no non-incumbent has ever done this. Four primaries and caucuses in a row. This really does show the dominance of Donald Trump when it comes to the modern Republican primary.

Nikki Haley knew that coming into this and that's why a lot of people thought she might want to avoid an embarrassing moment in her home state by leaving the race before that. But it almost seems like something has changed for her between New Hampshire and between South Carolina. The question is, what exactly is it?She's standing her ground saying she wants to stay in it. She seems personally deeply offended, especially because Trump has personally attacked her and her family, where else does that go for her and could this be a candidacy that might be less about how to challenge Trump in the primary and more about what is she going to say about Trump for the benefit of voters writ large? I don't know that Nikki Haley knows the answer to that question just yet, but increasingly that is going to be what people are talking about.",

Where I disagree a little bit with Alyssa and where I think it's sort of significant here that Nikki Haley stays in is I really think the future of American politics is going to be the future of factions. And I miss the days we were better off when the Democratic Party had really strong and robust competing factions, where they had to negotiate with each other. Republican Party desperately needs that. What Nikki Haley staying in the race does, I mean, there are a lot of things it does, but one of the things it does is it solidifies and gives permission structure for a big chunk of the Republican Party to be a non-Trump faction. And since Trump is not going to appoint a single person in his second administration to be a check on him, not one who could successfully there'd be no Barrs and Kellys or any of that kind of people.

But this is one that Rubio won and then Governor Haley endorsed him. But again, she is at 64 percent, so that's a nice early lead, but we're only at a quarter of the vote.

I spoke with one supporter who is headed to North Carolina, which of course is a Super Tuesday state to try and get voters there, to head out to the polls for Nikki Haley. And she told me, \"I don't think this is over.\" I spoke with another person in the room who said, we're all for anyone who isn't Donald Trump. So there is quite a bit of energy in this room for Nikki Haley, even though they recognize that she is likely to lose here in her home state. I do want to point out one thing, her campaign put so much time and resources into this state. They had more than 30 campaign events here over the last month. They really tried to do everything they can to compete here, to get supporters to vote for Nikki Haley, but I also spoke with campaign aides today who recognize that there were frustrations along the way, just because of the stronghold that Trump has here on the Republican Party in South Carolina and just on voters generally. For example, Clemson University, which is Nikki Haley's alma mater, the Republican Party of that college actually endorsed Donald Trump. That was a frustrating thing for the campaign. Of course, Nikki Haley did do an event there, it was a pretty large event. But there have been frustrations along the way. We are watching to see when she comes out here. Of course, after the New Hampshire projection was made for Donald Trump, she came out pretty quickly. Tonight, Donald Trump beat her to the stand, but we'll see when her campaign decides it is a good moment for her to talk to her supporters here in the room -- Jake.",

Columbia is kind of split, the county is split, not Columbia. The county is split in two districts.But in Richland County, she is only 64 percent of the vote at the moment, but again, only a quarter of the voting. So it's way too early to make any assumption based on that, and then this was -- this should be -- this should be her strongest area of the state. This is Charleston County, call it the Low Country. Again, a congressional district. You know, the former Governor Mark Sanford represented it, came to Congress, was governor, then left the governorship. She was the governor who succeeded him. He won the seat again then lost it because he criticized Donald Trump. He had a Trump primary there, but she's got 64 percent of the vote there. We are up to 33 percent. So conceivable, there's still a ways to go in the count, conceivable she wins this county. But again, congressional district that this county is involved in stretches up here as well.

Why wouldn't they just do that? And it's because that's not how South Carolina Republicans decided they want to do it.Different states have different rules. Pretty soon, we'll move into a lot of winner take all primaries the way South Carolina does it is, there are actually 26 winner take all delegates, then there are three Republican National Committee delegates that are allocated to the statewide winner. So there's 29, essentially, whoever wins the state gets the first 29 and the other 21, three for each of the seven districts. TAPPER: But it is if you look at why they do it that way.

And these zombie candidacies, which Nikki Haley's candidacy might very well become very soon, they can have an impact. This is maybe bringing in the delegate conversation they were just having. Sometimes acquiring delegates going into a convention can give you leverage over what happens in that convention, over what the eventual nominee does. Sometimes it keeps the conversation going about alternatives. Sometimes, this is -- well, I shouldn't say sometimes -- this is the one time when we could be facing a scenario, some people in the Republican party believe in which the Republican nominee might in some way disqualify himself before we get to November.
