But the bill faces uncertainty in the House where many Republicans egged on by Donald Trump are opposed to more Ukraine aid. The Senate is moving forward with the aid bill after Republicans, last week, blocked a border bill -- part of it -- that was bipartisan.The border deal was the product of months of negotiations with a trio of senators, including our next guest, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. He is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Thank you so much for being here. You got past that hurdle yesterday in the Senate. But now, Trump is saying don't provide any foreign aid unless it's in the form of a loan. Do you think this dies in the House? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  I hope it does not. I mean, let's just be clear. Vladimir Putin is intent on defeating Ukraine and then he has made it clear he has plans to move on. So, NATO countries to Europe. That would draw the United States directly into a confrontation with Putin. Two nuclear powers at war for the first time in our lifetime. That would mean Americans dying on the battlefield and potential global cataclysm. It would also incentivize China to start moving on Taiwan and other neighboring countries. We could be setting off World War III. So this is a very worthwhile investment in global security. A worthwhile investment in preventing the loss of American lives. Yes, it is true to Americans there are other things like controlling inflation, and border security, and health care prices that matter more, but this is as important as it gets as we try to preserve the World War II order where big countries are not allowed to invade small countries and get away with it.",

Yes, it did get tougher at the border, allowing the president to close down the border. But it also had priorities for Democrats, including increasing the number of visas that people can get to come to the country through other pathways. And when all of his Republican colleagues left him hanging out to dry, in many ways, he didn't back down from that bill. In the last 48 hours, went on conservative radio and TV and continued to try to sell it. He gave that very impressive speech in which he talked about the purpose of being a senator -- as to compromise and get things done, not just to do press conferences. I just wish there were more senators like that focused on doing the right thing. That were focused on compromise and didn't see their job as just standing up and complaining about -- listen, you could -- you could complain about what's wrong with America from anywhere, but if you run to be a United States senator, isn't your job to actually find solutions and compromise even if it gets you in trouble with the base of your party?",

That's in southern Gaza where the U.N. says more than one million civilians are taking shelter. It's raised concerns about the potential human toll of any operation. Those concerns extend to the White House. President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone for about 45 minutes yesterday. But the White House, in a readout after the call, saying that Biden, quote, \"Reaffirmed his view that a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there.\" Joining us now with the latest, spokesperson for the Israeli government, Eylon Levy. We appreciate your time. To start with, do we have any updates on the condition of the hostages? Obviously, big news -- very good news last night about the operation that secured their release. Do we have any news on their condition right now? EYLON LEVY, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAELI GOVERNMENT (via Webex by Cisco): Both hostages are in good and stable condition. Everyone in Israel is waking up to the very welcome news that the Army, in a daring special forces mission, managed to rescue those two hostages from Rafah where they had been held in a common block inside Gaza where Hamas has been trying to use neighboring areas (PH) as human shields.

And in order to evacuate them we need help from the U.N. agencies on the ground. Unfortunately, until now, they have been resisting our efforts to get civilians to safety. At every turn in this war, as we secure humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate, complying with our obligations under its national law, the U.N. has been accusing us of forced displacement for trying to help civilians get out of areas where terrorists are trying to use them as human shields. And those U.N. agencies now have a fateful choice to make. Are they trying to save Hamas or are they trying to save civilians?
