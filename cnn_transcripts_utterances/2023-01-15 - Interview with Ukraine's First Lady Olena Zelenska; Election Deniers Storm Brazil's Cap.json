I'm Fareed Zakaria.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, the first lady of Ukraine. I talk to Olena Zelenska about that frequently forgotten side of war, the human toll. How are Ukrainians dealing with the destruction of their cities and towns? How are they fighting winter's cold as the country struggles to pump out heat? And can they ever return to life as normal? Also, Brazil's January 8th and its stunning similarities to America's January 6th. We dig into the attack on the capitol in Brasilia with reporter Mac Margolis. And after California continued to be pummeled this week by rivers of rain, we'll explore the astronomical cost of climate change and wild weather that is already upon us. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

When you look at the bombing of civilian areas, the bombing of power plants to make people lose access to heat and electricity, it seems that it is an effort to break the will of the civilian population. And it takes us back to really kind of World War II days.Do you worry that it could succeed that just the sheer devastation of the Russian assault could break the back in some of these cities and some of these communities? ZELENSKA (through translator): Of course that's exactly what they are trying to do. I don't think they will succeed and we understand that upon carrying on for a year, we are capable of persevering for even longer. We can endure it, but you are right in that this terrorism aims to intimidate people. Quite recently, say three days ago, there was yet another shelling of a civilian community, and the projectiles hit an open-air market with a lot of people. And it was a sheer act of terrorism that cannot be either explained or justified. And one of the purposes that they have is to destroy the infrastructure of this country, for people to be exhausted, for people to raise their voice and say, we are sick and tired of this war, let us negotiate. Let us bring this war to the end. But they failed in this purpose.",

What have you told them that when the war started, they didn't see their father for months, even now. Do they understand it? Do they have to grow up very fast?ZELENSKA (through translator): You know, all children in Ukraine understand what's going on, including mine. You cannot conceal anything from them. And we are not trying to do so because they live in the same information phase as all of us. In our family they are trying to cope some normal life. Mother works, children study, and that supports us, because study is a purpose of their life. That's what keeps your life together, just something that does not allow you to get desperate. I've tried to cuddle my children to calm them, to reassure them. But children should live a well-organized, well-structured life, and I'm trying to bring in this order into their lives. Understand that sooner or later, everyone stops thinking that they do not know what's going on and what will happen tomorrow, and whether they should put a lot of effort into, say, university studies, studies at school. But we should not be -- we should not give up because we know that Ukraine, after the war, will need educators, young people that would be restoring our country and restoring normality in the country and in our town.",

They are constantly online, and they are quite taken with social media. And so a rumor spreads very quickly.You know, couple this with the discredit that exists of conventional media, and you have -- and Bolsonaro I have to say was a master at orchestrating discontent. His campaign, if you recall, four years ago he rose not on conventional media at all but on Facebook lives, and Twitter and such. And that has been the case ever since. So it wasn't a hard leap, really, for him to suggest that the electronic box that people deposit their votes was somehow suspect, because there's no paper, right? There's no way he said to audit the votes. That was easily disproven. The -- Brazil has been voting electronically for about 20 years or more, and there hasn't been a hitch in the losers except for in very rare occasions of -- not made peep at all about that outcome.

The very abrupt and unprepared U-turn on a policy that had been in effect for three years was largely driven by the mere fact that zero-COVID no longer worked.The virus infections were getting out of control. And on top of that, we have seen over the past months a very unprecedented way of protests breaking out all over China, and urgent pleas from local governments basically telling Xi Jinping that, you know, local governments are running out of money, because of, you know, all the requirements imposed on activities, et cetera.

It feels to me like your reporting is saying that finally there seems to be some course correction taking place in Beijing.",

Everybody was waiting to hear what the top guy had to say.And in terms of the course correction, I think the jury is still out. Because, you know, he definitely has unwind some of the policies he has implemented over the past few years from, you know, the private sector crackdown, the property sector, you know, crackdown to the most recently zero-COVID, in a bid to rescue the economy from collapsing. However, you know, public sentiment, private sector sentiment has already been badly battered by the policies of the last few years. And, you know, based on our conversations with private entrepreneurs in China, you know, talk is cheap these days. They want to see more concrete action. You know, will the government start fostering a new generation of Jack Mas? Will the government, you know, really start to embrace private tech sector again?",

However, I would just add that, you know, the room for that kind of stimulus is also getting much narrower these days than say 10 or 15 years before -- or 15 year ago because, you know, China's government, especially local governments, already have been too indebted and also the return from that kind of investment is also diminishing.",
