      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, after being delayed three times, the UN Security Council is expected to vote on a resolution calling for a pause to the fighting in Gaza. Home for Christmas, six Americans wrongfully detained in Venezuela are enjoying their first taste of freedom in quite some time. And the lava from a volcano in Iceland is easing, but it's also filling the air with smoke and toxic gas.The World Health Organization says there are no functioning hospitals left in northern Gaza. With no power and barely any medical supplies, the last of them can no longer take any more patients. The WHO says only a handful of hospitals in southern Gaza are able to treat patients. That desperate assessment comes as the UN Security Council tries to agree on a resolution urging Israel and Hamas to work out a new ceasefire. There are hopes a vote could come today, but the U.S. has balked at language. They say it is too critical of Israel. And the U.S. Secretary of State says Hamas has the power to end the suffering of Gaza's people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I hear virtually no one saying, demanding of Hamas that it stop hiding behind civilians, that it lay down its arms, that it surrender. This is over tomorrow if Hamas does that. And how could it be -- how can it be that there are no demands made of the aggressor and only demands made of the victim? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, not anymore, especially because we just got a statement in the last couple of hours from Hamas saying effectively that they will not engage in hostage negotiations until there is a cessation of aggression, as they term it, before any of those negotiations can move forward. That has been Hamas' position for several weeks now. But, there was some hope that perhaps they would move off of that position, especially as yesterday we saw Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas, traveling to Cairo for meetings with Egyptian officials, who have been key in -- key mediators in these talks alongside the Qataris. But, very clearly, Hamas is sticking to this position, which is untenable for Israel.Israel, of course, has put an offer on the table that would see some 40 hostages released in exchange for a week-long pause in the fighting, but they are not going to agree, at least at this time, to a pause in the fighting in order to allow space for the negotiations. And so, what we are seeing is that the fighting is very much going to continue on the ground in Gaza. And that also, of course, means that more Palestinian civilians are going to continue to suffer as a result. More than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza since the beginning of this war. 70 percent, 70 percent of those are believed to be women and children, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. That is an extraordinary number. And of course, behind that number are the lives of so many civilians who have been killed in this fighting and in the bombardment of the Gaza Strip that has been relentless since the beginning of this war. At the same time, we're also learning more, Max, about these three hostages who were killed late last week by Israeli soldiers, mistakenly identified as a threat despite the fact that they were waving a white flag and have their shirts off. But now, the mother of one of those three hostages delivered a message, an audio recording to the unit that was involved in that shooting, effectively telling them not to blame themselves. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IRIS HAIM, MOTHER OF SLAIN HOSTAGE YOTAM HAIM (Translated): I know that everything that happened is completely not your fault, it's nobody's fault -- except the Hamas, may their name and memory be wiped off the face of the earth. We all need you to be safe and sound. Don't hesitate for a single moment -- if you see a terrorist, don't think that you have deliberately killed a hostage. You need to protect yourselves because that's the only way you would be able to protect us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That dog was killed in the fighting. And unfortunately, the GoPro that he was wearing was only recovered two days ago. But, on it, the Israeli Military actually found that the voices of those three hostages was recorded on that GoPro. This happened five days before those hostages were shot and killed mistakenly by those Israeli soldiers. This, of course, will be a part of the broader investigation into this incident that the Israeli Military is conducting.",

      "sentences": "I think it's very rare to see an instance where Israel abides by or listens to what the United Nations is saying. We will see how they will actually react to it if indeed this resolution passes. But, of course, we know that the United States is very much working to tweak the language of this resolution so that it can be something more palatable, more acceptable to Israel's position, and more importantly, something that the U.S. could potentially support. The Secretary of State yesterday indicated that the U.S. is trying to get to language that it could actually support beyond just an abstention, something that they might actually vote in favor of.And so, they've been trying to work in language, not only about Hamas' roll in carrying out the October 7 terrorist attacks, which launched this entire war, but there is also negotiation around the language about stopping or suspending the hostilities in order to allow for the entry of aid, in order to provide some kind of a humanitarian pause. But, there is no question that now you have in the backdrop of all this Hamas effectively refusing to negotiate for a pause in the fighting for the release of hostages until Israel stops the fighting. So, this kind of just adds to the mix of this kind of complex situation that we are watching unfold, and perhaps we'll have a vote at the UN today if they don't delay it again.",

Ed Lavandera is in San Antonio, Texas, with more on the release of those Americans. And also some concern, obviously, about how the swap went the other way.ED LAVANDERA, CNN U.S. SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. There has been some concern. But, overall, I think what U.S. officials were saying is that they were much more intentionally driven by getting these Americans out. U.S. officials say now there are no wrongfully detained Americans inside of Venezuela. This deal came together so quickly yesterday morning that many of the family members of the Americans that arrived here in Texas didn't have time to make it here to the city to watch them walk off the plane. Many family members have arrived here since then. But, they said -- several of the released Americans said that they woke up yesterday morning in a Venezuelan jail cell. They were then flown to an island in the Caribbean, which turned out to be a meeting point, where they waited for almost six hours as the final details of this deal between the U.S. and Venezuela were hammered out. Then they were told that they were going to be getting on another plane that would be taking them home. One of the men that spoke after landing yesterday was Eyvin Hernandez. He had been held in Venezuela for almost two years, more than 20 months. He said it was an excruciating time. And then, he is just simply grateful to be back here in the United States, reunited with his family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Venezuela also sent back a man by the name of Leonard Francis who has escaped from the U.S. after he was convicted back in 2015 on -- in a huge scandal of the bribery and money laundering following -- it was a U.S. Naval scandal. He was supposed to be sentenced and then escaped to Venezuela. He has also been brought back.

      "sentences": "It has. This is a political vulnerability for President Biden as he heads into the 2024 presidential election. And now, sources tell me that the White House is expected to place additional pressure on Mexico to help with the surge at the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, the U.S. has generally leaned on Mexico to assist with stemming the flow of migration to the U.S. southern border. And that is what President Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are expected to talk about this week.Now, again, the reason that this is happening is because of what is an unprecedented surge at the U.S. southern border. There have been several days of more than 10,000 encounters daily. Those are numbers that haven't been seen since the spring. And current and former officials tell me that that is bringing the U.S.-Mexico border to a breaking point. And it's not only because of the numbers that we're seeing, but that it is happening across the U.S. southern border. In previous instances, there are often spots or sectors where there is a surge, and that is where all resources are deployed to assist. But, what is happening now is that there are multiple searches across the border. So, that means that officials are being sent to these different locations that there really -- their hands are tied in terms of where they can send migrants that they're receiving to get additionally processed, and if they are eligible, repatriated to their country. So, all of this is a steep, steep challenge for U.S. officials who are scrambling to respond. And that also means that they need more assistance from their regional partners, which is the reasons sources tell me that the President is expected to get on the phone with the Mexican President to talk about this. But, again, Max, this is a political liability, again, going into next year. It is one that the President has contended with since taking office, border security being an issue that Republicans have slammed the administration on as it faces unprecedented migration in the Western Hemisphere. And it is also the reason, Max, that Ukraine aid is currently stalled in Congress as Republicans seek border policy changes to get any aid forward. So, these domestic issues are at the center of the President's foreign policy agenda. All of this converging at the end of the year, and just placing additional urgency to those talks between the U.S. and Mexico. FOSTER: Yeah. And also in terms of the White House and some conservative lawmakers who are blocking various other packages because they're not happy with what's going on at the southern border. Is there any suggestion that some progress on common ground is occurring in those talks?",

The Congress has been unable to reach consensus on any immigration reform. And Senate negotiators tried this month to reach some sort of agreement on border policy changes, and the White House desperately wants this to happen. They too were involved, and even considering some pretty strict border measures that were against some of their own party members, and that includes, for example, expelling migrants at the U.S. southern border, which doesn't make them eligible for asylum, also more deportation flights, more detention. All of these are issues that Democrats have been speaking out against over the last several years.But, it just goes to underscore how desperately the White House wants this deal to get that aid to Ukraine and Israel. And again, while lawmakers were signaling progress, we're now almost at the end of the year, and the Senate is going home, and there hasn't been any deal accomplished. So, what we've heard so far is that this will be kicked up again in the New Year, and they hope to reach one then. But, Max, having covered this for years now, it is very difficult, perhaps unlikely for that to happen on what has been an intractable issue here in Washington.",

One of them is about his business practices, and how he kept his books as a businessman. And another one is about his handling of documents after the presidency, in Florida.And so, all of those things are things that Trump has said, the prosecutors, they go after me because I am in their minds of prime (ph), somebody that politically people want to prosecute. That isn't what has happened though. These cases have gone through grand juries. They have been approved by people sitting on those grand juries.
