It's Friday, March 29th, 4 p.m. here in Hong Kong, 11 a.m. in Jerusalem.The World Court is calling on Israel to do more to get basic supplies and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza in order to prevent genocide. On Thursday, the court said famine is setting in. It voted unanimously to add more provisional measures to its order from January, saying: The catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had deteriorated further, in particular in view of the prolonged and widespread deprivation of food and other basic necessities to which the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been subjected. Israel calls the decision cynical and accuses Hamas of commandeering, hoarding and stealing aid. Its foreign ministry spokesperson says South Africa, which has brought the genocide case, is undermining Israel's right to defend itself. The court's decision comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his military is preparing to enter Rafah in southern Gaza. Well, the city is now home to about 1.4 million people told by Israel to evacuate to safety there. The U.S. has repeatedly discouraged an Israeli ground incursion. Well, CNN's senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us now from Rome. He's been covering this story extensively. Ben, the International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to stop obstructing humanitarian aid into Gaza. There are some reports there are something like 1,500 trucks, aid trucks at the Egyptian border waiting to cross into Rafah. Practically, what does this ruling mean on the ground?",

Now, earlier this week, in a meeting with a bipartisan congressional delegation from the United States, Prime Minister Netanyahu laid forth his vision, if you can even call it that, of what the people currently taking refuge in Gaza, well over a million, I mean in Rafah, and he basically said they just can move out. They can move out of Rafah with their tents, in his words, and he says there's all of the north of Gaza.People move down, they can move up. Now, this is not a Sunday picnic. These are people who have lost their homes. They've had to move multiple times. Many of their homes have been destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Now, the United States has been pressing Israel for weeks to come up with some sort of plan to safely evacuate people out of Rafah in anticipation of this Israeli operation there, but this idea they can just move, sort of get, move, take their tents apart and move north doesn't really seem like much of a plan --Anna.",

Crews are working to recover the bodies of the rest of those on board, 45 people who were travelling to a conference to celebrate Easter. Officials say the bus driver lost control and collided with some barriers on the bridge. That reportedly caused the bus to go over the edge, falling some 50 meters to the ground below where it caught fire. Maryland's governor is admitting the state has a very long road ahead as a salvage operation gets underway after the collapse of the Key Bridge. Governor Wes Moore told reporters that recovery efforts for those still missing is a main focus as divers battle murky water conditions. Officials are also working to reopen the channel and restart traffic to and from the port before ultimately rebuilding the bridge.

Now, that would have been known about in the port area. At some point, someone's done a risk assessment on the vulnerability of that bridge. They've looked at measures to ameliorate that lack of resilience and have decided to not do it for reasons of cost. And I think when the investigation digs into the layers of this investigation, of this terrible accident, I think they'll look very closely at the decision chain to not provide greater resilience in and around the bridge.

When there's no electricity, the port doesn't work. And it's a pity because the Ukrainians have worked very, very hard to push back the Russian Black Sea fleet to the point where the Western Black Sea reopened and grain and sunflower oil was being shipped to Western ports. But that couldn't stop if these strikes continue. And one more thing, you know, there's also what's going on here beneath the surface, what I call kind of death by a thousand cuts.

But also, she said the psychological toll. She used to go there to help soldiers heal. But now she says music doesn't seem to make that bit of a difference. The other thing that aid is meant to do is to help budget support. The IMF just came out with a report, Anna, that said Ukraine's economy is headed into very strong headwinds.

And also, I think in the crosshairs of Mr. Putin, is NATO countries like Poland, but particularly the Baltic states. And that will be a lot more costlier for the West. It will be deadlier because NATO troops, American troops, will have to come on the ground there. Look, one quick factoid here is for three to four percent of the annual U.S. military budget, Ukraine has been able to destroy about 50 percent of conventional Russian military capability.
