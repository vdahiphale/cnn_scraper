      "sentences": "Let's get back to this hour's breaking news. John Eastman, Donald Trump's former attorney, has just reached a bond agreement with the Fulton County district attorney, $100,000.Eastman faces multiple criminal charges for his alleged role in helping Trump try to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. Remember, he's one of 19 defendants facing charges, including the former president himself. CNN chief legal analyst, Laura Coates, is back with us now. So, Laura, $100,000 bond. How do you read this?",

      "sentences": "Well, looking at the documents right now, remember, he is charged with multiple counts. And they're very serious. From RICO to conspiracy and beyond.This is actually quite typical to have bond. A real way to think about this is listen, I'm going to allow you not to be in prison or in jail awaiting your trial but you've got to give me some sort of guarantee that you're actually going to show back up and I can trust you. And the trust comes in the form of a monetary payment, hence the $100,000. So he will go to a bail bondsman who will ask you for 10 percent of the ultimate charge. If you do not pay that, of course, you can be a fugitive. You can have a warrant in defense of a bounty, obviously, not lethal, on one's head to have you return to court. This indication to give this sort of bond means a judge said you don't pose a threat to society, a public safety risk. and perhaps even a flight risk because I believe this $100,000 is going to guarantee you're going to show back up for your trial date. I will note, though, in this, he has to report to pretrial every 30 days, meaning you're passing a drug test, you're checking in with somebody every so often. And perhaps the most important thing here, Boris, is that he cannot communicate in any way either through intimidation or otherwise to a co-defendant, 19 people, essentially. Or to a witness in this case, which means that, at some point, you're going to hear from Fani Willis's team to say who are the witnesses that could be in this case. This happened in the Jack Smith case as well down in Mar-a-Lago, the co-defendants of Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira. But here it's more people involved. And how are you able to sort of thread the needle not to communicate, not to intimidate ought to be an easy concept, of course.",

Unlike the other issues, we had the valet, Walt Nauta, or someone close to his residence in Mar-a-Lago, this includes people he may have correspondence with.

He is known as sort of the architect of the pressure campaign against Vice President Pence.Based on what he believed or he said he initially believed was a surefire way to actually have an elector scheme that would say your role can be more than ceremonial, you can actually say no, we're not going to do this. Now, his lawyer in his disbarment proceeding said this is a matter of scholarly debate. I'm not sure which classroom we're having this debate, of course, Boris. Because it's very clear that the role of the vice president is not to be anything more than ceremonial. You have members of Congress right now trying to have that law changed or rewritten to make sure that it's all the more clear. But he is suggesting that he was simply trying to opine on these matters and not trying to do anything that was untoward, that was illegal or in any way would undermine justice. However, he also is the person, according to at least one person, Mr. Jacobs, who said he believed that he would lose this argument in front of the Supreme Court 9-0. Remember that famous statement. 9-0. Except he thought, because he was the clerk of Clarence Thomas once, maybe he could lean on him in some way. At the end of the day, though, the most important thing to think about, because of that disbarment proceeding you mentioned, on January 6th in front of Congress, he did not testify. He pled the Fifth multiple times. We saw it played over and over again. In the disbarment, though, he took the stand. He testified. Which means that everything he said there can now come in into future things, including this very proceeding.",

KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, this is the second term agreement that we have learned of today, and we now see on paper. This is for a man named Scott Graham Hall, who is accused of working with Sidney Powell and others to try and access these vote tabulating machines in Coffee County, Georgia, part of this racketeering case. Scott Graham Hall's bond is set at $10,000. And actually, he's a bail bondsman himself. So we now have those terms for this agreement here at the Fulton County courthouse. There are negotiations clearly taking place this afternoon. There's a lot of law enforcement activity. We just saw some additional lawyers head into the courthouse. Ken Cheseboro's lawyer was walking in, very likely to do his version of the negotiations for his client. Ken Cheseboro was one of those people who was working with other lawyers around Trump trying to set out as architects of this fake electors plan, the use of fake electors for Donald Trump in battleground states across the country. And then we also have a bail term set for John Eastman. These are going to be coming in one by one for each of these defendants. Very likely today. Could go into the future days. But all of these terms, these defendants are going to want to have set because it allows the judge to sign off on how these people can be released as they await trial. So that whenever they go to the jail to turn themselves in, to be arrested, to be processed they don't have to sit there for a long time. They can be processed. And then they can be released. But there will be a question of how long all of them, including Donald Trump, will be in that jail and exactly what Donald Trump's release terms might be.",

It has cut off some access to the Interstate 10 freeway here because there are still big trucks and cars blocking the road. We did just confirm that some of the roads are being reopened. But the three major roads into Palm Springs are still closed. So some ways in because you can get in from other ways. But it is still a big mess here. We did just see the owner of the small black car here, that is right in front of the white car, he was not driving. He was home. His car floated away. That's how it ended up here. It floated several hundred feet from where it was. He just told us -- he didn't want to go on camera to give an interview. But he came by to take pictures of his car. Completely totaled. That's how I'm assuming the white car got here, too. You see the mud is up to halfway in the wheels. The other car, though, Brianna, the black one, she's been sitting there for five hours.
