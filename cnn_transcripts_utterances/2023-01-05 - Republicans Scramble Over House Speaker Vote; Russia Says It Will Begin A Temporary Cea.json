      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we are following two breaking storiesfor you. Right now, U.S. House Republicans, you can see there are scrambling to elect a leader. Kevin McCarthy has just lost a seventh vote in his bid to become speaker of the house. We'll bring you of course, developments throughout the hour. But first, Russia says it's ready to begin a temporary ceasefire, starting on Friday, but Ukraine is denouncing the move as pure propaganda and hypocrisy. We are live in Kyiv just ahead. And now, as we're telling, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a 36-hour ceasefire in Ukraine, a declaration Ukrainian officials denounce as quote, \"pure propaganda\". According to the Kremlin, tomorrow and Saturday, Russian troops will lay down their weapons, so, Orthodox Christians can attend Christmas services. This was backed by the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. You can see in that picture, Keil(ph), who is a staunch supporter of the war in Ukraine. But both Ukraine and the U.S. say this isn't an act of Christian charity or goodwill from Moscow. Officials in Kyiv and Washington believe it's a way for Russia to buy time on the battlefield, to mobilize as well as to re- strategize. I want to bring in Scott McLean, who is joining us from Kyiv and Nic Robertson here in London. Scott, let me go to you, first. I mean, what are Ukrainian officials saying? If they're calling this pure propaganda, where does this leave the operation at home? Will they continue in their offensive?",

      "sentences": "Yes, all of the signs are that the Ukrainians are going to treat this as any other day on the battlefield. Infact, an adviser to President Zelenskyy said that there can be a truce only when the Russians withdraw entirely from Ukrainian territory. And we've seen plenty of officials with a very similar message. It seems that Ukraine is united in this, and even when you speak to ordinary Ukrainians, they are remarkably cynical about this Russian effort to get a ceasefire or even if only for 36 hours. You have an ordinary civilian in Kherson that we spoke to who says that he just simply doesn't believe that this is actually going to happen, that it's going to change anything on the ground even if the Russian military leadership at a high- level sort of maybe ceases launching missiles or drones for a 36-hour period. It's not going to change anything on the ground. Ukrainian soldier that spoke to us said that, quote, \"I don't believe this BS.\" We're also hearing from the Ukrainian governor of the Luhansk region who says that this is just an attempt for the Russians to get a little bit of breathing room from the intense pressure that they're under and have a chance to actually regroup. We've also just recently heard from the pro-Russian head of the Donetsk People's Republic who said there can be no truce, and said that the Russians will respond to any provocation, and they're not going to allow this to be a chance for the Ukrainians to improve their positions on the battlefield. So, all signs at this stage, Isa, are that not a whole lot is going to change tomorrow, certainly at least from the Ukrainian perspective.",

And it is taking a lot of spilled blood to move the frontline even, you know, a 100 yards in one direction or the other.

And I said, what's the plan? And he just said, well, not much is going to change. But we think that the behind-the-scenes conversations are what's being more productive. So, McCarthy and his allies think that they -- and believe and keep saying that they are winning over one by one Kevin McCarthy's detractors. But the fact remains that the math just does not add up in his favor. He made some major concessions overnight to some of these hard-liners. That deal is not done yet. But let's say he even got that group that he's targeting with these, it's still not enough to get him to that magical number of 218. He still got some work to do. So, it is a very heavy lift, and what his allies and supporters want to see is that he is making progress. And right now, he is not going backwards, but he is certainly not making progress. So, we're going to get through this eighth vote, and then the question becomes, what do they do next? Do they continue to vote? Do they adjourn for the evening? Do they adjourn for multiple days? Those are some of the questions that are floating around right now. Because if they think they're making progress and can kind of pick off these detractors one by one, they may want to continue to do that off the floor and behind the scenes before they come back for a vote. So, we're just going to wait until this eighth vote is over and see what the appetite is there. But Democrats, just so everyone knows, on the other side of the aisle, have been very upfront that they do not want to help bailout Republicans from this mess. They could be doing that, they're simply not and we don't anticipate that they will at this point.",

That is according to the \"Guardian\" newspaper. CNN royal correspondent Max Foster takes a closer look for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  New year, new set of revelations from Prince Harry about his family. The British newspaper, \"The Guardian\", managing to obtain a copy of his new autobiography entitled \"Spare\". In it, the newspaper says he describes an argument with his brother at Kensington Palace. The alleged fight started when William called Meghan difficult, rude and abrasive, painting a vivid picture of the incident. Harry writes that the Prince of Wales grabbed him by the collar, ripping his necklace and knocking him to the floor. Harry says he landed on the dog's bowl, which cracked under his back with pieces cutting into him. CNN has reached out to Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace who have declined to comment on the alleged altercation, so has a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan. To promote the book, the prince spoke to U.K. and U.S. media about his relationship with the family and his future role in the monarchy. In an interview with Britain's \"ITV Network\", he was asked this.",

And yet, as we reach this point, the full multi-ballot speaker's race in 100 years and one that shows no sign of reaching a resolution anytime soon, what you've gotten from advisers of President Biden has shifted. It has evolved from, at first, amusement, some level of sadistic enjoyment as they were watching the first day play out, to some concern about what this may mean, both in the near term, the longer term, heard the president talk about that yesterday, that this was embarrassing and other countries were watching how the U.S. was operating. How the U.S. government was operating. Now I think there is a level of, on some level, maybe some boredom but also recognition that this is a very real problem going forward. Obviously, Congress is not an operating legislative branch if the House and its members don't have a Speaker and therefore cannot be sworn in. There are very real implications on the policy side of things. Longer term, there are must-pass pieces of legislation with very wide repercussions that this doesn't give any sign that things are going to be easy in that process. The other interesting element is what the president has been doing throughout this time. Yesterday, he had a split screen event with Mitch McConnell, touting his bipartisan infrastructure law. Today, focusing on immigration, an issue the administration has long struggled with in the first two years, really tried to avoid it to some degree up until after the midterm elections. Now the president is traveling down to the border for the first time, something he has resisted on his way to the North American leaders' summit, talking about immigration, pushing Congress to try and reach some type of legislative solution. Republicans, who have attacked the president for two years on this issue, are focused elsewhere. I think the dynamics here of how that vacuum is somewhat unfilled by Republicans on the messaging side of things and what that may mean politically going forward, it's a fascinating dynamic. One that will have some wide-ranging implications in the months ahead.",
