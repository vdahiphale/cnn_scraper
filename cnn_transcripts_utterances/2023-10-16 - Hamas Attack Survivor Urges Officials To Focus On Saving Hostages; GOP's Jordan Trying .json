We'll get back to you very, very soon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel, as Erin was saying, this morning as the country says Hamas is holding more hostages than previously thought. Israel announced overnight that known number of hostages has increased to 199 people. We know hostages were taken from the Nova Music Festival where Hamas killed at least 260 people. Lior Gelbaum was at that festival with one of her friends. One of her dear friends, David Newman, was murdered there. Another, Inbar Hyman, was taken hostage by Hamas. You see her there. Lior survived and escaped. And last week, she shared her devastating story with Sec. Blinken when he visited Tel Aviv. You just saw him there with the secretary. She pleaded with him to help rescue her kidnapped friend -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

GELBAUM (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes, of course. Good morning. The meeting actually happened very spontaneously. Me, my boyfriend Khalil (PH), and our mothers went volunteering at the Brothers and Sisters in Arms organization donation center. We were packaging -- helping with the packaging. Then two Embassy representatives came up to us. They found out that we were survivors from the Nova Festival. They asked us if we would be willing to meet with Mr. Blinken. A couple of hours later, we met him and it was amazing. It was really touching. I was very emotional. I had little time to practice what I wanted to say to him. So eventually, everything that I said came from the bottom of my heart. He was very touched. I was very excited. I really felt him comforting me. I felt like he was a friend that cared for me and for us, and for my story. He cared and I could tell he was very emotional, too.",

How does all of that weigh on you? L. GELBAUM:  It's complicated. It's frustrating. I care so much for Inbar and the almost 200 hostages that are held in Gaza. We don't know their situation. All I ask is they get medical care -- proper medical care. I ask for prayers for them and for us and just bring them home. We need them home.
