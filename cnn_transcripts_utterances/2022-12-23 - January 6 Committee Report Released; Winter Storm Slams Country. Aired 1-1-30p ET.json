And whether it's blinding snow or the subzero temperatures, just about everyone out there is feeling it, more than 200 million Americans right now under winter warnings or advisories. And looking at that map, the more purple you see, the colder it is. And the timing of this is simply terrible. Holiday travel, where it's even possible, is a mess as you would guess. Thousands of flights are canceled right now. And you can forget about driving in a lot of parts of the country. In New York, the snow and flooding are so bad, all nonessential travel is banned right now. And, in Rhode Island, massive waves hammering the coast, street flooding there a big concern. And blizzard conditions are also making for some white-knuckle driving in Ohio and Cleveland. It's going to feel like minus-27 all day. And in the South, well, that's where you will find a lot of ice. And it is catching Memphis drivers off guard. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, first, we want to go to Polo Sandoval in Buffalo, New York. Just for everyone watching, we were going to get the forecast first, but, Polo, this shot is so awful and it looks so brutal, we wanted to get to you first mostly so we could get you back inside. So, tell us the latest, and then let's get you back inside.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Jessica.It's important to tell our viewers here and around the world, talking about the visibility and -- or the lack thereof here in the city of Buffalo right now, just for some perspective, I'm about 40 yards away from our colleague Tom Jurick's (ph) camera. You may not be able to see me because of these blinding conditions. What has happened over the last -- and I will slowly make my way towards the camera. We will see when you can actually spot me. But what we have seen here over the last six hours, Jessica, are these conditions that have been deteriorating just by the minute. Earlier this morning, we started with temperatures in the upper 30s with barely a drizzle. And then it was a matter of time that the system would continue to make its way east. And just a few hours ago is when we really began to feel it. And this is the result. And this is why authorities here in Erie County, New York, say that it's gotten -- the visibility has been gotten so bad, that they're actually pulling the massive plow trucks off the streets. I'm going to make sure, obviously, that there are no vehicles coming. We made sure that there's nothing that could actually -- that's actually flying around to be able to show you this, to make sure that we're safe. But just to tell our viewers and to remind our viewers just how bad it is, I mean, these are -- I have stood in hurricanes. I have stood in tropical storms. I have stood in winter storms. This really is a combination of both. And so the concerns here for authorities are not just the blinding conditions, but also the potential for flooding in some of the coastal communities as well. And so that's why the authorities are telling people who live in those parts of the community here near Lake Erie to simply stay home, and those who are thinking about actually braving the roads to stay in place, at least for the rest of the day. These conditions are going to continue into tomorrow -- Jessica, back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, while Polo's shot is absolutely mind-boggling, he's receiving what are considered blizzard conditions, reduced visibility under a quarter-mile for three hours, winds of over 35 miles per hour. Doesn't necessarily have to snow, but, clearly, it is.They are getting pounded by the worst of the storm. Conditions are going to deteriorate for them. But here where I am, in Atlanta, the emperor of the north has come in and really dropped our temperatures. We're monitoring it. It's about 20 degrees here. Hard for you to see at home. So I think we -- our best way to explain just how cold it is, we brought a wet towel out here earlier today, and it froze almost instantaneously. So if this gives you any indication about what the roads are like in and around Atlanta, in the general Georgia area, if there's water on the ground, it has certainly froze with this flash freeze that occurred overnight as temperatures dropped a staggering 30 to 40 degrees in a matter of six hours. Our Christmas Eve tomorrow forecast has high expected of 25 degrees. That will be the coldest Christmas Eve in Atlanta's history. The wind is whipping around the state of Georgia in the southeast. It has brought down trees. It has taken down electrical poles. And, unfortunately, just in the state of Georgia alone, there are around 100,000 customers without power right now. And you can think about the ramifications there with that. People do not have the ability to heat their homes, keep their selves warms, but also the pipes inside of their home at threat of being frozen. Get to the radar really quickly. This is my graphic. I want to show you where this storm is headed, the cold front right now located over the East Coast. New York, you're in the rain belt, so the warm air, but that cold air is coming. So, you're going to get a thump of snow very quickly. It won't last very long. It won't accumulate, likely, but you will see the dramatic drop in our temperatures. And then as we look a little bit closer into the downwind area of Lake Erie, where Polo is currently right now, we know they are going to be in whiteout conditions at least for the next 24 hours minimum, but some improvements expected a little bit further to the west. The Great Lakes, you have got it tough for the next several days -- Jessica.",

Alaska Airlines has canceled morning departures from Seattle and Portland because of icy runways there. And the FAA says ground stops are affecting airports from coast to coast.

      "sentences": "So, Jessica, in those places where we saw Polo or other colleagues -- and I'm wishing them a lot of warmth -- is that certain groups of people are more at risk. So let's talk about that and talk about what we can do about that.Infants and elderly are most at risk when it's extreme cold. They just don't maintain their body heat as well as other people do. Also, it's important to remember, if you know someone with heart disease, cold weather puts stress on the heart, so you need to be careful there. Also, cold weather aggravates asthma and other lung diseases. So even if your asthma is under control, and you're doing fine, the cold weather could make it much worse. Make sure you have your medicines at hand. So, what can we do about this? So, first of all, dress infants warmly, a little warmer than you would dress yourself, for example. Also, check in on older people. If you know some older people who are at home alone, check in on them. Make sure they have heat. Make sure they're OK. Also, avoid alcohol and caffeine. I know that's kind of disappointing, because those can be two very nice types of warm drinks. But the alcohol and the caffeine inhibits your body's ability to deal with the cold -- Jessica.",

The long-awaited final report from the January 6 Committee dropped overnight. And this 845-page document is based on more than 1,000 interviews and stacks of phone records. But the panel summed it up in these two simple lines that I will read to you -- quote -- \"The central cause of January 6 was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed. None of the events of January 6 would have happened without him.\" Let's talk more about this with CNN's Paula Reid and former assistant special Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman. Great to see you both. Thanks for being here. Paula, let's start with you. A lot of these bombshells that are in here were already presented by the Select Committee during the hearings that we all watched. But walk us through the new tidbits that are in this final report.",

      "sentences": "Jess, I was surprised by how much new information they included in this report.Their big conclusion is, of course, they were laying the blame for January 6 squarely at the feet of the former president. And then they use this nearly 850-page report to make the case. And they begin their presentation before Election Day. They argued that this attempt to falsely declare victory was premeditated. They said this started before Election Day. And they present evidence, including e-mails from a conservative group, saying that, yes, Trump should just declare victory no matter what the outcome of the election was. Then they move forward past Election Day, showing this pressure campaign on different states where Trump lost, but where they still had GOP-led legislatures. And they reveal, from their investigation, they have learned that the former president and his associates engaged in over 200 attempts to pressure state officials to change the election outcome. And the committee lays out how they believe these false claims that were being pushed by the former president and his associates are part of what spurred his supporters to the Capitol, where violence, of course, broke out. And then they detail what was happening at the White House as the Capitol was under attack. They say the president watched this on TV and resisted calls from his own staffers to call off his supporters. And some of his own aides testified that they were appalled that, while the Capitol was under attack, he was tweeting against his own vice president, so just really a stunning picture that they lay out here, really directly attacking one of the former president's key defenses, which has always been he's not responsible, he was relying on the advice of his advisers.",

And they rely on the section of the Constitution that states that an individual who has taken an oath to support the Constitution, but has engaged in an insurrection or given aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution, can be disqualified from office. We heard the vice chairwoman of the committee, Liz Cheney, touch on this too in the committee's hearing on Monday. She believes that, based on their year-and-a-half-long investigation, the evidence that they have uncovered, that she believes there should not only be legal consequences -- they have made criminal referrals -- but also political ones. And we can see that here in one of their recommendations. They're also asking for some legislative reforms to the Electoral Count Act. That is actually, Jess, something that could potentially happen. There is support for that. They also want the lawyers who were advising the former president and who are involved in this to be held accountable.",
