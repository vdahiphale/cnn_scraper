Investigators say radios that were provided for the Secret Service by local police the day before the rally were never actually picked up. This left local law enforcement with no way to communicate with Secret Service officials before those shots rang out, leading up to this moment after the gunman was killed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, officially, the Ketchikan Airport received about 2.5 inches in a 24-hour period. But there are reports in the National Weather Service that the mountain ranges here across the Ketchikan Mountains, they're about 3,000 feet high, and they received between eight to nine inches of rainfall in roughly a 30-hour period. That's a lot of rain. And, of course, where does that rain go? Well, it travels down the slopes and sometimes it can cause these slope failures known as a landslide. They happen in all U.S. states, but it is the most steep slopes that are the most vulnerable. So if we start building our households here along the slopes of these large mountains, well, that's potentially the recipe for a disaster, especially when you get heavy rainfall in a short period of time. So what happens? The heavy rain soaks into the soil, becomes saturated. Mind you, they're below-average rainfall for this month. So it's been dry. Then they get this sudden uptick in rainfall. Eventually, gravity wins, the slope fails, and there is, of course, the landslide and mudslide that can travel over 20 miles per hour. More rain to come. Jim, the potential here for another couple of inches of another storm system enters the equation.",
