I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington.All eyes on the U.S. Supreme Court where tomorrow the justices could back it might look like, likely they're going to provide an answer on whether former president Donald Trump is eligible for Colorado's presidential ballot and therefore for other states that have raised this issue. The Constitution's 14th Amendment says that Americans who engage in insurrection are disqualified from holding future public office. The Colorado State Supreme Court ruled this applies to Trump after his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, which then led to the January 6th attack on the Capitol. But the Constitution does not spell out exactly how to enforce that ban nor does it define what qualifies as insurrection, leaving the U.S. Supreme Court now to fill those gaps. Colorado Secretary of State Jenna Griswold joins us now. Good to have you on tonight. I couldn't think of a better night to have you on given what Supreme Court watchers believe will hear tomorrow. It doesn't reveal ahead of time which opinion to expect, but there's a lot of analysis that given Super Tuesday is just 48 hours away, this will be what they decide on. What are you expecting?",

And I can tell you, I hope it's the decision and you're right, a lot of folks think that it will be the Colorado decision as to whether or not Trump has disqualified himself. I had hoped for this decision last week, the week before, because our ballots actually went out several weeks ago.And over 400,000 ballots have already been returned for the Republican presidential primary. At the end of the day, Coloradans and Americans deserve to know as they go into Super Tuesday whether Trump is a qualified candidate or not.",

They both determined that he did. And from my perspective, it's clear as day what he did. He incited that violent mob to try to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential authority. And when it comes down to it, I do not believe that the president should be above the law or above the Constitution. That's what Trump consistently argues.Section Three of the 14th Amendment has clear language. If someone swears to uphold the Constitution and then engages in insurrection, they're disqualified. Again, I think the Colorado Supreme Court got it right. Oath-breaking insurrectionists should not appear on a state's ballot if that state determines to disqualify those candidates.

Even in this presidential primary, there are candidates who have been determined disqualified in some states and so they're not on the ballot, but they're on the ballot in other states. So that's exactly how it already works in the United States and it's worked for over 100 years, at the least with election administration.And earlier, you mentioned the question of, well, what is an insurrection. I believe that the United States Supreme Court can clearly define what an insurrection is. In this case, there was a five-day trial going after that exact question. Evidence was presented. Witnesses were called from both sides, and then the Colorado Supreme Court looked at that question again. So all these terms are able to be defined if the court chooses to go down the road under, I guess, allowing states to do what we many of us believe is already within our authority executing the Constitution, protecting our ballots and our democracy from oath breakers.",

Other special elections where Democrats have looked stronger. And I talked to a guy like Tom Suozzi, that was of course George Santos' his district. So it had some problems in it, but that was plus eight for George Santos about 14 months ago and it was plus eight for a Democrat here.That's a 16-point swing in that district. So when you look at, and I know by the way, again with the proviso that some number crunchers say specials aren't indicative of actual cycle elections, do you think they are?

They are also waiting for confirmation from Hamas of the number ofPalestinian prisoners that they would demand be released from Israeli prisons in exchange for those Israeli hostages Israel and the United States say that its mainly that issue of the lack of detail about the types of Israeli hostages who would be released that is the sticking point preventing negotiations for moving forward. But Hamas sees it differently. A senior Hamas source telling us that they see the sticking points as Israel refusing so far to agree to a pathway for a permanent ceasefire. Questions about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. And also this question of the return of displaced Palestinians back to northern Gaza. But amid all of these negotiations, the back-and-forth, the questions about the progress were also getting a clearer picture of the dire humanitarian situation inside of Gaza, particularly in the northern Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Ministry of Health saying on Sunday that 15 children have now died of malnutrition and dehydration, several of those in just the last few days. In (INAUDIBLE) Hospital in northern Gaza says that they fear for the lives of six more children, say that they could also soon face the same fate if urgent action is not taken to change the picture. Now, multiple countries, including the United States working to increase the amount of aid getting into Gaza. We saw the U.S. yesterday carrying out airdrops, 66 bundles of aid containing 38,000 meals dropped from three different U.S. military aircraft yesterday alone. That may sound like a lot. It's really a drop in the bucket compared to the enormous humanitarian need in Gaza right now. Those airdrops, they are costly. They are inefficient.

He also needs to shore up his support among people who are more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause in general.

We need to remember that in our past, in our history the French aided us, for example, in the American Revolution and they did it at the most dangerous time for us, we almost lost that war. People don't realize, they don't think about that. The Ukrainians had an even better chance to, at least when, or at least make it a much more even contest with American aid. Now, we are pulling that away from them, and if we don't provide aid to them, it is like pulling out the rug from under them and that's really the most dangerous situation because now, not only is there going to be a consequence on the battlefield, but there could be significant political and diplomatic consequences for not only Ukraine, but also for Europe.",
