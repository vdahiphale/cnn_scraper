Hello, I'm Julia Chatterley in New York, and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Israel. Tonight, one of the hostages freed by Hamas is offering a dramatic account of her time in captivity. Yocheved Lifshitz, pictured here on the left, spoke Tuesday in Tel Aviv, less than 24 hours after she and Nurit Cooper were released. Lifshitz described her violent kidnapping on October 7th. She was taken to Gaza and forced into underground network of tunnels. She said her guards made sure that she was fed, however, and she received medical care. Now during the news conference, she also criticized the Israeli government for failing to protect her community. Bianca Nobilo has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LIFSHITZ (through translator): \"It was a hell I could not have known.\" BIANCA NOBILO, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): An 85- year-old grandmother, one of the two Israeli hostages released by Hamas Monday night, expressed anger towards her government for not taking the Hamas threat seriously in the weeks leading up to the horror of October the 7th. LIFSHITZ (through translator): \"The lack of awareness by Shin Bet and IDF hurt us a lot. They were warned three weeks beforehand. They burnt fields. They sent fire balloons, and the IDF did not treat it seriously.\" NOBILO (voice over): Safely reunited with her daughter, Yocheved Lifshitz detailed the horror that unfolded in her home in southern Israel. LIFSHITZ (through translator): All of a sudden on Saturday morning, everything was very quiet. There was a hard pounding on the settlement. I was kidnapped on a motorbike on my side while they were driving towards Gaza in the field. NOBILO (voice over): The ensuing two weeks, she was held hostage in Hamas' secretive network of underground tunnels. Upon her release, her testimony of the traumatic ordeal extraordinary, from horror to displays of humanity from her captors. LIFSHITZ (through translator): When we got there, they told us they believed in the Quran and would not harm us, and that they would give us the same conditions that they had inside the tunnels. For each of us, there was a guard. They took care of every detail. There were a lot of women and they knew about feminine hygiene, and they took care of everything there. NOBILO (voice over): She was released alongside her female neighbor, but her husband remains held in Gaza. Her freedom, a relief from Yocheved's daughter and a glimmer of hope for the families whose loved ones who remain as hostages under Hamas. Her experience now a potentially critical insight into a Hamas' spiderweb of tunnels and their behaviors, planning, and objectives of a group, which shocked the world with their capabilities, preparedness, and brutality on October the 7th.

Exactly to this point, hospitals are hours away of running out of electricity, which provide life-sustaining systems for newborns and for health care emergencies to be performed. Now, what are we hearing on the ground? We're hearing -- we've heard testimonies from pregnant women in Gaza. Let me share one with you. A pregnant woman who was displaced four times from her home and the very shelters in which she was walking between, every step she is taking as moving between these places with vast insecurity, she is saying, quote, \"Each step felt like a race against death.\" Now when she -- when we've heard from another testimony of another pregnant woman who managed to make those dreadful journeys and managed to find her way to Al-Shifa Medical Hospital, which features on a number of these reports, the biggest health care facility in Gaza. And what she described was after being able to get there and be able to summon that strength to get to Al-Shifa Medical Hospital, after three hours after giving birth, she had to be discharged and had to make way for another pregnant women who had to come in, as well as the huge amounts of wounded people. So the challenges that not only the pregnant women, but the Gazan population are facing is huge, including the medical staff because we also hear from medical staff, midwives that Al-Shifa Hospital as well describing the dire, dire conditions. And this comes back to your earlier point. You asked about fuel and how important fuel is to be able to sustain these life-sustaining systems. But it's not only about water, pregnant women need more water than a regular person. And the conditions there are deeply, deeply worrying. Usually, on a regular day, it's recommended 15 liters of water for hygiene and consumption purposes. Usually, about three liters per day that a human should drink. Pregnant women needs more, needs another 300 milliliters. Lactating women, so one of these pregnant women who gives birth, has to sustain the life of her child through breastfeeding, requires even more. And so the challenges right now are ensuring a safe and steady flow of aid can come in with food, water, medical products, and fuel being a key issue at the moment.",

That may make some more moderate Republicans try to initiate some kind of action with Democrats to get the temporary speaker, who is currently in place, the powers to pass legislation. Tom McHenry is the name of the temporary speaker. But that is probably going to be subject to legal challenges. There are many Republicans who cannot stomach the idea that their majority will effectively be handed over to Democrats, who are in the majority -- in the minority and their minority -- the majority that they won in the midterm elections will basically be completely inoperable.
