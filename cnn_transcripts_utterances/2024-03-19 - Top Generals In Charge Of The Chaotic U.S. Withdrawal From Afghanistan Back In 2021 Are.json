Was there a comprehensive plan at that time to both withdraw absolutely every one of our servicemen, because that was  the promise Trump had made to the American people, while withdrawing in an organized way with no American casualties? Was there a complete plan ready to go at that time?",

That's everything from food and building barracks and uniforms and boots, to include equipment over 20 years. And then he cites, I think it's $7.2 billion, of military equipment, U.S.-manufactured military equipment that is with the Afghan security forces. That's Afghan-owned equipment, not American equipment. Every piece of American equipment that the American military owned came out with us with Scott Miller, or he destroyed it on sight.

      "sentences": "All right, we are watching the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which obviously was a disaster as it happened in the summer of 2021. But we're seeing this devolve, obviously, into a political event. And I guess that's not surprising here in an election year. Let's bring in someone who really knows the story of the entire war, retired Army Colonel Liam Collins. He is a former Green Beret who served in Afghanistan, including in the month following the September 11th attacks. He's also the co-author of Understanding Urban Warfare. And Colonel, you've been watching the hearing. I just wonder, you know, what your observations are of what you've heard so far.COL. LIAM COLLINS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Yeah, I mean, and as Representative Meek said, right, the call to leave Afghanistan was correct. But the manner in which Biden decided to do it was clearly flawed. And as pointed out, right, he didn't follow the advice of his military professionals who recommended leaving 2,500 forces on the ground, right? We still have forces in Germany, in Korea. We have special operations training militaries around the world. So this request was not, you know, it was based on past precedents. But if you examine the military's 20-year history in Afghanistan, it's professional military advice is extremely suspect. So it's understandable why Biden might be hesitant to follow that advice. And as I think it was, Meek's also pointed out, that really, they're focusing on the last six months as they should be. But really, what set the stage is a 20-year history for what happened during the exit. So you definitely have to do a broader look to understand the exit itself.",

      "sentences": "I think the biggest picture really, like I said, was set way back in 2002, 2003, 2004, when the U.S. made a decision, right? We had political and military leaders that didn't understand the history, the polity, the culture, the social structure of Afghanistan. So creating a strong central government, having a large conventional presence in Afghanistan, leading operations for far too long, right? And then building a strong national army when you needed local security. That kind of set the stage for what you had. And then, yeah, once you get to it, yeah, clearly was not planned and executed properly. But I think you've got to look at the underlying conditions that kind of set that stage. KEILARAnd that's what a president has to deal with, which is he was going to bring the troops out of Afghanistan. And he was tasked, his administration was tasked with figuring out how to do it.  When you look at what happened there in August of 2021, you know, as you pinpoint how this could have gone more smoothly. It seems here as they're talking to the military, they're really zeroing in on the State Department for culpability. What do you think about what you're hearing there?",

I mean, that's what you're going to get if you if you have the State Department in here, they're probably going to point the finger as somebody said, the Defense Department. But, you know, so, you know, the finger pointing, you can go back and forth all day. But clearly, there was not a good plan, whether that was the military's fault or State Department's fault. It's clear that there wasn't a good a good plan for this scenario, or the or the call was made at much too late of a date.And so those obviously led to the conditions, right, as they said, right, having too small of a presence in country that, you know, had to then come into security airfield and conduct that noncombatant evacuation operation. And anytime you got to conduct, you know, usually it's under duress, right? Usually, those don't happen in advance, and things go badly, and it went very badly. But, again, you know, to keep in mind why some people might not have been able to forecast it or understand it, despite the intelligence. The Taliban is not a sophisticated, sophisticated foe, right? This government just collapsed in the face of a foe that's not a sophisticated or, you know, they could have clearly defeated the Taliban, if they had any will to fight whatsoever. And so, you know, I think we have to look to Ukraine, and that's a nation that's fighting what many have ranked as the second most powerful nation in the world, and fighting toe-to-toe with them because they have the will. But we had partners there that had absolutely no will and no stake in their own governance. So it's tough to be successful in those circumstances.",

McCaul was calling for documents to be released to Congress to further that investigation.

KENNETH MCKENZIE, FORMER CENTCOM COMMANDER: Staying, keeping 2,500 beyond. We thought it needed to be coupled with an aggressive negotiation program with the Taliban, one that perhaps had a few more sticks and not all carrots. So I think you needed to change your approach to negotiation if you decided to stay. We'll never know. You'll never know. I think I agree with General Milley. It's very possible that we could have been fighting the Taliban, but that's just a counterfactual. that we won't know the answer to. REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Okay, thank you. On the issue of a NEO, I actually was one of those voices that joined you and called for an earlier NEO, and it was something that I thought would have been better and could have led to a smoother evacuation, but not a perfectly clean one. Because NEOs are hard. And one thing I want to talk about is this issue of who we evacuate, right? You talked about getting accounts on U.S. citizens, but the simple fact of the matter is the United States nowhere, wherever, requires its citizens to register with the State Department.
