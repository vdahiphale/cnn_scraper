Special Counsel Jack Smith charged him in the classified documents probe in June. He had that Manhattan grand jury charging the former president for business fraud back in March. And just listen to what Special Counsel Jack Smith had to say tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACK SMITH, SPECIAL COUNSEL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: The attack on our nation's capital on January 6th, 2021 was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy. As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies. Lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the U.S. government, the nation's process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election.

      "sentences": "Well, the biggest thing that stands out to me is that the former president is the only one being charged today. This is something that our reporting over the past several weeks had suggested to us, but we were quite surprised that he would be the only one charged, at least initially at this point, because he clearly did not act alone, right?You look at the charges that he's facing right now, three of them involve a conspiracy, where obviously he would need someone else. And throughout this indictment, they lay out exactly how he worked with others to amplify what he knew were false claims of election fraud to litigate this strategy, to pressure various states, to pressure his own vice president. And then, of course, on the day of January 6th, he continued to pressure his vice president, resulted in violence, and then he and his supporters continued to double down to try to use this as an opportunity to overturn the election. Again, he was not operating in a silo. So, really watching going forward to see if any of these six co- conspirators will be formally charged. The other thing, one of the other two things that stood out to me, is that we didn't get a lot of new information. We got some new details from like the vice president's handwritten notes, some interactions with political advisors we weren't privy to prior. But given how much additional information that Jack Smith was able to obtain, you know, he got access to Mark Meadows, Vice President Pence, I was expecting that we would learn even more. So, it will be interesting to see if the special counsel releases additional details going forward. But speaking of releasing details, we did get the indictment today. We didn't have to wait until the initial appearance. We didn't have to wait a few days. The country, the world gets to see the case today and they don't have to wait. I think that is significant and that's something we've been lobbying the special counsel to do.",

Yes, the special counsel said that. But we know what they're up to. They're continuing to talk to witnesses, witnesses like former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. He worked very closely with Rudy Giuliani in his efforts to find fraud, to allege fraud. And then one of the other witnesses, at least one of them, is a former Trump lawyer. So, they will continue to gather evidence. It is unclear, though, if there will be superseding indictment and additional charges.",

Through context clues and our own reporting, we have identified five of the six people that are described in this indictment.And if you followed along during the January 6 Committee hearings, none of these names really will come as a surprise. They include people like Trump's former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney John Eastman, and even people like Jeffrey Clark, the former DOJ official who we know has tried to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election. Those details, some of them are included in this indictment. Like Paula said, a lot of this information was publicly known, which is how we were able to identify in part some of these folks. But the unidentified person is described as a political consultant who helped implement what is really a central theme in this indictment, the fake electors plot. This is really one of the cornerstones of Jack Smith's case here. He says that Trump and these six individuals tried effectively to trick these electors in these seven states to sign these certificates, asserting that they were the legitimate electors, and to send them to the National Archives and to Congress with the idea that Pence could then use them and overturn the election on January 6th. We don't know the identity of this sixth individual yet, but I'm sure we'll come back with that shortly.",

And that word unindicted, the modifier is not present, right? They're just listed as co-conspirators.So, you know, there's nothing in this indictment that is not purposeful. So, that word is not in there on purpose. So, it could mean they're going to be charged. It could mean perhaps they already have had indictments handed up. We just don't know. Do you have any clarity on this? COHEN: Erin, like you said, there could be a number of reasons, including what Jack Smith told us today when we spoke publicly, which is a rare occasion, but he said they're still investigating. And as Paula noted, we know from our reporting that they still have witness interviews lined up, including with former New York City commissioner, Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, who can shed some light on these efforts to find alleged -- you know, find evidence of voter fraud. But I think the strongest indication is that this investigation is still ongoing.

That requires a prosecutor to prove intent to use force. There was evidence of that against the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. We looked very hard for evidence that the president was in communication with or somehow was aware of their plans or their actions, and we weren't able to establish it. It doesn't mean it isn't there, we just weren't able to establish it. The special counsel has not either. Otherwise, you would have seen a seditious conspiracy count. He is -- you're not going to issue an indictment of absent proof well beyond a reasonable doubt in a case of this magnitude, and I'm not surprised at all that he chose obstruction of the official proceeding. Doesn't require any intent to use violence but rather in terms to obstruct, interfere or impede the joint session. We found that, and he has only gotten more evidence since then.",

So, for instance, seditious conspiracy, you'd have to prove some agreement to use force or threats to prevent, hinder or delay the execution of American law.
