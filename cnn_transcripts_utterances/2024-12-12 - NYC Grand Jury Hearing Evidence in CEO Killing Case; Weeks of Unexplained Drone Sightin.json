That doesn't appear to be the case here at all.He certainly seems to have had his eye on the healthcare sector to some degree. His comments about the earnings of UnitedHealthcare may be making them a target, but it doesn't seem that he had any specific animus for Brian Thompson specifically. But maybe he was drawn to him more because of his role in this large, profitable health insurance company. As for the rest of the picture, there's really a lot we don't know about his motive. Now, a lot of that isn't' necessary for the prosecution. You don't have to prove motive as an element of this crime of murder. You just have to prove that he did it intentionally. The video goes a long way to proving that in and of itself. But I think to adequately assess the threat of this sort of violence targeting people like Brian Thompson or other CEOs or other corporate representatives, I think it's important that we understand as much as we can about this person's progression towards this very distinctive act of political violence, essentially, is what this was, even though we don't think of it as like traditionally Democrat-Republican politics.

It was Travis Timmerman from Missouri. We know that he told some journalists and people who went to the scene that he had been held in a prison for seven months. He said that he did not experience any bad treatment during that time, which is very different, obviously, from the accounts that we saw in this piece that we just watched now. The U.S. government has said that it is now trying to get him out of the country. They're not giving any details as to how they are doing that or what route they are taking. But still, clearly, a lot of people, particularly the family of Austin Tice, waiting desperately for some more news as to his whereabouts. He was taken in 2012, captured by the regime.
