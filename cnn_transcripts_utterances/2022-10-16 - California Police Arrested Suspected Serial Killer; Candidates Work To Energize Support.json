Thanks so much, Jasmine.Let's get some insight now with CNN political analyst and historian at Princeton University, Julian Zelizer. Julian, appreciate you sharing part of your Sunday morning with us. Let's start where Jasmine picked up, the conversation about President Biden focusing on the issue of abortion. Some feel that Democrats are ignoring the economy. Bernie Sanders actually issued a warning to Democrats who he believes are leaning too heavily into the issue of abortion. Here is part of something he wrote in \"The Guardian\" -- quote -- \"It would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.\" Julian, how do Democrats run on the economy, when even the best assessments point to a very murky outlook?",

I think there's good reason politically to focus on other kinds of problems, including reproductive rights, but I don't think Senator Sanders is wrong. The economy is out there, the conditions are not great, and voters want to hear from Democrats what are they going to do, how will they make it better. And they also need to hear Democratic voters, a defense in terms of what's the connection between President Biden's policies and inflation or where other factors are at work. So not talking about it doesn't make it better, but there's also room to try to bring in other issues to soften the blow. SANCHEZ",

There's also several mobile bathrooms and showers and laundry units that are here on the site.Now, this place is designed to only house 500 single adults, and it's supposed to be a temporary solution for what the mayor has described as a crisis. Over the last several months the city has processed 19,400 migrants through its Department of Homeless Services and the mayor says that the city is running out of space. So this is supposed to be a temporary solution. It will house 500 single adults for what is supposed to be only a couple days. Now when it comes to families, they will be housed at a hotel in midtown, up to 200 families will be housed there, as they get connected to services and legal resources and figure out what they're doing as they go through this asylum process. Some of them will stay here in New York. Others may want to go elsewhere. But, as I said, the mayor has described this as a crisis. He has asked for federal help and there's no clear indication that that's going to happen so far. He says he expects the numbers to continue to increase and migrants to continue to come into the city, so this is just one of the temporary solutions that the city has come up with as they continue to grapple with the influx of migrants into the city.

We know that at least one of them was about five miles away from the river where these bodies were found. So, officers were not planning on searching the area near the river. This was not in the path of that cell phone data. But look, whether they treat it as one case, two cases, or they eventually connect the dots, there are still a lot of questions. We want to know what happened on Sunday night. How did these bodies end up in the river? Is there other people involved in all of this? So, of course, questions that we continue to ask authorities.

She -- the bill actually is for the period in which the city of Jackson was under a boil water advisory in which the water, you couldn't drink it, you couldn't take a bath in it, you couldn't take a shower in it. It was not safe.And Virginia has reached out to the city for answers. She's hoping to get some help with paying the bill and she is still waiting to hear back. And she's not the only resident who was in his boat right now. I spoke with several residents who say that their bills have come in in September and October extremely high and they are just frustrated. And just hoping for answers and hoping to get some help. Keep in mind. Jackson is a predominantly Black city and about a quarter of the residents live in poverty. You can only imagine how hard that must be for someone who's already struggling to make ends meet to get a $4,000 water bill.",

Coy Wire is here with this morning's \"BLEACHER REPORT.\" Hi, Coy!COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good morning. October surprises not just for politics. Saturdays in October rock. And this was one of the best we've seen in a long time. Let's start with the baseball playoffs with a 111-win Dodgers are headed home after just four playoff games. LA had won all six series they played against the Padres in the regular season but San Diego taking the one that counts. Padres were down three zip but they rally the score five runs in the seventh. Jake Cronenworth' two-run single giving them the lead for good. So, when Josh Hader says see you later to Freddie Freeman and the Dodgers, the ninth inning, it was on. San Diego with a five-three win. It's their first trip to the national championship series in 24 years. So. break out the bubbly and don't forget your bubble goggles. And if you had the Padres facing the Phillies in the NLCS, pat yourself on the back. Philly taking down the defending champion Braves thanks to some history from J.T. Realmuto. He's the first catcher the hit an inside-the-park homer in a playoff game. Running 23 miles per hour, he finished the base path in 14 seconds. Phillies cruise to an 8-3 win. They'll now go to San Diego to face the Padres in the NLCS starting Tuesday. To the American League where the mariners were hosting their first playoff game in 21 years. And it felt like we'd need 21 years for this game to end. It was scoreless through 17 innings, 42 batters struck out, both are postseason records. This one goes to the eighteenth. Tied for the most in a postseason game, but Houston's Jeremy Pena hits a homerun giving the Astros the eventual game-winner. Houston wins ones that sweep in this series. The game last is six hours, 22 minutes. The third longest playoff game in history. Finally, Knoxville turned into Rockville, a sea of oranges. Number six Tennessee host number three Alabama Tide and were down 28-10 at one point but rise back to take a 49-42 lead. But with over three minutes to go, Tennessee's Jalen Hurd led to six, also his fifth touchdown of the day, a new school record, tying it at 49 So, it comes down to the kickers. 21 seconds to go, Alabama's Will Reichard, his surefire game winner sails wide right, but no overtime needed. With 15 seconds to go, Vols quarterback Hendon Hooker fires two passes for 45 yards, setting up Chase McGrath. The 40-yard knuckleball is good. The sea of orange now storming the field 52-49, the final, Tennessee's first win over Alabama in 15 seasons. The 52 points, that is the most given up by the tide since 1907. So, down come the goalposts and the fans take these things on a journey. They go through the tunnel, out of the stadium, into the streets of Knoxville, and eventually, into the Tennessee River for the best victory bath he could ever get. How about this? Syracuse Orange though, Boris, beating number 14 NC State coach has the Orange win six and O for the first time in 35 years. You were like 1-year-old at the time, bro.",
