And so what they're going to see, the people here in this crowd, is basically an outline of what he plans to address here in Iowa. But what you're going to hear the details of is him going into each one of those living rooms, trying to get into cafes, shake people's hands. Will all of this work? Well, we wandered the crowd talking to some people, and they say -- the people who have already shook his hand and spent the time to get to know Pence the person, they believe that this Midwest connection could work. But, of course, Boris, there are people here who say that they are loyal to Trump and that they can't be moved. So, again, as you point out, he has his work cut out for him.

At one point yesterday, New York City topped the list for the world's worst air pollution. Today, New Yorkers can barely make out the city skyline. Just check this out. Philadelphia just issued a code red air quality warning, urging all residents to stay indoors. Even here in Washington, we are feeling the hazy effects. Let's get to CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray on this story. It is something to look outside. It's really inescapable. How long are we expecting this to go on?",

Canada's still early in their fire season. And it has just exploded. So while some days might be better than others, this could be a problem we're talking about long term. We're looking at current visibility in New York City. It's been less than a mile at some points today. We could actually see ground stops for some of the big airports today because of the thick smoke. It is just coming in from Canada, just blanketing all of the Northeast, New England, all the way down to the mid-Atlantic, even down to the Carolinas getting in on the smoke. This is a live look at New York City, and you can see barely making out the buildings in the distance. So, if you're living there, you're definitely dealing with some poor air quality. And this involves a lot of areas up and down the I-95 Corridor, even up into Upstate New York, of course, closer to the fires, where we're dealing with very unhealthy air quality. So people that are specially sensitive, have respiratory problems, things like that, should definitely stay indoors, because it's incredibly unhealthy air quality. Look at that, Toronto and New York City topping the top five lists for the worst air quality in the world. So this is definitely significant. And what's causing all of this is basically this weather pattern that we're just stuck it. We have an area of high pressure off to the northwest, and it's channeling these winds out of the north and just bringing the smoke in day after day. And so until this big weather pattern decides to shift and we get a change in wind direction, the smoke is going to stick around. And so, unfortunately, with this weather pattern we're stuck in, as I mentioned, while some days might be better than others, we are going to be dealing with this long term. And it's not just going to be for the Northwest and Northeast. We're looking at places in the Ohio Valley. The Midwest has had huge problems with the smoke as well. So, the short-term forecast looks like this. You can see today we're in the worst of it across portions of the Northeast. We might get a little bit of a break, but it is going to be pushing farther into Washington, D.C., as we get into tomorrow morning. And then another wave of it comes a little bit farther to the West, so giving some of the big cities in the Northeast or break, Brianna, but as I mentioned, making places a little bit farther to the West worse. So, it's just going to be back and forth, I think, for the long term, the foreseeable future, really.",

Then everybody comes out of the theater to this park, Monroe Park. And police say that there were hundreds of people in this park at the time of the shooting. At that point, they say that the shooting took place right around here in this corner. We will walk you over here because they have got a memorial to the victims here. Some people have laid flowers down here. We did see from amateur video two people on the ground being tended to by first responders, right at about these spots right here, right there on the gray stones here and on the red brick right there. Also, police say that the suspect, Amari Pollard, fled on foot and didn't get far. This is the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University.

There was a moment in early 2020 when Budowich was among the people that talk to Trump out of or cast some doubt on Trump's willingness or wish to put out a public statement saying that he had turned over everything in his possession to the National Archives. Of course, Jim at that time, he had not, but we don't know much else at this time about exactly what went on in the jury room. We do know though, that Taylor Budowich has described it publicly on social media. He said today, after his testimony concluded today: \"In what can only be described as a bogus and deeply troubling effort to use the power of the government to get Trump, I fulfilled a legal obligation to testify in front of a federal grand jury.
