It is now just after six in the morning. The streets are quiet now. But anxiety gripped the city on Saturday after the Wagner Group mercenaries marched towards Moscow. Amidst brokered that the deal brought an abrupt end to the uprising. And the whereabouts of the Wagner Group head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is now unknown. Prigozhin, the Prigozhin's news service tells CNN he will answer questions when he has, quote, proper communication. One thing is clear, the insurrection marks the most serious threat we've seen to Putin's rule. And the U.S. Secretary of State says he doesn't think the turmoil is over.

Many Russians see them as heroes, not as the traitors the Kremlin paints them. And Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has become a celebrity too. Watch his supporters hailed down his car just to shake hands. The Kremlin says he's now moving to Belarus next door, but it's unclear if this is the last we'll see it in. What is definite, though, is a sense of relief, at least here in the Russian capital. It's calm now, but in the mayhem of the weekend, Moscow was on high alert. Military checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, residents bracing for Wagner fighters to enter and for the confrontation that never came. It was really uneasy yesterday, says Andre [ph]. But look now, people are walking in the streets and it's all good. Let's hope it will stay peaceful, he adds. But even here, the sympathy for Prigozhin's unprecedented challenge is tirades against the conduct of the war in Ukraine appears to have struck a popular chord. I think it was an expression of an opinion, says Olek [ph], another resident of Moscow. And opinion of a powerful person who wants some justice and clarity. The belief Prigozhin should be listened to is widely shared here. But that's not what the Kremlin wants to hear. Vladimir Putin hasn't appeared in public since making his angry pledge on Saturday. Filmed behind the scenes by state television to punish those responsible for what he called an armed mutiny, the biggest challenge to his authority in 23 years of power. But now that challenge has been maimed. There are growing concerns about what a defensive President Putin stung by the events of this weekend will do next to stay in power.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The abrupt ending to Yevgeny Prigozhin's march on Moscow was sooner and less violent than U.S. national security. And intelligence officials expected. The U.S. official tells CNN that they assess that there would be a lot of fighting and bloodshed as Wagner forces pushed up from southern Russia toward Moscow. Instead, there is very little resistance from Russia's army, security services and others and Wagner troops are well on their way to the capitol before Prigozhin shockingly called the advanced to a halt and ordered his troops to turn around. A deal supposedly brokered by Belarus, also surprising the U.S. But the insurrection itself was predicted by the U.S. intelligence community, according to multiple sources speaking to CNN. Movement and buildup of Wagner troop's equipment and weapons was observed by analysts and a rebellion was believed to be coming soon. Intelligence officials briefed the Gang of Eight in Congress, the leaders of both chambers from both parties as well as the head of the intelligence committees.

Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mikhail Podolyak, said in an interview, he was hoping for something more concrete, perhaps a civil war in Russia. He said he was still confident that will eventually happen. While attention was diverted away from the front, the fighting went on. Sunday, Ukrainian officials claimed their forces had seized a kilometer -- a kilometer stretch of trenches near Bakhmut. They said they killed wounded or captured an entire battalion. Though they didn't give exact numbers. It was a limited tactical success. The much anticipated counter offensive has yet to hit its stride. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Zaporizhzhia.

But they took heavy losses in trying to take Bakhmut.I think that the issue of in terms of how the war goes for Russia from here on in is to what extent the Russian rank and file and the junior officer corps within the Russian military lose faith and confidence in the senior Russian military leadership, firstly, and secondly, in Putin's leadership, and whether they continue to want to fight this war. It could be that you have a lot of conscripts that are poorly trained and basically thrown into the frontlines as cannon fodder that are sitting there and thinking, why are we even doing this? Why are we here? If the -- not only the President is not prepared to stand firm, but also the Russian military leadership is incompetent, then you could see mass desertions, you could see mutinies and unwillingness of the part of the rank and file to follow orders.

There was a decree by the Russian defense minister, a couple of weeks ago, where he said that all of the private military companies needed to have contracts with the Russian army if they wanted to operate in the future. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner private military company had always said if they were not going to do that, and that was, of course, also one of the things that escalated the feud between Prigozhin and the Russian military leadership. But all this is about a lot more than that. The private military company, Wagner, is one thing. But Yevgeny Prigozhin owns a lot more than that. He has media holdings, so like, for instance, the Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin was indicted for that. What happens to his media empire? Then, of course, there's all his dealings in the Middle East, oil fields in Syria, in Africa, exploiting things like gold and diamonds also training local forces there. So there are definitely still a lot of questions about whether or not the Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he goes to exile in Belarus, will retain any sort of control over that, or if other solutions will be found by the Russian leadership.

The Australian government doesn't take any chances, not just on its own national security but, of course, because Australia is a member of the intelligence sharing network, Five Eyes, that also includes the U.S., U.K., Canada, and New Zealand. So Australia is privy to some of the West's top secrets and needs to protect them.So when Australia's own spy agency informed the Australian government that there was a hive of spies working in Canberra, posing as diplomats back in February, the Australian government expelled them immediately. Now, the Australian government didn't break protocol by accusing Russia of running this spy ring. But that is what was established by local media reported widely at the time. So it was that -- those spy agencies, the Australian ones that this time advised the Australian government that the build of a Russian diplomatic compound, a stone's throw, as it was described from Australia's Parliament House, was a national security threat. And the Australian government again moved quickly last week legislating to give them the power to evict Russia from the site. The Russians reacted badly. They called Australia Russophobic. And they took the matter to the High Court. Today, the High Court said that Australia did have the right to evict Russia. Here is some of what the Australian Prime Minister had to say today. He mentioned this squatter who since last week, has refused to leave the site. He has diplomatic immunity again. So here's what Anthony Albanese had to say earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
