      "sentences": "Well, that's one of the major questions, and it's why half of this equation, of course, does rely on the Israeli government, on what Netanyahu decides following the killing of Yahya Sinwar. But, another part of it is going to depend on who actually succeeds Sinwar, and whether there is actually somebody on the other side who is willing to make a deal. We know, of course, that Sinwar's brother, Mohammed Sinwar, has been closely involved in directing Hamas' military activities in Gaza. He is not necessarily viewed as someone who could kind of take on the political helm of Hamas, but of course, he is in Gaza.And the other slew of potential contenders to replace Sinwar as the ultimate head of Hamas are largely outside of the Gaza Strip. You have Khaled Meshaal, for example, Mousa Abu Marzouk, the Deputy Chief of Hamas' Political Bureau. And then there is another figure who is very important to keep in mind here, and that is Khalil Al-Hayya, who has been deeply involved in the ceasefire and hostage negotiations. He is based in Qatar. He has had extensive engagements with the mediators over these negotiations. He is certainly someone who the United States believes could be someone they could deal with in terms of actually striking a ceasefire and hostage deal. But, again, he is outside of Gaza. And so, it's going to be interesting to see how Hamas kind of reorganizes itself, where they choose to put the power in terms of leadership. But, in the meantime, there is a very real risk of chaos in the ranks of Hamas putting the lives of the hostages at risk. It is something that Israeli officials have raised with me as a concern that they have for the lives of the hostages. What will the captors of these hostages do in the absence of a clear kind of leadership, a clear direction for where this is all headed, and could they potentially also be inclined to take revenge actions by killing the hostages in the wake of Sinwar's death? These are some real-time questions that Israeli officials are posing themselves right now. I do think it will certainly take some days, if not weeks, before we actually get a sense of what the leadership of Hamas actually looks like, and the likelihood that some kind of a deal could be struck.",

He does not want a deal. And everyone is trying, in the last 24 hours or so, to make this an opportunity, to define this as an inflection point. Jeremy Diamond did. Even I did earlier or yesterday on another show on this channel.But, the truth of the matter is that Mr. Netanyahu never had political goals, which is why, assuming he has achieved them, is wrong. He never had coherent, attainable political goals for Gaza, Omar. Now, furthermore, in his mind, this is not a war against Hamas in Gaza, but this is now a war on three fronts, conceivably even for, in Gaza, in south Lebanon, bilaterally and directly with Iran. And the fourth possible front would be in the West Bank. So, assuming that we will pursue a ceasefire and a hostage deal in Gaza, separate from all other theaters, I think is a wrong assumption.",

Now we're stuck with a situation in which he has been killed for good reasons and justifiable reasons, as were Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and his -- and Sinwar's deputy Mohammed Deif in southern Gaza, as for that matter was Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, but that's a different opera altogether. But, all three of these were assassinated by Israel, again, justifiably, and they deserve their faith.Notwithstanding, there are still anywhere between 75 and 100 hostages in Gaza. We assume -- we have to assume that all of them are alive, although we are realists and assume -- and have to also assume that maybe just half are alive. We don't know who, we don't know where, and now we're stuck with Hamas that has been splintering and will continue to splinter into little terrorist gangs roaming around Gaza, each owning, quote, unquote, \"a number of hostages\".

But, of course, he was in the air, in Air Force One when he got word of the killing of Yahya Sinwar, which I think the President hopes, and he has certainly said that he hopes, could change the dynamic in the Middle East, could change the dynamic in Gaza as well, because, of course, there is calls in the United States, there is calls internationally to try and get some sort of ceasefire going.And I thought it was quite interesting. But, of course, the first -- well, one of the first phone calls the U.S. President made was to the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, to congratulate him on the killing of Yahya Sinwar, but then also to say that he hopes that this could be a step forward to an improvement of the situation, possibly even a ceasefire, because we know that that war is obviously taking a massive toll on the civilian population in Gaza, but at the same time, is also a big problem for the Biden administration as well, as so far, they really haven't come to terms with trying to support Israel, on the one hand, but then also trying to set the conditions for the civilian population of Gaza to be protected from the worst things that that war brings with it, of course, the violence, but then also, of course, the lack of supply for so many people who are on the ground there, Omar.",

There is Secretary of State Antony Blinken from the United States. And Fred, I'm curious, I know you've been traveling all across the region, including to Iran as well, but I'm curious if, in preparation for last week's meeting, if the dynamics, whether on the German side, UK side or otherwise, changed at all when they were going to now meet the President, given this latest news?

Six witnesses have now testified to police. So, that will feed into the prosecutor's report. And of course, there will be a toxicology report and substances that were seized in the hotel room.This death is really resonating with people all over the world. Liam Payne wasn't just famous. He was someone who people really watched grow up from a very young age. He first went on X Factor when he was just 14-years-old, and people very much felt that they rode the success of One Direction, the band, and saw them, of course, through many years as they were all teenagers becoming adult men. The tributes are incredible, one, from the band, One Direction, the former band says, \"We are completely devastated by the news of Liam's passing. In time, and when everyone is able to, there will be more to say. But for now, we will take some time to grieve and process the loss of our brother, who we love dearly. The memories we shared with him will be treasured forever. We love you, Liam.\" Now, Liam Payne had been very vocal about his issues around substance abuse, about his mental health. This was something people were aware of, and that's also feeding into the story, could more have been done for Liam and sort of the other young pop stars, I suppose, in recent years and currently? Can more be done to protect them as they rise to fame? Liam once famously said that, as One Direction became more famous, in an interview, he said that, actually, to secure the band members, they just kind of kept them in their rooms and hotels.

Now, the group has confirmed Sinwar is dead, killed, apparently by Israel in Gaza on Wednesday, and this new video shows what the Israel Defense Forces says is the moment IDF troops fired on the building where Sinwar was hiding. Now, the killing of Sinwar, who was the chief architect of the brutal October 7th attacks, was a big step toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated goal of wiping out Hamas' leadership, but it doesn't necessarily mean an end to the war.

We're seeing these comments coming out of the White House, of D.C., essentially expressing hope, expressing optimism, that the killing of Yahya Sinwar could be the breakthrough in peace talks. You're hearing U.S. officials describing Yahya Sinwar as that obstacle, essentially, that needed to be removed for a path towards peace to be paved.But, when you look at the facts on the ground, it is very difficult to see that as nothing -- anything more than rhetoric, Omar, especially at a time when the White House is trying to put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the negotiating table. Yahya Sinwar's death will, of course, deal a major blow to Hamas. But, there is already talk of succession, and it's likely that whoever will replace him will continue the policies that he believed in, a very hard line approach to negotiations as well. You can't -- you see any overnight shift here in terms of ideology when you speak about the names that are in line for succession, potentially, Mohammed Sinwar, his brother, the second negotiator, second in command in Hamas, again, somebody who is a close follower of Sinwar, Khaled Meshaal, all of these figures who would carry on that same ideology.

Special Counsel Jack Smith is releasing a trove of documents in his 2020 election subversion case against Donald Trump. Now, the documents are, as they often are, heavily redacted. They're expected to include the grand jury transcripts and notes from FBI interviews. On Thursday, the judge in the case rejected a bid by the former President to put the unsealing of the documents on hold until after the election. As a reminder, Trump is charged with four crimes, including conspiracy and obstruction. I want to bring in CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez here. So, what are we seeing in these documents? What's the significance of this release? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's an important document because it is basically the evidence, the underpinning of this case that Jack Smith, the Special Counsel, has built against Donald Trump. And of course, all of this hangs on the election. If Donald Trump wins the election, this case probably will die, right? But, if he loses, we will see him go on trial, most likely sometime next year, and this is one of the cases that has that potential. And so, what these documents that were released by the court, by Judge Tanya Chutkan this morning, these are -- a lot of them, as you pointed out, are redacted. We're seeing a lot of blank pages that simply say \"sealed\", Omar. But, we also have a lot of documents that are -- that show a little bit about what Jack Smith has gathered as part of this investigation, and part of it, one of them, for instance, is the January 6 tweet that Donald Trump sent, @Mike Pence, which the argument from the prosecutors is that that helped sort of propel the crowd on the day of that attack against the U.S. Capitol. The tweet read that Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done. There is also documents from John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump, who outlined essentially the entire playbook for what they thought or what they said was Mike Pence's ability to block the election results. Now, addressing a question or an issue that the former President has raised, his lawyers have said that it was unfair to release these documents 18 days from the election, that this is essentially election interference. Judge Chutkan, in denying their request to keep these documents under wrap, addressed that, and I'll read you just a part of what she says. She says, \"If the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it and withholding, but withholding could itself constitute or appear to be election interference.\" She is saying, we have to put this out simply because the public has a right to know. Now, we will be going through these documents, about 2,000 pages, but we'll see what else turns up in this trove of information that has now been released by the court. Omar.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: -- on one side, somebody who really just cares about himself. Everything is about him, 02:00 a.m. tweets and tirades, and Kamala is somebody who comes from modest beginnings, who had to fight for what she had, and that's the kind of person that I'd want to vote for, because I know push comes to shove. She is going to be fighting for me, and that's the kind of President that we need. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Before that, it's going after Arab American voters who are upset about the Gaza war. It's going after black voters in Detroit.

I've heard from a number of people who feel like that strategy could potentially backfire, especially in such a tight election.There are a lot of concerns that they are not doing enough to reach out to voters in places like the Grand Rapids area, where Vice President Harris will be today. That is a part of the state where Nikki Haley got about 30 percent of the vote. It swung from Trump to Biden in the last election, and there are concerns that this part of the state where the politics are more moderate, where there are a lot more suburban voters, where poor people with affluence are moving to, that Trump isn't doing enough to turn those counties back towards Republicans, and is instead focusing too much on people who are very unlikely to vote, at least by historical standards, Omar.",

So, plenty of voters still on the edge there, really for both parties.Steve Contorno, Isaac Dovere, thank you both. All right. If you haven't heard, the political divide in the U.S. has tensions and anxiety running high among voters, no matter which candidate they support. I don't have to tell you that. You probably already know. But, the question is, is election stress really bad for your health, and what's the best way to cope with it? Joining us now to provide some tips is Dr. Trisha Pasricha, now -- the \"Ask A Doctor\" Columnist for The Washington Post, and a physician at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. All right. So, I know every presidential feels like there is a lot at stake. This one feels like it stands out, though. I mean, what do you see typically among your patients every election cycle? What are you seeing now? DR. TRISHA PASRICHA, M.D., ASK A DOCTOR COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST, &amp; PHYSICIAN, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER: That's absolutely right. Anxiety tends to spike in the weeks to months leading up to the election cycle, but this cycle has been particularly bad. I think it's for a few reasons. One, I think we haven't really recovered from the general anxiety levels that really ramped up from the pandemic, right? So, there was a poll earlier this year, 43 percent of Americans experienced general anxiety. That's up from 37 percent last year, 32 percent the year before that. So, I don't think we've really recovered from that baseline we started with. I think younger people, teenagers, parents, they're still the hardest hit. In my clinic, I see people's anxiety manifest in different ways. People are increasingly saying they're having trouble sleeping, right? They're having trouble concentrating at work. People's fearful bowel syndrome is flaring. That happens every election cycle. So, it's affecting a lot of people, and it's happening in a lot of different ways.",

I also think there is -- they're often, especially younger kids, they're often the ones who feel the most disenfranchised, right? They can't vote. They don't have the agency that you and I have, which is, at least we say we can't change everything about this outcome, but we have this small thing that we can do that does make a difference.I think the same thing is having these conversations with teenagers and kids modeling that behavior about how you manage your anxiety. Your anxiety as an adult and as a parent really gets picked up on by your kids, and certainly, there is another great study that shows that if you, as a parent, spend a lot of time on social media and riling yourself up, your kids sort of mirror that behavior too. So, I think as much as you can, modeling that behavior really does help when you have kids and teenagers in your house.",

We have been pooping all wrong, right? We think a lot about how, in some form, how our brain affects our gut. Our anxiety, we know there is a big connection. We were anxious. Think about the next -- last time you had to go singing at karaoke. Maybe you had to have a bowel movement. Why did that happen?But, this book really talks about how that brain gut connection is two ways, right? The gut really influences our brain, and things that are happening in our gut and in our microbiome, these things have a big effect on our anxiety and depression. So, that's really part of what the book explores, is how we can make pooping a breeze, which I think in this country is something we really don't like talking about with our friends and family, right?",
