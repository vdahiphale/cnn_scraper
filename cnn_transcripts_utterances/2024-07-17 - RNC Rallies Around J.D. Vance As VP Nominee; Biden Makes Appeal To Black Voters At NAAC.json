There was clearly a lot of excitement about him, but sure, part of the as we know, in a political campaign, part of what happens is people get defined and they are accountable for their records just in the same way, there's a narrative about him that the Trump campaign wants to tell. There are sort of what I would call fact checks -- look, the Democrats want to share about him particularly in this moment when were talking about unity, we're talking about how do we lower the temperature in our political discourse? He's someone who has not really done that in, in a lot of what we've seen from him online in the last, certainly a couple of years. So it'd be interesting to see tonight, does he -- is he able to hold it? Because already we've seen some of the speakers have not been able. I'm thinking Marjorie Taylor Greene, not quite able to get on that memo, but this will really be his big opportunity both to introduce himself to the country and to send the signal about whether or not this ticket is sincere and this lowering the temperature.",
