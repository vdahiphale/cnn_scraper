NATO summit this week was the uncertainty about President Biden's future and a potential second Trump term. Questions about Biden's age and fitness have consumed both campaigns with Biden's attempt to assuage those \"got to go\" fears at a press conference and Trumps mocking him on the campaign trail. But the fact remains that at 81 and 78, both candidates are well into their retirement years and showing signs of mental slippage leading to calls for more transparency about their health. One person who has witnessed each candidate's ability to serve in a time of crisis and whose worked under both administrations also happens to be America's most recognizable doctor. Anthony Fauci is an immunologist and the longtime director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He's advised every American president since Ronald Reagan on these matters and famously presided over the country's COVID-19 crisis during both Trump and Biden's first term. He's just written a new memoir called \"On Call: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service\". And there was a lot to ask about presidential fitness and possible future pandemics when I caught up with him this week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

What do you make of the hullabaloo around Biden, his age, the debate performance right now? Did you have any concerns when you were working for him? DR. FAUCI: Not at all, Christiane. I worked with him for two years that ended in December of 2022 when I had an extensive meeting with him, I believe in January or February of 2023. And at that point, which was the last time I spoke to him, he was fine. I mean, obviously -- I mean, he's someone who physically is not as vigorous as he used to be when he was younger, but from a mental standpoint, the last time I saw him, which I mentioned is in the early part of 2023, he seemed fine to me.

I mean, I exercise very regularly and vigorously every single day, but from a mental standpoint, I feel as sharp as I was, at least, the last time that I was in a situation running a big institute. So I feel fine. As far as I'm concerned, it's an individual thing, and you can't generalize, because people age very differently. There are some 65- year-old people I know who really look like they just can't function in any manner or form that's important. And as you mentioned, I'm 83, and I feel fine.

President Trump so much wanted the COVID outbreak, the pandemic to disappear in March and April because he wanted it to act like flu. It was very, very disturbing to him because, A, the economy was being impacted and he was focusing on the election cycle. So, what he did is that he would hope that it would go away in March, the beginning of April. When it didn't, he said things that were not true. He said it would go away like magic. And that's when I had to be in the painful position to publicly contradict him and say, no, it's not going to go away. When it became clear to him that it wasn't going to go away, he started grabbing for magic elixirs to essentially cure it. Hence, we had hydroxychloroquine, even though there was no evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, and in fact, it might hurt people. And then, when he heard from the purpose (ph) from Homeland Security that this bleach issue could get rid of the virus from other surfaces, he went way out of his line and said, well, maybe we could use it in people. He was desperately looking for a solution to get rid of COVID, but the solution wasn't there.
