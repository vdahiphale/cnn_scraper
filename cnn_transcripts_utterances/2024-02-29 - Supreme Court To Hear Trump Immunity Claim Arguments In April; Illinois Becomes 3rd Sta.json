      "sentences": "So it's now more likely that former President Trump will not face a federal trial over his actions on January 6th before November's general election after the Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's arguments that presidents should enjoy total criminal immunity for their acts while in office.That will delay Trump's trial over elections subversion that was supposed to start next month. And while the Supreme Court weighs a separate Trump case, Colorado's plan to disqualify Trump from his primary ballot. A third state just moved to kick Trump off of its ballot. An Illinois judge just ruling that Trump is disqualified because of the 14th Amendment's ban on insurrectionists holding office. With us now, we have CNN justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider. OK, let's start with the Supreme Court and presidential immunity that it will hear arguments in late April. How soon could it decide then?",

      "sentences": "Well, what's interesting is the Supreme Courts actually hearing this case faster than it normally would.Usually, when it grants cases this late, they're not heard until at least October. So in that sense, the Supreme Court is sort of fast- tracking this decision. But even despite that, they won't even be hearing arguments still the week of April 22nd. We don't know the exact date, yes, but it will be that week. And then presumably, it's only two months till the end of their terms. So it's very likely this case, this immunity decision won't actually get decided until June, maybe even late June, maybe even the last week of June. And at that point, if the Supreme Court says Donald Trump is not immune, that's when it would get kicked back to the federal trial court. And even at that point, Brianna, if were looking at the end of June and the court says you can start this trial, the judge in that case, Judge Tanya Chutkan, she's already said, even once I get the greenlight to go ahead, were still going to have to wait about up three months to get pretrial motions all taken care, all the things that need to happen before trial. So we're not looking at any potential trial to even start until maybe late September, And then, we're just about a month away from the election. So it is very likely and possible that this whole case would not get resolved before the election -- Brianna?",

But tell us about how this affects things?SCHNEIDER They're now the third state where a judge or judges have ruled that Trump should be taken off the ballot. This state, Illinois, as in the other states, it's paused their ruling for now. And early voting is already underway in Illinois. Their primary is March 19th. So Trump will be on the ballot there. It's just a matter of, as this process goes forward, will those votes actually be counted? So the judge has said, yes, Trump should be taken off the ballot there. Any votes against the -- for him shouldn't count. She paused her ruling until tomorrow. In the meantime, Trump's team just appealed. So it's possible that the ruling will be on pause even -- even longer now that Trump's team has appealed. But remember Brianna, you have the Supreme Court weighing in on this exact issue, whether state judges even have the power to unilaterally take candidates off the ballot. It seemed blood during the arguments they were not going to say that judges could do that. So if they rule before any of these other legal proceedings play out, it would render all these moot. And Trump would be on the ballot in those states.",

Of course, this is anything but a normal case. And I think a court understands that it does need to expedite things, that it can't drag its heels too much.

Well, I think the big perception is going be what -- how the Department of Justice sees this.In other words, the Department of Justice is going to be faced with a scenario where, when this case returns to the district court, assuming the court, the Supreme Court says that Trump is not immune, and if there's going to be a trial, the Justice Department is going to face this choice. They're going to have to decide if they still want to move ahead with this prosecution, even if it means having a trial in September or October. It's possible that the judge herself will take that decision out of the department's hands by not scheduling a trial so close to the election. But if she says, hey, I'm willing to hear this case in September or October, the ball will be in squarely in Merrick Garland's court.

And keep in mind that the schedule that they set for this is not that different from the schedule that Jack Smith himself had proposed to the Supreme Court if they were to grant this case.

The same goes with next week when they're going to try to pass six long-term funding bills, which Speaker Mike Johnson had already warned his conference that it's not going to contain some of these hardline demands that his right-wing flank has been pushing for. So that has sparked some internal frustration inside the GOP and it is really put Johnson on defense. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): The appropriations -- appropriations process is ugly. Democracy is ugly. This is the way it works every year, always has. Except that we've instituted some new innovations.

And before I get into the weather for the weekend, I just want to address the situation here.You mentioned, you know how a lot of the landscape here in Texas is covered with ash. it's hard to tell right now whether this is snow or ash flying through the air. This is snow. But the area for quality is just atrocious. That is just one of the many things that residents here in Fritch and a large part of the Texas Panhandle have to deal with. Now that fire, the largest up the fires, is now over one million acres. That's, just to give me some reference, more than five times the size of New York City. We are experiencing cooler temperatures today. So there's been snow all through Amarillo. We drove through that snowstorm. Here, there was snow, there was hail there's a bit of rain. It's sort of the all of the weather. As for the weather, it's going to help put out the -- the fires. It's certainly going to help dampen and contain them to some extent. But with such a large area burning, it might not get all of it. And what we're expecting for the weekend is, once the snow system passes through, we could be seeing strong winds around 30 miles an hour on Saturday. We could also be seeing temperatures soaring back to the 70s. And so the combination of that new hotter, drier air could re-spark the fires. And the big concern is any areas that hadn't been put out by this current weather system could just spread so quickly the way that we saw at the beginning of this week. And so that is certainly a challenge for firefighters that could hinder firefighting efforts. But I also want to give you a sense of the damage that this fire could do. You could see the building behind me belongs to a local hero named Janis. The car completely burnt to a husk. All of this she said happened within minutes. And that is the threat that is facing residents here this coming weekend if those hot temperatures, those strong winds pass through -- Boris?",
