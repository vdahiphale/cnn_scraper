Sources tell CNN that federal prosecutors are now in possession of an audiotape undercutting the former president's claim that he declassified documents before leaving the White House. Stand by for our exclusive report.Plus, we are awaiting a final vote in the House of Representatives on the debt limit deal. This hour, I'll be getting reaction from a key progressive Democrat who says she is voting no. Also tonight, attacks on Russian territory appear to be escalating. Kremlin officials calling the situation near the Ukrainian border alarming, one day after drone strikes shook the Russian capital city of Moscow. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in The Situation Room.

Our Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz and our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid have been working their sources. They are joining us now with the latest.

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, this is an audiotape, an audiotape that the Justice Department now has and is part of their special counsel investigation into whether Donald Trump mishandled national security secrets and possibly obstructed justice.So, the Justice Department has this audiotape. They've heard it. They have asked people about it in a grand jury. They have asked other people about it, including the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley. And the reason that they are asking about it is because it appears to be quite significant. So, this audiotape we have not heard, but it's been described to us by multiple sources. And on it Donald Trump is at a meeting at Bedminster where he has his golf resort in New Jersey. And in this meeting, it's Trump, some of his aides, some people working on a book for his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. During this meeting Donald Trump is talking about apparently a plan that existed from the Pentagon where the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley was presenting to Trump the possible option of bombing Iran. Now, all reporting that we understand is that Trump wanted to bomb Iran or have some sort of military attack there, and Milley did not want to do that. And at this point in time, in July of 2021, there were some stories coming out about how Milley and others had stopped Trump from taking this really aggressive military action at the very end of his presidency. So, Donald Trump was quite angry, and in this meeting he's talking about this plan. He's talking about a document that Milley has. And he's also rustling a paper, and that can be heard on the tape. Now, we don't know exactly what document he's having there, but he's apparently referring to a document that he wants to share more widely, and also acknowledging that he can't share it more widely because it's classified, and that's a really key piece of this, too. Now, Mark Meadows, his former chief of staff, he writes about this in his book, this particular episode at Bedminster. And he writes that in this meeting, Donald Trump recalled a four-page report typed up by Mark Milley himself. It contained the general's own plan to attack Iran, deploying massive numbers of troops. And so the Justice Department, they have locked down this audiotape, they've also gotten testimony about people who were in the meeting, we know at least one person, Margo Martin, an aide to him, who was in the meeting, she has testified to a grand jury and he's doing all of this evidence that they're gathering. This is the sort of thing where Donald Trump does not have -- he's talking about classified information to people who do not have clearances. Alex?",

Now, I'll also note that most of the focus so far in this investigation and in the reporting, Alex, has been on Mar-a-Lago.

We don't know exactly what his language is. I haven't heard it. There's a small group of people, as I understand it, who have. If he says, you know, something that indicates that he is aware that this material is either classified or sensitive in nature or something, and that possibly he shouldn't have it in his possession, that would undercut what their public defenses have been, and, frankly, private defenses have been for some time. So, I think this gets to mindset as much as anything. The fact that it's on tape is very striking. And, again, this is not a secret recording.

But what's interesting about this recording is it provides possible evidence of other crimes that are under investigation, the whole issue of mishandling classified information, retaining government secrets.As I've said in other hits that this Justice Department has been reluctant to bring cases that are solely obstruction without an underlying crime, which is why it was unclear if charges would be pursued in this case at all against the former president or against anyone else. But knowing they have this kind of evidence that they're asking witnesses, including Mark Milley, about this, this is significant.

And when you take the agreement on that, not only does it push a debt ceiling deadline off for another two years, but it also limits largely what Republicans had tried to get into place in the legislation that they had passed before the negotiations actually started. That said, White House officials are cognizant that there is work to do. They've been trying to engage in that over the course of the last several days since that agreement was reached. There's been dozens of phone calls from top administration officials, a series of briefings on specific elements of the bill, as well as the bill in its entirety this morning to the House Democratic caucus. All members were invited to a meeting on the Capitol to be briefed on this legislation. White House officials don't view this as something that will cause long-term damage with progressives. However, they do know that there is work to do, and at some point, the president will likely have to be involved in that work.

That said, this bill will pass tonight, they don't need progressive votes. I know they don't need progressive votes. And I think it's really important that Kevin McCarthy show that he is the speaker of the House that can deliver at least two-thirds of his caucus' votes. It is ridiculous, we already saw in the rule vote that Republicans had to be bailed out by Democrats. And now, I think it's important that he can show he can bring forward at least two-thirds of his caucus for these votes. Democrats will supply the rest of the votes but I think it's equally important for those of us who understand that both of in conscience -- of principle and in conscience of policy that there are bad things in this bill, not because Joe Biden or Democrats wanted it but because Republicans took us hostage. And it is important that we put up a very strong no-vote on the board. I intend to do that. I know several of my progressive colleagues intend to do that as well.

Do you think that Republican voters care about these recordings? Does this land with Republican voters that Trump is trying not just to maintain but bring over to his side?",

And a lot of the polling has suggested that, you know, majorities of Americans, which would necessarily include Republicans, care. A Quinnipiac poll showed almost half of Republicans thought that the former president may have done something illegal as it pertained to his documents.So, the idea that Trump can just do anything I don't think is there in the data. That being said, even while some voters might think that he did something wrong, it may not necessarily mean that they don't want to vote for him. And I think that's always been his strength in this field is that they take in the negative information, maybe they think he did something wrong, and then they say, well, we'll put it aside because we care about these other things more. And that's why it's not that he's Teflon, but it's that Republican voters have a priority list that may be different from the rest of the electorate.",

We know that in New York case, in the Stormy Daniels case, it's scheduled for trial just a few weeks after Super Tuesday. So, this is going to be totally part and parcel of his campaign. We'll see how voters respond to it. Yes, some candidates like Chris Christie may try to make this an issue. Ron DeSantis, I think we're getting an early glimpse, isn't all that eager to delve into all the legal challenges, wants to make a broader ideological argument against Donald Trump in this Republican primary.",

I think, by and large, the response from a lot of the other candidates has been, well, the FBI has been politicized, they're just going after him.They know that that argument works with Republican voters to basically say that Trump is being prosecuted unfairly. But it really is almost like unilateral disarmament on their part. They are taking, in other words, that argument almost off the table and making it much more difficult when these cases do come to bear to actually use them against Trump in the campaign. So we'll see how this turns out. But there are some very serious legal challenges that have already ended in an indictment in one case and could end in an indictment in several others.
