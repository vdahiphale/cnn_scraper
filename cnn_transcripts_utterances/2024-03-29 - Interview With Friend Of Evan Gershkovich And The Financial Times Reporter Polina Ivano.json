This is the front page of today's \"Wall Street Journal.\" It's blank, with the simple headline, his story should be here. It marks one year since American journalist Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia on espionage charges, an accusation the journal and U.S. government strongly deny. In reality, he was simply doing his job as a reporter, only to end up as one of Putin's pawns, kept behind bars as the bargaining chip. In an interview released today by the \"Wall Street Journal,\" Editor-in- Chief Emma Tucker asked his parents if they thought it was getting harder for him as time passes. Here's what his mother said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELLA MILMAN, EVAN GERSHKOVICH'S MOTHER:  I'm sure it takes toll. It takes a toll on us. It's definitely the take toll of him. He worries about us so much. He wouldn't really reveal a lot, but we still know that it's taking toll. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they can go back to that or have something else. Everything is possible. One thing I should say, and it's that, that agreement, back in 2015, was predicated upon a certain number of -- or a certain type of technologies and capacities and capabilities, but this was 10 years ago. So, 2024, 2025, almost, is 10 years after that agreement was signed. So, Iran has now much faster, more efficient, more performing centrifuges. Iran has more facilities producing the parts of those, is developing, constructing new sites where the nuclear activities are taking place. So, the spectrum, if you want, of that agreement is clearly superseded at this point. So, maybe for political reasons, they will continue to say, we have to go back to that agreement, OK, fine with us. But the reality is that the Iran of 2015 is not the Iran of 2020.",

I will not do that. Let me give you a reference. In the 1990s -- 1980, late 1980s, that happened in Iraq, where the agency believed and the world believed that everything was correct. But many things were happening without the inspectors and my predecessors knowing it. We learned from that sad experience. We don't want to go back to that.

So, we have to be very objective here. Iran is accumulating a vast amount of highly enriched uranium. And this is something that, of course, draws our attention because no other country without nuclear weapons is enriching at these high levels. Another point I would draw attention to is that a nuclear weapon requires more than highly enriched uranium or plutonium to go bang. All right. It is a complex system that requires other things. Normally, those pursuing nuclear weapons test them, like the North Koreans did. So, there are a number of things. I say this because alarmism is also a bad idea. It is, of course, concerning. We are in a trajectory that is not good. We have to persuade Iran to come back to full cooperation with us. But, of course, we are not in a scenario where we have nuclear weapons in that country.",

That being said, the proportion, the general -- the overall proportion of nuclear energy in the energy mix continues to be quite low. I think it's very important because, as you know, the Chinese energy mix is highly dependent on coal and other CO2 heavy emitters. So, the fact that they are increasing the nuclear share is in itself a very important thing. It's like in India, for example, you have the same situation and I think it's very positive. But we are seeing more nuclear here in Europe, maybe for other reasons, maybe energy security. The war in Ukraine is bating (ph) countries look at nuclear energy with renewed enthusiasm. We see it in the United States, where they -- I mean, it's at a time of great difficulty and divide. It enjoys bipartisan support now, nuclear energy, or in big countries in Europe, in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, I mean, Korea, Japan, in spite of the traumatic experience of Fukushima, the 18 nuclear accidents.

Why we are fighting? Why we are killing each other? Why we hate each other? We are a normal people because we live in abnormal situation. Christiane, since three weeks, for example, the last three weeks, Jericho, which is the quieter place on earth under a very heavy siege, the very brutal behavior, the soldiers around the checkpoints, you cannot move in or out.

Why I called to end the occupation and not to kill the Israeli people because this is our common enemy. Because I recognize the humanity of the Israelis there. You know, your enemy is exactly like you, but without occupation, without oppression. Even Jabotinsky says that oppression creates resistance. We want to live in a normal place, normal space, Israelis and Palestinians, and stop being victims, both sides, to the policy of the others. Stop the war. Gaza and -- it's like become as a ghetto.
