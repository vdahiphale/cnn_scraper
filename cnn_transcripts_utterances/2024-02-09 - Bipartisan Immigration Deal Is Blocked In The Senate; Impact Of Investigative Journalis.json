Well, it's deja vu for US lawmakers who failed yetagain this week to agree on a solution to the country's immigration crisis. Now this time, security provisions designed to draw bipartisan support ended up backfiring, with former president Donald Trump turning the tide against it. And then congressional Republicans following suit. Now, it's already a defining issue in this year's presidential election. But beyond the politics are countless human stories as the number of unauthorized immigrants crossing the border keeps reaching record highs. And a backlog of cases in US immigration court passes 3 million. So if this week's deal had passed in Congress, it would have been one of the most significant changes to US immigration policy in decades. Now evidence of just how long the issue has remained a stubborn political challenge in Washington, to get a sense of why, we turned now to Jonathan Blitzer. He's covered the issue for years, and he explores how we got here in his new book \"Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here: The United States, Central America, And The Making of a Crisis.\" He joins us from Washington, DC.

And related to that, this also established certain triggers so that if the traffic reached a certain point at the southern border, the president would have the authority to \"shut down the border,\" which essentially means that the president would have the authority to suspend the processing of asylum altogether. So fairly narrow but notably conservative measures that typically in the sweep of Washington reform on immigration would be paired with other measures that would be more ambitious and broader.

In other words, not coordinating with local officials, not coordinating with state officials, luring people onto these buses with promises of jobs that don't materialize on the other side of the trip. This drastically changed how Democrats have come to think about the border. And now, as blue cities are facing real economic strains and humanitarian needs, there has been a lot of frustration among state and local officials that the federal government hasn't more swiftly come to their defense, and that there really is a problem at the border that needs to be dealt with. And so, it's incredibly striking to see how far Democrats have started to shift on this issue over the last couple of years, almost directly as a consequence of this political stunt coming out of Texas.",

So, in fact, people -- employers are looking to hire people. And you do have, in the arrival of all of these migrants, a willing enabled workforce. The problems are technical. The problems consist mainly in making sure that these new arrivals have the ability to work and get work authorization. And part of what's slowing that down is government bureaucracy, some of what's slowing that down is partisan politics. But this is kind of always coming back to the same theme with Trump and with the Republicans, which is, you know, this notion somehow that by talking tough, the Republicans are more orderly in their approach to this issue is not only wrong, but we've also seen -- demonstrated in recent history just how wrong headed this is. And so, when Trump was president, you saw the harshest policies we've really ever witnessed at the southern border, separating parents from children in an effort to deter other migrants from coming. What happened within a year of that, record numbers of new arrivals at the southern border. So toughness alone, tough talk, least of all, doesn't even begin to cover what the needs actually are.",

This was in September of 2017. At a moment, actually, when that family separation policy was being tested out in the clandestine way in the El Paso border area. She was apprehended in New Mexico, which is part of that broader district. She was separated from her children. At that moment in time, no one in the wider country really understood that there was a policy afoot to do this. And so, she suffered essentially in private, with really no lifeline on the outside, and witnessed the earliest days of these family separation cases from inside a detention center in El Paso. So she gathered the names of other women who had recently been separated from her children. She wrote these names down. She mailed them out of the facility to local lawyers, to government officials, to anyone who might receive her mail. She eventually got deported by the Trump administration back to Honduras. She traveled through Mexico, reached the southern border again because her family was in the United States. And she winds up, in 2021, being one of the first families reunited under the Biden administration's effort to kind of piece together what had happened. So that's her arc and just a kind of a window into the last couple of years of immigration policy at the border.",

And so, what we watch time after time on both sides of the aisle, frankly, is this idea that deterrence somehow will save the broader system from what is a global phenomenon. We're in the midst of a moment of genuine mass migration, the likes of which we really haven't seen since the Second World War. And so, the idea that border policy alone is somehow going to manage this broader, almost world historical flow, it's wrong and it really ends up only perpetuating the problem.",

And it was interesting that his relationship with Tucker Carlson was that you wanted an interview, so here I am and I'm going to tell you all this very long story. And in fact, he immediately said, do you want a show? You want a serious conversation? So Tucker Carlson is a very -- he seemed like a kind of very obedient puppy who said, oh, of course, the great master. Tell me all you need to say. But it was a little comical because in Russia, everybody got used to this long and tedious history lessons began with the Rurik and everything else. But I think for the American and global audience, that was a little daunting, the first 20, whatever, 40 minutes of this. So that interview was a show of Putin's strength.

And his statements that he says, I'm openly anti-Putin candidate, I am for peace. And peace is not really a big word in Russia. In fact, you can go to prison if you keep talking about peace. Just in case you shouldn't be wanting that, you want to have a global war or some sort victory in Ukraine at least. So he was like that, I want to open elections, I don't want Russia's isolation. And so for this, actually, people can be branded foreign agents or, as I said, can go to prison. Suddenly he's open with this. He collects signatures. So that was an idea for the Kremlin, that we're going to pretend it's some sort of a democratic formula because big word for these elections, not elections for Putin's becoming president again in March 2024 next month, is that it should look legitimate. And so he was part of that legitimization effort. And I think what they didn't understand, they didn't really count on how much protest, the inside protest, sort of the silent majority that is afraid to speak out but can speak out in those lines signing for Boris Nadezhdin because they have a hope. And Boris Nadezhdin is a -- if you translate the name, the name signifies hope. Have a hope that some other alternative to Putin is possible. And so, the minute it became clear that Nadezhdin could become a real force, we know that -- I think yesterday his signatures were deemed unacceptable and he was banned from running for presidency. So the Kremlin tried. The minute it had a fear that somehow Putin may be undermined, they immediately turned on the machine on and said, it's illegal for Nadezhdin to try again. But I think it actually becomes a problem for Putin. So there is a protest brewing somewhere in Russia. We don't know when it will come out, but it might come out soon enough.",

But he did say that we continue work in that area. And I think for me, that was a sign. If the work is being done, that may result in something. But I think what he also said, and it's very important for everybody to hear that this all should be done quietly. Because -- these Russians been saying that many, many times, is that when the Americans start talking about potential solutions or talking about sort of bring the public opinion into it, the Russians immediately close down and say, we're not going to deal with it.

But if you go to page 248, the report says, \"We conclude that the evidence does not establish that Mr. Biden willfully disclosed national defense information to his writing assistant.\" That's in the report. That's the conclusion that was made based on the evidence. There's something else I want to add about this, because we've gone back and forth. On page one of the report says the president willfully retained classified marked documents relating to Afghanistan. But on page 215 of the report, it says, there's in fact a shortage of evidence on these points. On page 5 of the report, everybody read that first few pages says, quote, Mr. Biden's memory was significantly limited. But here's something that everybody should make sure that they see elsewhere in the report. He says, \"we expect the evidence of Mr. Biden's state of mind to be compelling,\" pointing to him providing, \"clear and forceful testimony.\" That's his comments on his state of mind later in the report.
