The Israeli military says it hit terror targets in Beirut suburbs 20 times in two minutes. At least 25 people were killed across Lebanon on Tuesday. Well, meanwhile, Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel that were intercepted. The Israeli government has vowed to resume military operations against the Iran-backed group if the ceasefire is breached. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 is the basis of the deal. Uder the ceasefire terms over 60 days Israel will gradually withdraw its forces as Lebanon's army takes control of territory near its border with Israel to ensure Hezbollah does not rebuild its infrastructure there. The U.S. and France will help enforce the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Israel did not launch this war. The Lebanese people did not seek that war either, nor did the United States. But lasting security for the people of Israel and Lebanon cannot be achieved only on the battlefield.

I mean, any kind of break would allow all sides to regroup, and Hezbollah, we can expect to see it, try to reconstitute and rearm because at the end of the day Hezbollah was created as a resistance organization to Israeli occupation of Arab lands and also to serve as strategic depth to Iran in its own conflict with Israel. And so you would expect to see it rearm, although it will be more difficult to do so. It did so after the 2006 war with Israel. This time around the U.S. and France are participating in an enforcement mechanism along with the Lebanese Army and the Lebanese state and the United Nations to make sure that that doesn't happen.

If you look at how marketshave reacted, the stock market has been relatively complacent given the magnitude of the tariffs we're talking about, which suggests that a lot of traders don't think that they will materialize. But you have seen big moves in a few stocks for companies that would be seriously affected.
