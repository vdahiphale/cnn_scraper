And today, Russian President Vladimir Putin says more prisoner swaps are possible.Plus, talk about a shake-up. Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema says she is leaving the Democratic Party and registering as an Independent. How Washington is reacting. And we know this tripledemic of viruses is hitting the nation hard, but the post-Thanksgiving numbers are in and it's getting even more deadly. We're following all of that. But first, we begin with Brittney Griner right now receiving treatment in Texas. CNN's Alex Marquardt leads us off. Alex what more can you tell us about what these first few days home will be like for her?",

And then she was pulled suddenly from the penal colony that she was being detained at, put on a series of flights home landing in San Antonio early this morning.The first priority is going to be on her physical, on her medical health. We have seen video of her as she boarded that Russian plane, she was all smiles. U.S. officials say that she is in good spirits and that she does appear to be in good health. Ana, the reason that she was taken to San Antonio is because there is a medical treatment facility there called the Brooke Army Medical Center. We know that she has gone there for a preliminary medical evaluation. And in San Antonio, she will also have access to a very specialized program that helps people who have been in isolation readjust, reacclimate to normal life that is run by the Defense Department. That's also why Trevor Reed was taken to San Antonio back in April when he was exchanged by the Russians. So, of course, on a so many people all across this country, all around the world, thrilled that Brittney Griner is now home. But at the same time there is growing criticism that the U.S. was not able to get out Paul Whelan at the same time, in exchange for the so-called Merchant of Death for someone who is as significant as Viktor Bout. The White House's John Kirby was asked about this earlier today on CNN. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We are told that those conversations continue.They are looking for creative solutions, for different combinations to try to get Whelan home. We did hear from President Putin himself saying that more swaps are possible. He confirmed that those conversations do continue. The White House, John Kirby, who we just heard from, he has said that they are not back to square one. But clearly, Ana, there is some kind of reset here. Now, CNN reported exclusively back in August that the Russians had asked specifically for a Russian who is in German custody, a convicted murderer. And as recently as yesterday, a senior administration official told our colleagues over at the State Department that the Russians had continued to bring someone up who is not in U.S. custody and that the U.S. continued to get frustrated by that. So those conversations do continue. Again, lots of excitement and joy in the administration that Griner is home.

Great to see both of you. Senator Jones, Democrats just for celebrating, expanding their majority in the Senate, and now this. So what does it mean for Democrats in the Biden agenda, in your perspective? DOUG JONES (D), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: You know, look, when we talked about celebrating majority, we included two independents already. We still now have a third independent that's still included in that 51-49 majority. I think it's been reported. Senator Schumer is going to allow Senator Sinema to stay on her committees. We've still got a majority. We've still be able to function at the committee level. And I don't really think for purposes of the Senate functioning, very much is going to change at all. She has always had an independent streak. We've always had Democrats, we've always had to work with her and talk to her. She's also been a leading proponent of bipartisanship on the infrastructure bill. I don't think a whole lot of things are going to change, at this point.

Now I looked up her voting record, she votes more than 90 percent with our President, and that will probably continue. I don't see any difference. You know, I serve so long with Bernie Sanders and Angus King, both independents. They vote with Democrats, most of the time. They have their Maverick moments, as we all do, one way or the other. Honestly, it sounds like a big deal. But in terms of day-to-day work, and Chuck Schumer lining up the votes, nothing has changed. Now, if she had said she was going to caucus with Republicans, that would have been a bombshell. That is not what's happening. She's going to continue to caucus with the Democrats. That is my understanding. Last point I'd make is, you know, Kyrsten Sinema is kind of in search for her own identity. She started off as a Green Party member.",

And I think that that's a real danger for Democrats. Democrats have to look at their mouth, across the board. We got to start winning elections in the south, the Midwest and places that we used to win elections in, and we don't as much anymore. And it's -- it -- I really think that it's a bad signal. I really want Democrats to make sure that everybody in this tent is welcome and that we just don't run -- you know, it's interesting how we criticize Republicans, when people like Jeff Flake, and Bob Corker left their Senate seats because they were going to get primary.We run the risk of doing the same thing in the Democrats if we're not careful.

And honestly, I see that Senator Sinema move as something as simple as, how about this, avoiding a million -- a multimillion dollar primary. That's what I think it really is about.I don't think anything else was changed. She said nothing else will change. She was a very independent Democrat. Fine. So as I, so as Doug Jones. You don't have to leave the party to make your mark. You're still who you are. So, but she did it. And I think it was calculated on the reelection. I could be wrong.

And again, I'm not defending them at all, because these documents should have been given a long time ago. But that's the place we're at. So this third party search, I think, was a good thing to do, because it gives one more level of both impartiality, one more level of a buffer, I guess, between Trump's people, and the DOJ. And they can say, look, we relied on somebody else, we've paid them to do it. What else can we possibly do? If you know where the documents are, if you have reason to believe they're in a particular property, tell us where they -- what information you have, tell us what documents you're looking for. And we'll send our entire gaggle of lawyers up there to look for the documents at the time.
