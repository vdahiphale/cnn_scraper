(VIDEO PLAYING) As we can see here, some were in tears after learning that the pop super star will not be performing in Vienna this week as planned. Authorities in Austria say that they foiled an ISIS-inspired suicide attack plot targeting Taylor Swift concerts. The prime 19-year-old suspect has been arrested in Ternitz, Austria. You can see on this map here. It's about an hour drive away from where Taylor Swift was scheduled to perform later today. Now, in response, organizers are pulling the plug on three concerts in Vienna. A 17-year-old suspect was also arrested in Austria's capital, and police say that they found explosive devices at the home of the 19-year-old suspect. Now, along with detonators and chemicals, these signs are leading authorities to believe that the teenagers were radicalized online. Here is what the head of Austria's domestic intelligence agency had to say about the alleged terror plot. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OMAR HAIJAWI-PIRCHNER, AUSTRIAN DIRECTOR OF SECURITY SERVICES: So, they are using all kind of social medias we know. So, they are giving private messages. So, it's encrypted communication. In Austria at the moment, we don't have any chance to influence encrypted communication or to read encrypted communication as security authority, and for future investigations, we would need that, of course.

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's startling details about a plot involving only three teenagers, all Austrian-born, one 19-years-old. He is said to have announced in late July that he was leaving his job and was planning something big and then changed his appearance. Police searched his home yesterday in Ternitz, you showed it on the map there, about an hour away from the Taylor Swift venues, and found the precursor chemicals for bomb making, bomb detonators, 21,000 Euros in counterfeit currency, knives.They believe part of his intention was to use another thing they found in his home, a police blue flashing light to gain easier access for his vehicle into the crowds around the periphery of the Taylor Swift concerts. That he would use to bring the explosive device in, and they believe he intended to die either in the delivery of that device or potentially in using knives to attack people there as well. That's the allegations against him, and then also that he was radicalized online by the Islamic states through social media platforms. Austrian officials have complained about today as being so encrypted, they can't often read what's happening there. The second individual here arrested in Vienna hours later, 17-years- old, apparently broke up with his girlfriend recently, important, because police try and work out the state of mind of individuals in moments like this. He appears to have been more involved in the plot. And then the third individual, just a 15-year-old boy, also Austrian- born, may have known about the plot, but being less involved. Investigators are still really at the stage of questioning that individual. But, it's kind of stunning, frankly, that we are talking about a plot so close towards its moments of execution that involved three teenagers, nobody else that Austrian officials are looking for right now, suggestions possibly other people online may have known about it. And of course, Austrian officials want to know who was involved in their radicalization, but startling how close to completion this appears to have got.",

As Israel braces for potential attacks from Iran and its proxies, sources tell CNN that it looks increasingly likely that Hezbollah may strike independent of whatever Iran may intend to do. Hezbollah is based in Lebanon, and sources say that that proximity to Israel means that it could act with little to no notice. Iran and its allies have vowed to retaliate for a series of assassinations claimed by or blamed on Israel. An emergency meeting of Islamic nations yesterday in Jeddah condemned Israel's actions, saying that they undermine regional security and stability. The conference also reaffirmed solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Let's get to Jeremy Diamond, who is following all of these developments from Haifa in northern Israel. Jeremy, a source says that Hezbollah could act with little or no notice at all. I mean, what are you hearing?",

But, the Israeli military itself is clearly at a very heightened state of alert, as is this city of Haifa, where we are now, and that's because Haifa has been through this before. In the 2006 war, it was a major target of Hezbollah, and there are fears that it could be the same once again, should there be a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.And so, Israel -- the Israeli military has been adding troops to reinforce this city's defenses, including search and rescue teams, we understand, and there have also been steps at the municipal level here. Haifa's port and the Haifa Bay, they are limiting the amount of hazardous materials and chemicals that are being brought in at this time because of the potential for that to make the situation that much more dangerous, should the port be struck, for example. And so, there are a number of preparations being made at the city level as well, as people here are certainly getting to a higher state of alert. Rahel.",

Paul, let me start where Alayna left off, these concerns or criticisms from the Trump campaign that he is at least speaking to reporters and Kamala Harris and her campaign are not. What do you think? Should she be? PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I don't care. She should talk to voters. I mean it. I'm in the press. So, I want press conferences. OK? So, I have a bias here. But, I've never met a voter who said, gee, I think politician x should have more press conferences. We all think that in the media. But, she has -- she hasn't set a foot wrong yet. It's been remarkable. Now, I've done this a long time. 75 percent of a politician's mistakes occur in the first 25 percent of the politician's campaign. That's why this very late start was really, really treacherous for Kamala Harris. And yet, so far, she'll make her mistakes, believe me, but so far, she hadn't made a mistake yet.

I do think it's important, however, to talk to journalists, because there are some consequential questions that journalists will ask, particularly when a candidate is changing their views on certain issues, like Vice President Harris is moderating more. I understand why she is moderating more from her pre-positions that were far more progressive. But, a journalist will have the skills to ask the questions of, why, from some of the swing voters in the middle who may be wondering, well, where does she stand on this particular issue now? Maybe why she changed?With that said, I think Trump needs to get out there. He needs to get out there and build the case for why he would be a better leader on a whole host of things, and not doing that I think is a structural disadvantage.

The purpose of a campaign is not to respond to their attacks. It's to launch your own.So, on this, for example, and I'm not running the campaign, obviously, for Kamala Harris, but if I were, I would have -- they're attacking Master Sergeant Walz's military record, 24 years in uniform in the National Guard. I would, instead of saying, well, he did this, he did that, I would point out that Donald Trump avoided service altogether by faking that he had bone spurs. I would point out that Donald Trump called our war dead, suckers and losers. I would point out that Donald Trump refused to visit the cemetery in France of better men than he who died so we could be free, that Donald Trump was quoted and saying he didn't want military veterans who were wounded to come to his rallies, because he said, quote, am I get the quote right here, \"Nobody wants to see that.\" In other words, I would go on the offense.

I also don't think he would trust Vance would attempting to develop in very real time messaging or targeting of the other vice presidential candidate, which we've been seeing for the past 24, 48 hours, again, talking about Walz and his record during the National Guard.So, I think chemistry is going to be important. I think trust is important. But again, Rahel, I want to overemphasize, Republicans have got to figure out a way to showcase that they have a level of momentum and that their message can penetrate.

Ukraine has not commented on the brazen attack, which appears to be one of its largest since the war began more than two years ago. Russian claims seem to be at odds with reports on the ground that there is heavy shelling in the region. Minutes ago, Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus was sworn in as the head of the Bangladesh interim government in the capital of Dhaka. This comes after weeks of violent protests, left hundreds of people dead and led to the resignation of the country's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Now, before Yunus arrived for the swearing in, he called on the citizens of Bangladesh to be, quote, \"ready to build the country\". Now, what could have turned into more rioting by far-right groups in the UK, appears to have been stopped in its tracks by anti-racism protesters. Far-right groups have used social media to call for demonstrations targeting the offices of immigration lawyers and visa processing centers on Wednesday. Well, that's when thousands of people showed up in dozens of cities to guard the centers following days of violence. Well, it is day 13 at the Olympics in Paris. An action on the track is making news. Quincy Hall from the U.S. raced to the Top in the 400 meters. Now, he trailed for much of the race, but then pushed through at the end that got Hall ahead of Great Britain's Matthew Hudson-Smith at the finish line. There are 27 medal events today.

The Dow was seeing some gains, some nice gains, up above 500 points, or 1.4 percent. The NASDAQ up the most among them, 2.18 percent -- 2.16 percent, and the S&amp;P also up, a little bit less than two percent, likely some welcome news for many investors watching. And in Europe, we'll pull up Europe, more of a mixed picture, with the DAX closing up about one third of a percent, the FTSE off, as well as the CAC 40. Asian markets, meantime, also close mixed, with the Nikkei closing lower, which looks like that come back that we saw in those stocks, appear to be short lived, at least for now. We'll keep watching.Also what we continue to watch, the weekly jobless claims here in the U.S. So, this number came in lower than expected. It gives us a sense of how many Americans are filing for unemployment benefits for the first time, and first-time claims fell last week to 233,000. That's about 17,000 fewer than the week prior. Let's bring in CNN Anchor Julia Chatterley, who joins us live from New York. Julia, always good to see you. I don't have to tell you, but with the week we've had between the jobs report, the market volatility, there was a lot of focus on this report. Did the lower claims come larger concerns?",

But, that gives you a sense, one of the volatility of what we're feeling at the moment, and underlines to your point, Rahel, the concerns about the U.S. economy. So, it's not a good number. We're talking about people who, insecure about their jobs, are asking for help from the government in the interim. But, it was better than expected, and that was enough.One of the things that leapt out to me about this report too was Texas. We saw the biggest drop in people filing for first-time unemployment benefits. Why does that matter? Well, Hurricane Beryl hit Texas during the data collection period for Friday's job numbers. So, the fact that it impacted these numbers perhaps tells me that we might see a bit of give back on that weaker jobs number that we got on Friday. You can understand why investors are optimistic, I think, because this is calming fears. Yes, the jobs market, it's slowing, but it's not falling off a cliff. And just to give you a sense, if we were talking about imminent recession, that number at 233,000 would be more like 300,000, 350,000, and were simply not there. This number is consistent, I think, with a quarter of a percentage point cut from the Fed in September and nothing more. So, for now, we've got a positive move in stocks. We're calm to some degree.

It's going to be new appointees, new team, new approach.

That lack of liquidity ultimately affects the ability to form new small businesses in the first place. So, I think that's really more what people are excited about, is to show that there is like a wide diversity of views in Silicon Valley. It's not a monolith. But, that -- we really want to get people civically engaged. It's easy for people who are working on the future to feel like politics is mired in the past and to not want to get involved.So, there is a number of these groups. There is the VC group, but there is also tech for Harris, and there is founders for Harris even. So, they see these groups kind of grassroots organizing to get people civically engaged and just -- we don't necessarily want to tell people what they should believe or what they have to do.

So far, this snow -- this storm has been so slow, crawling at a pace, and that's allowed for it to dump a tremendous amount of rain, and, yes, even caused some severe weather. Here is a look at one of the tornadoes from yesterday. This was along the Pender, Pender and Sampson County line, there in North Carolina. That was one of at least three tornado reports that we know of in just the state of North Carolina alone.We have another Tornado watch in effect for portions of North Carolina and Virginia. This is valid until 01:00 p.m. Eastern local time there. You've got several tornado warnings that have been off and on in this state throughout much of the morning. Only one active at this point in time, near Kinston, North Carolina. But again, a lot of them could continue to pop up as we go through the day, and more of that moisture continues to spread northward, not just in Virginia, but eventually into some other Mid-Atlantic and even states into the Northeast. The short-term concern, especially still for the southeast, is that flooding component. All of these counties you see here in red under flash flood warnings. Many of these areas have picked up at least eight to 10 inches of rain just in the last 48 to 72 hours. We're going to be adding even more rain on top of that. So, you still have that high risk for flooding for today across those pink regions, and even some of the areas around it, may not be as high of a risk, but there is still a risk in general, and then tomorrow, another risk, a moderate, but notice, it shifts more into the northeast, states like Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, really going to be the focal point there. And here you can see, all of that moisture beginning to spread off to the north. You're looking at widespread totals of two to four inches. But, some spots not out of the question to get five, six, maybe even seven inches before a lot of that moisture finally moves away. Here is a look at the system again, very slow so far, but in about 24 hours from now, the bulk of it will already spread into the Mid-Atlantic and then into the northeast by the time we get to Friday evening. In fact, by very early Saturday morning, the moisture is really just left right there, along coastal regions of Massachusetts and up into Maine, everywhere else, finally starting to dry back out, and they certainly need that drier air. Tropical Storm Debby just holding on at about 40 miles per hour for those sustained winds, but that forward speed now up to 10 miles per hour, much faster than we have seen this system move in the last several days, and that's really what's going to give those folks in the southeast a much needed break.",
