      "sentences": "A tale of two numbers for Joe Biden and the economy. First, the strong jobs numbers with no sign yet of a downturn.Next, a new poll showing that the majority of voters are still feeling the sticker shock of the last few years. Also, President faces doubts about his handling of foreign policy, especially on the divisive issue of Israel's war in Gaza. We'll look at how that could factor in for Biden and the Republicans. And we'll speak to his South Carolina State Representative who has known Nikki Haley for decades, and ask why she still struggles to overtake Trump in a state she used to govern. Good day, everyone. I'm Audie Cornish, in for Kasie Hunt, to our viewers watching around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, February 2, and there are just 22 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, and 276 days until Election Day. So, this is today's STATE OF THE RACE. So, the new jobs numbers show the U.S. economy is strong. So, why do so many voters feel the opposite? Well, in a brand new CNN poll, we do this hypothetical matchup, and find Donald Trump has the edge over President Biden, 49 percent to 45 percent. The other number we're watching, the 26 percent of Americans surveyed who say, yes, the economy is starting to recover, and that might not sound like much, but it's actually an improvement over the 20 percent who said the same last summer. And no one is hearing more about America's bleak view of the economy than the Biden campaign. So, the question is, what do they do about it? With more on those job numbers, we've got CNN Matt Egan, who joins us now from New York. So, walk us through what do we mean when we say by good. How does it compare?",

The student loan is huge for younger voters, and we know that that is a very particularly important coalition that President Biden needs to continue to have support him. Right?

It seems so. And how about the party of America First? How are they faring on foreign policy questions on the campaign trail? Well, a new CNN poll just out today finds 41 percent of Americans support Mr. Biden's handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while just 34 percent support the way he has responded to Israel's war with Hamas. Donald Trump's challenger for the Republican nomination is a former UN Ambassador. So, Nikki Haley capitalizes on that by talking up her own foreign policy chops, even though in CNN polls in Iowa and New Hampshire found that less than 15 percent of Republican voters listed foreign policy is their most important concern. So, our panel is back with us to talk more. So, Matt, I want to start with you, because I have always found the sort of what the policies are that follow America First, to be confusing in terms of like, where do you push for democracy?

They are making that short flight to Dover Air Force Base where the dignified transfer will take place a little bit later this afternoon, around 1:30. But, right before the dignified transfer, the President will have some time to meet privately with the families of those three fallen U.S. service members. He has a little bit over an hour on his schedule for that meeting. It would give him an opportunity to hear their personal stories and concerns about the death of their loved ones. Now, the President did place a phone call to the families of Sergeant William Rivers as well as those two specialists, Kennedy Sanders and Breonna Moffett, on Tuesday. And one thing the White House said was that the President gauged whether they would be interested in having him on hand for these dignified transfers, and all three families supported him being there. And in one of those phone calls, we got some very rare footage, insight into how these phone calls take place.

Now, this will be the second time President Biden is attending a dignified transfer. Back in 2021, he was at Dover Air Force Base when the remains of those 13 U.S. servicemembers who were killed in a terrorist attack in Afghanistan returned back to the United States. That was a meeting that he had with families at the time that was quite raw with emotion and anger. There were a lot of families frustrated with the President's handling of the drawdown in Afghanistan. But, the President today is on hand at Dover Air Force Base with the support of the families who have said that they would like for him to be there. I'll also note that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown will also be on hand for both that meeting and for the dignified transfer. And this all comes as the U.S. has already made a decision, the President told me earlier in the week, about how it will respond to that attack that led to the death of these three U.S. service members in Jordan.

They're trying to say that Nikki is not conservative. She is the only conservative in the race. People forget, Donald Trump was a registered Democrat for years. He gave money to Hillary. But yet, the narrative is Nikki is not Republican enough, and that's just unbelievable, because all the people that were here before that hated her, to include my colleagues in the House and Senate, realize that she shook things up. She was very conservative and she wouldn't let the good old boys get by with what they've always done. That's the message that we need to break through. Cult, I mean, excuse me with a slip there with cult. Trump has a stranglehold. It's like a cult with his individuals. He has got strong support. We're just having to reach out to them and explain to them, look, do you want it to be a revenge tour for the next four years, or you want it to be about what America is about, how we can move forward and have it for eight years under Nikki Haley?",

He didn't even get that done. Nikki understands there is policy that's involved. She is not out there doing the sound bites that other candidates do. But, apparently, that resonates here in politics and in South Carolina. I'd like to say this, and you know this as well, but a consultant years ago told me, a South Carolina consultant can take a choirboy and make him look like a crack at it. So, the ads, the hits that you see currently going around Trump and his surrogates, (inaudible), he has got other things to do than be in South Carolina, but his surrogates are there with all these talking points, and it's ridiculous.
