      "sentences": "Well, Boris, this was a little bit of a surprise. The FBI Director does an annual all-hands meeting with employees around the country. And what happened today was he moved up that traditional meeting that he does. And in this case, he announced that he was planning to resign. He's resigning at the end of the Biden term, which is, of course, January 20th, and ahead of the arrival of the new president, Donald Trump.Now, as you pointed out, Donald Trump had already made clear that he plans to replace Christopher Wray, that he was unhappy with the leadership of the FBI. And he had already chosen Kash Patel, who has begun making the rounds on Capitol Hill, to be confirmed as the next FBI director. The FBI director held a meeting last hour with employees and here is some of what he said. He said, \"After weeks of careful thought, I have decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission - the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important, so - to how we do our work.\" Now, one of the things that we know behind the scenes that's been happening, Boris, is that the director has been meeting with people he knows, people he trusts inside the Bureau, to try to figure out how best to do this. The consideration here was, do you resign before January 20, or do you wait for Donald Trump to come in and do the actual firing? And in the end, the director decided that one of the things he wanted to do was to find a way to say goodbye to the employees. He's been serving there, obviously, close to seven years, off the 10-year term. Part of the pushback that he was getting inside the Bureau and from people here at the Justice Department was, you know, you can't just leave, because that normalizes the idea that you can just replace FBI directors when you just don't like the - what they're doing or their work. Donald Trump, of course, fired James Comey in 2017, and he appointed Chris Wray. Chris Wray still had three more years left on that 10-year term. But some of that consideration, I think, changed over the last few days. You started seeing Republicans in Congress, Chuck Grassley, for instance, sending a letter saying that he lacked confidence in Chris Wray and the FBI leadership. That is part of what you see maybe changing the calculation here for the FBI Director.",

And I asked him, you know, what is your initial reaction to this news? And he said, this is probably for the best.Now, he called Wray an honorable guy. He said the politicization of the Justice Department was something that in his view had happened before Wray had actually taken over. But he said clearly Trump did not have confidence in the current FBI director. And he said this was probably the most straightforward and best thing for the department. I think you heard that echoed in what Evan said that Wray delivered to his employees earlier today. But one thing to keep in mind here is that this was all coming amid the backdrop of Republican senators like Sen. Cornyn meeting this week with Kash Patel. And Cornyn told me just a couple of days ago that barring any unforeseen circumstances, he was prepared to potentially vote for Kash Patel. Now, he was asked, you know, if Kash Patel gets this job, are you confident that he is going to be able to return the Department of Justice to being an agency that Americans, including MAGA World, can support and think is not politicized? And he said time is really going to tell. He did not give a definitive answer. And that is coming from someone who said that he is prepared to vote for Kash Patel in this moment, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I also talked to Sen. Ted Cruz, another member of the Judiciary Committee, who is a Republican, who said, look, this is the best thing, because the writing was on the wall. This is where we knew it was headed. It's better for Christopher Wray, perhaps, that he'd make this decision, rather than be forced into it in just a couple of weeks.",

But I'm glad that he is going out on his terms and he's setting the tone.The FBI was under very good leadership under Director Wray for seven years and most and half of my career. So it was a good administration, it was a good organization. Like any other organization, there's always room for improvement. And I believe a new director will change some things up and it will be an improvement. But I'm not too surprised about this resignation. He does these town halls from time to time.

You know, he's got a large step from what he was doing as a chief of staff to running a 35,000-person organization.I think a lot of his statements that he said in podcasts before, I don't think he can - he can't do that. He can't shut down the FBI headquarters and send all 7,000 employees into the field. Because 6,000 of them - 6,000 of those employees are not gun-carrying agents, so that can't be done. So I think that he, you know, can come in. I hope he listens to those that are there. I hope he learns about the organization from the inside. He has his opinions about the organization, which are rightfully so. The FBI needs improvements. And I will be the first one to say that there are problems at the DOJ, there are problems at the FBI, and that those things can be changed. But the most important thing is I hope he comes in, listens to those that are there and he changes - he makes the changes he wants to change. But at the end of the day, no matter what - I know that the - and I talk to a lot of the street agents that are still in the field, they're going to continue to uphold the Constitution, and they're going to continue to follow the lawful orders, all of those that are above them.",

He talks about illegal - working diligently to illegally impeach and indict him. I wonder what you make of those criticisms of Wray, if fundamentally that search of Mar-a-Lago was ordered by a court, it was approved by a grand jury, signed off on by a judge.

Evidence had to be shown, probable cause had to be shown, all the tracks of the investigation up until that point had to be shown to the court before it was a legally signed off warrant, a search warrant, and to conduct a search at Mar-a-Lago.So I believe that Director Wray, and I'm sure he had the final approval on the search, and at the end of the day, he's going to be the fall guy because he's the director of the FBI at the time of the search.

Well, with the ballistic match to the shell casings found on the ground there, that puts the gun and the prints in New York, and then the gun and the person whose prints they - those are in Pennsylvania. So, when you hear statements that the defense attorney is making, and that's his job, which is, you know, there's no indication that my client is the person involved, if this physical and forensic evidence is what it - is meant to be, that puts him in both places.

And both of them came out not in the records. So, in this case, they now know who that print belongs to, according to police, and they now know that those shell casings belonged to the gun that was with him when he was picked up in McDonald's.
