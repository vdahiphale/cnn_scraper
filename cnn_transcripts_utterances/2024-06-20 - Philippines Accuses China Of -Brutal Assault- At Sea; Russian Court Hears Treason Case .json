A recent survey finds 46 percent, nearly half, of large U.S. firms plan to use AI within the next year to do work that was previously done by humans.And it's not just the easy things. It can mean invoices, financial reporting, writing news releases, and building marketing campaigns. Companies say they want more quality and they want more output, but they also want to cut the cost and complications of human workers. Let's discuss with CNN media correspondent and real-life human, Sara Fischer. She's also a senior media reporter for Axios. All right.

So what you're going to see is AI is going to be used to make points of friction in the supply chain go away.And that can be in any job function, whether it's manufacturing or if it's in a white-collar type of role, but it's not going to replace so many jobs just yet for a few reasons. One, AI is still so new. So part of what we're going to have to do is add humans to actually run and manage the AI. The other thing is that AI has a lot of safety and sort of guardrail concerns. And so we're going to need humans to help build applications so that we can manage it correctly. So I actually don't think that we're going to see a net loss of jobs in the near future. What you're going to see is jobs transitioning to be managing the workforce with AI? The question, though, becomes, what are the lever implications of that, right? Especially for unionized jobs. If you're going to have to change your role, do you get paid the same? Do you want to have a different type of type of job? That's the actual concern in the near future.",

And so what's happening is companies are adopting this at a very fast clip, but we do not have some sort of broader policy idea about how are we going to manage this for society. You know, not just jobs, but things like managing bias, things like managing innovation, things like managing waste. All those things need to be addressed. As we completely shift society around AI, not only are we not ready, we also have this as a global problem. Like a lot of other countries are trying to figure out rules and all of these rules are very different. So if you're a big global company, you're trying to implement AI to adhere to some standards in some countries, some standards that don't exist in others.

So they were -- had quite a long journey. And its warm conditions and rough roads and then the transfer at the border was unique thing. Thank goodness that there's a lot of preparation. So that it was expedited. And really half the expected time through the border. So that went well.

DENNIS CHRISTEN, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF ANIMAL WELLBEING &amp; BEHAVIOR, GEORGIA AQUARIUM: Yes, absolutely. Urgency and complexity as well. Because Keith and I have worked together quite a bit in moving these types of animals, but we're pretty detail-oriented to make sure that it goes as well as can be expected. And the details on the front end of this were really hard to assemble because we getting information and little blips. The timeframe was very urgent. Getting resources, equipment, supplies to Kharkiv was almost impossible. And just we had to adapt our approach to be able to move these animals in a safe manner as possible with whatever resources we had available. So it was a very MacGyver-type scenario where we just kind of had to go outside of our comfort zone to make sure that were able to pull this off and work together with an amazing team. And can't say enough about the Ukrainian staff that were caring for those animals and getting them really to the border where we were able to help take them the rest of the way.",

So they were very much in peril. And it's just amazing that they're now out of that situation. Daniel Garacia, can you talk a little bit about the delicate health and what that means and what that means for the long term or if these are just short-term concerns? GARCIA-PARRAGA: Yes, well, basically, before this kind of transports, we always check the animals first and be sure that the animals are in very good medical conditions and basically in a good immune status to tolerate distress of the transport. Because of course, getting the animals out of the medium and moving them into another place for adaptation and it means some level of stress. And in this case, we were totally blind. So basically, we were -- we had some reports from their blood work in Ukraine with some basic data. But we really need to proceed with quite deep sampling as soon as they arrived here in their new habitat before putting them with the other whales. And taking up the generally status and all infectious diseases that could be transmitted to our -- our other whales. So generally we were greatly surprised that besides the stress and exposure, these animals to the bomb being, the noises. They were telling us that sometimes they were maintaining half diet to guarantee that the fish supplies stay as long as possible in case they will not receiving any further fish. The water temperature there in Ukraine was really high because they losed the capacity to chill the waters. They were 26 degrees. That is I think equivalent 77 Fahrenheit. That is pretty high for beluga whales. They are Arctic animals. [14:55:10] So the animals were somehow compromised at different levels. But whenever we take -- take them up here, as soon as they arrive, and based on the preliminary results, they are quite OK. They are a little bit slim. Certainly, are belugas and we believe that we keep the requirements are in a better body condition, I would say. But so far, I mean, the animal seems to be adapting well. The male is eating already and we will hope that we managed to recover them good.",
