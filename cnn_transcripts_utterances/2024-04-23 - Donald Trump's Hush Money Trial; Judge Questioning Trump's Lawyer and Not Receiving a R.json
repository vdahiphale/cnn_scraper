Right now, you see Todd Blanche saying, \"No, he's attacking the people and the system for not prosecuting Michael Cohen for lying.\" That's because they're talking about a post where Trump went after and asked why the district attorney here, Alvin Bragg, who brought this case, did not prosecute Michael Cohen for lying here.So, they are going through every specific post that Trump has. And CNN's Paula Reid is back here with me. And Paula, what's notable is Judge Merchan is kind of going through what we have seen, you know, Trump do on social media, his kind of tactics that you obviously, we remember well from the Trump White House. But when Trump says, well, I just found this. I just saw this. And Trump posted that the other day saying, I just saw this statement from Stormy Daniels from six years ago where she was denying having a sexual encounter with Donald Trump. And Todd Blanche is now arguing there are two systems of justice saying that Allen Weisselberg, a former CFO of the Trump Org. and arguing about what happened to him. He's obviously in jail right now. And the judge is arguing to Todd Blanche, there are no -- there's two systems of justice going on in this courtroom. It's not going well for Todd Blanche.",

He is trying to make the best argument he can in a situation that his client has made pretty unwinnable for him.And he, what he is trying to do is make macro arguments. About the constitution, about the system as you see there, and the unfairness. But the judge wants to go micro and go post by post by post. And arguably, Kaitlan, some of these posts are indefensible in the context of the gag order, and that's why the judge is getting really frustrated. COLLINS:  And -- I mean -- but to the fact that this is where this argument is right now, where the judge is saying, oh, are you arguing that there's two systems of justice happening right now here in this courtroom? Because obviously that's what this judge cares about. He's not arguing about the broader, you know, justice system.

And then this was a very important moment when the judge said there is an active action required to repost things and he doesn't buy that by calling it a repost. Your client can wash your hands of it. That seems to be a reference to the Truth Social post where Trump was quoting Jesse Watters, who is a Fox commentator who was saying that perhaps the jury has been stacked with Democrats who lied their way onto the jury. The judge not buying some of the explanations coming from former president and his legal team. And Merchan said at one point he wants to hear an assertion, this is important, under oath that Trump believed he wasn't violating the gag order when he made the posts at issue now. So, it sounds like the judge is turning up the heat a little bit on the former president. I want to talk about this a bit further. Former Trump Campaign Advisor and CNN Senior Political Commentator David Urban joins me now to discuss. Our legal panel back with us, Elliot and Joey. David, let me go to you first. You -- you've been dealing with Trump for a long time. I mean, you know that he is -- he's pretty much on top of what goes out on social media under his name.

David Pecker was the chairman and CEO of American Media Incorporated. You'll hear them referred to as AMI. They're the company that runs the \"National Enquirer\", the famous or infamous tabloid. And the crux of David Pecker's testimony goes to this practice that they would engage in called catch and kill, where they would purchase the rights to a story that would have been unflattering to Donald Trump and then kill it and then not run it.

Now, we got a sense of David Pecker's testimony from when he started testifying yesterday. First thing he said that was interesting. He said for the tabloids, meaning \"National Enquirer\", we used checkbook journalism and we paid for stories, meaning they paid sources. They used the power of their finances to shape their coverage. Another thing David Pecker said is that the only thing that was important was the cover of the magazine. We've all been in the supermarket checkout line and seen the covers of those magazines. And finally, David Pecker said, Dylan Howard reported directly to me.
