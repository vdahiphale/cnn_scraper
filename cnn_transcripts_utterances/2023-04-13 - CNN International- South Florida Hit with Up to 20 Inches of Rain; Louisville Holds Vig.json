The Trump's deny any wrongdoing.Lawyers for the former president have asked a judge to delay the start of a sexual assault and defamation trial following Trump's historic indictment earlier this month.

Former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll opposes the delay request with her lawyer, calling it meritless. Carroll alleges that Trump raped her in the mid 1990s and defamed her while he was president. And he said that she made up the claim to boost sales of her book. Trump denies the accusations.

But if you look again at that close up, you can see a yellow arm band that is -- it shows it sort of loyalty to the Ukrainian military that is on one of the victims. They had their heads cut off, and it looks like their hands as well. A voice in Russian on the video says that says they've been killed, their heads have been cut off. There's laughter. Pro Russian social media channels have claimed that this video was filmed near Bakhmut. We, of course, have not been able to verify this. There's another video, which shows the actual act or seems to show the act of a beheading. The plant life as you can see in this video suggests that it might have been filmed in summer sometime ago. Perhaps we haven't been able to verify that, but you can see that white band around that soldier's leg that is the soldier actually carrying out the beheading that shows loyalty to the Russian military. And then we have another image, which shows a yellow armband again around the arm of the victim, very, very graphic. That again that yellow showing affiliation with the Ukrainian military. So, these we can't confirm where or when, or who, as of yet. As you said the Ukrainian security services are conducting an investigation. But really, really graphic points to potentially crimes carried out by Russia and the ongoing brutality of this war. And the videos themselves, Bianca, point potentially to part of this information war. Ukrainian officials are warning about the propaganda value of them. They might be used as a psychological operation to intimidate in this war.",
