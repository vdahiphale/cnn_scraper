Iran's supreme leader led the prayers at Tehran University, saying it's Iran's duty to avenge Ismail Haniyeh since he was killed on Iranian soil. He's expected to be buried in Doha, Qatar on Friday.The targeted strike on Haniyeh has caused widespread outrage with mass protests across the region. A Hamas spokesperson says Haniyeh was hit directly by a rocket in the room where he was staying in Tehran. Hamas vowed that Israel would pay the price, calling it a heinous crime. More now from CNN's chief U.S. security analyst, Jim Sciutto. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST (voice-over): The stunning assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran is a bold strike at the very top of Hamas leadership, but it is also a test of the relationship between Israel and the U.S., already strained by the ongoing war in Gaza. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Something we were not aware of or involved in. SCIUTTO (voice-over): Close observers of the region see an Israeli leader who now feels unencumbered by a U.S. president. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We're prepared for any scenario, and we'll stand united and determined against any threat. SCIUTTO (voice-over): Who's viewed in the region as a lame duck following his withdrawal from the presidential race. In the near term, the strike very likely disrupts the tenuous negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages. President Biden has made completing the deal a central feature of his final months in office. More broadly, in ordering assassination strikes abroad, the Israeli leader is showing his willingness to risk broadening the war. Senior U.S. official told me the Biden administration views such a risk as limited. The assessment is that none of the players, Israel, Iran or its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, truly want a regional war. On Wednesday, White House senior advisor John Kirby downplayed escalation fears.",

This is something that we've concerned about since the 7th of October.It's not like we're brushing off concerns at all. We're watching this very, very closely. SCIUTTO (voice-over): However, the recent history of the region shows that neither side ever fully understands the other's red lines. As each side retaliates against the other in increasingly aggressive ways, the danger of escalation grows. To that point today, a senior Iranian official tweeted: Undoubtedly, the Israeli occupying regime will pay a heavy price. Enter one final variable to the calculus. Benjamin Netanyahu himself. Even some Israelis question whether he wants to extend the fighting to delay any political reckoning for the October 7th attacks at home. Jonathan Dekel-Chen's 35-year-old son was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. He says Hamas and the Israeli leader don't truly want peace. And the stalling only helps Netanyahu's political future. JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, SON HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: I could find no legitimate reason other than to satisfy his domestic political partners to delay any kind of progress, real progress.",

That distances him from the calamity and debacle of October 7th and portrays this as some kind of a different narrative, as if this is a broad regional war. So he has a vested interest in turning it into a broad regional war. In that piece of footage that you just aired form him, notice that he takes credit for attacking the Houthis in western Yemen, for the assassination in Beirut of Fuad Shukr, the number two guy, allegedly the number two guy in Hezbollah, and for Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran the last night or a night and a half ago. It is not worthy that he's not saying anything about the hostages, anything about the ceasefire, not a thing about a framework, a plan for the day after, nothing. All he's talking about, claiming credit in this respect, is the continuation of the war. Now, as for the sense, on the one hand, people are happy about it, and it's natural and it's understandable. They feel good about this. It's revenge, it's vengeance, it's settling an account. That's fine, but that's not strategy. And people are beginning to ask whether or not a serious, deep, cost- effective calculation was processed, at least was done here, in terms of the likelihood of escalation. Because if it does escalate, and Jim Sciutto was absolutely right in the previous report, that people only think they understand the other side's red line. People only think they can control escalation, and people only think they actually have some magical power over the spiraling dynamic that this creates. And so I think the next 48 hours are critical. An Iranian response, which they vowed to do, that is limited, will be tolerated. An Iranian response that is not limited will not be tolerated. And before you know it, this expands. So the public opinion on the assassination of these two guys in Beirut and Tehran, respectively, decide people are going to change their mind if this escalates.",
