Very soon E. Jean Carroll will face the man she says unleashed his followers on her after she said he sexually assaulted her. Carroll will be testifying today as Donald Trump is sitting in the courtroom and also Donald Trump then will be also sitting before a jury who are tasked with determining how much money, if any, he will have to pay in damages. The former president just left Trump Tower minutes ago heading to the courthouse. His team is signaling that he could also testify sometime this week. TBD. We will see on that. During opening statements yesterday, Carroll's attorneys said that Trump used the \"world's biggest microphone\" -- also some of the world's biggest letters right there - to attack, humiliate and destroy her reputation and continues to do so. The attorney said that Donald Trump is still posting about Carroll on social media, even as the trial started yesterday. But Trump's lawyer quickly reminded the jury this case is only about two statements Trump made in 2019. CNN's Kara Scannell following all of this for us from the federal court in New York. Kara, what are we expecting to happen today?",

Now, the judge made clear, this case is not going to be a do-over of the sexual abuse and rape that occurred in 1996, but Carroll is going to be able to tell her story and say what happened to her after Trump made the statements in 2019 denying that he raped her, saying she wasn't his type and that she made up the allegations to sell her book.So, we expect Carroll will testify about how she was scared, how Trump's followers, as her lawyer put it, latched on to his message and then bombarded her with hate filled emails, mean tweets and threats that she says has caused her to sleep with a gun beside her bed. So, Carroll is expected to set the scene today of what the impact of those statements were, those kinds of messages that she received. Now, she will be, you know, as they say, on the witness stand telling her story to the jury. But while Donald Trump will be at the defense table facing her in the courtroom. So that will clearly lead to some extra dynamics that we did not see last year, adding to the intensity of the moment. And then Trump's lawyers will have the opportunity to cross-examine Carroll. Their defense in this case is made clear yesterday is that Carroll wasn't harmed. They're going to argue that her career actually prospered as a result of the notoriety and fame that she received from making these allegations against the former president. And they're trying to distance Trump from his followers, saying that he shouldn't be held responsible for the mean tweets, as they put it, that she had received. But clearly going to be a fairly tense moment today, potentially an emotional moment in this courtroom playing out with Donald Trump facing E. Jean Carroll as she tells her story. The fear she says she has faced and the first time, you know, this week that they are seeing each other in decades, Kate.",

And Donald Trump's team is going to argue that not only did she not suffer economically, but she actually benefited. Now, this is a pretty audacious defense. It could backfire. It could offend the jury. Keep in mind, the jury is just nine regular New York civilians. But they're going to go at her. And I think on the cross-examination you're going to see them putting her TV appearances in front of her, her book deal in front of her, and arguing this has raised her profile. If anything, you've profited economically and financially and therefore there are no damages. And, ultimately, it's a tough question and the jury is going to weigh that.",

Instead sort of speaking to the larger, political message, which is that he is a victim of a rigged system. So, will he testify? Well, that's going to be up to him and his lawyers to balance, you know, do we want to have potentially a trial loss here, right, antagonize the judge, maybe not make a great impression in front of the jury, to getting across our political message. He has done that in the past. Let's see how things go over the next few days because it's possible, but again legally there doesn't seem to be a lot of need. A lot of risk, little reward.

So, previously, there was a decision at the state level - at the state administrative level that Donald Trump should not be on the ballot there. And this is the process now where the courts get to review that, Donald Trump gets to challenge it.Now, of course, a lot of this is on hold because there's the Supreme Court going to be weighing in, the U.S. Supreme Court going to be weighing in related to Maine and Colorado. But as we are waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to act, things do get to have more procedures in the states, like in Maine, where the superior court will make a determination if Trump can be on the ballot there. And then there are other courts in Maine that can do that as well. An appeals court too. Separately, there are boards this week in other states that are meeting, including in Illinois this morning where there is a board that's going to be kicking off a process to look at a challenge to Donald Trump on the ballot. There's also going to be a meeting that's a little bit similar to that in Massachusetts happening tomorrow. And so all of these states are going to be figuring out what to do. But all eyes should really be on February 8th, which is when the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments. And we're going to get more of an inkling of what the nine justices on that court are thinking and how much they believe the U.S. Supreme Court should or could make a determination about what the individual states do. If states like Maine and Colorado can indeed decide to keep Trump off their primary ballots. Kate.",

As you mentioned, all of these candidates have events throughout the day. But really for Haley and DeSantis, it's trying to cut into what's essentially been Trump dominance up to this point. Now, when you look at the polls, Nikki Haley has the best chance in this state to at least pose a serious challenge to the former president. A lot of moderates in this state, also undeclared, or independent voters as they're known here, can vote in this as well. And she's polled very well with that demographic. Even - even further - or even better than the former president, particularly with moderate Republicans. But this is still a very steep hill to climb. And even with polls showing her within single digits of the former president, no poll has showed her ahead of the former president. That said, Nikki Haley has been a little bit of a controversy. But really over the fact of how she responded to whether America has had racism in the past and whether it is a racist country. Just take a listen to some of her comments, but also DeSantis' as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're not a racist country, Brian. We've never been a racist country. Our goal is to make sure that today is better than yesterday. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, the U.S. is not a racist country. And we've overcome things in our history. You know, I think the founding fathers, they established a set of principles that are universal. Now, they may not have been universally applied at the time, but I think they understood what they were doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But also, let's be clear here, whether it's slavery or segregation, there were periods where literally racism was written into the fundamentals of this country.Now, whether that matters to the people that are actually heading to the polls in a few day, we're just going to have to see if that has any sort of impact at all. But regardless, this is the environment we're in, in the final stretch, where every marginal thing could change the mind of a particular, potentially valuable voter here in this state. And when you look at someone like former President Trump, he has been attacking Nikki Haley a little bit more and leading some to believe that it's because he sees her as a legitimate threat here, which would pair up with what Nikki Haley has been framing things as, which is essentially a two person race.

It runs contrary, frankly, to Nikki Haley's own family history. Her father is a Ph.D. in biology and could only find a job at a place called Voorhees College in South Carolina, an historically black college. The only place where they would hire him. His -- her mother was trained in law in India, but ended up starting a closing shop in South Carolina because other professional opportunities were not available to her. So, you know, look, they - they're going to do what they think they have to do to try and get votes.

New Hampshire is a more representative slice of the electorate from the Iowa caucus, which was 3.5 percent of the total population turned out. Here you've got independents who are the deciders in general elections. You've got moderates, who Nikki Haley won 63 percent of in Iowa. So, this is actually a better test of a general election candidate. But it all depends on turnout.
