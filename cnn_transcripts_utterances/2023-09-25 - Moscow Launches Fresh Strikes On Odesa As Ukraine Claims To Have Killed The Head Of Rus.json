      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Moscow launches fresh strikes on Odesaas Ukraine say they've killed the head of Russia's Black Sea fleet. Then, screenwriters could get back to work in the coming days as a tentative deal is reached with studios to end the nearly five-month long strike. Plus, U.S. border towns in crisis. Will the new U.S.-Mexico migrant deal help reduce the surge in crossings. We'll explore this hour. But first this evening, it has been dubbed Operation Crab Trap, and Ukrainian special forces says it was a devastating blow to Russia's military in occupied Crimea. Missiles rained down on Sevastopol if you remember on Friday. Ukraine says they killed dozens of officers, including the head of Moscow's Black Sea fleet. Admiral Viktor Sokolov is one of Russia's most seasoned Naval commanders, we can't verify claims about his death, but if he is alive, his whereabouts are unknown. Meanwhile, Russia stepped up attacks on Odesa overnight. Ukraine reports at least two people were killed after a grain warehouse was hit. Ukraine's Defense Ministry called it pathetic attempt to retaliate after the strike on Crimea. So let's put all of this into perspective, Our Sam Kiley has reported extensively from Ukraine, and he joins me now with the very latest. So, Sam, if truly, like we said, we cannot verify this, how much of a blow is the death of this Russian admiral in Crimea?",

But if they've killed over 30 senior officers in the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet, including the unit's commander, then that is a huge blow, not just in terms of the command and control structures, of the Russian Armed Forces, but also, indeed, of the morale. Now, if you can put that, Isa, in the context of other recent strikes by Ukraine that they have claimed to have sunk a diesel-powered submarine, also in Sevastopol and several other warships over the last year and a bit, or more than a year and a half now of war, all of this points to increasing levels of sophistication, not only of the Ukrainian special forces operations, but of their ability to use the weapons that they've been given in all probability. This was an attack using a star -- storm shadow cruise missile probably supplied by the United Kingdom or France, as namely French product, and kind of making the argument if you like ultimately, that they really deserve to get the longer-range missiles, the ATACMS as they're called here from the United States. And of course, we're expecting the decision on that from the White House fairly soon. So, a very important devastating blow, and on top of that, of course, you'll recall, Isa, indeed, we've talked about it --",

We are getting more information about what led theCanadian prime minister to probably link the Indian government to the assassination of a Sikh activist.

The accusation has set off a diplomatic firestorm with India vehemently denying the claim. But it's not the only controversy Mr. Trudeau's government is facing. Over the weekend, the speaker of Canada's House of Commons was forced to apologize after he praised the Ukrainian veteran who once fought in a Nazi military unit. Our Paula Newton joins us with the very latest from Ottawa.

And what they wanted was higher wages, specifically when it came to residuals and streaming and artificial  intelligence, this is a big one because a lot of these writers say they don't want to be or have scripts written by machines. They want to be the ones writing the scripts. And so, a source did tell us that artificial intelligence was really one of the last sticking points in these negotiations. And the thing is, a lot of people don't understand artificial intelligence or don't know how it's going to develop. So that's why it appears it took a little bit longer when it came to that issue. But what happens next is that tomorrow, likely, you're going to see leadership votes. After those leadership votes, then the agreement will be made public, and once it's made public, then the writers will have the chance to ask questions and see if they like it or not. After that, then it gets -- goes to a vote, and it could be ratified by the writers. Now, the problem here is that, even if the writers do come to an agreement and vote yes on it, the actors are still on strike. And so, you are not going to see productions really going back to normal any time soon. The only thing you may be able to see return to normal are late-night shows or talk-shows. But you're not going to have any actors as -- going to have any actors as guests. So, there's still a big question as to what happens for the rest of TV shows for the year, and movies next Summer.

This bottleneck, Isa,Darien Gap, it's a stretch of treasures jungle that leads not just from Colombia and the Panama, but actually from the entire of South America into North America, Central America, and then of course, North America and the U.S. South America has worked as a tank, as a safe area for Venezuelan migrants for so many years. And now this migration route has opened up and it's been taken by hundreds of thousands of people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POZZEBON (voice-over): The journey for the American dream starts before dawn. At 4:00 a.m., this group of migrants is getting ready to cross the Darien Gap, the stretch of tropical forests between Colombia and Panama. In the darkness, a loudspeaker invites each migrant to sing the anthems of the countries that have left behind. The voices of the Venezuelans resonate the loudest. At sunrise, the gates of this makeshift migrant camp open up and the group advances into the forest. Panamanian authorities estimate that, on average, more than 1,400 people have crossed this thick stretch of forest every day this year, already more than double the numbers in 2022. Most of those crossings are Venezuelans, but migrants from Ecuador, Haiti, Colombia, and even China also attempt these routes. Hundreds of thousands of personal stories, but one shared goal. RICARDO RUIZ, VENEZUELAN MIGRANT (through translator): I have a lump in my throat, but I'm doing this for my family, for a better future. POZZEBON (voice-over): The hike lasts several days across rivers and jungle mud, but the prospect of making it to the United States over 2,000 miles north from here is stronger than ever.",

Well, let's take a look now at exactly what Stefano was talking about, the other side of the coin, the surge in illegal crossings along the southern border of the U.S. Mexico and the U.S. have now struck a deal with Mexico agreeing to the port migrants in its border cities to their home countries. Mexico's president says he also wants a face-to-face meeting with his counterpart, Joe Biden, talk about the situation. Many border towns are feeling the strain, as we've shown you here on the show, the mayor of El Paso, Texas, the city is reaching a breaking point with more than 2,000 migrants coming there each day. Texas lawmakers are planning to hold a press in less than an hour. Of course, we'll bring that to you when that gets underway. Our Rosa Flores is in Houston for the very latest. So, Rosa, let's talk about this agreement. And how significant is this agreement between Mexico and the U.S.? Just give us some details.",

In essence, what Mexican officials have agreed to is a \"decompression\" of the northern cities in Mexico that border the U.S. And what they mean by that is that they plan to deport migrants from their border cities back to their home countries. So, in essence, what that means is that they could reroute those migrants back to their home countries before they arrived to the United States. Now, these types of tactics have been used in the past, and they've been very controversial with immigration advocates and human rights organizations being very critical of these tactics being used on the border to curb migration. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FLORES (voice-over): From Mexico to the riverbanks of Eagle Pass, thousands of migrants have crossed the border, waiting across the Rio Grande, crawling under the razor wire, and overwhelming Eagle Pass and other southern Texas cities.",

And Isa, we learned more about that from a senior CBP official who says that in part what the U.S. will be doing are mirror patrols on the border. And what that means is that law enforcement in Mexico and law enforcement in the United States will be patrolling in the same areas. And so migrants will be either apprehended on the Mexican side or on the US side. And on the U.S. side, we know that law enforcement here will be applying the laws of the United States.

And so what's happening here, and what you can really see on paper as you're describing, is that Mexico is having to do that diplomatic work with countries in Latin America that would be very difficult for the United States to do. And this, of course, raises the question, is Mexico doing the U.S. work south of the border to control the flow of migration? I think it's a fair question that we need to be asking, because that is the net effect. That is what we're seeing, or that is what we could be seeing if Mexico goes along with this agreement, of, in essence, deporting migrants back to their home countries after they've already reached their northern border.",

This comes after Channel 4 andthe Sunday Times reveal he had been accused of rape and sexual assault. These allegations date from 2006 to 2013. Since they were published, the Met Police say it's received a number of claims of other sexual offenses by Brand. Brand has denied the allegations and said all sexual encounters were consensual. He was demonetized by YouTube following the accusations. The video platform Rumble, which hosts Brand's podcast as a member of the U.K. S Parliament, asked it to do the same. Rumble has so far refused. Well, the U.S. government remains in the brink of the potential, I should say, shut down. Government funding will run out in just five days unless lawmakers can strike a deal. A shutdown could have a significant impact on all Americans including millions of federal employees, many of whom will not be paid during an impasse.

And even if they do, it's dead on arrival in the Senate. So for Kevin McCarthy, he's really trying to live day by day at this moment. There's not really a clear plan to avoid a shutdown because at the end of the day, really, what it's going to take to keep the government funded is work between Democrats and Republicans, work between the Senate and the House. And at this juncture, Kevin McCarthy has shown no interest in going down that path. And the reason he doesn't want to work with Democrats is because number of his conservative hardliners have threatened to oust him as speaker if he does try to cut a bipartisan deal. So, that is the predicament that Kevin McCarthy finds himself in right now and ultimately it may come down to Kevin McCarthy having to choose between keeping the government open or keeping his speakership.",

      "sentences": "The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft left Earth back in 2016. Since then, it has traveled more thanfour billion miles to the asteroid Bennu and back before finally releasing a capsule over the United States on Sunday morning. Inside that capsule is about half a pound worth of rocks dust from the asteroid itself. And this is really the first time that NASA has ever done anything like this. This capsule re-entered the earth's atmosphere traveling about 27, 000 miles per hour, it hit temperatures of about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit before finally touching down at a very gentle 11 miles per hour in a remote stretch of the desert in Utah with the help of some very big parachutes. From there, the recovery team swooped in to make sure that the capsule was intact and safe and not leaking any toxic fumes. It was deemed to be intact and safe. And so from there, they moved it to a clean room. And from there, they're going to be transporting it to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas where they will open up the capsule for the public to see. And it's also where scientists are going to be spending the next few years studying what is inside and this is important because scientists believe that ancient asteroids like Bennu contained the seeds of life that this asteroid, in a way, perhaps might have acted like a seed when it, or an asteroid like it, hit the earth and had molecules like, you know, water, carbon, things like that, which then seeded the earth and then proved to be the genesis for life as we know it. So there's a very important scientific component to this. But there's also a the planetary defense component because Bennu is an asteroid that has a very small chance of actually hitting planet earth in the year 2182, but that is about more than 150 years from now so scientists have time, but again very small chance but it's enough to where NASA wanted to get an up close and personal look at the asteroid itself.
