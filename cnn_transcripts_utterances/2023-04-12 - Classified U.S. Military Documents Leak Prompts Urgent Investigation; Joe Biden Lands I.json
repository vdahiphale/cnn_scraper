The leaks have reached across the globe revealing U.S. spying on adversaries including Russia and China but also on U.S. allies and partners among them Israel, South Korea and many more.Some of the documents reviewed by CNN offers sensitive details on Ukraine's military capabilities or lack thereof, including critical shortages of air defenses and overall casualty assessments after more than a year of war. Ukrainian officials downplayed the significance of the leaks saying some of the information wasn't secret at all. But a source close to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the military has already changed some of its plans because of the leaks. In a new set of leaked documents obtained by the Washington Post, the U.S. learned Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was considering providing 40,000 rockets to Russia for its war in Ukraine, but to do so quietly to avoid problems with the West since Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid. CNN has not seen the documents and cannot confirm their authenticity. Egyptian state media called the report an informational absurdity while the Kremlin called it another hoax and the U.S. says they've seen no signs of Egypt providing lethal aid to Russia, but it underscores the far reaching consequences of the leaks.

And so he will meet with Rishi Sunak, as well, on the side. That will certainly be a main topic of discussion as they speak. But certainly both of those leaders would have hoped that this disagreement would have been settled by the time President Biden arrived here in Northern Ireland. He's only here for around 15 hours. And you do hear some disappointment that he isn't spending more time talking about the Good Friday Agreement, the legacy of this, a U.S. brokered deal that did bring an end to that sectarian violence. Of course, you also see the lingering remnants of some of that violence ahead of the President's visit. You saw clashes between Republican dissidents in Derry on Monday. And I think one thing that was so disappointing to some people here was how young some of those dissidents were. They were really just young teen -- teenagers, really the sort of people for whom the Good Friday Agreement was really supposed to change things.

Now that would work a departure from decades long protocol which has so far allowed migrants to seek refuge upon reaching U.S. soil And it also has echoes of the Trump administration which released a similar policy that was dubbed \"the transit ban\". Now administration officials reject the comparison saying that their world would have acceptance and that they have simultaneously opened up legal pathways for migrants to come to the United States. But that has done little to quell the concerns of asylum officers who say they will be morally and legally conflicted if this is to take effect next month. Now asylum officers have told me quote, \"at this point I can't tell the difference between Biden immigration policy and Trump immigration policy.\" Another asylum officer told me it quote, \"feels like groundhog day,\" going on to say if this is just going to be repeating over and over, there's so many other things I could be doing. Now the union that represents federal asylum officers also filed a comment to this regulation in which they called the rule draconian and went on to say that it would compel officers to violate U.S. and international law. Now this has been a major concern and the urgency here comes with the end of the COVID-19 border restriction that is set to end on May 11th when the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Now that authority has allowed officials to turn certain migrants away at the U.S. southern border. When that goes away, the administration is seeking alternatives so that they can try to manage the flow of migration across the western hemisphere. But for many asylum officers, that could also mean putting them in a position they thought they would no longer be in after Biden's predecessor and that for some may lead them to leave their jobs.
