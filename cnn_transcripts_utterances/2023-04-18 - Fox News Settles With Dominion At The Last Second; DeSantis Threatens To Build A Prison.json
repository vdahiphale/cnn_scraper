      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in to this hour where we bring you \"Tomorrow's News Tonight.\" We have our great lineup of reporters to share their scoops. Here with me tonight, we have Sara Fischer, Jessica Dean, Athena Jones, and Kylie Atwood.Okay, so let's dive right into the huge box settlement. Fox has to pay more than $787 million in damages to Dominion. The dramatic announcement came just moments before the trial was set to begin. Sara Fischer was in the courtroom all day at that moment that this happened. So, Sara, I want to hear everything that happened in the courtroom. But first, let's just talk about what's going to happen because this is not the end. It feels like it's the end for Dominion, certainly, but it's not the end. There are other legal challenges on the horizon for Fox. So, what should we all be watching for?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a big thing. So, they're settling now for $787 million. But this is just one lawsuit that they're settling with Dominion. They're facing several other lawsuits from Smartmatic, another voting machines company. That lawsuit is even bigger than the Dominion one. That's $2.7 billion. They're also facing a lawsuit from one of their former producers, Abby Grossberg, who said that the Fox News lawyers had manipulated her testimony leading up to the trial.So, Fox is going to be facing a whole bunch of legal challenges and how it acted today in making the settlement can and probably will impact those other lawsuits. The other one I'll mention, Alisyn, is that Reuters reported yesterday that some members of Fox's shareholder group are also looking to do a potential investigation into Fox's board, basically to see if they were responsible for overseeing this coverage, should they potentially be held liable for picking up the check for some of the settlement damages as opposed to passing that off to the company in which shareholders would essentially be contributing to paying that out. So, this is not over for Fox. In fact, this is probably just the beginning for Fox. But it's a historic day. This trial was supposed to last for six weeks. And at the very last minute, right before opening statements started, we got a settlement.",

So, in terms of whether or not Fox is going to have to unveil more, the answer is potentially yes.Now, the other thing to make note of is that this isn't all totally over either. You know, they had assigned a sort of special prosecutor to look into Fox's -- the way that Fox had presented the role of Rupert Murdoch. You know, I think that's still going to proceed. And so, there's still little implications that are going to fall out here in terms of what's -- we're not totally done. So, things could still come out.

Even with that situation in mind, Fox still didn't even want pictures of their key hosts and executives walking into the building. That should tell you everything you need to know about what lengths they were going to go to protect their people. ATWOOD:  I also wonder like what happens to Dominion now. I mean, obviously, as you were saying, like they won, they got more than $700 million, that is a huge sum of money, but in the grand scheme of things, are these conservative counties that we have seen dropping these Dominion Voting Systems now going to stick with Dominion?

And they wouldn't be descriptive as to what those actual options that they're drawing up look like. But the official also was very clear minded. And this is a sad reality. But in saying that it's probably going to take a while. And that's because in these cases, these things don't happen overnight. These negotiations take a long time.

Evan Gershkovich was doing incredible reporting in Russia. He was really getting underneath the hood of what's happening in the Kremlin. He was reporting on people who are pushing back on President Putin. You know, some of his stories were just remarkable to read because they were so well done.

We've already spent the money. They just need to raise the limit. This is usually not that big of a deal. It is turning into a really big deal. And so now, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy today told Manu Raju, my colleague, he does have the votes to pass, um, to pass something in the House. The problem is it's not going anywhere in the Senate and it just kind of continues this circle. And so, what we need to keep an eye on is the clock is ticking.

And so, we'll have to wait and see if -- what they do after this deadline. Will they block the blocking of access to mifepristone while the legal battles play out which are going to take months and months? That's going to be really, really important. And I should mention, even the World Health Organization has weighed in. They did not name the U.S. by name, but they did say that their concerns about women's rights to sort of control their bodies and to access to health care is -- could be restricted here.",
