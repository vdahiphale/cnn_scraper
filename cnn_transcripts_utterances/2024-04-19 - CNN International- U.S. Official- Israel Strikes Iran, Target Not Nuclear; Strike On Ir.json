      "sentences": "Returning to our top story, a U.S. official tells CNN that Israel has carried out military strikes on Iran in an apparent retaliation for Iranian missile attack on Saturday.Flights have resumed in Iran after reports of explosions were reported in the Isfahan region, the city of Isfahan is believed to be home to Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program, as well as the country's biggest nuclear research facility which operates three small Chinese supplied research reactors. Iranian media say the nuclear facilities in the region are secure, while the U.S. official says those facilities weren't the target is still no comment from Israel's military. Nick Paton Walsh, our chief international security correspondent, is with us. We're probably not going to hear much from the Israelis, are we?",

      "sentences": "I would imagine probably not. You might do from a higher level for them to bear to establish internally that it was them that this was the retaliation that some hardliners have been demanding or there's a long history of Israel's doing things like that and nothing the rest of the world essentially draw its own conclusions.You might argue, it's pretty obvious that these explosions from them, they've had long history of covert activity, assassinations blast over the past decade or so. It's only now that there's been this expectation of overt direct confrontation that the focus has changed. So now I think you might possibly here some kind of indirect confirmation or even a large public statement. But I think the general tone now is everybody is trying to move on to the more pressing concerns rather than try and get into a direct war.",

      "sentences": "I mean, the taboo is being broken, right? The whole notion of we're not going to do this is gone. They've done it although arguably the assassinations you've seen that have clearly been Israel over the past multiple years -- yes, there's a fig leaf there, but its still want to country usually attacking another.I think really you see large conflagrations when both parties want it, they're always off ramps. There's particularly in the Middle East, long practice channels to try and calm things down. I think it's a stage here -- yes, we were certainly a new chapter in that particular confrontation between Israel and around, but one important thing to keep an eye on Max is flaring tension to Israel's north with Hezbollah that has been rumbling now for months. It seems to get worse periodically and then calm down but has been particularly bad in recent days. And so while I think its possible to look at the messaging, look at the limitations of what both sides have done here. Remember there's a lot of reporting suggests that the Iranians indeed tipped off. Many people in the region by what was going to happen before they launched that drone and missile strike to try and less than potentially the casualties or its impact or enable more interception. There's much capacity here for miscalculation, hot tempers, and remember, we do have pretty hard line people in charge in most areas here. So, yeah, a lot that could go wrong. But looking at how tonight as play it out does seem that Israel is calibrated this, and Iran has accepted that&amp; is now potentially going to pretend nothing happened and move on.",

      "sentences": "I think that's certainly correct. I think that Israel's strike today on Iran was very limited. It deliberately avoided one of the most provocative targets for Tehran, which was Natanz, in Isfahan. It instead struck at military bases are around Isfahan. I think the Iranians have responded in a way that suggests that they don't want to escalate things. They're basically saying the attack never really happened or if it did happen, it was completely unsuccessful.So I think were both sides, they're creating an off-ramp which allows them to step back from the precipice. They're probably looking over that precipice and thing thinking, we really don't want to go into a massive war at this point. So, I think both sides will step back.",

You would have seen a much larger strike that would have been generated an Iranian counter response that would have led to this for tat escalation cycle that we're all concerned about.But instead, what the Biden administration said was were not going to support you. That's circumscribed Israel's military options to a degree because very, very little in the way of tanker or intelligence support, to support the operation. But it also really undermine the political foundation for Israel to be able to carry out a large strike. So I do think that diplomatic pressure from Washington probably did constrain Netanyahu's thinking on how they would actually retaliate.",

I mean, I think a precedent has been set on both sides now both sides have struck at each others territory is directly from their own territory and so do think that that means that its not unthinkable now that this sort of thing could happen again in the future, either by Iran launching attacks on Israel or vice versa. And I think the real gray zone here, the uncertainty is if what happens, for example, if Iran uses its proxy forces in Iraq or Syria against Israel all escalates the conflict along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, Syria, Hezbollah, does Israel then respond directly against Iran as it's done today? And that generates a counter response.So I do think to a degree the strikes by Iran against Israel and Israel against Iran have changed the dynamics of the Middle East. And I think it does bear caution that, you know, we could be in for a more unpredictable and dangerous future in the region.",

It's very clear to me that the efforts towards a ceasefire and the release of the hostages, maybe the hostages are no longer with us. They may have been killed or they're dead.But if the hostages are still alive, I don't see the hostages being released and I don't see a ceasefire happening anytime soon. So I do think a Rafah assault is likely and I think that's the Israelis will go in there very quickly, very decisively. But at the same time, the Israelis must be conscious of the fact that if they start causing yet fervor, civilian casualties in that area. And it's only going to pit the rest of the world against them. And undermine their diplomatic credibility and their support.",

Now, just a few hours before we started hearing reports of explosions in Iran, that country's top diplomat warned of a decisive response to any Israeli military actions. Iran's foreign minister delivered that message to members of the United Nations Security Council and in an exclusive interview with CNN's Erin Burnett. The diplomat describes Saturday's drone and missile strikes on Israel as defensive countermeasures. But he says Iran is capable of much more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HOSSEIN AMIR-ABDOLLAHIAN, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  our response to the Israeli regime was limited. And stayed within a minimum of frameworks, whereas we could have given a much harsher response to the Israeli regime. Following that, we announced that this response is within the framework of legitimate defense according to international laws. We will not continue. However, in case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level. It will be decisive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
