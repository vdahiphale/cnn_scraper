Matthew Colangelo laid out the prosecutor's theory of the case, which he said is about election fraud, pure and simple. He says it all started with a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump, his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and the former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker. The government alleges Pecker agreed to use the Enquirer to help Trump's campaign by buying and suppressing negative stories about him and by amplifying stories that were favourable to him.

In Kyiv, a TV tower was brought down by Russian missile strike. Ukrainian official say no one was hurt. Workers at the tower were taking shelter at the time of the strike.

The (UNINTELLIGIBLE) members paid their respects to fallen soldiers, laying flowers at a memorial.

Greene also said that Johnson betrayed not only Republicans, but the whole of the USA. Nonetheless, the U.S. military aid will be bigger this year compared to the past years. And of course, there is nothing good in that. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia's foreign minister going even further, threatening nuclear confrontation. SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): westerners are teetering dangerously on the brink of a direct military clash between nuclear powers, fraught with catastrophic consequences.
