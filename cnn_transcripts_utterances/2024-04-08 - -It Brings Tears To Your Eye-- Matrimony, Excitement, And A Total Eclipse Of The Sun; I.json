And later, the former president's latest stance on abortion that his former vice president today called a \"slap in the face.\" The fallout, plus a history of how his opinions have changed over the years. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We start with a stellar event today that plunged much of the United States into darkness and will not be repeated for more than 20 years. The total eclipse of the sun witnessed firsthand by tens of millions in the U.S., plus many more in Mexico and Canada. It was the rare event when people from all over could stop, look up and share a celestial moment together. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER (voice over): Total eclipse excitement began on the shores of Mexico, quickly spreading as the path moved northeast through Texas.

And the clouds here were just thin enough to make the prominence easier to see.They blocked out some of the very bright part of the sun or the rim around the moon.

Have you ever attended any rallies for Trump, have you attended any rallies against Trump and they're also asking if you belong to any fringe groups. They cite QAnon, the Proud Boys, but also Antifa.And one question they asked, which I thought was interesting and really specific to this case, is do you have any strong beliefs about whether a former president can be criminally charged in state court, because there are these questions about immunity and about whether the politics of going after a former president. I mean, another thing that is interesting here, the judge made it clear there will be no questions about political contributions, who you voted for or who you like.

You let one bad juror through, you're going to regret that for a long time. And what the judge and the court is trying to do with this document is suss out any undue biases. And it really sort of breaks into a couple parts.One of them is just basically the basics, the biographical basics, what type of job do you do, what's your family situation. But then it gets into, without quite asking, how do you feel about Donald Trump, do you love him or hate him, asking a lot of proxies for that. For example, where do you get your news, are you a member of any organizations. And then, as Kara said, are, have you been to a Trump rally. Are you part of any Trump email list? It also asks, have you been a part of any anti-Trump organization. Now, I don't know if Democrats count as anti-Trump, so there's a little bit of interpretation here. But what's going to happen is the jurors will fill out these questionnaires, and then it's sort of a guessing game.

I'll read you just part of what this 60-plus page filing from the Special Counsel says. He says, \"The President's constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed does not entail a general right to violate them.\" He goes on to say, \"The Framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former President, and all Presidents from the founding to the modern era have known that after leaving office they faced potential criminal liability for official acts.\"Now, former President Trump, Anderson, has claimed that if this prosecution is allowed to go forward, this is going to impair the presidency forever, including all former presidents. And Jack Smith pushes back against that argument here. I'll read you just another part of this. \"The petitioner is charged with crimes that, if proved at trial, reflect an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government. The effective functioning of the presidency does not require that a former President be immune from accountability for these alleged violations of federal criminal law. To the contrary, a bedrock principle of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law, including the president.\" Anderson, we also see a lot of pushback here from the idea that this case should be sort of put on hold and sent back to the courts for more hearings.

That would delay this trial well into next year. And -- and -- and you could tell in reading the government's brief that they're concerned about that.

We were against having a monarchy rule us that's untouchable and taxation without representation. The other thing that's interesting here is the same guy, the defendant, Donald Trump, who was saying that he has absolute immunity from everything, is still out there at every speech talking about the laws, that so-called -- you know, the so-called laws that are being broken by Joe Biden, which, of course, there's no evidence of. But you can't, on the one hand, say that a president has absolute immunity and on the other hand say that the president of the United States, Joe Biden, is violating laws or he needs to be locked up or all this kind of stuff. It's asinine, but that goes to the whole point here. The whole point is not to argue deep legal theory and not to get an answer of deep legal theory. It's to stall and delay so that Donald Trump in his mind hopefully wins and then he can direct the Department of Justice to dismiss this case. And they will because they will be under his direction. COOPER: Jeff, I mean, as part of their argument for immunity, Trump's attorneys, they've been arguing or pointing to the fact that no president has ever faced criminal charges on his official acts.
