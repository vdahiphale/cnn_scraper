Special counsel Jack Smith now says he wants to start on July 8th, later that he initially asked for. It raises a ton of questions about what that means, not only for this case, but also the January 6th case, the federal case against Trump.

      "sentences": "A lot indeed. And this is a high-stakes hearing in arguably the most high-stakes case for former President Trump. This is a case where he faces 40 criminal charges connected to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Now, right now this trial is scheduled for May 20th, but it is widely expected that that is going to be pushed back.And today the judge overseeing this case, federal judge, a Trump appointee, Aileen Cannon, has asked both sides to come here to court today to talk about scheduling. And in the past few days, both sides have given an indication of where they might be willing to have this trial on this very crowded calendar. Now, as you noted, the special counsel has said they'd like to start this in early July. Now, interestingly, Trumps lawyers insist that their client, as he is campaigning for the White House, should not be sitting inside a federal courtroom. They argue that that violates his First Amendment. But they offered up August 12th as a date when they would like to see this start, if it must. Now, that's interesting because, as we know, the Trump trial strategy has been to delay everything, particularly these federal trials, until after the November presidential election. Why? Well, if Trump is re- elected, he could have his attorney general dismiss Jack Smith and both of these cases. So, the fact that they're asking that this trial, if it has to start, start in early August is notable because it looks like maybe a little bit of gamesmanship, right? Take up space on the calendar to make it difficult to schedule other criminal cases. So, all eyes today on Judge Aileen Cannon as she weighs in on when this trial will start. And former President Trump has not arrived yet, though we expect he'll be here any minute.",

From Jack Smith's perspective, what this tells me is, he now is accepting the very high likelihood that he's not going to be able to try his other case, the Washington, D.C., case around January 6th, at any point before the election. Because even if he gets this request, if he gets the Florida the case, the documents case, moved into July, that's going to effectively block the calendar and make it impossible to try the D.C. case.From Donald Trump's perspective, it's interesting to me because Trump has been trying to get all these cases moved out past the election. One thing it tells me is, Donald Trump's team is less afraid of the Florida case. They're less afraid of the documents case than the D.C. case, the January 6th case, because their position on the January 6th case all along has been, this case needs to be tried, at one point they said in 2026. Now they -- it seems that there is some willingness by them to try the Florida case starting in August. So that tells me they're less afraid of that. They also may well see the Florida case as a blockade, which effectively will prevent the January 6th case from happening before the election.",

In order to get Fani Willis disqualified the defendants, meaning Donald Trump, Mike Roman, that people who are challenging her, they have to show that she had some financial conflict of interests. Now, it doesn't have to be that she had some grand plan to get rich off this case, but their allegation is she hired her boyfriend, Nathan Wade, to run this case. He made a bunch of money and some of it ended up being spent on Fani Willis, vacations and recreational outings.Now, the response from the DA is, well, it all evened out because she would pay for things in cash, as we just heard from Zach Cohen, or she would essentially reimburse Nathan Wade, and so it all zeroed out and so there's no conflict of interest. The second big point that we're looking at here, though, John, and this has emerged during these hearings is, what was the timing of the start of the romantic relationship between Fani Willis and Nathan Wade. And the reason that's become an issue is because Fani Willis and Nathan Wade have now testified under oath that the relationship, the romantic relationship, didn't start until after Wade was hired. But the defendants are -- have offered some evidence, quite a bit of evidence I think, that it started before the -- before Nathan Wade was hired. So, that's another important issue.",

And that's a really important question, John, because ordinarily in a criminal case the burden is on the prosecution, and it's a heavy burden beyond a reasonable doubt.
