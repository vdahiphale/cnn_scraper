Every one of them does, because that's what can pass, and that's what the majority of people support. The extremist on abortion in this campaign is Congresswoman Demings. She supports no restrictions, no limitations of any kind. REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL):  Senator, how gullible do you really think Florida voters are? Number one, you have been clear that you support no exceptions, even including rape and incest. Now, as a police detective who investigated cases of rape and incest, no, Senator, I don't think it's OK for a 10-year-old girl to be raped and have to carry the seed of her rapist. No, I don't think it's OK for you to make decisions for women and girls as a senator. I think those decisions are made between the woman, her family, her daughter, and her faith.

If you didn't notice from your screen, you were looking at one.The study followed more than 33,000 women ages 35 to 74 in the United States who have used hair dyes, straighteners, relaxers, or pressing products for an average of over 10 years. About 60 percent of participants identified as black women. Now, over that time 378 women were diagnosed with uterine cancer. Here with this now CNN political analyst, Laura Barron-Lopez, political commentator, Ashley Allison and senior political analyst, Kirsten Powers. You know, this is a topic that is very near and dear to my heart. I am natural. I no longer straighten my hair chemically, but there was a time that I did. And the idea that so many people I know did so at an early age, did so for a very long time, and now might have the risk of uterine cancer. And it's linked in many ways, some do so to try to conform certain beauty standards in our world, let alone the industry and beyond. And I'm resentful of the fact that this is even occurring. And we were talking about this in makeup, you and I, about when did you have your first relaxer and when did you get it? When did you decide not to do it any longer?
