      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextThe breaking news, Harris closing the gap with Trump, erasing the lead he once had over Biden. Two brand new polls out tonight show Harris with the momentum right now. Plus, trial and error. Trump unloading a series of new attacks against Kamala Harris. Which ones are real? Which ones are lies? We go through them. And breaking news, the FBI tonight revealing what hit Trump's ear during his attempted assassination. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett on this Friday. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news on Kamala Harris. She is surging. A brand new poll out just moments ago showing Harris is now in a statistical dead heat with Donald Trump, surging ahead of where Biden was just before he dropped out of the race. Earlier this month, Trump had a six-point lead over Biden, six points in electoral politics in this country is a chasm. \"The Wall Street Journals\" numbers now though tracking with the trend we've been seeing from other polls from CNN and \"The New York Times\". And when it comes to the all-important indicator of voter enthusiasm, 81 percent of Harris voters say they're enthusiastic about her. It was 37 percent for Biden. And there's another poll that came out just before we came on the air. This one from Fox News, and it's in the battleground states, very important, showing Harris slightly ahead or tied with Trump in four all important battleground states. We'll tick through them. Michigan, 49, 49. Trump was up by seven against Biden in the last Michigan poll. Minnesota, Harris leads 50 to 46. In Pennsylvania, again, it is now tied 49-49. Biden had been slipping there behind Trump in the must-win state of Pennsylvania as well. And in Wisconsin tonight, just one percentage points separates the two in the Fox News poll. And it all comes in the context of the eyes on Trump's ticket, Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, making another unforced error tonight, as he looks to tamp down criticism over his disparaging remarks about, quote, childless cat ladies. Instead, when he tried to dampen it down, he has created a new front firestorm. Tonight, making it clear that, quote, I've gotten nothing against cats. But going on to say that the left has become anti-family and the Democrats want to replace American children with immigrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've got nothing against cats, have got nothing dogs. I've got one dog. People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said. And the substance of what I said, Meghan, I'm sorry, it's true. It is true that we become anti-family. It is true that the left has become anti-child, but the simple point that I made is that having children becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective and it pretty profound way. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti- family and anti-child. A lot of liberals and a lot of people on the left will say, well, we can just replace American children with immigrants. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's about that if you don't, you are lesser.And the reality of it is, of course, if he was trying to make the point that his party is pro-family and the Democrats aren't, there are a lot of policy ways you could choose to do that, not this way. And this could come at a cost because according to a new Pew Research Center survey, nearly half of adults under the age of 50 say they don't want kids. That's a lot of people, a lot of voters, and we're going to much more on this in just a moment. I want to begin though with MJ Lee because she's OUTFRONT live outside the White House on these new poll numbers -- all of which just sort of came out, MJ, fast and furious.

We have a new poll tonight from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that shows a very close two-way matchup between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, 49 to 47 percent.But this is yet another survey that seems to suggest that the vice president is outperforming President Biden with traditionally Democratic leaning group groups including younger voters and voters of color, which had become a trouble spots for the president before, of course, he dropped out over the weekend. And when you dig more into the details of this journal poll, you also see that there has been a spike in enthusiasm among Democrats for their presumptive nominee. You see 76 percent now say they feel enthusiastic about their preferred candidate. That is up from 46 percent. That said the same previously. Again, when President Biden was at the top of the ticket. One issue where Harris seems to outperform Donald Trump is the issue of abortion issues where Trump outperforms Harrison this pool or immigration and the economy. And I should just note on stepping back from all of the data on the polls that are coming up. Of course the new Harris campaign is very closely watching Donald Trump. They are also very closely watching his running mate, J.D. Vance, including this childless cat, ladies comments. They said in a rapid response X account for the camera the pain that his response to the backlash amounts to an apology to cats and doubling down on attacking women. Very separately, the campaign also sent an email describing J.D. Vance as a creep and weird. I mean, this is clearly the campaign as it is gearing up, trying to paint a specific image of Donald Trump's running mate -- Erin.",

Mayor, let me just start with you and it's great to have you here, you know, in-person in New York. All these polls just coming out, \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll specifically though on the enthusiasm numbers and there's a range here, MJ was talking about one at 76 percent, this poll, 81 percent say Harris voters say they're enthusiastic about her. It was 37 percent for Biden, just a few weeks ago. That's a 44-point jump on enthusiasm. What's happening right now inside your party? MAYOR STEVEN REED (D), MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA; HARRIS SUPPORTER: Well, I think that there's a level of energy, level of excitement behind the vice president does needed to make this a competitive race? I think what we see are Black voters, women voters, and younger voters, very energetic and very interested invigorated, if you will, to support the vice president.

There's others as well, but these are crucial ones. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: These are crucial. I mean, that is what the election is going to be decided on. And this is great news for the Harris campaign. You've got thought to be cheering if you're in that campaign right now because what it shows is that she really has been able to flip the script the people who support her are now feeling really enthusiastic. Those enthusiasm numbers -- I mean, look at that before it was like third -- in the 30s for President Biden. And now it's like in the 80s.

Taken out of out-of-context.It's not just sarcasm. He has said it in different places and he has said it with different intentions. He's talked about people without children should have less votes, that people with children should be able to have more votes. He's talked about it when it comes to tax policy. He's talked about it in such despective (ph) way and I think it's really angering a lot of people. It's angering people who are childless because of choice or because of nature, or because they couldn't do it. Its angering people like Jennifer Aniston who don't come out and do politics often. And it's, you know, it touched a nerve. It has touched a nerve. And, look, I was what Kamala Harris last night, I was at her residence and a meeting of Latino leaders that have been scheduled before Joe Biden dropped out. I sense a level of enthusiasm. This is beginning to feel more like a movement and less like a traditional campaign. And I think that Democrats had been in the doldrums for a long time. They were feeling defeated even before the elections, and they were going through the motions. And this is now a campaign unburdened by the age issue and full of energy, and just the fact that J.D.

And there are two ways to look at that in the short term, would there be a bump for while -- three things. I think would there be a bump for Vice President Harris just because the age issue was gone? Answer. Yes.Two, would Vice President Harris looked like a compelling candidate? She was not great in 2019. Let's not forget that. And so people were nervous about that. She's done excellently in the first week. And then the third question, which is unresolved, is, can she sustain it? And that's a little more complicated than getting that initial rush of enthusiasm. That involves addressing a couple of issues that she's being attacked on, the Trump people off with tens of billions of dollars of ads attacking her as a California liberal, replaying some of her comments from 2019, which are a little bit to the left to the mainstream, attacking her for being soft on crime. She needs to deal with those in a defensive way, I think. But then stay on the offensive very much and I do think -- I agree with what people have been saying, Vance, normally, the V.P. pick doesn't matter much. The vice presidential pick doesn't matter much. But Vance is so out of the mainstream, so weird, so self-consciously so. You know, normally, the scandals and we've been through this so many times, I mean, you know, about someone who's picked this, quote, scandal is something someone said 15 years ago or some law enforcement brush, 25 five years ago when they were in college or something. Okay. People look at it for a day or two, they decide this person has been in public life for 20 years. This isn't decisive. No one knows anything about Vance.

He does it when he talks about childless people, he does it in a hateful way, and he categorically specifically said that we should punish things that are bad, i.e., having no children, and reward things that are good. That is why he is suggesting things like giving folks with children more votes and giving people without children more taxes, right? So it is -- it is from that it is not sarcasm and it is not about child tax credit. It is about punishing people who don't have children and I have to inform Mr. Vance that we are not handmaids' tale, we don't live under a society where adults in this country are forced to have children. It is a free choice and for some of us its not even a free choice. Some of us tried and couldn't do it. And for -- the cruelty of that man to suggest that because I couldn't have a child, I should be punished by having less votes and paying more taxes. And being derided as a childless cat lady, and then he's going to talk to me about family values and Christian values? Shame on you, shame on you. And it is angering all sorts of people.

It may not have even been in his prepared talking points and it opened up all this speculation about whether or not Trump had actually been hit by a bullet or something else. The statement that we got just a few a few minutes ago, I think is really artfully drafted because it essentially says the same thing he said in his testimony. It says whether he was hit, he was definitely hit by a bullet whether whole or in part, that's what he said in his testimony slightly differently. He said were not sure if he was hit by a bullet or some shrapnel. All part of a bullet, you can describe as shrapnel. So they're really being very artful here.

You know, \"The New York Times\", they had published its own investigation actually, and they had some pretty compelling analysis of the bullet's trajectory. They have that incredible picture, right, that when you slow down, you see the vapor trail of the bullet seeming to go by his head. And they had concluded it was likely a bullet that grazed his ear.

And, of course, Mr. Trump has not released the records of that treatment and is not authorized those doctors to speak about how they treated him.
