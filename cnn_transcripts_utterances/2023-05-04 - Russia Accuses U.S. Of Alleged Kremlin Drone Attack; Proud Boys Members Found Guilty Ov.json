We will go live to the Pentagon for that story. Also, four members of the Proud Boys are found guilty for their role in the January 6th insurrection. More on the rare and serious charges. And news just in, a jury rules that singer Ed Sheeran did not breach copyright with his smash hit, \"Thinking Out Loud\". We'll bring you an update from outside the courtroom. Well, blaming Ukraine wasn't enough. Russia now accusing the U.S. of involvement in the attack on the Kremlin. Moscow hasn't provided any evidence for these claims. The Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked by CNN if they believed the U.S. was involved. He said decisions like this are dictated to Kyiv from Washington. U.S. officials say the Kremlin's claim is ludicrous. Here was John Kirby speaking to CNN's Kaitlan Collins. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You heard John Kirby there, call these claims ludicrous. The U.S. says, and this is from the director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, just a little bit earlier today, that there isn't an assessment here, the U.S. is still looking at this, but there isn't all that much data or info to pour over and to look at, to figure out exactly what happened. So there isn't a position from the U.S. on who may be responsible for this. A lot of this info is simply from the videos we've seen of a slight explosion near a flagpole above part of the Kremlin. But that isn't much to go on. Regardless, this is at least, partly embarrassing for Russia and for the Kremlin. That a drone was able to get this close to one of the most heavily-guarded government compounds in the world, that's hundreds of miles, some 700 or 800 miles away from Ukraine. So if it is Ukraine, they managed to infiltrate a drone from hundreds of miles away into an incredibly heavily-guarded area, they got through the Kremlin's layers of air defense and managed to explode right over the Kremlin. Regardless, it is at least, slightly embarrassing for the Kremlin to have to deal with this, and for Russia to have had this happen all the way in the heart of Moscow. Which should be safe, at least, theoretically, from a war that's so far away. Russia's position is clear. They blame the U.S., they blame Ukraine, and when Kremlin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked about a response, he said it would be varied and would correspond to Russia's interests. Lynda.",

They shoot back, the fight continues. \"They wouldn't surrender\", he says. \"We killed three of them without grenades.

(voice-over):  \"You can't do enough training\", he says. \"You must do it all the time to be ready.\" (on camera):  There is every possibility the next time these troops go back to the frontline, it could be part of the big counteroffensive operation, they don't know, and their commanders certainly aren't saying. (voice-over):  Most of these troops in their early 20s. The U.S. made M113 they're training with a 60-year veteran of the type of infantry assault they'll need to punch through Russian lines.

The bank is saying, though, that they're exploring all other options, which is code for they're looking for some help right now. Now, this is not just about PacWest, though, because we've seen a number of other regional banks fall very sharply today after weeks of losses, Western Alliance, this is an Arizona bank, down very sharply. This is after the \"Financial Times\" reported that this bank is also potentially up for sale. Western Alliance though, pushing back very strongly on this -- against this report. They're saying that it's quote, \"categorically false\". They say the company is not exploring a sale, they have not hired any advisors.

Twenty-four-year-oldcoast guard veteran Deion Patterson is charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault. Police say he opened fire at a medical building, killing one woman and wounding four others, three of whom remain in intensive care. In a statement, the suspect's mother pleaded for mental illness to be taken seriously. Joining us from Atlanta is Ryan Young. Ryan, this gunman was able to evade police for some eight hours yesterday, even with the mother of the accused helping police locate him. Patterson has waived his rights to appear in court today. What exactly does that mean? RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT:  Well, usually somebody who is arrested gets a chance to figure out if not they're going to have bond or not. So him waiving his right also keeps him from going in front of a judge and basically resets the court date. So one of the things people are told, if they go to court, they may have to face cameras, they may have to face the public. So sometimes people who are accused of something that's as horrific as this, that might be the reason why someone would waive. On top of all that, according to the shooter's mother -- or should I say, the accused shooter's mother, they want to make sure that in a situation like this, when someone is facing mental health issues, they are evaluated from top to bottom sometimes before they go to court as well. So this -- so many pieces that are connected to this. You see that building right behind me. That's where the shooting happened. That's where it all took place, on the 11th floor. There were people who were going into this medical center for help. But unfortunately, were facing a man, running around, who was very disturbed, with a handgun, opening fire.

One other person is in intensive care. You understand, this will be a long process. We do know some of the victims have been able to talk to the medical professionals at the hospital to tell them how they are feeling. When you put all this together, this is a medical community that is shaken, because this happened at a medical complex. When you add the additional trauma to this, one woman in Midtown was saying she hopes the city doesn't just move on from the shooting, that there is some sort of memorial placed outside this location, so people can grieve together.

They said it's a common four chord progression found in songs that predate the 1973 hit by Marvin Gaye written also by Ed Townsend, \"Let's Get It On.\" That four chord progression is essential for musicians to be creative and continue to create music. I will say that, after the verdict was read, we had some reporters in the courtroom. Nikki Brown (ph) told me she actually saw Kathryn Townsend (ph) hugging Sheeran or a little bit of vice versa and that Ed said at one point, you've got to come to one of my concerts. Amy Waugh (ph), when I spoke to her a few moments ago, she said that is just exactly who Ed Sheeran is. And no bad blood, just happy for this to be behind them.

A team of doctors in Boston, Massachusetts, have raised the bar in neonatal care. They have successfully performed at the first in utero brain surgery in the United States. Chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta has the details on this medical milestone. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) KENYATA COLEMAN, DENVER'S MOTHER (voice-over):  On September 14th, we were able to have our first ultrasound. We saw a baby. We were extremely excited. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This was baby number four for Derek and Kenyata Coleman -- a girl named Denver -- and they were excited. But then, at their routine 30-week ultrasound, a nightmare began. K. COLEMAN:  I saw my doctor and we sat down and then she shared with me that something wasn't right in terms of the baby's brain and also her heart was enlarged. GUPTA (voice-over):  The concern was this -- that big colorful mass you're looking at in baby Denver's brain. It's known as a vein of Galen malformation and it shouldn't exist. Simply put, this vein was getting too much blood and too quickly. DR. DARREN ORBACH, RADIOLOGIST, BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL:  Ironically, despite all of this blood going to the brain, it's not supplying brain tissue. It's just going through the malformation like a short circuit right back to the heart. GUPTA (voice-over):  Dr. Darren Orbach, a radiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, typically treats these rare malformations right after a baby is born. But too often, that can be too late.",

K. COLEMAN:  So after learning that she was in the ideal position that was more confirmation for me. Like, there's no backing out of this.",

The actual procedure itself took just around 20 minutes. Just two days later, Denver was born -- happy, healthy -- both baby and family. D. COLEMAN:  So this is Ms. Denver Coleman and she is about to change the world. GUPTA (voice-over):  Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He will sit on the coronation chair, used by monarchs for more than 700 years. He will be crowned with the St. Edward's crown, a gold, velvet and jewel encrusted piece weighing more than two kilograms.
