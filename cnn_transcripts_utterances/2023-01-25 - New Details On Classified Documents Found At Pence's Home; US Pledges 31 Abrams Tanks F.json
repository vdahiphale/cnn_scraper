Perhaps, they would not have been visible unless the packers actually went through these binders page by page. Just for context, it is not unusual for Presidents and Vice Presidents to be given these travel briefing binders that include background memos on people they are meeting with in foreign countries.

They didn't believe it was the best use of capabilities in terms of the battlefield dynamics that are currently at play.But it really gets at the central driving force behind how President Biden has viewed this war throughout the 11 months it has been ongoing. And also, in the months beforehand, as the US was trying to put together this alliance, there have been no shortage of reasons and even predictions for cracks or fractures in this 30-plus country Alliance up to this point. And it underscores the point, as one official told me, this isn't about one weapon system or one specific weapons capability. This is about maintaining unity, maintaining that durability going forward. There is no clear endgame right now to this war.

And there is actually a good example just a couple of weeks ago, when Germany signed off on sending a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, it was notable that it was an announcement that was made with the White House, a joint statement from Chancellor Scholz and President Biden, lengthy, very detailed, and also outlining what the US commitments would be that would be coming at the same exact time. I am told that was a statement that was requested specifically and explicitly by Chancellor Scholz, made very clear the US needed to show its commitments, and also the US needed to make clear that they supported Germany's position. It's important for the domestic political decisions. It's important for how Chancellor Scholz was viewed back home.

According to the Washington Post, House Republicans are on impossible cuts to Social Security and Medicare.Joining me now, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Senator Sanders, appreciate you being with us. Just briefly, do you think it's the right choice for Facebook and Instagram to have President Trump back? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): You know, it's look, you have a guy who is a pathological liar, but he happens to be the former President of the United States and he has a right to express his views.",

You got an educational system where primary, where childcare and PreK is in real trouble, in real disarray. We're losing hundreds of thousands of teachers a year because salaries are much too low, classroom conditions are bad. We got to address that issue, got to deal with student debt. And in terms of labor, you got 60% of our people who are living paycheck to paycheck.So, what I'm going to try to do is not get involved inside the Beltway gossip.

Before we get to what was said in the opening statements, I understand some of Alex Murdaugh's family showed up in the court today. RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They did, Anderson he had quite an entourage there supporting him. His brothers were there, John Marvin and Randy Murdaugh. They've been strong defenders of his. Also, his only surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, was in court today. I was sitting right behind him, and when he walked in and sat down, Alex Murdaugh turned around and gave him a thumbs up. And as the defense finished presenting its opening statement, Alex Murdaugh turned back around to him and gave him a nod of approval of that opening statement. But those opening statements, Anderson, they lasted about an hour or so, and at times they were very disturbing. They shared both sides, shared quite a bit about what they learned from the murder scene. And here's just of those opening statements. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There was this moment, Anderson, when we were trying to get this amazing shot up at the top of the mountain. So, we walked up and down the mountain side probably like for two hours, and they followed us every step of the way up, every step of the way down on this winding, narrow road. And I said to them, look, we're just trying to get some view roll of the shot up there. You don't have to follow us that closely or exhaust. They basically were like, well, that's pretty much our job.Now, we tried driving away to get more information on the COVID situation, so went out several hours out of their district, but somehow, they knew were going there, too, because we had a whole different group of people telling us the entire time were reporting at hospital after hospital. And they were much more aggressive there, much more obvious in the way they were trying to obstruct our reporting. Clearly talking to all the potential interviewees. We'd speak to someone the moments later, they'd cut in, speak in the local language, and then suddenly they wouldn't speak to us anymore. So clearly, they had planned and alerted the network of clinics there that were coming. So, this is kind of the level of obstruction that CNN faced just a couple of years ago in Xinjiang reporting on very sensitive stuff.
