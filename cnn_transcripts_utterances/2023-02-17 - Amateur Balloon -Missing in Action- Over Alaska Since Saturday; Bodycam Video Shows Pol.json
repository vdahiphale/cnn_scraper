This is a White House that was hesitant to take this position, take this step. President Biden you saw him there talking a lot about what the White House still doesn't know and also really being limited at what he could say about what they do know because a lot of that information is classified.And so, the White House over the last four days under pressure from lawmakers to not only be more transparent about what was going on, but also have the American people be addressed by the president himself, they had really been reticent to take that step. But, of course, President Biden we saw him really outlining at least in the way that he can barring any revealing any classified information what is going on. And so I want to point you to four points that he made sure to point out in his speech. The president said there was no evidence that there was increased amount of objects in the sky, something that Americans were wondering after those last three were downed in such close capacity. The president promised once again to shoot down any materials that would present a threat to the American public. Remember, the reason why the president and the White House shot down those last three objects is because they said that they were flying within civilian air space. And the president said he instructed his team to create a sharper rule for how they engage in future objects, what the criteria is to shoot these things down, and obviously sharing that with Congress. The president also said that he expects to speak with his Chinese counterpart over the coming future really to talk about this issue especially when we think back to that Chinese spy balloon downed over the Atlantic just some time ago -- Christine.",

Expected here as well, a speech by President Zelenskyy, not in person, by media link as he has done so many times before, likely thanking everyone here for the support, urging them to do more, fighter planes, tanks, ground to air missile systems, air defense systems will be top of Ukraine's agenda. But Ukraine is not the only thing here. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be here as well as China's foreign minister, Wang Yi. Questions are being asked, will they neat in the margins to discuss China's spy balloon that were shot down recently that led to the cancellation of Secretary Blinken's trip to China -- no confirmation on that, no indications that it will happen.

I mean, Fani Willis is my counterpart, she is a first term D.A. and her investigation after eight months is ahead, at least it seems that way, of the U.S. attorney general's investigation. And that is why a lot of people have lost faith in Merrick Garland.But I think that eventually, he's going to do justice and Jack Smith, the special counsel, the right person for the job. But I don't think that Fani Willis as first term elected D.A. wanted to be the first prosecutor in the history of our country to indict a former president, but her clock has hit midnight. I mean, the grand jury has come out with this report and it is now time. She said it is imminent and I think that it means, yeah, it is coming. And as far as the U.S. attorney general, they are still taking their time.",
