      "sentences": "New this morning, President Biden in his final weeks in office has now commuted the sentences of nearly every federal death row inmate. There were 40, but now 37 men are no longer facing execution but rather life in prison without the possibility of parole. Biden without saying President-elect Trump's name did say the next administration is part of the reason behind his decision.The move this morning considered a major blow to Trump in a key campaign promise he has made. Let's get right to CNN's M.J. Lee live outside the White House. What is the president saying this morning? And this is certainly a 180 from where he was in 1994. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's absolutely right, Sara. In one of his last major acts as president, President Biden is choosing to use his clemency power to commute the death sentences of 37 inmates who are on federal death row to life in prison without the possibility of parole. As you noted, back in the 2020 campaign, President Biden had campaigned on getting rid of the federal death penalty. And there had been a swirl of speculation in recent weeks about whether he might at some point before leaving office, take this kind of action. He had come under pressure from human rights activists and other advocates who will argue that the death penalty tends to disproportionately affect black people and other people of color. I do want to read for you, Sara, a part of the statement from President Biden in announcing this. He said, make no mistake, I condemn these murderers, but guided by my conscience and my experience, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted. That last reference there to a new administration resuming executions I halted, that, of course, refers to incoming President Donald Trump. Remember during his first term as president, 13 federal death row inmates had been put to death. And in his most recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump has made quite clear in his public statements that he intends to bring back and aggressively seek more federal executions. This is a little bit of a sampling of some of the things that Donald Trump has said over the last year on this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. We are an institute and a powerful death penalty we will put this on. We have to bring in the death penalty if we want to stop the infestation of drugs coming into our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They include the murderer who killed nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, one of the people responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing, and then Robert Bowers, who killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.I will finally just note, Sara, that President Biden, of course, is a devout Catholic, and the White House recently announced that he is going to be traveling back to Italy for a meeting with Pope Francis. Of course, the pontiff was among those who had publicly called on President Biden to take exactly this action and commute the sentences of those on federal death row. Sara?",

He'll be back in a New York courtroom to be arraigned this time on the state charges he faces.Now, those are the 11 state terror and murder charges that he was hit with last week in the shooting and killing of CEO of UnitedHealthcare Brian Thompson. Let's talk more about what today means in the grand scheme of everything that he is facing now with a former deputy director of the FBI and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Andrew McCabe. It's good to see you, Andy. Thank you so much for jumping on. So, this -- I mean, a lot of people remember this is the arraignment that essentially was expected to have happened last week, but then the proceedings were postponed when federal authorities announced that they were bringing charges. He was whisked off to a federal courtroom, catching everyone -- most people by surprise and how it all played out. So, what does today now look like?",

      "sentences": "So, the anticipation of this hearing and the kind of excitement around, it is a little bit -- honestly, Kate, it's a little bit overblown compared to what's actually going to happen in the courtroom.So, the arraignment or initial appearance purposes to inform the defendant of the charges against him to make sure he's represented by counsel, maybe give him an opportunity to request fail, and, of course, he'll have to enter a plea. It's really very administrative in nature. I don't expect anything surprising to happen. It seems like the surprises -- we got all those last week with the surprise announcement of the federal charges. So, you'll see him go in. They'll offer to read the indictment. He'll probably decline that he'll enter no doubt a plea of not guilty simply because that preserves his rights as the process goes forward. And I think he's also almost at a zero chance of being offered bail under any circumstances. And so it's likely he may not even ask for that.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, the top charge that he's facing on the state side is that first-degree murder charge. And he qualifies for it only because the prosecutors have said he executed the murder as an act of terrorism, so meaning to intimidate or coerce some portion of the population or change in action of government. And to rely on that or the evidence they'll rely on to prove that is the fact that he wrote in those infamous writings that were seized from him when he was arrested, things about wanting to kill the healthcare CEO because it would send a message, and it was a way to strike back against that corporate community. And then, of course, the murder had the result of putting an entire class of kind of corporate leadership in fear of their own safety. It's still a bit of a -- I don't want to say an overreach, but it's a tough charge to prove, but simply having the first amendment charge on the indictment gives the prosecutors the opportunity to plead him to a lower level of murder, which is murder in the second-degree. So, that sort of bargaining leverage is very helpful to the prosecution. It could still end up landing with a guilty plea of a very serious murder crime that would give him a lot of time in prison.",

The years-long probe investigated numerous allegations against Gaetz, including illicit drug use and sexual misconduct with a minor.

      "sentences": "Yes, this has been a long time coming, Sara. If you remember back in November when Matt Gaetz was nominated to be Donald Trump's pick for Attorney General, the House Ethics Committee actually voted and declined to release this report despite the fact that there were many lawmakers who were pushing for its release given the fact that he was up for that job. Then what CNN learned is that earlier this month, the committee met again and secretly voted to release this report. We do expect to see this report sometime today.Now, what's interesting here is that a lot of Republicans have argued that this will break with precedent of releasing a report of a member who is no longer in Congress. But what we are learning, obviously, is that there is some past precedent for these reports being released after a member has left Congress. There are two examples that we have looked into, both the example of Representative Bill Bonner and the example of John Ensign, both of whom had resigned when the Ethics reports were released into their past behaviors. Last week, once this was reported that this report was coming, Representative Matt Gaetz, former Representative Matt Gaetz tweeted, quote, in my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. I never had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court, which is why no such claim was ever made in court. Matt Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. We should also note that the Justice Department declined to bring charges back in 2023. Sara?",

There seems to be no interaction between the two of them before this. He uses a lighter that he had on him to light a blanket that she was using to cover herself, lights her on fire. She immediately is engulfed in flames. And as you said, as she is burning, he steps outside the train, sits down on a bench and appears to watch as this woman is dying.Now, police were on the platform pretty much immediately. They had been patrolling that morning. They saw the smoke. They responded right away. They try to put her out. EMS were called. Unfortunately, she could not be saved and she was pronounced dead at the scene. But because those officers were on the platform, they were able to capture pretty incredible photos of the suspect who, as you mentioned, was sitting on that bench. They actually walked right past him. So, it was the combination of the officers walking past him, capturing him on their body worn cameras.",
