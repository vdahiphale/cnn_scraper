Prominent figures, many who had been previously linked to Epstein like former President Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were named in the filings, though not accused of any wrongdoing. The documents stem from a civil defamation lawsuit that was settled in 2017 by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against Epstein's former confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. The unsealed filings contain a 2016 deposition from one of Epstein's alleged victims, Johanna Sjoberg.",

His spokesman on Wednesday reiterated the Clinton knew nothing of Epstein's crimes, and told CNN that it has now quote, \"Been nearly 20 years since President Clinton last had contact with Epstein.\" In her deposition, Sjoberg also recalled a time she was with Epstein on one of his planes and pilots said he needed to land in Atlantic City, quote, \"Jeffrey said, great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to, I don't recall the name of the casino, but we'll go to the casino.\" Sjoberg said in her deposition, she never gave a massage to Trump. He is not accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein. The Trump campaign responded to a request for comment by attacking the media. The documents also contain excerpts of depositions taken from Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Maxwell. Giuffre alleged in her deposition that Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people, including Prince Andrew. She previously reached an out of court settlement in her sexual assault lawsuit against him. Andrew has denied all the allegations. Also a part of the new releases, Maxwell's own words.",

So it does appear to be a downward trend, but at least compared to 2020, which is significant because that was the first year of the pandemic and more. But that was also the first year that many of these cities saw a major spike in homicides, so a downward trend at least compared to there.Now for many of these cities, they also saw decreases in shootings as well, which is oftentimes a better indicator of at least a willingness to commit violence that said, not every place saw decreases, places like Washington, D.C., saw an increase in murders by over 30 percent and got to a level of homicides not seen in a decade there. And when you look at a place like Memphis, murders jumped over 40 percent through September when you have places like Detroit that saw their lowest levels of murders since the 60s. So that's sort of the picture when it comes to murders. That said, we were also looking at nonviolent and violent crime as well, because that's a little bit more of a complicated picture. When you look at Chicago, for example, murders and shootings down double digits. But when you look at things like car thefts and robberies, those were up 20 and 30 percent, specifically since 2019, car thefts in Chicago up over 200 percent. In Philadelphia was a similar story, retail thefts up almost 30 percent, and car thefts up almost 70 percent. And that reflects a little bit of what we've seen nationwide. So there are a lot of factors at play when it comes to feeling safe. And I do just want to say that as we've been talking about numbers, specifically when it comes to homicides, these are still individuals lives that were lost and decreases in numbers doesn't bring back some of the people that were shot and killed in many cases, Jake.",
