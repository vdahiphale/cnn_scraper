But Trump's team also made a late filing today that is related to this issue. They asked the judge to amend how he is going to question the jury pool when they first come in. The judge said he would ask if anyone could not serve on this jury because they're not fair or impartial or for any other reason. Trump's team is asking the judge to separate that because they want to try to build data for their appeal. They've been arguing that they should get a change of anyone in this case because of the publicity and because they believe Manhattanites tend to vote Democratic and would be against Trump. So they want the judge to separate it and ask anybody here who can't be fair and impartial, separate from anyone who can't serve in this jury because maybe they have a religious reason or for some other reason, such as travel. So they're trying to build data for this appeal that they tried to execute earlier this week and also to argue that they should just move this case out of New York City.",

In the filing that the president's lawyers submitted to the court, they submitted a poll of 2000 Manhattanites that found that 61 percent of people in Manhattan already believe that Trump's guilty in this case. And if you peel back the onion a little bit further and go to the 2020 election, 76 percent of people in New York City and Manhattan in this jury poll voted for Joe Biden. Twenty three percent voted for Donald Trump, so it's going to be pretty tough to find a jury that is not somehow predisposed. If you find that Trump, that pro-Trump juror, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.And we're hearing all this talk about data and building data. I think in the year 2024. The fact that we're relying on jurors to self-report bias is kind of crazy. Data is available, readily available, you could get - gathered tons of data on every one of these jurors, see what they've looked at on their Internet searches and see if they've voted for Trump or posting anti-Trump messages on social media. It's easy to find whether somebody is pro-Trump or not. And then when they go and seated this jury, who's going to want to recuse himself from the biggest trial in the history of New York City?",

I mean, many jurors would say, well, I can still be fair about - based on whatever the evidence presented is.AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Yes. And we see that every day. So I would disagree with David's perspective here. I was a federal prosecutor and I've done trials. And people take this really, really seriously. They treat this like a solemn event. And I think I have a lot of faith in jurors. And I think the fact that someone is from Manhattan or how they voted does not determine whether or not they're going to be a fair juror. And that's why we have those. I think 40 plus questions that judge - that the judge is going to be asking here, because you do have the opportunity to parse out to answer the question. And then you'll ask them a lot of things. Who did you - what kind of podcast you listen to, what TV shows do you watch, what books have you read, any one of your family's law enforcement. All these questions give you incredible insight into who a juror is. And it's not merely asking them, can you be fair. All these other data points allow the lawyers to really parse out who these people are. And I think that's why on average, right, our jurors really tend to end up at the right result here if the government can meet its high burden.",

In every single case, you are able to ultimately find fair and impartial jurors. It's not whether - it's whether you can be fair in this particular case.And as Temidayo I said, there's questions that are designed to ask that. And I think, nobody is pro-murder or pro-rape, yet sometimes there are cases that end in acquittals because it's about making sure that the people prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. And I agree that jurors take that very seriously. And so I think the process, you have excellent lawyers on both sides of a really good judge here. This is not inexperienced people. They know how to pick a jury. They know how to ask the right questions. And something to keep in mind is Donald Trump has to be there every single day because it's a criminal case. He's going to be sitting at that jury table - sitting at the council table and he's going to actually have to agree to every single juror. So this is going to be a jury that he picks too, he and his lawyers agree to. But these are the jurors that they want sitting in judgment, so I have no problem with that.",

The judge really showed some skepticism to those arguments saying that a lot of what they were saying were essentially things that should be presented to a jury that you should go to trial and argue that for -- before the jury. So she seems at least uninclined to buy their arguments. We also heard, though, during this hearing something interesting that we hadn't heard before from Jay Bratt, one of the prosecutors on Jack Smith, the special counsel's team. He said that at least some of the documents that were transported from here in Florida to Bedminster, the former president's golf club in New Jersey, he says that the FBI didn't recover all of those boxes, perhaps containing some documents. And so, the possibility was raised that there might still be documents and there still might be boxes somewhere out there that the FBI never recovered at the end of that raid in Mar-a-Lago.

So, I think the Israelis are very, very confident that they can handle this.And that's why they put out the assurances to their people. And so, you know, we've seen, Anderson, the mood was -- they're pretty sly. They're pretty cautious. They're not going to follow their rhetoric in every case. Obviously, we're getting intelligence that says they're preparing to do something. So we're on alert. But will they make the decision to do it? Or if they come after Israel, they're making a big mistake.",

At this hour, U.S. officials are indicating that they don't expect this Iranian response to target U.S. forces in the region. But the United States has deployed additional air defense assets in the region in anticipation for this.Also, because U.S. officials are also saying that they may try and intercept any potential attacks by Iranian proxies headed towards Israel. We've seen them do that in the past as it relates to some of those Houthi attacks being fired from Yemen towards Israel. Some of those have been intercepted by the U.S. Navy. We've also know, of course, that there are U.S. forces deployed in the region elsewhere that could potentially intercept any missiles or other assets that are fired from Iranian proxies in Iraq as well. So we know that U.S. forces and Israeli forces are closely coordinating that visit earlier today by the head of U.S. Central Command meeting with the defense minister in Israel, meeting with Israel's top general as well, intended to showcase that close collaboration and very much sending a message to Iran.

The Iranian economy's a mess. They've had actually soldiers walk off the job because they're not paid.The Iranians have taken Social Security money from their populace. Inflation's high. People can't get taxis. They can't afford it. They can't afford gasoline. So really, this is the mullahs against the Iranian people in some respect. And were they to get into a shooting war with Israel, they can't count on the support of their own populace in this. I think they're going to wager that things will look different if they can become a nuclear power and somehow that's going to keep them in place. So, I see them trying to do something, but being sly, clever. Maybe something that's a semi deniable. Not giving Israel a chance to really come in there and take out the drone factories or the nuclear capacity that Iran is building.",
