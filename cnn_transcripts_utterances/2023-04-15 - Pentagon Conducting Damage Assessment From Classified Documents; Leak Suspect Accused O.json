Right now, The Pentagon is trying to assess the fallout of leaked classified documents. Twenty-one year old Jack Teixeira, an Air National Guardsman is in custody and charged under the Espionage Act, despite his young age and low rank. Teixeira had top secret security clearance because of what he would come across in his IT work. The documents he is accused of leaking are considered highly classified and include eavesdropping on adversaries and allies alike. CNN White House correspondent, Jeremy Diamond joins us now. He is over at the White House for us. Jeremy, this is a huge mess for the administration, The Pentagon, the Intelligence Community. Damage assessment apparently is underway. What more can you tell us?",

As soon as those documents leaked online, and The Pentagon became aware of it, one of the first questions that officials have been trying to answer is how exactly could this potentially damage US National Security?And there is no question that even as that review is underway, that damage assessment, as they call it, there are some significant concerns within the administration about the fact that some of this information has become public. Let's take a look at some of what this information is that was revealed in these leaks that were allegedly put online by this 21- year-old Airman, Jack Teixeira. It goes into some information that is pretty real time, the war in Ukraine, looking at US Intelligence gathering capabilities within the Russian Ministry of Defense, and then on the Ukrainian side, there is information in some of these documents that points to weaknesses, and shortages of Ukrainian weaponry and ammunition. That information particularly sensitive, because this war, of course, is still ongoing. And then you have the eavesdropping on US allies, Israel, South Korea, Ukraine, and then there is also this new information about Taiwan and US Intelligence indicating that they are highly vulnerable to a Chinese air attack at a time, of course, of heightened tensions with China and a discussion about potential Chinese plans to eventually invade Taiwan in the coming years. And so, The Pentagon is now working in partnership with those Intelligence Agencies to try and assess what the potential damages to US National Security, and also the impact on US allies. We know that that is one of those concerns amid the revelations of some of that eavesdropping. There has been some damage control that US officials have been doing with those allies. So that's also something that officials are looking at.",

Joining me now, CNN legal analyst, Elliot Williams, a former Federalprosecutor; and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, retired General Wesley Clark. General, great to see you. Thanks so much to both of you. The leaked documents revealed eavesdropping on both enemies and allies, included blunt assessments of Ukraine's military abilities and weaknesses. Are you concerned about how damaging this could be? And I mean, what is going on when you have people this young, getting online and just able to access this kind of information? It just doesn't sound like the controls are there? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think there are a chain of command issues here that have to be looked at, not only the fact that this is an Air Force National Guard, but also the fact that who were his superiors and what kind of checking was done. During the Cold War, we had something called a Personal Reliability Program for people that were involved with nuclear secrets. We need something like that, something stricter for these people who are handling these highly classified elements. But Jim, I'm not so worried about Ukraine. I mean, everybody in Ukraine understands that they've been underestimated the whole time. They're also very disappointed that they don't get more support from the United States. They're grateful for what they get, but they understand what their weaknesses are, I'm sure the Russians do. And, you know, it's only the public that has gone through these cycles of what I call premature exultation when the Ukrainians have thrown back the Russians and achieved something and then it's like, oh, well, it's all done. It's not done. This is a tough problem, and actually, this kind of a leak probably helps Ukraine, not hurt it.",

If convicted, what kind of a sentence could he be facing? What would you expect in terms of charges being added? And, you know, what about the age of this young man? He is 21 years old. I asked a Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren about this in one of our previous hours. And, you know, she was saying, you know, the age isn't -- you might want to sympathize, I suppose, because he's young, but age is not really relevant here. There are so many young people who perform in our military and don't do this sort of thing.",

Now, nobody gets the full maximum. Each count of mishandling classified information carries five years in prison. So again, you could be looking at potentially decades in prison, if it were multiple documents. Now, to the question of the youth or inexperience of the individual, that might be the kind of thing that would come in at sentencing, if he were if in fact convicted, where a Judge could say, look, you have your life ahead of you, you have served the country in some way, and based on the intent that you show here, you know, perhaps we can give you a lower sentence.

Who are they associating with? Jim, this is a classic case of someone whose ego led him to betray his country. I mean, this is a common fallacy in all security systems: It's money. It's ego, and it is something that drives people. Just because he's young. He is showing off with his ego. For some reason, he didn't feel like he was appreciated, he wanted to show his power in some way. This is pretty classic. We know what the symptoms are.

It's also a key source of anxiety for Republicans and Democrats alike who want to avoid a default at all cost.A big problem, though, is that President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have yet to sit down and have serious negotiations on how to handle this. The Biden administration says that they want Republicans to put forth a budget proposal of their own before they sit down, they have yet to do that. But I do have some reporting on that on how House Republicans have begun to informally put together a debt limit package that they're going to roll out to some members next week. So, that's something to watch for. Another key issue, classified briefings. Members want to know exactly what happened with that Pentagon documents leak and all senators are expected to have a briefing on that on Wednesday. Another issue here guns, fresh cries to do something at the Federal level after the mass shootings in Texas and Kentucky, but I know that Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge that they don't think they'll be able to do that just given the balance of power in Congress. Abortion, another issue where both sides -- well not both sides, they don't have a lot to do. I mean, Democrats really want to do something on this, but there's not a lot that Congress can do. They're probably going to put forth some sort of women's health legislation, but that will likely fail.

Boeing is coming clean, about a defect in the manufacturing of the jet itself. The issue Boeing says is with a fitting in the weird part of the fuselage of some Maxes. It's manufactured by a third party. Boeing has not said exactly how many are defective, though there are about a thousand 737 Maxes flying worldwide, more than 300 in the US. In a statement, Boeing says this is not an immediate safety of flight issue, and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely. The Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, which ultimately came down hard on Boeing after investigations into those Max crashes, says it has validated what Boeing says is true and is monitoring next steps.
