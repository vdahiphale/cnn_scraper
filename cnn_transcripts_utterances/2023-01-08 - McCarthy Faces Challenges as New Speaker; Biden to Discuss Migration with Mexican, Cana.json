Now to try to address the issue, the president announced that the U.S. will accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from four countries. But it will also expel just as many migrants if they don't go through the legal process; that is, if they do not enter the United States legally. Hispanic lawmakers are criticizing the plan, saying they weren't consulted ahead of time. Now Republicans are also skeptical, as you can imagine, of Mr. Biden's border plan, saying -- they're telling the president that, in fact, it's far too little and way too late. On Saturday, the newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy promised that Republicans would address the issue in the months ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  One of our very first hearings will be held on the southern border. No more ignoring a crisis of safety and sovereignty. We must secure our border.

Here we are again, Doctor, you and I talking about China; this time it is an issue that is a complete pivot from what we were used to seeing. Does it concern you, though, how quickly this is happening and how quickly those barriers have come down? DR. SCOTT MISCOVICH, FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND NATIONAL CONSULTANT:  Yes, very much so. We've only had three countries that have dropped the zero COVID policy. And that was New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. But they did it with a massive vaccination push, that was a recent, fresh vaccination. And that's one of the big differences with China. When you look at their vaccine, it was, you know, maybe eight months ago, nine months ago and we all know that vaccines have that waning immunity. So that's a big issue. So the speed at which it happened is an issue, with no vaccines. Number two, they don't have the things like Paxlovid, the medicine that we have, pills that still work. They don't have monoclonal antibodies that are not that effective against anyway the Omicron variants. And they have very limited hospital and ICU capability. And they have the people, as Ivan and you just discussed, they're dying to see their families. They're going to get together, they're going to hug each other. And the Lunar New Year.

This is a total unchartered (sic) territory. And for population, 67 percent urban in China, the rest is rural.

So this is, you know, 1.56 billion people are going to have suddenly, as your piece just showed, in a period of three to six months, full spreading of COVID. It's going to be very, very serious. And, you know, their own studies have predicted death rates of 1.7 million. And now other studies that we are looking at are predicting it's probably going to be a minimum of 2.5 million by the end of the year.

But as a Brit, I think Harry is rather losing rather than gaining support with the American public. It's almost like he's picking on William. That's how it's playing in the court of public opinion.

He received a reported $20 million advance for this book. And that means you've got to sell close to, I don't know, 2 million copies, something like that, just to break even. So that explains this publicity blitz. So this is part of a four-book deal reportedly. So there's more to come. So this isn't going to be over anytime soon. And if you think this is full of juicy detail, I can't wait for the Meghan book. When is that coming out? It's really interesting to see that, you know, that \"never complain, never explain\" policy, which was laid down by the queen, has so far been enforced. But you know, there is a new king in town now and a new heir in waiting. How is he going to deal with the spare? It's almost Shakespearean, this war between the brothers. It's a great story.

You can see Damar there, very small, the bottom right-hand corner and he is, yes, smiling. The entire NFL is, in fact, honoring him this weekend.
