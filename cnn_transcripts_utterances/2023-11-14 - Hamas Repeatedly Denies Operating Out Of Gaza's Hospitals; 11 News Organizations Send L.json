I mean, he became prime minister at a very young age and he left the office at a fairly young age. I mean, he's not yet 60. He's got -- he's got more to give, he thinks.More crudely, I suppose, he would rather be remembered for a short but successful stint as foreign secretary than for the prime minister who fought and lost the referendum and left office immediately afterwards.",

That's according to the polls anyway.And why has it been so difficult for successive conservative leaders to offer stability to the people of the U.K.?",

      "sentences": "Very good question. I mean, that's why -- I mean, David Cameron does offer a sense of stability. In a way, it sort of ties Rishi Sunak with entire period of conservative government since 2010, since David Cameron himself was prime minister, which is slightly paradoxical as Rishi Sunak was announcing itself as a candidate of change to his party conference only a few weeks ago.Whether it will have an effect, who can say? I think -- I think getting rid of Suella Braverman as home secretary clearly helps the government. She was a destabilizing influence. I think David Cameron, we will have to wait and see whether his inclusion in the government helps Rishi Sunak minimize the damage to the next election. And I think what he's engaged in is defensive politics, trying to minimize losses rather than trying to hold on to power.",

Rishi Sunak has decided to get rid of her before. Her inflammatory comment was a suggestion that people who sleep rough on the streets of British cities were doing so as a lifestyle choice. That really offended a wide swath of opinion, not just in the country, but in the Conservative Party. There are very few of her most stalwart defenders on the right of the Conservative Party who defend those comments.And Rishi Sunak had decided that she wasn't a team player. All the arguments about pro-Palestinian march over remembrance weekend added to his urgency getting rid of her. But he'd already decided to do so. And she will now want to set out to become leader of the opposition after an election defeat. But I don't think she has as much support as she think she does among her fellow MPs.",
