I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour in Philadelphia, where President Joe Biden landed just moments ago, heading off on a campaign rally that he will be holding there later today. Right now, however, he is taking an aerial tour over I-95. You may remember a portion of that highway collapsed last weekend after investigators say a tanker truck crashed and burst into flames. Crews continue to work around the clock at the collapse site. This week, they finished demolishing the crumbled section of roadway and are now working to rebuild it all. And it will be quite a process. Officials will soon briefed the president on that reconstruction work. And soon, President Biden will also be giving an update on how his administration is helping with those efforts. We will bring that to you live when it is coming up later this hour. But now to a severe weather threat. Sixty million people are facing potentially dangerous storms from Colorado to Florida. Many of these areas are still reeling from powerful storm systems that swept through earlier this week. CNN meteorologist, Britley Ritz, is tracking all of these threats. Britley, what are we expecting to see with these storms?",

Places like Ocala two inches per hour. And we've extended the flood watch now in two parts of Florida. That includes Tallahassee, all the way down through the Big Bend where we could pick up over six inches of rain, if not more. Not only that, but again, the threat for severe weather today and tomorrow. Areas highlighted in orange that includes Tulsa, Oklahoma City, that's where we're most vulnerable for those strong long lived tornadoes, but we can't rule them out in places like Dallas into Mobile. Even places like Tampa, where we are under a slight risk. That extends into Sunday, then to Little Rock, Shreveport, back into Mobile for the strongest tornado risk. But we watch this very closely. Take a look at the timeframe later this afternoon. We get this redevelopment with the heat of the day. So late afternoon, early evening, we're talking four or five o'clock, starting to see them spark that really ramp up around eight, nine o'clock. That pushes into the southeast through the overnight hours, places like Arkansas back into Mississippi, Alabama. Early tomorrow morning and into the afternoon, still holding on to that threat of severe weather. Then late into the afternoon and evening, then pushing down into places like Tampa and back into places like Miami, West Palm. Not only that, but it is extremely hot. We need to make sure we're taking care of ourselves and our pets and our neighbors too. They're just as important as you are. The heat really ramping up across places like Texas. Back into Louisiana, over 40 million are under some sort of heat alert, and including excessive heat warnings. We need to make sure we're making -- taking care of ourselves. I want you to take a look at some of these numbers. Because these numbers are very important to pay attention to. It's hot, but then we factor in the humidity. And it feels so much worse. Look at the numbers. I mean places like Austin, your heat index value at 111 degrees. Brownsville, back into San Antonio, doing the same thing, in upwards of roughly 120 degrees. That's what it's going to feel like. So let's avoid heatstroke and heat exhaustion at all cost. One thing to remember, light colored clothing, loose fitting clothing, drink plenty of water. I can't stress that enough. Take frequent breaks if you have to be outdoors for an extended period of time. These are extremely dangerous temperatures. Alex.",

So the girls apparently opened the door and tried to escape. That's according to Uganda's Education Minister, Janet Museveni. And they were hacked with machetes. At least 20 girls were killed in that. But the boys' dormitory was locked and they were not able to get in. The First Lady of Uganda here saying that they threw a petrol bomb inside that boys' dormitory. And the two -- the kids were in there, at least 17 of them are burnt beyond recognition. They're going to need to do DNA analysis to identify those bodies and send them to their families, so a really horrific attack, the worst that Uganda seen in decades, the worst suddenly that's been carried out by the ADF since at least 1998 when it attacked another educational institution and 80 people were killed.

As you -- you know, CISA and the NSC and government agencies have been taking the federal ransomware quite seriously over the last couple of years. And a lot of -- a lot of progress has been made in disrupting ransomware networks. At the same time, it is critical that we continue to strengthen the cybersecurity of the businesses of agencies of organizations involved. And things like basic patching, cyber hygiene, like using multifactor authentication, changing your passwords regularly, so that you have a strong password.

They're insisting that the two defendants not be able to view any of the evidence that is shared with attorneys without their attorneys present. They also request that they not be given copies of it, or be able to take notes and then take those notes. The notes need to be protected and kept safe by the attorneys. Now, prosecutors say in this request that they worry that sharing this information with the public or others could compromise other ongoing investigations, witnesses, or other people who haven't been charged. We note the special counsel is, of course, looking at the events in and around January 6th, and efforts to undermine the 2020 election.

I don't know that from personal information. But the public reporting and the conversation among lawyers is that Boris has the president's ear, and Boris isn't the easiest guy to work with. And as long as he is there, other lawyers may have some hesitation to move in because they don't know whether the president will listen to them or Boris.",

So, I think they'll -- some order to the calendar, but each of these judges (ph) are independent-minded people. They set their own calendars, and each has to accommodate one another.So, this is going to be a very complicated mosaic, especially if we get a third indictment out of Georgia and a fourth indictment in the January 6th case.

And so, that led to about a $95 a month drop for food stamp recipients, and that's taking a big toll on these customers right now. Kroger said that food stamp recipients were buying less when they go to the grocery store, they were buying smaller pack sizes, they were switching to store -- to the Kroger private labeled brands which are cheaper. These are all signs of financial stress.And then Kroger isn't the only company that's called out this hardship among food stamp recipients. Dollar General said that more customers were turning to food banks and dipping into their savings to afford groceries. And Walmart has noticed this shift as well. So, really troubling on the grocery front.",
