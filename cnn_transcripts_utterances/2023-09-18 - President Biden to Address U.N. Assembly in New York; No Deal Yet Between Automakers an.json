The U.S. president tackles Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change and China at the U.N., all while dealing with an impeachment inquiry and a possible government shutdown in Washington.And we're on the picket lines with striking workers in Michigan as it approaches day four. Are the big three automakers and the UAW any closer to a deal? Plus, Donald Trump leaves the friendly confines of right-wing media to actually meet the press. Will he bring the truth with him? Well, there's some fact-checking. It's 2:00 in the morning in New York where U.S. President Joe Biden will kick off a busy week in the hours ahead. Mr. Biden will be attending the annual United Nations General Assembly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be there, appealing for more support for Ukraine amid its counteroffensive against Russia. The two leaders are expected to meet later in the week. While off the international stage, Mr. Biden is facing a number of challenges in Washington. And that includes the possibility of a government shutdown later this month and an impeachment inquiry launched by House Republicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

General Assembly and officials say that he will talk about America's vision for leadership in the world and also make the case that countries need to work together in order to solve some of the world's biggest problems.This is all coming as the president has tried to highlight his alliance building as a selling point heading into the 2024 election. But there also will be a lot of attention on who President Biden will be meeting with on the sidelines of the summit. He'll meet with Brazil's President Lula da Silva on Wednesday, and also on Wednesday he's set to sit down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This will be the first time the two men are meeting since Netanyahu came back into power last year. But it does come at a time when there had been questions about whether such a meeting would even occur after the White House has expressed criticism and frustration with Netanyahu's government moving to make some judicial reforms in that country. Now, when the president wraps up in New York City, he'll head back here to Washington. And on Thursday, here at the White House, he will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also will be making the rounds up on Capitol Hill. This would give the men a chance to speak in person about the counteroffensive that's underway against Russia. But the meeting also comes at a time when Biden is pushing Congress to pass more aid for Ukraine, but that is meeting significant resistance from Republicans in the House.

He is going to be on the global stage once again, meeting with leaders from around the globe, really to remind them about how important his counteroffensive is and how much he needs support from many allies around the world as this war continues. Now, he's going to be meeting with various leaders on the sidelines while he also gives an address at the U.N. General Assembly.But as you mentioned earlier, he will also be going on to Washington. And it's not just to meet with Biden. It's also to meet with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle as this concern about U.S. public support for the funding of Ukraine and the worry that it may be declining and this need to shore up support, particularly as we move into these winter months. This counteroffensive, while it has been making some marginal gains, the progress will be getting more challenging as the weather gets colder. It will give Russia more time to shore up those defensive lines and make it difficult for Ukraine to continue making progress. And really what Zelenskyy aims to do here is to ensure that not only that U.S. support is there, but demonstrate to them why it is so key that he continues to need this military equipment, this ammunition, this support from the United States. And one of these key things are long- range missiles that we've been discussing. And the reason for that is because long-range missiles can get behind enemy lines and target key areas that Russia is using for this war. So, for example, we looked last week at a variety of Ukrainian attacks in the area of Crimea. One of the major attacks was on the port of Sevastopol last Wednesday. Now it's suspected they used long-range missiles. Again, that is because that they can reach so far to target areas such as that port, which had a key ship repair facility that is crucial for really for Russia's war in Ukraine, key for rebuilding ships that may get damaged during the offensive as it continues. This is what Ukraine desperately needs. And while it has some long-range missiles, it doesn't have the U.S. ones that they want, which are the ATACMS, these Army Tactical Missile Systems. They can reach over 180 miles. Now, Biden is said to be considering giving these to Ukraine, but he has not yet made a final decision. And this is a key thing that Zelenskyy really wants to get out of this trip. More assurances that more weaponry, more missiles will be delivered to Ukraine.",

VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Negotiations continue between the Big Three and the Union. On Sunday, General Motors had their day negotiating at the main table. On Saturday, it was Ford. And on Monday, it will be Stellantis. But no word on a deal as progress seems to be slow. The last offers that the Big Three put on the table were before the strike deadline. Those offers were around 20% increases in wages over four years. We know that the Union has been demanding 40% in wage increases for the next four years. Now, there has been a rotating cast of elected officials who have come by the picket lines.

No quick resolution on the horizon in the United Auto Workers strike. What are the political ramifications of this industrial action and do you think this could potentially become an electoral issue? NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEXWell, it could. There will be big political ramifications if this goes on for a really long time. I should note that the average autoworker strikes in history have lasted, at least the last 30 years, have lasted about five weeks. This could be bad if this went on and on because it will have an impact on the local economies in some of these swing states, but also on the national economy as a whole. And Biden, as he has proclaimed himself the most pro-union president ever, he's really has -- a bit of a tricky situation here because he's going to want the strike to be resolved as soon as possible because of how closely connected it is to the economy. But he has no choice, but he has to appear to be as pro-union as he can. He needs to be on the side of the autoworkers. And this is difficult because, as you already mentioned, there are some really important demands here that might not get met that soon, that these autoworkers want to have more pay, that they see that there's a huge divide between what the CEOs are making, some in some cases 365 times as much as the average auto worker. And the auto workers have been saying, you know, there's a 40 percent increase in CEO pay, whereas we can't even afford to buy the cars that we're actually making. So, in terms of what the democratic values are, this would be to be on the side of the auto workers, but he's dealing with the way the nation perceives his ability to run the economy as a whole. And recent polling by Suffolk University and \"USA Today\" has revealed that it's not so great, that 70 percent of Americans don't think that the economy is going in the right direction, 84 percent think it's due to the cost of living, and only about a third think that Biden is doing a good job running the economy. And in head-to-head polls against Trump, Trump is actually 10 percent ahead of him in terms of the way Americans think that he will be better able to run the economy compared to Biden. And so, Biden's going to want this to be resolved quickly without him appearing to lose sight of what the needs are of the autoworkers.",

As we see in the recent economic speech, he was going on the attack of the Republicans, particularly with their economic credentials and what they're up to and what are they offering the American people, what is their plan?

No state has done so, Republican or Democratic. That is infanticide illegal in all 50 states.New York, in fact, passed a 24-week abortion limit with exceptions after that for the health and life of the pregnant woman and the viability of the fetus. And that of course was not all. He repeated his false claim that Nancy Pelosi had been in charge of capital security on January 6, 2021. That is false, as is his claim that Pelosi rejected an offer of 10,000 National Guard troops that he made. There was no evidence he even made the offer. Pelosi says she never received such an offer. And in fact, it is Donald Trump, the president of the United States, who had the authority to order the National Guard to the Capitol on that day. He repeated his out and out lie that he won the 2020 election, that he was cheated, that it was rigged. Of course, we know this is false. He made a claim that he had heard that there were no people on the terrorist watch list encountered at the southern border under him in 2019, that the number has exploded today. In fact, the number in fiscal year 2019 was actually higher to this point in the fiscal year than it is this year under President Biden. He repeated his false claim that he had killed the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline until Biden revived it. In fact, he never killed it. It was about 90 percent complete before Trump imposed sanctions on it during his presidency. And then, still during his presidency, Russia announced that it was going to resume construction. He also exaggerated even on facts where the actual truth, the actual facts, would be helpful to him. For example, he claimed, talking about inflation, that the price of bacon has gone up by, he said, five times under Joe Biden. Well, it has gone up, like a lot of things, but it's gone up about 11 percent, not five times, not even close. He also said that the U.S. left behind about 85 billion, he said $85 billion worth of military equipment upon the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

That's the conclusion of a new report which says the overcrowding is forcing officers to put children in separate holding areas from adults.The report's author says some children were separated from their parents for days and did not know how to request a visit with them. A customs and border protection official says separating families is a last resort, but it happens for safety reasons. It's important to note the separations are different from the ones that happened during the Trump administration, when a zero tolerance policy kept families apart, and in some instances, parents were deported without their children. American 'Dreamers' are facing a new legal setback. A federal judge in Texas has ruled against the Biden administration's efforts to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or DACA. It shields undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the U.S. as children. The order doesn't impact those currently protected but, as CNN's Camila Bernal explains it, it's creating new uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The success of this Mexican candy family business is in part thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.",

CNN's Paula Newton met with several families who say they were exploited or abused by UN personnel while peacekeepers were stationed in the country between 2004 and 2017. Some fathering children and leaving mothers struggling with both poverty and stigma long after they left. Here's our CNN AsEquals report from Western Haiti.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The UN's promises weigh heavily in Haiti. At its long abandoned compound at the coastal outpost of Port Salut, there's barely a trace of the peacekeepers that served here. And yet, much has been left behind. This woman, who asked to be referred to as Rosalynn, due to the stigma of her situation, says she has been cast aside. ROSALYNN (through translator): How can you abandon a child like this? She's without a father. I am raising her alone. NEWTON (voice-over): Rosalynn has a teenage daughter who was fathered by a Uruguayan peacekeeper. The UN says she is one of at least 35 women who were in exploitative or abusive relationships with UN personnel. Peace is something this mother says she has never known. She has filed a paternity claim but argues the UN should be held accountable, as well. She says she has been left to raise a daughter on paltry sums authorized by the UN. ROSALYNN (through translator): They know the kids, they did DNA tests and everything. They know the situation of the kids with everything that is going on in Haiti. NEWTON (voice-over): Rosmina Joseph says she was a child when she was lured into a relationship with another Uruguayan peacekeeper and became pregnant. He was sent home and served a sentence for abuse, that's according to a UN document. Rosmina wanted us to see her home. A place where she says dreams once stood. A plot for a house, still a barren foundation. She has no money to build here. She lives on this patch of land in nothing more than a tent. Clinging to proof and staking her claim that the UN is also responsible for the harm done to her and her 12-year-old son.",
