The White House must respond by the end of the hour to the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily keeping Title 42 in place. Title 42 is the pandemic policy that currently allows border agents to quickly expel asylum seekers. The Trump era rule a set to expire tomorrow. But, chief justice of the United States John Roberts extended the policy to give the court more time to hear a complaint from Republican-led states. In Mexico, thousands of migrants are hoping if Title 42 is lifted, they will have a better chance of being granted asylum status in the U.S. But for U.S. border cities, lifting Title 42 would likely bring and even greater influx of migrants, as these cities are already struggling to support to the thousands of people crossing each day, desperate for a new life in the U.S. Shelters are packed, supplies are running out, migrants are sleeping in the freezing streets. CNN's David Culver and Ed Lavandera are monitoring the situation from both sides of the border. We're going to start with Ed in El Paso, where city officials are bracing for thousands of migrants to arrive every day, stretching already thin resources even more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Just hours before sunrise, Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas state troopers constructed a nearly mile-long fence covered in razor wire along the Rio Grande, in the very spot where federal Border Patrol agent started processing thousands of migrants in the last week. The Texas military department says the National Guard did not alert the border control or local officials that this offense would be constructive. On Monday, El Paso officials said National Guard soldiers were to primarily focus on humanitarian efforts and which security of migrants who are already in the city not with deterrent efforts. MARIO D'AGOSTINO, EL PASO DEPUTY CITY MANAGER:  The state is preparing resources. They are relocating to El Paso. They are not activated, anything other than security.

A House version passed the House Judiciary Committee in 2021.European countries are right now working on getting some of these protections for consumers and small business people. There's another bill that is from Senators Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn. That would loosen the stranglehold the companies such as Apple and Google have when it comes to apps. That stranglehold allows them to crush competition. Did you know, for instance, that Apple has blocked third-party app stores from iPhones? You can only use their App Store. Did you know that Apple requires apps use Apple's own rather pricey payment system for any in-app purchase? The legislation from Blackburn and Blumenthal to rein in Apple's behavior on apps was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 20 to 2, in February. But neither of these bills even got a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And similar bills in the House were also denied votes on the floor of the House. The App Store bill in the House didn't even get marked up in its committee. Why? Well, often, leaders deny the opportunity for votes for bills that they are afraid will actually pass. And sources familiar with this fight tell me that congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans, seemed eager to run out the clock. Now, it might be cynical to note the number of relatives of members of Congress, not to mention former top staffers, who have coincidentally found a lucrative jobs in the tech sector. But it's certainly relevant to observe that these tech companies represent one of the biggest sources of campaign funds for the Democratic Party, which fancies itself as standing up for the little guy against corporate behemoths, though in this case, not so much. It might also be worth observing that despite all the anti-big tech rhetoric we heard from Republicans, who are currently casting themselves as populists, very few Republicans, Grassley, Blackburn, and Congressman Ken Buck, accepted seeming all interested in standing up to monopolies. Buck recently speculated about why the bills were never brought to the floor for a House vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO):  There are so many reasons of that.

She made her decision and she's very articulate in the way she pointed out of why she did what she did. And I think that basically, I will make my decision whenever I make the decision, or if I do make a decision, I will do it and I'm not in any hurry to do that. So, you know, the bottom line is I'm not changing how I vote. I'm not changing how I approach a problem. If my Republican colleagues have a good idea, I'm for it. I can go home and explain it. If the Democrats have a good idea, I can support that also. And I'm not afraid to say, I can't support something that makes no sense at all to the Democrats or Republicans. So, people have gotten so, it's what team are you on? I'm on one team. I'm on the American team. I would like to think we are all on the same side. We just have different branches. That's all.

The trifecta of illnesses is colliding with the holidays, raising concerns that more Americans will get sick as they gather indoors or travel for family events.CNN's Dr. Tara Narula joins us now. Tara, what can people do to keep these viruses from ruining their holiday plans? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  As someone who had Christmas of 2020 ruined by COVID, I can attest to the fact that it is not fun to be away from your family. So, certainly what you want to do is think about the events that you want to attend this week or next, you can count back by about five days. During that time, you really want to avoid large indoor, unmasked crowds. If you do have to attend an event during that time, you want to wear a high quality masks like an N95. Certainly, when you are going to attend an event with family in the coming weeks, you want to make sure they're all strategizing and planning out in the same way. And keeping those vulnerable people in your parties safe. So if that means that you are sick and showing signs of symptoms, don't attend. Other things you can think about doing, obviously seeing up to date on your COVID booster, your flu shot, ventilation. You can't underestimate the importance of that. So, HEPA filters, open the windows, go outdoors if you live somewhere warm. And then finally those rapid COVID tests to be taken right before you attend an event or at the door. These are always that you can think about trying to stay safe.",

These are spot shortages, but it's difficult for parents when they are hunting around and certainly in an effort to kind of increase and meet the demand, and increase supply, CVS and Walgreens have initiated these changes. CVS, saying that you cannot buy more than two of these pain or fever reducing medications for kids either in-store or online, and Walgreens, limiting it to six purchases of these medications online. They have not put a limit in-store. We know that, you know, sales of these drugs are up by about 65 percent compared to the previous year. So, it's definitely frustrating and parents may have to search at smaller pharmacies. And again, you don't have to treat every fever in your child as well. So --",
