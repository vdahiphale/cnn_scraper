The grand jury recommends that the district attorney seek appropriate indictments for such crimes where the evidence is compelling.\" Here with me now, we have \"L.A.

September -- January 6, 2001, we were under attack. There were all sorts of words they used for the FBI like domestic terrorism, insurrection, overturning the election. These are really serious charges, and yet the person most associated with those charges has yet to be held responsible in a way that's satisfactory for a significant portion of the country.

Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease that Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.\" I'm joined by CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, great to see you tonight. So, what is frontotemporal dementia and how common is it? JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:  So, Alisyn, frontotemporal dementia is sort of an umbrella term that describes a series of conditions that ultimately result in the loss of neural tissue in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobes are sort of behind your forehead. The temporal lobes are sort of behind your ears. Those are the parts of the brain that are involved with helping you form certain behaviors, process hearing, poor memories. And ultimately, it results in clinical conditions that sometimes radically change the behavior of a patient or result in difficulty communicating. I think, last year, when Mr. Willis's family reported that he was suffering from aphasia, that was the first clue that he had frontotemporal dementia, which often involves some form of aphasia.",
