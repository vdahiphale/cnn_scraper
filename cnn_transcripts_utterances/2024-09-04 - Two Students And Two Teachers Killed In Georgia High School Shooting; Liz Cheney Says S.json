But because there is no national gun registry, like you could run the license plate of a car, they're going to have to take the weapon that was recovered, run the serial number, that will make the manufacturer, whoever that company is, tell them what gun store or dealer that was sent to. They go to that dealer, then they have to go through paper records and say, well, here's the person we sold it to. So, that is how that trail begins.Now, you know, guns are traded and sold from owners and that has even less record associated with it, but 76 percent of guns used in school shootings will have come from the home. So, we'll start with the probability that it probably originated at the home and the records, you know, will direct them otherwise, if that's the case.",

And it's not unusual for the shooter to take his own life or by cop, where the cop actually winds up killing the individual.

So, what I'm looking for now is to see, are we going to have another situation where we could see possibly parents being looked at for prosecution. It is extremely young, but as you said, a lot of these guns come from the home and some kind of we don't have nationwide safe storage laws, which actually criminalize leaving guns accessible to children. You have state by state patchwork of laws. Georgia is not one of them. They have a very permissive gun laws. So, we're going to see how all of this wraps up.We could have a trial, which is kind of rare. As you said, a lot of mass shooters take their own lives, but in recent years they haven't.

This is according to remarks at Duke University. She obtained audio of those remarks.Now, let me read you what she said. She said, as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. And because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I voting for Donald Trump -- not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris. Now, this is notable, of course, Wolf, because over the course of the Democratic National Convention, Democrats repeatedly stressed that Republicans would be backing the vice president, that she would be the bridge going into the next -- going into this election year, and she even told our CNN's Dana Bash that she would also elect a Republican to be on her cabinet. So, clearly, the message from the Harris campaign is that she can appeal to Democrats and Republicans. And so certainly, an endorsement like this from Liz Cheney is one that her campaign, the Harris campaign, will certainly be seizing on, as they continue to make this argument on the campaign trail that she not only can gain support among Democrats, but also Republicans who are not interested or tired of Donald Trump.

Of course, Liz Cheney has also spoken forcefully about January 6th. And one of the themes of this campaign has also been protecting democracy and freedoms from our CNN polling today, that also featured prominently and what voters, the issue that voters are thinking about, again, protecting democracy. So, combine an endorsement like this from a name like Liz Cheney, someone who has spoken repeatedly and forcefully about January 6th, and you can imagine that this is something that the Harris campaign will want to seize on to try to broaden her support, particularly to those Republicans.",

But certainly we'll be asking the Trump campaign those questions. But this is really about, and she said so in her remarks, not voting for Donald Trump. And that is the slice of the electorate that the Harris campaign is targeting. Perhaps it's people who don't know her well enough. Perhaps it is those who are just tired of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. So, these are the people she's going after, and now with Liz Cheney's endorsement, she may make more inroads.",

Price controls completely stop innovation. They stop entrepreneurship. They basically say that only the really large companies that sell products en masse can take the really small profits that the government will allow them to have, right, and it crushes competition.And then you add what she wants to do with the taxes on unrealized gains. I mean, that's crazy. That would destroy the stock market and retirees' 401(k)s and retirement plans. So, her original ideas have been so radical. She had to quickly try to pivot here, but we can't get away from the fact that she thinks the government should put price controls on everything. And once you start that, that process on everyday products, now you've really let, you know, the genie out of the bottle, so to say, in a very bad way. It's very unAmerican. It's not being received very well. Even the why -- when The Washington Post tells Kamala Harris that her economic plan is too liberal and too extreme, you have a major problem. So, I get why she's putting this stuff out, but I think she's already shown her colors.",
