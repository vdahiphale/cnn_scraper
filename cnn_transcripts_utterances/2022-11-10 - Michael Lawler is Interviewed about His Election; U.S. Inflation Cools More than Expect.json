Directionally, we're moving in the right direction. Now, is this something that folks and consumers are home are going to cheer in the streets about? Absolutely not. Inflation is still very high. It's still hovering near 40-year highs. But directionally moving in the right direction. And take a look at futures. Investors like it because it is starting to feel like, well, maybe the medicine is working. Maybe all of these rate hikes are actually starting to work and you're starting to see a meaningfully cooler inflation report. So --",

I mean they are really pulling back after growing so much during the pandemic, they're starting to have to pull back some of that growth. And so, you know, I talked to an analyst a few weeks ago after Meta's earnings report and he said, you know, advertisers know that Meta's ads work. They know that YouTube's ads work.
