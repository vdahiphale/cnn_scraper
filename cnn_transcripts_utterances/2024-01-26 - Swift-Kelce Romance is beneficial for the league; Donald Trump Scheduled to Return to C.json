So, he has just gotten here, and he is here for closing arguments, that will get underway this morning, just around 9Next up, it will be Trump's attorney's turn. They have argued that any harm E. Jean Carroll faced was not Donald Trump's fault and perhaps even one of her own making, by going public with these allegations and by people who just felt that they were responding on their own, that it was not tied to the former president's remarks. So, they will both have about an hour to make their case to the jury. Then the judge will explain to the jury what the law is, and then the jury will get the case and begin their deliberations. You know, the case ending yesterday with Donald Trump on the witness stand. Before he took the stand, E. Jean Carroll's attorneys had played excerpts from a videotaped deposition where Trump was actually making a lot of these statements that he's wanted to say in court but hasn't been able to. Saying, that he thought she was a wacko, that she was mentally ill, that she made up this story. So, they heard that first, and then Trump took the stand after his lawyers discussed back and forth with the judge for about 10 minutes about what exactly they could ask him, because the judge really wanted to limit this to this question of harm, not re litigating the assault or the defamation claim. So, once Donald Trump was on the stand, he was only on for about three minutes. His lawyer asked him, do you stand by your testimony in the deposition? Trump said, 100 percent yes. She also asked him, did you ever instruct anyone to hurt Ms. Carroll in your statements? Trump said, no. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency. Now, the drug -- the judge struck the second half of that answer telling the jury just to listen to the part where he said, no. He really wanted to try to prevent this from turning into a circus. Donald Trump, again, was on the stand for just about three minutes before it was over and then he left and took to the -- his public -- his Truth social statements in order to make the comments that he wanted to make that he couldn't make before the jury.

So, Donald Trump and his campaign were initially on board with this draft resolution, we're told, until they started to see the backlash that it was garnering. But part of the reason they were initially in support of it is because it would greatly benefit Donald Trump if this were to be approved. Not only would he be declared the presumptive nominee by the RNC, but it would also allow him access and to benefit, really, from their ground game strategy and their data operation, as well as from fundraising on the trail with the RNC.But they shifted their tune after they saw the immense backlash that this draft resolution was receiving, especially after it began circling -- circulating in the media. Trump allies were reaching out, saying that they were concerned about this angering a lot of Republicans, and really showing that maybe Trump was trying to stack the deck against Nikki Haley. And I have to say, you know, this is a very unusual thing that the RNC was considering. We know that their policy is to remain neutral. And there is still another Republican in this primary, Nikki Haley. And so, for them to come out and really try to, you know, already declare that Donald Trump would be the presumptive nominee was a bit, you know, a departure from that policy. But look, after Donald Trump issued that statement on social media, saying that this isn't necessary, and we want to win this at the ballot box.

We know, and this is from our new reporting today with my colleague, Fredreka Schouten (ph), that many of these groups, particularly those who are backing Nikki Haley, are very concerned about what having Donald Trump potentially at the top of the ticket could mean for these down ballot races. We talked to one group, the Americans for Prosperity Action, it's a Koch-backed group, that is putting a lot of money behind Nikki Haley, but they told us that their actually main goal is to invest in the 2024 congressional races, particularly in the Senate. I'm just going to quick read you a quote from what their spokesperson told us. He said, \"If ultimately -- if Trump is ultimately the nominee, the threat of a repeat of the last three elections and a Democratic sweep increases dramatically. Making the Senate and the House that much more important.\" And that is really what this comes down to. We've seen Donald Trump impact these down ballot races in the past, not necessarily in the Senate's favor, something many congressmen and outsiders blame Donald Trump for.

So, I think you have that tension. The other thing that's interesting that people forget is this is not a new play. This is an old play out of their playbook, the Trump Camp. In that if you look at the South Carolina primary last go round, four years ago, even though South Carolina has historically prided itself in first in the South, they said, we're not going to do a Republican primary. We won't even allow another voice, another electoral contest against Trump in South Carolina. And that was the last presidential primary season. So, this is not a new thing.

They had hoped it would go so far.And yet, when you consider the six immediate measures that this court has ruled in favor of. And again, Sara, I think it's important to remember, these are preliminary emergency measures that South Africa had been requesting the International Criminal -- the International Court of Justice to take in order that the war in Gaza ceased so that these events could be investigated and the more substantive allegations be pursued by this court. That will happen, but it could take years for this court to decide on the question of whether or not genocide has been committed inside Gaza. Meanwhile though, those six measures, extremely significant, because whilst they stop short of calling for a ceasefire, they do call for the immediate end of the killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to the Palestinian people, which this court has recognized are a protected people. And that is extremely significant. It does go in the direction of the South Africans, and yet have a listen to what South Africa's foreign minister had to say in response and an acknowledgement of their disappointment that the court didn't go so far as to call for an immediate ceasefire.

And yet the order that has been made here by the court does pile huge pressure on Israel, not only to report back on what's happening and what measures it's taken to prevent the further committing of acts, the killings that I mentioned a moment ago. That significant pressure on Israel, we had been very curious as we heard the pro-Palestinian protesters here shout, as we heard those measures pronounced very much favorable to what they heard. Almost surprised that the court had gone so far in their direction. This is what Benjamin Netanyahu had to say a moment ago in a short video message that was released in the wake of the ruling.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
