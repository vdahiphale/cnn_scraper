      "sentences": "Mexico`s most dangerous active volcano once again is putting residents on alert as over the last several daysthere have been eruptions witnessed at the Popocatepetl volcano and that is causing officials to raise the level of alert to a yellow alert which indicates that residents, and there are millions of residents who live in the vicinity of this volcano may need to consider evacuating should this volcano erupt. Already there has been a duration of the air quality as ash has gone into the area. It has caused residents to have to swoop up the ash on the streets, so officials are warning people to make sure that the ash does not get into their water supply. Some schools have been closed as well, have some parks. There have been flights that have been delayed as a result of the ash, because, of course, ash, once it is emitted into the atmosphere, can be very damaging, very dangerous cure to air travel. At this point, officials say that because this is an active volcano that`s been active now for some years, that they are simply in a position of observing the volcano, that they feel they would have enough time before any major eruption to warn residents to begin evacuating. That appeared to be less ash that had been admitted by the volcano on Tuesday. But all the same, as people in these Mexican states keep a close eye on this volcano and what could happen next. No one is breathing a sigh of relief just yet. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The day which also signals the unofficial start to summer, originated in the years following the Civil War, which ended in 1865, the country establishing a Decoration Day where the nation could decorate the graves of those who died in war with flowers. Well, over 100 years later, in 1971, Congress made it an official holiday. CNN had the chance to speak with a few veterans in active-duty military about the first time they knew they wanted to serve their country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON RUMBAUGH, CORPORAL RET. U.S. MARINE CORPS: When I was laying there, I really, you know, didn`t think that I was going to make it. The Marines that were around me. I`m sure that they didn`t think I was going to make it either. So, you know, it really shows me that I`m here for a reason. What really made things clear for me was looking back at my life up to, you know, this point. I always did everything for myself and I never really took a step back and said, you know what, I just need to start doing things for other people. And I knew that I could do that in the Marines. JAMES BROWN, FORMER SERGEANT, U.S. AIR FORCE: My dad was furious. My dad didn`t talk to me for like a solid month. He really hated it when I said, I was on leave to go to the military. I`m from Chicago originally. I`m from the south side. We thought that, you know, the scholarship and education, I stuff that I had would get me out of the hood, you know, which it did. But I wanted to get farther out the net. I had higher aspirations of that I want to get out of the country. And the Air Force was supposed to be the most intelligent branch of the service. I went all over. I mean, I went to Scotland, I went to Wales, I went to -- every time I had a chance to get off, I went somewhere. I traveled somewhere. ELEANOR RIZZUTO, LIEUTENANT RET. U.S. ARMY: At 21, I was just finishing my nurse`s training when World War II broke out. In fact, we were on the chow line when, over the loudspeaker, it was announced that the war had started. Being in the service made me grow up. I was a young girl, just lived home, and all of a sudden, you`re thrown out with all kinds of people and places that you read about but never saw. It was quite an experience. It`s something I`m very happy I did, but I would never want to do it again. FLORENT GROBERG, CAPT. RET. U.S. ARMY, MDEAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT: My uncle was killed by a terrorist organization, and I knew at that point that I wanted to fight against those type of individuals. And so I graduated from Ranger school in October 23 of 2009, and just about six weeks later, I was in Afghanistan. ARNIE ALBORNOZ, FORMER MAJOR, U.S. ARMY: Growing up in South Shore, Long Islands, you hear about West Point, which is where I was fortunate enough to go to college. I was a junior when 911 happened. I distinctly remember being in class. No one was teaching. We were just sitting there watching. Everyone was in shock. Most of the professors there are active-duty military. Each one had made a comment to the effect of, you know, cadets. We don`t know what`s going to happen, we don`t know what this means, but your nation`s going to call on you to go serve. I never thought I`d stay in for 10 years, but I enjoyed it very much so. And it was the best job I`ve ever had in my life and likely will ever have. So I look back on it with just the fondest memories. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
