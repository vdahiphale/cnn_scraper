I mean, in Arizona is a huge conversation around -- it's a 15-week ban in Arizona now. There's conversations about it being a near total ban. But sharing this so publicly, this doesn't happen very often, Senator. How are you feeling?EVA BURCH, (D) ARIZONA STATE SENATOR:  To be honest with you, I'm feeling really good. I'm feeling so lucky to have the opportunity to hopefully and potentially make an impact. Arizona as a swing state. We are really right in the thick of this conversation about how does health care impacts the voice that voters have? And I'm just so hopeful that people will really be able to take this conversation and that it will translate into action, that people will be more interested in the political process. There'll be more interested in their local elections and in what they can do to move the needle in the right direction. My experience at the clinic yesterday was really as good as it could be. I felt so welcomed. I felt like I had all the information that I needed. I felt like I was getting such superior care. And I felt -- I felt fine. A little bit crampy and, of course, it's disappointing to be in this position again, but I got in my dad's struck and we went to the drive-through and I went home and sat on the couch surrounded by people who I love and I have felt good since then.",

Even though we only have a one seat deficit in both the House and the Senate, that's not how the legislature has really operated in Arizona. None of our bills get heard. None of our bills barely ever make it to committee. I've had one bill be heard in the last two legislative sessions. So there's not an accurate representation of the people of Arizona in the legislature because that's not how Republican majority leadership is running the legislature. They're running it like it's a monopoly. And the people of Arizona are not being heard.So I'm not surprised about the outcome of giving that speech. I'm not expecting things to change within the chamber. I'm expecting things to change in Arizona. I'm expecting us to make the difference, because that's the only opportunity we have left.",

He's struggling to find a company to underwrite the bond related to his penalty that he faces for the civil fraud case in New York. And if he doesn't scare the money or a loan by Monday, Attorney General Letitia James can start the process of starting to seize and collect on that penalty.At the very same time, Donald Trump is facing other money troubles.

As you heard from some of those numbers, fundraising has been a bright spot for the Biden campaign, and it is reflected in what we saw in the filings overnight. That is, again, the $71 million in the Biden campaign account. They fundraised $53 million last month. And all in all, $155 million with the affiliated committees. Thats a pretty strong outlook for the Biden campaign as it's ramping up in this election season, and again, building out more offices, hiring more staffers across the country, particularly in those battleground states that President Biden only narrowly won in 2020.What these numbers don't yet reflect, of course, is the $10 million that were brought in 24 hours after the State of the Union, which was another moment that the Biden campaign highlighted. Now, of course, last month, just to remind viewers, President Biden did do a west coast swing where he did fundraisers. It was also a month where the Biden campaign felt that the rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump was crystallized, bringing in more funds to the Biden camp. So all in all, the president is going and continuing his travel blitz, continuing fundraisers in Texas last night, and with even more on the horizon for one event that may be the biggest fundraising event ever. That's next week in New York where President Biden will be alongside former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. So clearly the campaign just continuing their efforts to shore up those funds, knowing that it's going to be a close race and those funds are going to be critical to paying for those digital ads, those TV ads, and all the rest.

We heard yesterday that that's not the case, at least not this year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell essentially said that the inflation story hasn't changed very much. If you look at their forecasts, the forecasts of the Fed officials, they suggest that they still expect three rate cuts sometime this year. Future years, different story. It looks like we may not get as many cuts in the future, but for the time being, still on path, which essentially means that there is more money going around. There is more liquidity in the markets and that generally tends to be good for stocks.",

The upshot of all of this is that that feared recession that had been in the news and on a lot of market analysts' lips not too long ago, does not seem to be in the sight. It looks like the economy is going to continue remaining strong.
