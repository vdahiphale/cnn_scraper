So, I think a lot of Americans are comparing it to the pre-pandemic economy.And if you look at that overall price increase, this four-year period, since October of 2019 according to CPI, look at that, prices are up 20 percent. Compare that to the normal four-year period since 1948, it's up just 11 percent. So, prices are falling (ph) much, much higher compared to what we normally see over a four-year period.
