He is pleading not guilty to all three felony charges. Yesterday, 12 jurors and four alternates were seated in the case. Among them, gun owners and relatives of addicts. The president issuing a statement of support for his son, writing this, quote, \"as the president, I don't and won't comment on pending federal cases, but as a dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength.\" Our panel is back. Jonah Goldberg, this, of course, something that is incredibly difficult for any father to have to go through. He is also, though, the president of the United States. How - what is the right way to balance these two roles here for him, for the president?",

At the same time, they're kind of - I mean, in a way, they're kind of lucky that this is as narrowly focused on the gun charge and not the full, rich tapestry of Hunter Biden problems, which is one reason why the talking point with a lot of Republicans doesn't work when you say, well, this, you know, the DOJ is targeting Trump. It's also going after Hunter Biden. They're like, yes, but they're only going after this very narrow thing.So, look, I don't know. I think he should - that should be his last statement. It's fine. Just stay out of it is - is the only advice I would give him. And Kate's the pro at this stuff.

He is making a statement about his son's case days after the former president is (INAUDIBLE). He knows that he has a set the tone for what he thinks is the responsible behavior in a court of - in a court proceeding, right?

I think, you know, what - what Abbe Lowell's tactics are, obviously he is the attorney for the president's son. So him. But Raskin has said this many times, and so have many members of Congress, including Democrats, we are not electing Hunter Biden to become president. No one is saying Hunter Biden is perfect.

But I do want to make sure that we separate the reasons for that, right? This is Joe Manchin's choice entirely. Senator Menendez was basically pushed off the Democratic stage by a primary because he has refused to step down in the context of these allegations. Still allegations. He is currently on trial.It -- I - my - the thing that I kind of wonder about Menendez is, is this the first test we get of whether Donald Trump is the only one who can ever - who can overcome stuff like this because, I mean, I'd be really surprised if he were to, you know, actually win a Senate race, but he seems to be trying the things that Trump has successfully tried.",

The second time he's going through an indictment. He survived that one. The party stood by him. He regained his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a high perch for any senator.And, you know, you're seeing this happen for the second time. And we'll see if he survives it. I mean, obviously, the - Andy Kim, the New Jersey Democrat who is running for the Senate seat, is likely to become the Democratic favorite. And, you know, there is some conversations about Republicans, but New Jersey has not had a Republican senator and 40, 50 years. So, I don't see that happening. But, you know, Menendez's future beyond this moment will be interesting, right? We've seen a lot of people take some time off from public life after facing legal troubles or any sort of controversy and then come back stronger. But I think you're right, I think we'll see if Donald Trump is going to be the only political, you know, character of our time who can overcome legal battles and still get public office.",
