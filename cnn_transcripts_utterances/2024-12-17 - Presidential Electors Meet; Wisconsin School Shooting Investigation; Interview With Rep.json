According to police, a second grader called 911 when shots rang out at Abundant Life Christian School, and the first officer arrived on scene within minutes.

They're trying to figure out whether the gun that was used in this shooting was owned by or possessed by the parents. And they're also asking ATF to do a trace on the gun, where it was purchased, when was it purchased, by whom, basically tracing the steps all the way to how it got in the hands of this 15-year-old student. This second grader, as you mentioned, had called 911, a very traumatizing moment. This apparently came out of a call from a classroom in a study hall, where there were students of mixed grade levels. Here are a couple of the students just reeling from what happened that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADLER JEAN-CHARLES, SIXTH GRADER:  We heard them, and then some people started crying.

And that would be a federally licensed firearms dealer, most likely a gun store. Then, who purchased it? But in the cases where we have seen across the country in these school shootings carried out by students in high school or younger, those guns most often come from the home, were legally purchased, were legally possessed. And when we heard the chief yesterday, he said that they are looking into whether that's the case. So, if they interviewed the parents and the parents cooperated, the likelihood is that they know that.",

The chief also mentioned some things this morning I think are very interesting and very important, two things, mental health. And we hear this time and time again, the mental health of the child, what she was dealing with, if anything. Obviously, there's something there, in my opinion. And, of course, the second thing, as you were just talking about, access to the firearm that was used. Those are, I think, the two most important things.

We want to give attention to the people who are actually doing something to stop this from happening again, which is, let's face it, likely not going to be Congress.It's going to have to be school administrators, teachers, students, and it's going to have to be parents.

They don't snap. Every study has told us again and again that they see, they plan, they prepare, they arm, they map these things out, sometimes over days, often over weeks, in the case of the Nashville school shooter, literally over years. And during that time, they give off a number of signals that people around them, if they are trained to recognize them, should see. And the FBI has at FBI.gov/Prevent an entire kit of the list of 15 of these potential tells, whether you see a cluster of them or a couple of them. And then they get this, which is people don't want to call the police on their friend, especially if they might be wrong. But it talks about finding someone you can trust, a teacher, a coach, a guidance counselor, a parent, a friend, and ways to intervene, which I think, since we already know gun control is a discussion that's going to drag on for the rest of time, this is a solution that could start to happen tomorrow if people knew what the resources were and where to find them.",

Researching her writings. Is there anything -- if they have a copy of this manifesto, are there any writings in any of her personal effects that have the same verbiage or parts of the verbiage?

Yes, the election was some 42 days or so ago, and Donald Trump is going to begin his second term in office in 34 days or so.But today is a key part of this becoming official. So we're seeing state by state by state happening right now. It's under way in Wisconsin, in Nevada, as we saw there in Minnesota, some other states as well. But during the 3:00 Eastern hour this afternoon, the state of Texas will put the former president and soon-to-be-next president over the top in terms of 270 electoral votes. So that is something that this is a peaceful transition of power. What is unusual this time around, there are 13 fake electors from four years ago, some of whom are under criminal charges, who are electors this time as well. So that is, I guess, the hangover, if you will, of when Donald Trump refused to accept his defeat four years ago. The difference today is, Kamala Harris is accepting her defeat. And, ironically, at the end of all of this early next month, she will preside in the Senate chamber over these electors actually becoming certified. And she will do as Al Gore did in 2000, accept her own defeat. That is how it should work in the United States of America.",

The key here is transparency and making sure people know that we're not telling them or insulting them and saying that they're not seeing what they're seeing, but actually explain to them what they are. This is where I have called on the FBI, Homeland Security, and others to please do a briefing right away, come out, explain to the country and to the people that I represent what they know, right? And that transparency, that information is critically important. And then, of course, to give local law enforcement, and I have got bipartisan legislation to do this, the tools they need to be able to monitor and ensure this isn't the Wild West of drones, right, that actually only the drones that are licensed and should be in the air are in the air. I'm not talking about recreational drones that you have in your backyard, right, as someone puts -- you get for the holidays. I'm talking about these large drones that I'm concerned are over military bases, as have been reported, over reservoirs, over critical infrastructure, and over airports.

And,obviously, I have an Intelligence Committee briefing, as I mentioned, coming up in the next couple hours and hope to learn more. I feel good about the fact that there's no foreign threats here. That said, I think people should know, well, what is this surge of activity? Where are they coming from? How do we make sure that we monitor the skies properly? I have called for an FAA traffic monitoring of the sky, just like we do at our airports with planes, so we know what's out there and know what's going on. You can't have just people throwing up drones everywhere, these unlicensed, unwelcome drones, and making sure that they're not capturing information or anything else.
