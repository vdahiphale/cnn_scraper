War is raging in Eastern Europe, and now war in the Middle East. We continue to see China menace in the Asia Pacific. We've got to meet this moment with American strength. We're the leader of the free world, we're the arsenal of democracy. I would tell my old colleagues, it's time. Let Congress work its will, let them crunch the numbers. For heaven's sakes, let's get resources to secure the southern border of the United States as well.

Hundreds of trucks are waiting along the Egyptian side of the border. Diplomatic efforts to establish a continuous humanitarian corridor have failed, and there is no more time for debate.

Dr. Abusada said they haven't seen any of the medical supplies that have been going inside Gaza. This is just another problem, another obstacle to be overcome.

Well, it didn't happen.And despite what the Israeli government and what the Palestinian Authority said, that don't have these elections, because Hamas will win in Gaza, they did go ahead and have the elections and of course, Hamas won. At that time, I went in in 2006, and then again, June, just after the last, you know, the latest war, 2008-2009. Hamas was moving from having been mostly, mostly according to the people a social organization. It was becoming more and more militant, more and more involved in \"the resistance\" and becoming very, very militant in that way. But what I did notice and which I think is a cautionary tale, is I visited the homes of Palestinians in Gaza City and around that, you know, heavily -- always heavily bombarded north Gaza and went to civilians' homes, there was a little boy who I always remember, Hamza, five years old, who his parents showed me what had happened to their house in the latest Israeli campaign. And this is a cautionary tale about what happens when people are constantly subjected to this kind of violence, and how they and where they put their faith and their, you know, their politics, even as a kid for the future. Just watch this a little bit, an excerpt. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (voice over):  Since this latest round of war, teachers have noticed not just sadness, but anger.

They have no faith in society, not their teachers, just in what they're told is their defender, and that is Hamas in this case. And so these generations, and that was in 2009, he is nearly 20 now, young Hamza, where is he today? This is a very cautionary tale.
