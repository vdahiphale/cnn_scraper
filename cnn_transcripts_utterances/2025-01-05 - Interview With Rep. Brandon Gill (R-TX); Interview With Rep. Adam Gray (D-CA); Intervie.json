There are 15 days left before the peaceful transfer of power,hopefully, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And as Biden wraps up his four years in office, Trump is ramping up his preparations to return to office, along with some of his national security nominees. Trump met last night with Italy's prime minister at Mar-a-Lago in Florida just before Biden's official visit to Italy this week. Trump also strategized with House Speaker Mike Johnson about how to get his priorities on the border, energy and tax cuts passed through Congress this spring. The president-elect wants one giant reconciliation package, which would require only 51, instead of 60 Senate votes. More on that coming up. But, first, tomorrow, four years after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, Congress will again convene on January 6 to certify Trump's return to the White House. These proceedings will be led by Trump's 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, as Washington bolsters security ahead of the event. Through -- though a repeat of the violence of four years ago does not, thankfully, seem imminent, tomorrow's certification a remarkable turnaround for Trump, who was widely condemned by even some of his strongest supporters four years ago this week for his role in the attack. And Mr. Trump is now promising to pardon many of those convicted of crimes committed four years ago on January 6 as soon as he takes office. Joining us now to discuss, Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. She is counting the ballots tomorrow. She helped write the Electoral Count Act designed to prevent another January 6 tragedy. Thanks so much for being here. And happy new year to you, Senator. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN):  Thanks, Jake. Great to be on.",

I'm talking about the billionaires. And if that's what they're going to do, they're going to add greatly to whatever -- whatever they end up doing on spending. You're still going to have a problem with the debt. And so what I see this as being for my Senate colleagues is a moment. This is a moment where they're going to have to decide, are you going to just add to the debt and do everything Donald Trump tells you to do, or are you going to stand up on some of these things and say, wait a minute, we're worried about the debt? Our job as Democrats is to make that case, to pick our battles. We're not going to pick every single battle. There will be some things that are red lines. But we're in this. We're in this in a big way. And there's ways to make your case without being able to be the deciding vote. We realize that we're up against a lot with the votes. But we have a strong case to make about the debt, about their claims that they were going to stand up for average people. And tax cuts for billionaires and going after a newspaper for a poll in -- that they don't like, that the president didn't like, the president-elect, in Des Moines, man, that is not going to help people with their health care costs. It's not going to help them with childcare. It's not going to help them with housing.

We all agree there's a housing supply issue, and we want to build more housing, so housing can be more affordable. So I'm excited to see more young people in leadership. The new chair of the Progressive Caucus is young. I was inspired to run for office the first time because of that first young wave of women of color running for office for the first time. And I think it's just the beginning, and we are seeing these changes.",

I think what's wrong with this town and so many capitals around the country is just this extreme partisanship all the time.
