It is a report you will see first OUTFRONT.Plus, four years and at least six and a half million tax dollars later, Trump administration special counsel John Durham's special report, was it everything Trump promised it would be? And a Florida teacher under investigation for playing a Disney movie that happens to include gay character. Chasten Buttigieg, a former teacher and husband of Pete Buttigieg, is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russia's worst day of the war. In fact, it's the worst day for Putin and his prized Air Force in more than 50 years, more than 50 years. So, here's what happened. Ukraine's anti-aircraft missile systems took down four of Putin's prized aircraft according to censor.net, which is an independent Ukrainian news outlet. Now, that's two fighter jets worth an estimated $200 million each, and two helicopters. And judging by the video we have here, it reportedly does not hear that the crew had time to eject. Now, the worst day in more than 50 years for Putin's air force, Ukraine, so far, stopped short of taking responsibility for the attack, only saying tonight that the aircraft, quote, ran into some trouble. Now, these attacks could be a precursor, of course, to the counteroffensive. Just today, two more strikes in the Russian occupied city of Luhansk. One was actually inside a barbershop, appeared to be targeted taking out a top official with ties to Russia. And these are significant strikes because keep in mind, Luhansk is the city was illegally annexed by Russia at the beginning of the war, on the first day. It has been, until now, a safe zone for Russia. So this is a game-changer in that regard. And, in Bakhmut meanwhile to the west, new video out front tonight of the intense shelling going on there. And you can hear it, many of these firing, like Wagner fighters, according to \"The Washington Post\", the boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who talked about so much here, made Ukraine a jaw-dropping offer. According to leaked U.S. intelligence documents, Prigozhin offered to hand over Putin's troop positions if Ukrainian commanders withdrew their soldiers from Bakhmut. That would've been allowed Prigozhin to declare victory and get the credit. Now, that did not happen but it is a stunning thing, right, to give over the location of Russian troops to the Russians will be killed all en masse by Ukrainians. Prigozhin denying discussions like that took place. Ukraine's president played coy telling \"The Washington Post\", quote, this is a matter of intelligence. D you want me tried for treason? Also, Zelenskyy is not denying it there. But it comes as something else happened, which is strange. The man you are looking at there is the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. And we've talked about him quite a bit. He's making it public showing it, trying to squash rumors of his failing health. This image which was released is releasing more questions. And, of course, he is the top ally for Putin. He fell ill after visiting Moscow. In this image you see what appears to be a bandage on his left hand and rumors of his health have been growing. He looked frail last week, unable to make the short walk with Putin to the memorial of the Unknown Soldier. This is all crucial because, of course, Belarus has been the staging ground for Putin's invasion into Ukraine. Matthew Chance is OUTFRONT live in London. And, Matthew, Ukraine edging closer to that long-awaited counteroffensive tonight, already it appears dealing the worst day to Putin's air force, not just of this war but in more than 50 years.",

GENERAL BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL OF U.S. ARMY EUROPE: Well, to lose four aircraft in one day would certainly send shockwaves through the aviation community of the Russian federation forces just like it would anybody. I'm interested in how this happened. It seems that Ukraine may have been able to infiltrate capabilities in there still not entirely confirmed how it happened but if they were able to do that, that would really demonstrate a level of sophistication that will worry the Russians.

If something were wrong with him, if he was no longer in power, what would do what would that do to Putin, Ambassador? JOHN SULLIVAN, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  It's a big problem for him. As you mentioned, President Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with a hard authoritarian hand for almost 30 years. He was a vital supporter of Putin's war against Ukraine. He's the one foreign leader that Putin meets with more than anybody else. I think he has met with him something like 14 times since the war started. So his most important ally.",

And then when you put that against all these other good news that's been happening, you do have the sense that we could be very close to Ukraine achieving catastrophic success. I think this counteroffensive has three conditions. Number one, are the Ukrainians ready? Number two, have they degraded the Russians enough? And number three, is the ground ready?

Charges, though, were ultimately dropped. Tonight, though, that suspect is being held without bond. So, authorities have released his name, he is 49 year old Xuan Kha Tran Pham. And authorities say just before 11:00, he went into this district office of Congressman Gerry Connolly. He attacked with a metal bet two staffers. One was a senior aide who was hit in the head, one was actually an intern and this was her first day on the job. They both went to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Now, as for the congressman, he was at an event, a ribbon-cutting event. He wasn't here. But he did say that this was a rage-filled attack. He says the suspect shattered some glass in the conference room, broke several computers, and tonight that suspect is being held without bond, Erin.",
