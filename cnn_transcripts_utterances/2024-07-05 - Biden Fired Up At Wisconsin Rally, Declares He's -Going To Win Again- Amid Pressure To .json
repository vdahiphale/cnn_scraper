And that is certainly still a true. But it is a bigger if tonight than it was even yesterday. But look, she's the sitting vice president.This is the Biden-Harris campaign. So, there's been a lot of progress this week, if you will, in terms of moving on toward passing the torch to her with the exception of President Biden. So where do we sit tonight as he is locked into this. But should he make a decision at some point to step aside? There's no doubt that time is running short here for Democrats and vice president Harris certainly would be considered the front runner. As one top Democratic official just told me a couple days ago, how could Democratic delegates stand in the way of this historic nomination? Of course, the nation's first African-American and Asian vice president could be the Democratic nominee for president. The question is, could she win? It's a risk, no doubt in the eyes of Democrats.

What you're seeing is the Biden operation finally trying to stop the bleeding. Now, I can tell you, even so this is a White House in crisis right now.And not just inside the White House, but inside the campaign as well. Because, you know, while we're talking about -- we've obviously talked to donors and reporters that feel like the -- and Democratic officials that feel the White House has not been completely candid about the age, there are people inside the operations, inside the White House, inside the campaign, that do not feel that senior leadership was completely honest with them in terms of Joe Biden's limitations given his age. And there is a trust deficit with the bosses, with the people in charge. And that is contributing to the rolling turmoil. Now, I think there are some people that have been heartened by the moves the last 48 hours, but it's unclear if it's going to be enough.

The American people see this race right now is a race between a guy who they think is incapable, and one who is unimaginable. Joe Biden had problems with the age question before the debate. Of course, those problems had been significantly magnified since that catastrophic performance a week ago. And frankly, you know, it just seems like we've been gaslit. I mean, they've been hiding Joe Biden from the public, at least in terms of -- in terms of unscripted events. And this is coming back to bite them. And Mark Warner and other, you know, thoughtful Democrats recognize this problem, that for these down ballot candidates in these competitive districts, this is a real issue. So, I can't imagine why anybody thinks, you know, his continuing -- Biden's continuing as a candidate is somehow in the best interest of the country.

The thing is that he's going to have to do this every day that he's in public between now and November. But I also think that we have to keep in mind in terms of balancing out every breathless thing that we report out about President Biden. Let's look at Donald Trump, and the reason why I brought up the voters at the rally, Charlie and I love you, but they do matter, they're voters. And I've talked to other voters as well who have not gone to any rally and they have said to me, as well as others, groups that have gone door to door, that they will take Joe Biden on his worst day over Donald Trump who wants to instill the -- an imperial presidency and wants to impose Project 2025 where he will deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, fire 50,000 people from the civil service, change the face of America.

And -- but here's the thing, she's accomplished, she's brilliant. She's got a tremendous personality.She's cool. She resonates. She can resonate with working class people in places like Ohio. But here's the thing, the country is dying for an aspirational message around unity, around reconciliation, around healing and coming together and bringing in and ushering in an age of reform that we can find some common ground so we can get to some higher ground. That's the message Kamala Harris can deliver, I think in a very elevated and high minded way to inspire us to do something. This exhausted majority is still out there, those double haters that the pollsters talk a lot about, they don't like Biden, they don't like Trump, they're just dying for somebody new. We have that. And we have a very unique opportunity to change horses in the middle of a race. So, why wouldn't we do that? You've got to -- we've got to be decisive. We've got to have confidence in her and confidence in the party. And I'm telling you, she will resonate. And her -- that kind of message will resonate with Americans, it'll hit like a lightning bolt in the electorate. And there'll be so much energy behind the campaign. You know, our communities of color, you know, the black folks, brown folks, the young people will be energized. And I believe she can come to the industrial Midwest with the reindustrialization message around the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure bill, she will resonate with those guys in union halls and Pittsburgh, and Youngstown, Ohio and Milwaukee and Detroit and Flint, Michigan, she'll connect to those folks. And in will put Donald Trump in the age of Trump to bed for good. And that's what I'm looking to do. And I want to be a part of helping her do that.",

I think Judge Cannon, you know, may very well decide to accept it, I don't know. I think that would be an unfortunate outcome.But given the law that the Supreme Court created this week, and they did create this new doctrine of immunity, there are a lot of open and very expansive questions that are going to be available to Judge Cannon to pursue and that could be resolved in Trump's favor. Now, I will say one thing is that even if these immunity argument somehow carries the day, the subsequent obstruction counts, right, because there's half of the cases that are retaining the documents and the other half of the cases about the subsequent obstruction.

We're not going to see this case, go to trial in 2024. And that's a travesty because I think it is a very clear case, maybe the clearest case for possessing classified documents and the indictment says the crime begins after as soon as Trump leaves office, that's when they charge it.
