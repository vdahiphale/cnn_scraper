We'll tell you about that, as well.It is 6 a.m. here in Washington, about noon in Capri, Italy. You're looking at live pictures right now at Capri, Italy and the G-7 meeting there. Secretary of State Tony Blinken, expected to speak. And just a short while from now, just minutes from now Good morning, everyone. I'm Jim Acosta, in for Kasie Hunt. We're following breaking news this morning. The U.S. confirming Israel has carried out a military strike inside Iran. Three blasts were heard in the central province of Isfahan where Iran has nuclear facilities and a drone factory. The Israeli military not commenting on the incident. A source telling CNN the U.S. had advanced notice but did not endorse the strike. Iran has ramped up the rhetoric. The country's foreign minister telling CNN the response to any further Israeli action would be immediate and at a maximum level. CNN's Paula Hancocks is live in Beirut with more. Paula, I guess we should note that Iranian official said that before what took place last night. So perhaps the calculation will be different once they assess the damage. But what's the latest? What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, we're seeing a very different response after the attack than the rhetoric we were hearing from Iranian officials before the strike.Now what we're hearing through state media in Iran is Iranian officials saying that explosions that were heard in the area of Isfahan overnight, where the air defense systems of Iran that were taking out three drones. Now they have said there has been no damage whatsoever. They say that their nuclear facilities are intact, they are secure, and that is something that the U.N. nuclear agency, the IAEA, has confirmed, as well, saying that there has been no damage to the nuclear facilities. That also based in the same area. Now it's understood, at least from -- from state media that it was potentially near a -- an army base. It's not clear what the target was. We haven't heard from the Israelis. They have given a \"no comment.\" We haven't heard from the Iranian side, what they believed was being targeted, as well, nor from any other sides. So there is still information that we are waiting for before we can assess whether or not the Iranians are likely to want to respond to this. Now, we knew that the Israelis were going to have some kind of response following that unprecedented drone and missile attack against Israel on the weekends. And what we've heard from the rhetoric side, and as you point out, this was before the strike happened, but just hours before the strike. The Iranian foreign minister speaking on CNN saying that, if Israel was going to carry out any kind of attack against the assets of Iran, then there would be an immediate response, an immediate and at a maximum level, and it would be decisive. We've heard, as well, in recent days from the President Raisi, for example, saying that it would be an even bigger response than what we saw last weekend. Now, whether or not what we have seen overnight, which appears at first sight, to be limited in scope. We did have a U.S. official, as well as telling CNN that they believed Israel would make sure it was limited in scope. So they wouldn't escalate the situation. But from what we have seen so far, there is certainly hope in the region that this may be something that Iran does not feel the need to respond to. Now of course, this is speculation at this point. It is experts assessing whether or not Tehran will feel that they need to have some kind of retaliation. But we've heard from the U.S. We have heard from countries around the world, asking for de-escalation and for calm heads -- Jim. [06:05:11]",

Joel, we talked in the previous hour about this. You know, what the Iranians said before the strike rate might be a little different from what they say this morning and reaction to this strike.

And to Iran, it's in their interest to not escalate, as well. And hopefully, this is not going to escalate. It does look like two boxers bumping gloves right now and sort of going back to their corners, potentially.

And so by hitting Isfahan in the area near nuclear facilities, you're telling me Iranians don't even try it. And then of course, hitting some military infrastructure, batteries, whatnot set (ph) the ability essentially for Iran to project its power, they had to do that, as well. But a very limited deterrent. They did not want to go hit civilian areas, clearly, and they did not make it a massive assault.

That doesn't necessarily mean in the moment of truth that they're not going to be there. But it is crucial for Israel, still, to capitalize on the positive momentum they got from having multiple countries backing them last weekend and try to change dynamics in the region from their security perspective and from the American perspective. Ultimately, it's our opportunity to engage, as Secretary Blinken is doing right now with G-7, multiple countries to try to calm the situation down. That's the best way forward.",

Yes.Now, why that happened, you might have heard that each side has ten strikes of jurors. So limited number of people that they can get rid of for any reason. And I presume they just ran out of strikes yesterday. They had gotten rid of the jurors that they didn't want on the panel, and then just had to take what came. And as he started seeing some of the folks toward the end of the panel started having slightly more political backgrounds, I think on paper, at least in the abstract.
