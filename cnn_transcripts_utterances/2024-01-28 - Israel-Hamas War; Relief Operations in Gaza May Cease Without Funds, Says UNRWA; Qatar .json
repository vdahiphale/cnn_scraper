Relief and Works Agency after accusations by Israel that a handful of their workers were involved in the October 7th Hamas terror attack. Israel has not publicly released its evidence, but it says it shared that evidence with UNRWA and the United States. The U.N. group fired nine accused staffers and launched an investigation into the allegations. It sent -- it said that one other staffer accused had died and that the identities of two others are being verified. Well, now the U.N. Secretary General is weighing in. Saying, the abhorrent alleged acts of these staff members must have consequences. But the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalized. The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met.Well, 2 million civilians in Gaza rely on that aid from UNRWA. These needs are of course growing as Israel continues its military operation in Khan Younis. Families are evacuating but struggling to find shelter. Besides hunger, fierce rain and cold weather are making their escape even more miserable. Well further north in Gaza City, Palestinians are rushing to grab sacks of flour that were delivered Saturday. The U.N. warned this week that parts of the territory are facing famine, and residents say the aid isn't reaching everyone.

I have three children, and I don't know how to feed them. God help us. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Only the young men can take sacks of flour, but the elderly can't. The children, the orphans, and the mothers of orphans, only the strong young men can take a share, but the orphans don't have shares at all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you.Well, CNN has some new video out of southern Israel near the Gaza border showing armed Israeli soldiers guarding more than two dozen Palestinian detainees, wearing only lightweight disposable white coveralls despite the freezing temperatures. Sitting and kneeling on the ground, the men are blindfolded and barefoot, their hands are tied behind their backs. Israeli authorities say, the men are being held for what they called suspected terrorist activities after being detained inside Gaza. The IDF says in a statement, \"Relevant suspects are taken for further questioning within Israel. Individuals who are not found to be taking part in terrorist activities are released back into Gaza as soon as possible.\" The IDF claims the men are being treated in accordance with international law and that they were stripped to ensure they weren't carrying any concealed weapons. The U.N. and rights groups have previously condemned Israel for alleged mistreatment of detainees. Many detainees have alleged abuse at the hands of Israeli forces, and that includes several Palestinian boys and men who told CNN in December they were detained for five days before being released, emerging with bruised and swollen wrists. Well, an IDF official estimates that only 60 percent of the tunnels built by Hamas under Gaza have been found so far as the war with Hamas nears its fourth month. But as CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, that's just one of the challenges facing Israel as they work to drive out militants and find the remaining hostages.

Much of the gold, for example, from the Asante tribes were seized by what would now be called war crimes. The local population, sneeringly regarded as natives and as inferior were killed by modern Mauser rifles and so on, and were -- their temples and their homes were stripped of anything with gold or silver and it was auctioned off. It frequently went to the British Museum or to one or other national museums.

Instead, she's on the ballot for the state's primary. But the caucus is really where the state's crucial delegates will be awarded.And so, that was really a big part of Donald Trump's message on Saturday. He was telling voters to skip the primary altogether and make sure they get out for him on caucus day. But because Donald Trump and his team don't really see Nikki Haley as a player here, that allowed them to Donald Trump to pivot to more of a general election message. And a big part of that message was talking about the border. One reason is because the border is a key issue for Nevada. It's a state with a large migrant population. But another part of it is the timing, and that's what I found really noteworthy. He spent a lot of time railing against Congress' bipartisan negotiations over securing the southern border, and he went farther than he had before in declaring that there is \"zero chance I will support these horrible open borders betrayal of America.\" Take a listen to how he put it.",

We want either a strong bill or no bill.

The fact is that if Joe Biden truly wanted to secure the border, he doesn't really need a bill.",

And so, I think you're going to continue to hear Donald Trump rail against the border, rail against this deal. And he also argued that he was happy taking the fall for its potential failure.Now, one more thing I just want to point out that I found very noteworthy is that Donald Trump did not address the $83.3 million that a jury decided he owes E. Jean Carroll during a trial on Friday. It's something that angered Donald Trump very much from my conversations with his advisers, but he did not bring it up once or address it.

Jean Carroll case, with the jury ordering Donald Trump to pay more than $83 million in damages to Carroll, to the Stormy Daniels hush money case, to the Mar-a-Lago documents probe, to the election interference case in Georgia, and the federal January 6th inquiry, Donald Trump has been entangled in a web of investigations targeting him from many directions.",

And in Georgia, Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis has brought a huge racketeering case against Trump and 18 other people, alleging a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election. There's also a civil lawsuit in New York filed against Trump and his adult sons, alleging that they fraudulently distorted the values of their properties. Which case against Trump is the strongest? Analysts have gone back and forth, but some point to Georgia as a decent possibility for conviction. TIA MITCHELL, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION:  Even if he didn't have a direct hand in some of the efforts, that he was part of the planning that he directed these efforts. And so, that's why in a lot of ways, it is the most serious, because when it comes to the election, it's the one with the most teeth. TODD (on camera):  Donald Trump has repeatedly rejected all of the allegations in each of these cases, characterizing them as facets of a witch hunt designed to take him down. He's called the Mar-a-Lago investigation the weaponization of the justice system, has slammed the New York and Georgia probes as being politically motivated, and on Friday, he called the E. Jean Carroll verdict \"absolutely ridiculous,\" and said he'll appeal. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
