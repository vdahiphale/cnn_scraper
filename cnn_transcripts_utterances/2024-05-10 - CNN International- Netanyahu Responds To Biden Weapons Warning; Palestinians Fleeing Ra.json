The Israeli military says that it must go into these population centers in Rafah going forward because they say that there are four Hamas battalions that are embedded among the civilian population there. But, of course, we've seen the concerns from the United States and others that this military operation will endanger civilians who simply do not have a safe place to go at the moment, do not have a place to go that has the adequate infrastructure to sustain them.But, we've heard -- as we just heard from the Israeli Prime Minister, he views it as essential to eliminating Hamas' last bastion in Rafah, as he has called it, and the only thing that could potentially avert that is if there is indeed a ceasefire deal. But, in recent days, there is no indication that those talks are headed anywhere close to a breakthrough.",

It was due by midnight on Wednesday, and officials here at the White House suggest that it's still coming. It was just taking additional few days to complete the report.But, it does come after President Biden made that very public ultimatum to Prime Minister Netanyahu after what we're told is months of behind-the-scenes backchanneling between Biden, his top national security aides, and their Israeli counterparts through phone calls, virtual meetings, and in some cases, in-person meetings, where they said in no uncertain terms, if you go forward with a full-scale military invasion of Rafah, you will be doing so without U.S. weapons, that U.S. did not want its fingerprints on any sort of campaign that was seen having mass casualties in a densely populated region, as Jeremy was just describing, that has been a critical conduit, both for refugee resettlement as well as for humanitarian aid. So, the Biden team had been communicating that to Netanyahu and his deputies, his war cabinet, for several months, but it was after they felt there was no clarity even still from the Israeli side on how they plan to proceed, and then the establishment of Israeli Defense Forces along the border in Rafah choking up some of those entry points that caused President Biden to go public with that warning. U.S. officials maintain that this should not have been a surprise to the Israeli side, despite the shock that Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed upon hearing that. But, Fred, there is reporting from Axios' Barak Ravid, who is a CNN contributor, suggesting that even despite some of those concerns, despite the frustration over the lack of clarity that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is still prepared to say to Congress that the U.S. believes that Israel is complying with humanitarian laws and norms, and the U.S. will continue sending aid, although the President, as we now know, has suggested that it's a hypothetical situation for the U.S., that if Israel goes forward with that full-scale campaign, then that aid will cease or slow.

You see the images from moments ago. His hush money trial is still reeling from two days of dramatic testimony from Stormy Daniels about the alleged sexual relationship she had with Trump. Today's testimony will begin with more questions for a former Trump aide who worked in the White House and handled checks that Trump signed. All right. For some analysis of everything happening at the trial, we welcome former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi. Gene, great to see you. So, it's a new day, but still lingering is the testimonies from yesterday. Stormy Daniels' testimony was pretty explosive, again, very detailed, hugely embarrassing for the former President. Overall, as a prosecution witness, did her testimony advance the storytelling to help establish motivation toward alleged falsifying of records?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. This is a case or instead of \"A Tale of Two Cities\", Charles Dickens. It's a tale of two witnesses all wrapped in one. In the beginning of the week, Stormy Daniels did not do very well. In fact, some people would say she did poorly. But, I think what happened yesterday was they crossed the Rubicon and they really presented, in my view, through cross and redirect the theme that they wanted to get out. And this is it. After that Hollywood tape came out, Stormy Daniels came forward, and her salacious alleged tryst with Donald Trump way back in the day, I think in 2006, Donald Trump allegedly and Michael Cohen allegedly were scared to death that they may have to deal with that story.And here is the point. Even if the story is 100 percent false or it's 100 percent true, they knew this story was coming out, and that gave motive for Donald Trump and calling allegedly to engage in falsification of business records. WHITFIELD: And so, now, new day, the testimony of how the former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, is she beginning to paint a picture? We saw a little bit of her testimony yesterday. Today, we'll resume. Is she helping to begin to paint that picture of how payments were made when Trump was in the White House, which might be critical?",

But, these two witnesses that I think, well, one of them testified yesterday and they're finishing up today, they are prosecutors' dreams, and here is why. Both of those witnesses still love Donald Trump. They adore him. They revere him. And when you have a witness for the prosecution that has witnesses that are biased towards the defendant, and they say things that don't help the defendant in terms of how the checks were cashed, presented and all that, it's very devastating or harmful to the defense's defense.And I think these witnesses are a great way to end the week. They didn't want to end with Stormy alone. You've got to have witnesses like this. And the way those checks were handled, I got to say that was creepy. That was creepy.",

The reason it violates taxes is it's not a legitimate business expense that was either taken on a corporate return or taken out a personal return as a deduction. So, I call to souffle because it went from $130,000 to $420,000. That's a pretty good souffle.",

And it was just a snippet of what is in store for them on this trip. It really embodies what the Duke and Duchess stand for, mental health, and of course, the Invictus Foundation, which hosts the Invictus Games that Harry founded 10 years ago to rehabilitate wounded military personnel.Now, the royal couple are here on the invitation of Nigeria's defense headquarters, who consider themselves part of the Invictus community, they say, and this trip was planned as late -- as early as last year when Nigeria first took part in the Invictus Games in September last year. And people are just very excited to see Meghan, of course, because she revealed that she is 43 percent Nigerian after taking the ancestry tests. One woman told me that she was giddy to think about Meghan in the country, in a place where she is absolutely loved and welcomed, perhaps an allusion to Meghan's experiences, what she detailed in the UK. But, people here are very excited to see the royal couple. They interacted. They posted for pictures. They had a troupe of cultural dances welcoming them this morning. So, it's been very colorful. Now, they're in Kaduna state, a neighboring state to the capital Abuja, where they're visiting a military rehabilitation center for wounded soldiers. So, that Invictus element is very much a part, a strong theme in this visit, a private visit. They won't be meeting the Nigerian President because they're no longer working royals. And so, it's not considered an official visit. But then, they'll be meeting the governors in Lagos state and Kaduna, and really just engaging with everyday Nigerians, Fredricka.",
