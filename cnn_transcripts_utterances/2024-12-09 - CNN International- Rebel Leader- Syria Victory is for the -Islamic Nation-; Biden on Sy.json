Just ahead as Syrian rebels promise a new future for their country, celebrations at home and reaction now around the world to the collapse of the Assad regime.President Biden declares the moment an historic opportunity, but also underscores the risk and uncertainty. And Donald Trump sits down for his first TV interview since winning the election here. What he has to say about immigration and retribution against his political opponents. Reaction now flowing in as the UN gets ready for an emergency meeting on Syria. The question many people are asking is, what's next for the country? Well, Syrians and of course, the world still reacting to the stunning fall of Syria's Assad regime, the long and brutal rule of Bashar Al Assad ending after rebels swept into the capital of Damascus on Sunday. Well, that is the sound of celebration as the rebels declare Syria is free from its former dictator after 13 years of civil war. Russian state media and an official source say that Assad, a key ally of Vladimir Putin fled to Moscow with his family, where they have been granted asylum. Well, these images were inconceivable just a few days ago. You are looking at what we are told are people looting Former President Bashar Al Assad's official office in Damascus, walking off with whatever they can carry. My colleague, CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward, reporting from the streets of Damascus as Syrians take in their new reality.",

These people say they've been waiting more than half an hour, or some of them, they're waiting for bread. We've seen lines like this around the city. People are lining up for cash. They're lining up for gas. They are trying to make sure that they have enough food to ride out this transitional period where nobody really knows what's going to happen. You can see behind me, at the end of the road there, that is the central bank of Syria. Yesterday, there was extensive moving. There a lot of people in the city started to feel a little bit concerned that this was going to be a chaotic period. Then more rebels arrived in the capital. The looting appears to have stopped. It does seem very calm on the streets. Of course, there are many people who are elated the Bashar Al Assad is finally gone. But there is also the day today that people need to focus on to ensure that they have enough bread, enough gas, enough cash, enough supplies to get them through this tenuous transitional period.

Israel says it struck weapons systems in Syria to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists. And let's be quite clear, some of these groups, including HTS have -- are extremist groups have been affiliated with extremist groups in the past. HTS itself has a history associated with ISIS and Al-Qaeda. So how might the balance of power look in the Middle East going forward? There is a real change in the architecture here.

But the fact is, they had a fairly secure border, which they now no longer have. So, we have seen in that buffer zone between Israel and Syria. Israeli troops are now there. This is effectively Syrian territory. They are stationing themselves there because the Syrian regime military left, and they knew that if there is a vacuum there, then there could be something far worse that would be right on their border. You see Turkey, for example, Turkey has been empowered by what has happened, because, as we understand it, Turkey had a fair amount of influence in what happened, a fair amount of support to some of these groups. And there are some of these groups that came through that America supports as well. So, there is definitely a lot of maneuvering behind the scenes that there's one obvious loser, of course, and that's Iran. This is not what Iran wanted. But for many of the other countries there, they certainly would have been aware of something happening. They may have been integral into that happening.

In fact, the spokesman for the Kremlin also said that, that is something that the next weeks and months are going to show that the Russians, first of all, need to find out who is going to be in power in Syria.And of course, the Russians were more than allies for Bashar Al Assad. They were the main backers, and really the main ones responsible for keeping Bashar Al Assad in power, along with the Iranians as well. And if you look back, for instance, to 2015 where things were really going badly for the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war. It was the Russians who stepped in, established themselves at their air base near Latakia, in a place called Miami, and their Air Force started being the Air Force for the advances of the Assad regime forces and its allied forces as well, and played a huge role on the ground in Syria, the Russians and also taking on other roles as well. They have a big naval base in Tartus. Just last week, they conducted a major naval exercise with their ship sailing from there. And for the Russians, this was obviously something that made them a major player in Syria, but also made them a major player in the Middle East as well, of course, very much allied with Iran. But then also, of course, very big as far as relations with Turkey and other countries are concerned as well. And there's one other thing that I think is also really important to point out Becky, that especially this air base that they have near Latakia, it gives Russia the possibility to project power, not just into the Middle East, but also all the way into western Africa, where, of course, now by and by, there are more and more countries that are allying themselves with the Russians as well, Becky.",

DANA STROUL, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR THE MIDDLE EAST: I do think if the U.S. military sees a risk of ISIS resurging and reconstituting, we will see more of these strikes. So, it's important to remember that there are still 900 U.S. forces on the ground inside Syria, and they're working with a local partner, the Syrian Democratic Forces, who not only are doing counter terrorism operations. But they're maintaining custody of more than 9000 ISIS fighters who are still in detention.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): At first, the new president agreed to modest reforms and released hundreds of political prisoners, but that brief moment of optimism, dubbed the Damascus Spring ended abruptly. Protests demanding change spread across Syria in early 2011. The regime cracks down, turning peaceful protests into slaughter. The U.N. found what it called massive evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity, responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state. The chaos spawned countless local militias and opposition forces. In the mayhem, the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS gained a temporary foothold, spewing its nihilistic terror over the border into Iraq. U.S. and Iraqi forces confronted and ultimately crushed them, but didn't challenge Assad's brutal authority. Russia too joined the fight. Assad and his allies, Hezbollah from Lebanon, an Iranian militia, were losing ground. Committing more forces than any other country with barbaric, internationally condemned ground and air assaults, Russia turned the tide in Assad's favor. But when Russia's forces went to war in Ukraine in 2022, the clock on Assad's rule began ticking down by late 2024. His other main allies, Iran and Hezbollah, were blooded by over a year long war with Israel. Assad's fortunes plummeted. Former al-Qaeda turned nationalist Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham surged out of their northern enclave, exploiting Assad's allies' weakness over running the country. Within two weeks, Assad had fled to Russia, ending his family's half century ruthless repression of the Syrian people. His life in exile begins living in the shadow of fear his heinous crimes will eventually catch up with him. Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
