And if you remember last week, U.S. intelligence said that Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin might meet to discuss advancing arms negotiations between their two countries.",

Now, we know also from Russian state media that Vladimir Putin has arrived in Vladivostok, in the eastern part of the country, for that eastern economic forum. And this is where Kim Jong-un is believed to be heading, Vladivostok as well.Now, we haven't got it completely confirmed at this point, but as you say, it was expected. This is what U.S. officials, backed up by South Korean officials, as well and intelligence here, had said last week, saying that they believed that the leaders would be meeting potentially this month. They do believe that they are working towards an arms deal. They know that Russia, for example, wants ammunition, it wants small arms. And we all know, backed up by analysts, that North Korea has some significant production capability when it comes to this. So, both sides stand to gain from any potential deal. But it is a meeting that neither Washington nor Seoul want to see go ahead. So, from Russia's point of view, they are looking for more arms to take to the front line in Ukraine. And we know that North Korea, for example, is looking for a number of things. It's looking for satellite technology, for example, from Russia. It would like to have more core nuclear and missile technology information. And this is potentially the sort of deal that we could see. It's been four years since these two leaders met, the first and only time that they met back in 2019. Nothing particularly noteworthy came out of that meeting. But now fast forward four years, an awful lot has changed. And it does appear, according to U.S. and South Korean officials, that Russia now needs North Korea and that Vladimir Putin is looking to do some kind of deal with the North Korean leader. So, certainly, it shows from Kim Jong-un's point of view, his diplomatic priorities. Washington has been reaching out to Pyongyang on a number of occasions over recent months, and it has effectively been ignored. But we are seeing, for example, in July, the Russian defense minister being invited to Pyongyang, the red carpet treatment, he saw a military parade with Kim and his daughter. And he was taken through an arms expo in Pyongyang. So, all the weapons and armory capabilities that Pyongyang possesses were on show for the Russian delegation and the defense minister. The first time a Russian defense minister has been to Pyongyang, in fact, since the fall of the Soviet Union. [07:05:01] So, there is no doubt that this relationship is getting much closer. It is a worry for those in the region and for Washington, and it appears that Kim Jong-un is on his way to meet Putin.",

Of course, shelter has been utterly shattered for these people, have lost their homes throughout these mountains, which are very, very inaccessible. But there is now a massive both private and public aid effort going. Roads are jammed with vehicles as much as they are in some parts with rocks. But, this was the scene in those remote villages just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice over):  Another victim buried, returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2,000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late Friday night. The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Moulay Brahim killed 25 people. Three or four are still missing, believed buried in the rubble. And this is a pattern that has been repeated throughout this province. And it looks very often like there's been some kind of airstrike, the collapsing buildings here actually leaving holes as if they've been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine. But this has been an all too natural disaster. At least three elderly people have been entombed here in the remains of their hotel. And a fourth guest is missing.

And this weekend really showed a fairly large setback for the manhunt for Danelo Cavalcante.But, really, to understand why, I have got to go back to Friday and Saturday. Remember, just a few miles from where we are at the command center, the whole area was pretty much shut down. They had the largest police presence yet in this manhunt. Those two days, there were troopers searching trunks, putting their flashlights in cars. That was the environment that Cavalcante was able to escape from. So, here is what we learned yesterday. Cavalcante slipped that perimeter. He stole a van from a nearby dairy farm, Phil, because the keys were actually left in that van. He then drove 20 miles north to Phoenixville, and that's where he was caught on that camera. He was looking for help from an old associate. That associate did not help him, though. But that's where we got a look at his new clean- shaven look with the hoodie in tow. And then yesterday, police found that dairy van that he stole but Cavalcante was once again nowhere to be seen. Now, Phil, we're getting new sound from an interview with a former roommate of Cavalcante's given to one of our CNN affiliates. Take a listen to what he had to say about this manhunt.

So, she's been out there longer than any of these other opponents who are vying to compete with the former president, and I think that matters too.Now, what I found really interesting about this poll in particular was that even though you see the CBS poll where of her where people want younger -- people want somebody younger, and then you also see this poll where she is clearly up big against Joe Biden. But the problem is Donald Trump is still up in the polls. And so the thing when I talk to voters about Trump is it's not even that they don't -- they aren't -- they don't view the electability argument as important, it's that they don't see that Trump isn't as electable.
