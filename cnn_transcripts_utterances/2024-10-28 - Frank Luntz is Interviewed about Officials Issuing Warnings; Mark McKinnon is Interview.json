That's why they didn't do six months. They didn't want a comparison of Trump and Kamala, something that the Democrats could latch onto and use. That's why they let her have all the airtime.This was one of the rare exceptions where they did give them grist. And I think the objective over the last, I would say, 40 days, and certainly over these last eight, is to try and not give them any more that can be used. Now, I agree that, as I said before, the future (INAUDIBLE) he's been saying, this stuff doesn't work when it actually comes to moving voters. But when it comes to actually being the topic over the last week, they're trying hard to not give them grist to keep that coming.",

I think there's just the opposite now. I think particularly with Republican suburban women, just because of the community that surrounds them, they're afraid to say that they're not for Trump. And I think that - and this is the typically Nikki Haley voter, but I think there are just women across the board, but suburban Republican women that are quietly going to go vote for Harris.
