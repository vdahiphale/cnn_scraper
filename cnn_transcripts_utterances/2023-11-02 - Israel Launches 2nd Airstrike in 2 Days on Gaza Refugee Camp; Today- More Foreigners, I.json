He did say though that more Americans would be able to leave today, and in the next days, and that the State Department had communicated lyrically with American citizens in Gaza so that they would be ready to go. There was also confirmation from President Biden himself. He wrote Wednesday on X that the U.S. had secured safe passage for wounded Palestinians, and foreign nationals to exit Gaza and were expecting some American citizens to exit right away with more departing over the coming days. And, Kasie, the question is, how many Americans were stuck in Gaza in the first place? Well, at a Senate appropriations committee, Secretary of State Blinken said there were approximately 400 plus their families, about 1,000 people in total. He also said that there were about 5,000 other third country nationals in Gaza who want to get out as well -- Kasie.",

CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier joins us now. Kim, good morning. Thank you so much for being here. I know you have had a lot of experiences over the course of the past week with the Israeli embassy and others that gives you some insight into what the challenges are in terms of the Israelis trying to maintain world support as they mount this campaign against Hamas terrorists. The secretary of state obviously expected to be in Israel on Friday. As he tries to maintain these connections with the Israelis and try to urge them in the direction that the U.S. wants them to go. Can you kind of take us behind the scenes and help us understand what these conversations are like? What is the push and pull?",

But it didn't condemn Hamas, and demand the release of hostages.So the White House needs Israel to ratchet back, to be more careful about civilian casualties. But I have to tell you talking to a senior military official, and some of the former national security folks who are briefed on some of these decisions, they feel like this is an existential threat and they are going to keep moving forward. I think even if the White House starts asking them publicly to move back, they are just going to accomplish what they see as their mission which is dismantling Hamas.",

I think it might help people understand why it is the Israelis feel the way they do to feel about this. Can you kind of take us inside some of that experience that you had?

And then, you know, I covered the first uprising that led to that peace process, and then a second uprising years later.And what I saw is that after this initial hope for peace, each side getting so alienated from each other, hope being lost time and time again, each one disappointing each other, and especially inside Gaza, once Hamas used to be an entity that took care of its people better than the Palestinian authority, which was seen as widely corrupt. I interviewed a family of -- with ten children, misled we can't get help from the PA, but Hamas comes by every week with aid. So that's how they got into power. But once they got into power, they literally threw PA officials off rooftops, in expelling them from Gaza, and instituted education where the Anti-Defamation League can give the chapter a verse of the town of textbooks that are taught in Gazan school that say things about Jews that basically make them seem like not people. And that's the only way I could explain the brutal attacks that we saw in that raw video that Israel has shown to groups of journalists, pen and pad only. They are not releasing to this to the world, so yes these videos are independently verified. But the kind of things said in the video, like a young fighter calling his friends back in Gaza and bragging about how he killed Israelis with his bare hands, I did see that kind of sentiment when I would go to Gaza to report on incidents there during the second uprising.",

It is cold.And that's why we have these frost and freeze warnings, likely much of the southeastern U.S., because that cold air has advanced, just as we warn you the past few days, we have these alerts that stretch all the way from Texas to the mid-Atlantic, even portions of the northeast as well. So freeze warnings. Temperatures have dropped below freezing. Here's what it feels like on your skin as you step outside, lower 30s, upper twenties, it is downright chilly outside. So grab a coat. Heading out the door this morning, plan accordingly because it significantly colder than what we started the week as, and the good news is we're going to see a whole new trend. So, check out these temperatures. These are morning lows for some larger cities, Chicago, to Atlanta. You see the mercury in the thermometer starting to climb slowly back, back and back. So we will replace the blues with the oranges, and the above average temperatures are welcomed. Again, will hold on to them as long as we can. It is the sunshine that is given kind of a deceiving warmth to the air outside, along the East Coast. Let's enjoy it while it lasts, because no real active weather for the eastern two thirds of the country, but the Pacific northwest, it is a whole other story. You have an atmospheric river. What is that? That is literally a river in the sky that is pointed directly into the Pacific Northwest with a significant amount of moisture. So two to four inches of rainfall is expected to cross into this region, highest elevation is getting the snowfall. Mount Baker, into the Olympic range. And then we get a break with more range for the weekend. So, yes, winter is settling in, I should say autumn, for the Pacific Northwest.

Mr. Biden replied this way, quote, I think we need to pause. A pause means give time to get the prisoners out, end quote. What's not clear is whether the president was actually endorsing a cease-fire, which his administration is not back so far. In fact, this precise language around a pause is very distinct from the calls for a cease-fire. So, it's a little bit of a disagreement with that protester there.
