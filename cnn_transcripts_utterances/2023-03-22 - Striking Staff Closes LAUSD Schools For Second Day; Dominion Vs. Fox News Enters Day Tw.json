They made sure everybody got a COVID test and everybody got a COVID vaccine. And as a result, Los Angeles students were the only ones in the nation to see improvement in both math and reading in fourth and eighth grade. These are our heroes.Now, with an average wage of $25,000, they're struggling to get by. Los Angeles is a very expensive place to live. And I think when the district has record revenue and record surplus, it's time to treat people fairly and take care of those who are doing the work in schools.",

This was made for me by a bus driver during the pandemic who was not just working with the bus to make sure her kids had a computer and internet access but she was helping an art teacher with their kids in their art project, which happen to be tile mosaics.

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Kate, the arguments ran long yesterday. Both sides now back before a judge. And this is a Delaware State judge. He'll determine whether he alone will decide this case on the facts that are already out there, or if this will, in fact, go to a jury trial.So, interestingly, this morning, Fox News lawyers accused Dominion of manipulating its data to justify that $1.6 billion demand in this defamation case. Fox is saying that this billion-dollar-plus demand it was only concocted to garner media coverage around this case. And they argue that Dominion is really worth less than that since they generated less than $11 million in annual earnings before the 2020 race. So, there's still a question as this hearing is going on now about whether this case maybe could settle before any potential trial. But if it does go to trial, that would likely start next month. And the stakes, in this case, are enormous, both money-wise, but this would also be a major test of First Amendment law because Dominion is saying that Fox News executives and its hosts knew that they were airing false claims accusing Dominion Voting of using its machines and software to rig the 2020 election. Then you have Fox News, and they're saying we can't be held liable for airing what are inherently newsworthy allegations from public figures like Rudy Giuliani, and lawyer Sidney Powell, who is really at the forefront of these allegations. So, in recent weeks leading up to this hearing, we've seen explosive inside communications from the hosts where they talk about how outrageous the claims were against Dominion but they did really nothing on air to tamp down on those allegations. Interestingly, here, Kate. Fox corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, he's also been implicated. His texts and e-mails have come out. And now Dominion wants Rupert Murdoch and his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch to testify if there is a trial here. Fox News is pushing back, saying that it would be a hardship for them to actually appear and that it would just create a media circus. So, we'll see, Kate, what will happen. This hearing will likely conclude this afternoon. The judge will then decide whether or not to grant summary judgment. If he doesn't, the case will move to a trial which will likely be at some point starting next month. Kat.",

Questions about Smith's death were raised during the Alex Murdaugh murder investigation. Smith's death was reported at the time as a hit and run but officials are now publicly acknowledging that they do not believe that to be the case.Dianne Gallagher is following this and she joins us now.

But look, I have an attorney for Stephen Smith's mother, Sandy said that yesterday, the chief of SLED called him and said that now that the Murdaugh trial is over, they are able to put more manpower, more investigative power into Stephen's homicide investigation, and also noted that perhaps more people would be willing to speak about anything that they may know. So, again, there have been no suspects named in Stephen Smith's killing. But back in 2015 when highway patrol was doing an investigation, there were plenty of people who mentioned the Murdaugh name and including Buster Murdaugh, the only surviving son of Alex Murdaugh. He, of course, issued a statement this afternoon -- this week saying explicitly denying it, that he had nothing to do with it. He said that this has gone on for far too long. These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death. And my heart goes out to the Smith family. Kate, look. hear the family of Stephen Smith is asking anybody who has any information to please contact state authorities there in South Carolina.",
