We'll get a live report from Kyiv, analysis from our experts and reaction from a top adviser from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Plus, prosecutors grill South Carolina Attorney Alex Murdaugh four hours under cross-examination. Murdaugh trying to explain inconsistencies in his story, including why he lied to law enforcement on the night his wife and son were murdered. And later this hour, a CNN exclusive report on the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation. How did a box of records end up in Donald Trump's Florida resort after several rounds of searches?

Then very quickly they pushed them back within weeks. And now we hear from people that, yes, they were terrified back then. They did not know whether their capital or their country would be standing. 365 days later, it is.And today we had a press conference with President Zelenskyy and I got to ask him a question about how long he thought this war would take.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINE:  Thank you for the question. Indeed, I want to very much. If each of us, each partner and we in our country, if we stay as one fist, one strong fist and work towards victory, this is a victory of values. If they stick to their words, to their terms, and it's not just blah, blah, blah, I believe in it. We have been partners, strong partners, and there is evidence to that.

Drones as well, we've seen the impact of Iranian made drones there, in terms of helping Russia with its air war on civilian targets across the country. So, the biggest concern from the U.S. and Pentagon perspective is that, China's help will lengthen the war. It will give Russia what it needs now, particularly what it's short of now in terms of ammunition.The other piece of that is more broad, and that is that you already have a war here that is, in effect, to some degree, a proxy war between the U.S. and its allies and Russia. You hear western official don't want to describe it that way but you have the U.S. and its allies on one side arming Ukraine, and you have Russia on the other side that's invaded Ukraine. With China deciding to provide lethal assistance to Russia, you would now have three superpowers, in effect, involved in the largest land war in Europe since World War II. And that is a prospect that speaks to the broader conflict going on between these superpowers really on a number of fronts around the globe could lengthen this conflict and also add the risk of escalation beyond the borders of Ukraine.",

They tried to speak after the U.S. downed that Chinese spy balloon. His Chinese counterpart, the foreign minister, did not take that call.

You have the Ukrainian defense minister speaking today, about the possibility of winning this war, including taking back Crimea this year. Now, Ukrainians, they're confident in their abilities and they have got a year of incredible gains and defense to work on, I would say that U.S. officials at this point are -- I don't want to say more pessimistic but perhaps more realistic about how quickly they can gain back particularly when you look at Crimea given the importance that Russia plays on that.

There have been small but vocal group of Republican who have said they do not want to continue providing support to Ukraine.And we've heard from top Republicans on committees, like Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs, who say they're confident they can get another funding request through. But it is something I think that the White House wants to make sure they keep at the forefront, so people do understand what is actually the human toll of this.

But whether the jury finds explanations to be credible or not is interesting.But all in all, the entire theme of this is, look, he's saying, I may be a liar, I may be somebody who is downright a dirty, rotten scoundrel but I did not commit murder.

So this is a box essentially of presidential schedules, copies ofthem. And they found it in December. So several months after the previous searches, including the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. It turned up in the president's office, the ex-president's office at Mar-a-Lago in a closet.

I'm very confused about what he's wanting to do with them. But it does seem like this junior aide was doing this at the direction of the former president. It almost brings to mind like the Kim Jong-un letters and other memorabilia of sorts from his presidency that he wanted to keep and sort of store in some sort of way, again, completely flouting, archiving, and national security laws.

I think that's clearly become a focus of DOJ's investigation.The question is, is DOJ willing, if they believe they have a charge on obstruction, to charge obstruction even if they don't have some other crime relating to mishandling of classified documents.
