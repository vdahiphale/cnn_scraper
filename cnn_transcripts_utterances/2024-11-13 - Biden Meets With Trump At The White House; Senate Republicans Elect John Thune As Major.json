      "sentences": "Yes. The President-elect Trump and President Joe Biden really having this cordial exchange as theymet in the Oval Office. We do believe that they are still in this meeting right now. And it comes as Biden is trying to show that he is committed to having an orderly and peaceful transfer of power to Trump, something that was not afforded to him by Trump back in 2020, when the then-president refused to concede the election, did not invite Biden to the White House or attend his inauguration. Today, you saw the two men engaging in a handshake, a smiling at times. As Biden said, he -- that there -- he's hoping there will be a smooth transition. And then Trump acknowledging a bit of the awkwardness in the room, saying that politics can be tough. Of course, these two men have been fierce competitors. for really going on six years now when Biden first challenged him in 2020. And then they faced off for about 15 months of this campaign in 2024 when Biden had been seeking reelection. So certainly, at least for these moments in front of the cameras, the two men appear to be putting their differences aside to try to show that there will be this peaceful transition period occurring. Now, I will also note that the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, and incoming White House Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, are in that meeting right now with Biden and Trump in the Oval Office, perhaps giving them a chance to talk about how some of this will play out over the coming months. One person who is not in Washington, D.C., today is former and incoming First Lady Melania Trump. She did not join her husband for this traditional event at the White House. But as Trump was arriving at the White House, we're told, that First Lady Jill Biden was on hand with her husband to greet Trump. And she actually handed Trump a handwritten letter directly for Melania Trump, congratulating her on her return and saying that the first lady's team remains available to help with any of the transition process. So in many ways, the Bidens trying to have some return to normalcy after Trump had really sworn off and shunned these traditions in the past. But I will note that this meeting in the Oval Office is playing out just a few feet away from the private dining room where Trump had watched the January 6 insurrection play out. Biden often described that scene as he criticized Trump, as he's painting him as a direct threat to democracy. So certainly, there are a lot of feelings that go into Trump's return to the White House, many staffers acknowledging it's an emotional day. But for President Biden and his team, they are trying to keep their heads down and focus on the professional work, show that they are committed to this peaceful transfer at a time when Biden is now personally grappling with the fact that the man that he had defeated back in 2020 is now set to return to that very oval office in just two months.",

      "sentences": "That's right. And I'd also remind you as well that something he didn't have before is that Supreme Court ruling, wherethey -- the Supreme Court had ruled that presidents are immune for official acts. So that's another thing I know in my conversations with those close to Trump and involved in some of these transitions discussions say that is really making Donald Trump feel emboldened, empowered, and like -- and like he has a mandate. And that's exactly what he told the room of House Republicans this morning when they met at the Hyatt. He really went in there to give a victory lap. When I talked to people prior to that meeting, they said that his big goal was to try and unify them further behind him and to acknowledge that he believes he's claiming that he won the popular vote. I'd note that there are still millions of votes to be counted, but he believes that that gives him a mandate in Washington and that he really wants Republicans in Congress and all of Washington as well to back him up once he is sworn in. He wants to hit the ground running and he doesn't want Republicans to get in his way. It's very similar to what we're seeing with his several picks for cabinet and other top roles in his second administration. He wants people that will be yes men. He wants people who will not hold him back from doing what he wants to do. Now, some other things we heard that he did in that meeting this morning, our colleague, Dana Bash, got some great inside room conversations or some inside look at some of the inside the room conversations from that closed door meeting. At one point, a source in the room had told her that Trump said he was with Johnson all the way. That is, of course, you know, Republicans are still picking out and voting on who the next speaker is going to be, but I will note that they did not have any other challenger to him, so it looks like Johnson has a clear pathway there. But then also Donald Trump had joked at one point that he couldn't get rid of Elon Musk. And one of the things that is noteworthy about that is, Elon Musk traveled with him today to that House Republican meeting to Washington. He flew on Donald Trump's plane from Palm Beach, landed with him in D.C., and then attended that meeting with House Republicans. And the reason that's so important is because we have really seen Musk's influence grow exponentially over the last several months, but particularly in the last several days. Ever since Donald Trump won the election, Elon Musk has essentially been at Mar-a-Lago every single day by his side. We know that people in the House, lawmakers have been calling him up and he's been calling them as well trying to see if they can boost their profiles in front of Donald Trump through Elon Musk. So I think that was a very notable thing. And, of course, it comes as we just learned within the last 24 hours that Donald Trump is going to be appointing Musk, as well as his former Republican primary challenger, Vivek Ramaswamy, to run what they are calling the Department of Government Efficiency, a totally new department that he is trying to create. It's still unclear exactly what power they are going to have and what they're going to do. But Donald Trump did say in that announcement today that it would provide advice and guidance from outside of government. I note that outside of government because we know that Elon Musk was not interested in a formal role in Donald Trump's administration. He did not want some sort of secretary cabinet position. And so this would allow him to kind of serve in Donald Trump's administration and have a government role without having to divest from his businesses and companies. Erica.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This was a huge question mark, Erica, going into this race, because Donald Trump and John Thune'srelationship has been checkered at times. Back in 2020, John Thune actually said that Trump's challenge of the election against Joe Biden, at the end of December, would go down like a shot dog. That prompted at the time Donald Trump to call on Kristi Noem, another South Dakotan, to actually run against John Thune in a Republican primary. Now, she never went through with that. She declined to run against John Thune. But that just shows you how tense their relationship was just a few years ago. Now, in the spring, John Thune went down to Mar-a-Lago to try to make inroads with the president. He's continued to have conversations with Donald Trump. His team has been telling me throughout the summer and into the fall. But this was really an inside game. Despite the fact that Rick Scott did get that late surge of MAGA momentum, the underscoring reality was that senators were going to be able to vote their conscience in the room. This is a secret ballot election. That means no one knows how each member of the Republican Senate Conference was going to be voting today. And that obviously may have benefited Thune, given the fact that, like Alayna was saying, this was never seen as Donald Trump's first choice. The reality is, Donald Trump did not ultimately make an official endorsement and that was because there were several Republican senators who were sort of urging him not to do so. I talked to one of them who said that there was really no point in Trump getting in this race. You know, Markwayne Mullin had told me a couple of weeks ago when I was reporting on this ongoing battle for GOP leader, that he had had several conversations. Every time he saw Donald Trump, he was telling him, don't get involved in this race, because ultimately, it's not going to be up to you to decide. And you're going to have to work with whoever gets that crown.",

I mean obviously it's a really interesting moment and there's going to be so much for John Thune to have to manage in the months ahead.You know, it's really unclear what's going to happen with government's funding. That deadline is going to happen December 20th. Now, Mitch McConnell will still be the Republican leader at that point, but there's going to be a huge question mark. If that gets kicked in to early next year, that means that not only will John Thune be trying to move forward with all of Trump's nominees, get them through the United States Senate in an expedited manner, but he will also potentially be dealing with a government funding package. There's also a huge question mark of how quickly Republicans want to move forward on some kind of tax package. That's another agenda item that's really important to Donald Trump. And the underscoring reality here is that John Thune is an experienced leader. He is currently the Republican whip. He has relationships with these Republican members. And so it's going to be really interesting to see whether or not, going forward, these two men can continue to bury the hatchet, continue to work together. I will say that one of the closing arguments that Thune was making to his colleagues was that he was going to be in regular contact with J.D. Vance, who is a senator in the United States Senate who he's worked closely with, incoming vice president. And he was also going to continue to have regular conversations with House Speaker Mike Johnson if he were elected to Republican leadership. I think there have been some question if those lines of communication were always super open in the last couple of months, given the fact that there have been some differences in the way that leaders on the Hill have been operating.

And I do not necessarily see how all the math lines up.Now Donald Trump, of course, will say he has an idea how it lines up, but we'll have to see. And some of these choices have really, as you said, raised eyebrows. The Fox News host, Hegseth, being one of them. Yes, he's a decorated military veteran, but all indications are he has no experience whatsoever that would involve managing a giant organization, let alone something like the military, approaching three million people. That's really huge, and the backlash from that and the underperformance of that could also be huge. He's loyal to Trump, but the problem is when you put loyalty above everything else and you surround yourself with yes men, you better be right on everything because it's all on you. Same with Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota. She has been very loyal to Trump and a real hawk on this idea of, we have to control immigration. The problem is the Department of Homeland Security is in charge of more than just looking after immigration. And we don't know how well she'll be suited for those other tasks out there. So, yes, for Trump supporters, this is the giant remaking of government that they have wanted, and some of these picks reflect it. But for some other supporters who are worried about the success of all of this, they're worried that if you put loyalty that high up above ability and experience, there's some of these that are -- you know, then you're running a real risk. Some of these people really know what they're doing. Tom Homan, the border czar, he has experience in this field. Whether you agree with his politics or not, he does now how this sort of thing works. Marco Rubio, a senator who's been around a long time, yes, he's flip- flopped on Trump in a big, big way, but again, at least he's somebody who's been involved in committees and has some idea of how the government works. A few others are that way. But then others here, Erica, they fit that category of Trump just likes him. And I think it's so interesting that he said about Hegseth, that he had the look. I think it has been important for a long time to know how much Donald Trump looks at the world like a reality T.V. star, or somebody tied to the world of pro wrestling, where it's like, ah, we want a certain look. And at one point during the whole conflict with Israel and Gaza, Trump was saying, well, you know, Israel's public relations, their public image is really looking bad here. That's true, but it's all rooted in actual things. And that's where I think a lot of critics are looking and saying, is he really going to be able to tend to the actual things with these people, not just the image?",

Both leaders addressing the press at the start of the meeting, pledging for a smooth transition. For a closer look in what we know so far about what the second Trump administration might look like, some of the choices that have been announced, I want to bring in our panel, Olivia Troye, who worked in the first Trump White House, with a focus of home on homeland security.

The fact that, as we saw the former president, now president-elect, and current president sitting there in the Oval Office, Donald Trump said in that spray that this would be a very smooth transition, saying it will be as smooth as it can get, which I don't think we can point out enough just how different this moment is to what we saw four years ago in terms of this very important transition and peaceful transition of power.

To me, having her at the helm, points to the fact that they do plan to make significant changes in the Homeland Security enterprise. And I think if you really carefully look closely at the Project 2025 chapter on the Department of Homeland Security, I think that is going to see something that we'll see come to fruition where they start to dismantle the department.

Donald Trump saying, the world of politics, in his words, is tough, but that quote, it's a nice world today. On Capitol Hill at this hour, Republican Senator John Thune has just won Senate leadership after two rounds of voting. The U.S. House majority remains undecided more than a week after the election, as we wait for some of those final races to be called.

When we look at where things stand and where we are today, this slim majority, which is likely in the House, giving Republicans a lot of power to carry out these campaign promises from the president-elect, there are questions, too, about the guardrails, because Donald Trump also has a lot of power, thanks to that immunity decision, from the Supreme Court. Do you believe some of these guardrails and checks and balances will hold in the next couple of years?",

But when we start-- when things start to get disrupted, then people react. Take the tariff proposal, for example. There will be extreme disruption. And I can assure you that there are going to be a lot of members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, who are going to be hearing from their constituents loudly about how damaging this will be. So there's a disruption. Was it a good one? And there may be political consequences. So, yes, there's disruption. And, but again, you know, one thing to talk about it, but once you start enacting it, you start making these types of changes, people will react. And so just remember that nothing is permanent in politics. Everybody's out there talking right now like there's a mandate. The winning party always, always misreads their mandate. Democrats misread their mandate in 2020. Republicans will probably end up overreaching and misreading their mandate going forward. I hope that's not the case, but expect it. And this disruption, you know, will obviously have political repercussions for many members, particularly in the most vulnerable districts.",

But what I'm expecting right now, I mean, they have to make some really big decisions quickly. Like, are they going to finish the appropriations bills and deal with the debt ceiling, which ripens on January 2nd? I mean, they should get it all done now. But I have a feeling Trump is going to be under pressure from the hardliners in the House especially to kick all this into the new year. So on top of that, they have to get all these nominations through the Senate. They're going to have to deal with the border issues. They're going to have to deal with the tax changes that they want to make through reconciliation. They're going to have a pile up pretty quickly if they don't get things moving smartly now by clearing the deck clean the barn so to speak in the Congress right now before Christmas.",

And number two, do you think they're taking into account the potential ramifications of that?

Not what we call -- this is not the mandatory or entitlement spending, which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, a lot of veterans benefits, food stamps, or what they call them, SNAP now, that's most of the budget. But the truth -- but you're spending a little less than $2 trillion on discretionary spending. If you wiped that all out in one year, I mean, you wouldn't have a Defense Department, you wouldn't have a Justice Department, a Homeland Security Department. I mean, you've got a list. So, you know, I don't know where they're picking these numbers out of, but only about the discretionary part of the budget is subject to the appropriations process. The other spending is on autopilot. What changes? They're going to have to make changes to Medicare in a big way, Medicaid and Social Security if they hope to get anywhere close to $2 trillion in savings.

Both leaders at the start of the moment -- start of the meeting, pardon me, were speaking, very cordial with one another, promising a smooth transition. Sources telling CNN that for her second go-round as first lady, though, it's unlikely Melania Trump will move back into the White House full-time. After the 2016 election, of course, Mrs. Trump delayed her move to Washington for several months to allow her son, Barron, to finish out the school year in New York. She also declined today's invitation from first lady Jill Biden to come to the White House, citing a scheduling conflict. Joining me now, CNN senior White House producer Betsy Klein.

So she's laying an early marker here that this time will be no different. She decided to skip that meeting with First Lady Jill Biden after Biden extended her that invitation as their husbands met in the Oval Office today. But First Lady Jill Biden did greet President-elect Donald Trump and she offered a handwritten note to Melania Trump expressing her hope that they can have a smooth transition. Now, we've also learned, as you mentioned, that Melania Trump is unlikely to move full-time to Washington next year when President-elect Trump takes office. She's expected to divide her time largely between New York, where Barron Trump is in college, as well as Palm Beach, where Mar-a-Lago is, and she's built a community and circle of friends there. And as you mentioned, a first lady declining to live full-time at the White House, that is unprecedented. But if you observe Melania Trump, it shouldn't really come as a surprise, because her preference, frankly, is not to be publicly involved. She has her husband's ear on a variety of topics and advises him frequently, but she really telegraphed early on in this campaign that she was not going to be an active presence compared to back in 2016 and 2020. We saw her at the announcement event. We saw her at Madison Square Garden. And then the third and final time we saw her on the campaign trail was on election night up on the stage with families. So she made that clear. But make no mistake, she has a constant voice in her husband's ear, giving him advice. They -- there was this sort of misconception during the first four years that she was some sort of so-called resistance, but that is really not the case.
