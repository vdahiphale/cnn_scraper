After he was convicted in absentia for the assassinations of anti-Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, both killed in separate targeted bombings in 1992. Police had been searching for him ever since. Messino Denaro is thought to have led the Cosa Nostra Mafia in Sicily since the arrest of his predecessor, Bernardo Provenzano, who was captured near the infamous Sicilian town of Corleone in 2006. Messina Denaro has multiple convictions for murder, including the kidnapping and death of a 12-year-old boy, whose body was dissolved in acid.

Although severance agreements have arrived, the final number was for one month's wages, 50 percent lower than legally required. That was quickly rejected by a lawyer representing a small group of Twitter workers, saying that he was basically trying to fleece them. And then came a ruling in a district court last week. Laid-off Twitter workers are being forced to drop their class-action lawsuit and go into individual arbitration. So back to the lawyer, who then tweeted, \"We anticipated this and that's why we have already filed 500 individual arbitration demands -- and counting. This is not a win for Elon Musk.\" OK. First off, this legal decision, in and of itself, does look like it's a win for Musk, simply because dragging out these sorts of legal battles only harms the plaintiffs, who often look for a fairly quick settlement.

We start to get sort of tips coming in on, you know, they're going to get evicted from these -- from these offices.And, you know, Musk obviously is no longer the richest man in the world, but I believe at least up there. You know, first or second. But part of his whole strategy is basically cut costs where we can. And that means literally not paying rent on the Seattle offices, which they were already evicted from. Offices around the world. In San Francisco, they're not paying rent. And I think that he -- his basic sort of strategy is push it to the limit. See as far as we can make it before we absolutely have to pay something. And then only then will we start paying. And another thing is to keep the lights on, we start renegotiating those contracts and really putting the screws to everyone that they're working with, which is just -- it's a real hardball way of doing business.",

Twitter has never came close to making that much money in one year. And so you've got to ask the question, who lent him the money based on that sort -- on that formula, on that calculation? But more to the point, what are the chances that Twitter just ends up going out of business, unable to to turn (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Because there's the Twitter that everyone idealizes and wants. Then there's the Twitter Musk is looking at. Those two things don't seem to coexist.",

With that, let's go live to Hong Kong. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is standing by.

For 2022, China posted economic growth growth, GDP growth for 3percent. For the fourth quarter, China posted GDP growth of 2.9 percent, year on year. And China's population is shrinking. It's shrinking for the first time since the 1960s. But the total population now about 1.4 billion people. China right now is counting the cost of an ongoing and historic property slump. But it's also counting the cost of its zero-COVID policy, which absolutely wrecked its economy last year, so much so that provincial governments were forced to pay billions of dollars. In fact, we learned recently that Guangdong province, this mega economic powerhouse province in the South of China, paid 22 billion U.S. dollars over the course of the pandemic due to zero-COVID expenses like mass testing campaigns, vaccination campaigns. And this is one of the reasons why China abruptly ended its zero-COVID policy last month. And now, we're in the midst of the reopening and, of course, this exit wave of infections. But economists point out that this will only pose short-term economic pain. I want to bring up this statement that we got earlier today from a senior economist. This is from Aidan Yao, who tells us that \"Q4 has likely marked the darkest before the dawn.\" He goes on to say, \"With the reopening timeline now significantly front-loaded, the economic outlook has brightened beyond the near term,\" unquote. Now, looking ahead, China's economic growth for 2023 is expected to rebound. It's based on a number of factors. No. 1, China will finally learn to live with COVID. No. 2, officials in China, they're showing signs that they're now easing on the regulatory crackdown on its critical technologies sector. But also thirdly, Chinese officials have signaled that they do plan to pass policies that will stabilize the Chinese economy. And that's why a number of economists and analysts that we've been speaking to say that they anticipate China GDP growth this year to top 5 percent. Back to you, John.",
