Speaking publicly or directly about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses in the case. That he's not allowed to speak of. Specifically concerning their potential participation in the case.Another one is speaking publicly or directly about prosecutors - prosecutors other than Bragg in the case, about staff members of Bragg's office in court, and about family members of prosecutors, staffers, or the court. And talking directly about the jurors and prospective jurors in the case. He can attack Bragg all he wants. He can defend himself all he wants. He can say that he thinks the case is unfair all he wants. He can talk about what he calls a conflicted judge, though we can fact check that all he wants. These are the three categories that are part of the - are the gag order. And he's got a lot of leeway outside of it.",

Initially he said six, but it's possible they don't need that many. But that is the objective for today, at least for this morning, is to find those alternate jurors.We know that there are 22 jurors that are going to come forward and essentially go through that 42 questionnaire as they search for these extra alternates. Now, remember, each side, the defense and the prosecution, had ten strikes when it came to the jurors. What we're understanding is, when it comes to the alternates, both sides actually have two strikes for each alternate, for each person that they're questioning for these positions. So it is expected to not take too, too long. They do think that they will wrap this up before the lunch break. And then into the afternoon, it's possible the judge said they will get into what is called a Sandoval (ph) hearing. And essentially what that is, is figuring out exactly what of Trump's legal history can be addressed if Donald Trump takes the witness stand. We know from a previous filing the prosecution has said that they would like to get into the verdicts from his civil case, also the defamation case with E. Jean Carroll and some other cases. So, this will also be discussed possibly today according to the judge. And then if that is all done, then possibly we will be seeing opening statements on Monday, guys.",

Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Elie Honig on this. So, Donald Trump speaks. Donald Trump, as you heard, Elie, he went off about the gag order, saying that the gag order has to be lifted. He's facing a lot of questions and is going to face a hearing about, did he cross the line and how much next week. What do you think of this extra element that we've learned of, of prosecutors saying they don't want to - they don't want to say who their first witnesses could be because of what Donald Trump could do?",

      "sentences": "So, Kate, that's an example of one way where Donald Trump could actually suffer a meaningful consequences of violating the gag order because prosecutors, as we've been discussing, they now alleged that Donald Trump, in his social media posts, has violated the gag order ten times. And it looks like they're right in most or all of those allegations. The problem though is one of enforcement and discipline. All that the law allows the judge to do is either, a, imposed fines, but under the New York law that the DA cited, only a maximum of $1,000 per incident. That's not going to matter to Donald Trump.And then the other option is to lock him up, which I think is very unrealistic. And I just don't think is realistically in play here. Now, the thing for Donald Trump, though, where he's suffering is now, the DA is refusing to give over to the defense lawyers the order of witnesses. And that's a big deal because if you're Donald Trump's team, you head into this weekend, you've seen their witness list, but there's dozens of names on that list. You need to prepare for whoever you're going to be cross-examining potentially on Monday or Tuesday. And if the DA's office is unwilling to give you the order and the judge is unwilling to make them give you the order because they don't want Trump tweeting about them. Then Donald Trump is sort of leaving his own lawyers adrift. So, there's a real consequence to that. BOLDUAN: Elie Honig. Thanks for jumping on, Elie. Brynn is outside court. We're going to be following it as court's about to get underway in just a few moments. We'll be bringing you updates throughout the morning.",

      "sentences": "Well, absolutely no word from the Israeli military, from the Israeli government about these strikes overnight. They seem intend to stay absolutely quiet about what was actually done by Israel overnight. We have heard reports of explosions over that city of Isfahan with Iranian officials saying that at least three drones were intercepted over Isfahan. Isfahan is, of course, very important because not only is it home to a military base, but also to a nuclear facility, although there are no indications that that nuclear facility was targeted.Syrian state media is also reporting that Israel targeted its air defense assets in - inside of Syria. We also know, of course, that Iran maintains a significant military presence inside of Syria. And so where does this leave us ultimately? It leaves us with the fact that over the course of the last week we have heard Israeli officials and American officials talking about the fact that Israel was looking for a response that could thread the needle here, that could make clear that this Iranian attack over the weekend, that the first in - of its kind to target Israeli soil, that this attack would not go unanswered. And so this sends a message that that attack was not going to go unanswered, but it also avoids escalating this conflict into all-out war between Iran and Israel. And as of now, a regional intelligence source is indicating to us that Iran does not intend to respond, but rather that this tit for tat between Israel and Iran, for the moment at least in terms of direct confrontation, appears to be over. And that is significant because last night we had heard the Iranian foreign minister warning that an Israeli attack on Iranian soil would draw an immediate and an overwhelming military response from Iran. And clearly that has not happened. So, it seems, at least for the moment, that we have hit that kind of balance of the ability to de-escalate this going forward and the United States is now instead focusing on a global coalition to further isolate Iran, which very much suits the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.",

French authorities are warning people to stay away from the area, which is just across the river from the Eiffel Tower.It also comes, obviously, as we've been following the breaking news between Israel and Iran, Israel conducting a strike inside Iran near the city the Isfahan.

And that's because what we heard a few hours ago was that there was a man that police said had been seen entering the Iranian consular building carrying what seemed to be either an explosive vest or a grenade. They weren't hearing exactly what kind of arming. He was certainly armed as he entered the consulate.We're not hearing much about what went on while he was inside, weather or if there were - what sort of negotiations there were inside the building. What we understand from Paris police is that he's now left the building and is now in police custody and undergoing questions. So, for the time being, more questions than answers really at this stage. Why he went into the embassy armed, how he got in there in the first place, and what his intentions were. But certainly a huge police operation here in central Paris. Several metro lines closed down. An entire part. These western neighborhoods of Paris entirely cordoned off because this is a city, of course, remember, that is on high alert. We'd seen, over the course of the last few years, since that big wave of terror attacks a few years ago here in Paris, the number of military personnel out in the streets of France kept at a maximum of about 3,000. After the Moscow attacks last month, you saw that number doubled. So, Paris was put on its maximum state of alert. And that police operation you're seeing going on, on those images, the result of that. A very quick police presence around this building as soon as it emerged that an armed man had entered.",
