It's called Clear Air Turbulence. And while that's not what happened on the Singapore Airlines flight, researchers say incidents like it could worsen because of climate change.

I think it must have felt like being on a roller coaster without any harness in place for those who weren't seat-belted. The Clear Air Turbulence is invisible. It's got nothing to do with storms. It's actually generated by these fast air currents called jet streams which if something called the wind shear in the jet stream is too strong, it can break down into this invisible turbulence which does not show up on the radar in the flight deck, so it has the potential to be particularly problematic coming out of the blue when the seat belt sign could well be switched off.",

Now, they're relatively rare but they can happen.The last fatality that I'm aware of from turbulence happened back in 2009. And the one before that was from Clear Air Turbulence in 1997.
