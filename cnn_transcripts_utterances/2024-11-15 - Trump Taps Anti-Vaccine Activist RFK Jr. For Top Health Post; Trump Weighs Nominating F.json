Along with some, well, it's safe to say, perhaps no other president would have considered. Like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run Health and Human Services, Matt Gaetz to be Attorney General, Tulsi Gabbard to lead the Intelligence Community, and Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon.Trump will have to rely on his narrow Republican majority in the Senate to confirm them. But will they? Joining me now is South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds. He's a Republican. He sits on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. Senator, thank you so much for taking the time this afternoon. Really appreciate it. So -- SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I appreciate the opportunity.",

As you know, he spread theories, often baseless theories about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.He's proposed replacing with 600 officials at the NIH with handpicked staff and you have said to me and to others, you want to give the president the benefit of the doubt. And these nominees will go through the vetting process. But when you were governor of South Dakota, you celebrated your state's rising child immunization rate.

We do give the president the benefit of the doubt. I did that with President Biden, but there's another part of this, which is a very important part, and that is the process that we go through with every single one of these nominees. We vet them.

And he was the one, Manu, who found the body of Laken Riley. And what we were able to see in the courtroom was the body camera video that showed that moment. And it was just very hard to see. Before the video was shown, the judge assigned to the case gave people in the courtroom an opportunity to exit at the courtroom because we were about to see something that was going to be very, very disturbing. And we saw how about half a dozen people exited the courtroom. And what I can tell you is that the video showed the officer said that it took about 21 minutes for him to find the body when he found it. What we could see was that the body was partially naked. And one thing that the officer said, and here I quote, he said, \"It looked more intentional as if somebody had attempted to either remove her top or maybe had used it to drag her.\" Earlier, Manu, we also heard from the prosecution, Special Prosecutor Sheila Ross, said that she has very powerful evidence against the suspect.

That's when migrants had to stay in Mexico while they went through their immigration proceedings here. Limiting protections and asylum restrictions as well. Detention, building that out. Making it mandatory. And also, using a national emergency declaration. We talked about this a lot the first time. That was a way that they unlocked those Pentagon funds and resources to build the border wall. Well, now they want to use that for detention, which is the fixation of the now. And part of this is going to actually the key element of this is building out detention space because you can't do mass deportation without mass detention.
