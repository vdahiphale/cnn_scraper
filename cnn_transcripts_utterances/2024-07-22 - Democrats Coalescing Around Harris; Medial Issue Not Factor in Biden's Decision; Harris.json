And just as quickly says that he is not. What this means for Democrats as they wade into - further into unchartered presidential waters.

Two key members of Democratic leadership are now throwing their support behind Kamala Harris. House Democratic whip Catherine Clark, and the chair of the House Democratic caucus, Pete Aguilar. Also this morning, Kentucky's governor is throwing his support behind Kamala Harris. And that's not just any governor. Andy Beshear has been really seen as one of the break glass in case of emergency candidates if Biden had dropped out. Now he's standing with Harris and is seen as a contender to possibly be her vice presidential pick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And at this time, right now, he is currently still here in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, at his home where he's been recovering since Covid - after his Covid diagnosis last week.Now, the last 48 hours have really been a trying one for President Biden as he reached that difficult decision to bow out of this 2024 campaign and throw his full support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris. For the president's part, in announcing his decision not to seek re- election, he said that he does plan to address the nation at some point about this. We're still learning - trying to learn when exactly President Biden will return to the White House. Much of the president's schedule right now is contingent on him clearing Covid and actually returning to the White House. We've also learned that his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely would occur mid to late in the week. They're still working to try to firm up that timing due to his Covid diagnosis. Biden had also been scheduled to travel out west for campaign fundraising. He was going to have at least one fundraiser in California on Friday. It's unclear whether that will proceed. But President Biden really has thrown his full support between - behind Vice President Kamala Harris. You have also seen the Biden- Harris campaign really transition their apparatus to supporting Harris' campaign now. They have changed social media sites from Biden HQ to Kamala HQ. They've changed logos. They also have been really pushing their fundraising machine to try to turn out and get more support for - financial support for Harris' candidacy. As you noted earlier, the campaign brought in 49.6 million in the last days since Biden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee. Donors have told CNN that they are feeling re-energize about giving to the Harris campaign in the wake of this decision from President Biden yesterday. But still, as Eva noted, there is still a long road ahead for Vice President Kamala Harris as she is trying to secure this Democratic nomination, saying yesterday that she plans to earn and win that heading into the August convention.",

About her ideas and her campaign, combined with all these new leaders in the party that I think will be out there.So, I think that's part of the frame, because I think the future is not something that Trump, JD Vance, MAGA and Project '25 are - are - they're not going to win that fight, I don't believe. She'll - she - she will. On the other hand, the other thing though is lean into the prosecution - being the prosecutor. I mean she stood in court face down and convicted rapist, felons, fraud.

But what the question was, was, was he going to be able to raise turn out to levels in which would sustain him and be able to carry him through some of the doldrums and kind of ruts that he found himself in?Kamala Harris is going to have to do something a little similar because Kamala Harris, if she's able to hit 40 percent of the white vote, then she'll be president of the United States. And if she's not able to hit 40 percent, if she's around 38, 39 percent, then she's going to need the African-American community, young voters and Hispanic voters to come out in insanely high numbers. That energy is real though. And she's on a path to do that. You had 44,000 black woman on a call last night. You have black men on a call tonight. You had Gary Chambers and Michael Blake and Roland Martin all situating that. You have the Divine Nine, which are the nine fraternities and sororities. You have the AME Church. You have all of these organizations who are now energized in this battle for democracy. And it's just - and this is something that wasn't there yesterday. I had people calling me saying, I just gave $25. Now, how do I get tickets to Chicago? I mean, this is a newfound type of excitement that they have, or we have in the party.
