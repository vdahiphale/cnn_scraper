I'm Laura Coates and this is CNN TONIGHT.Now, you just saw our CNN Primetime Special with Poppy Harlow in Banks Bust, What's Next for America's Money, and there are fears tonight about what could be happening overseas as we speak and how that could affect us all right here. We'll have more on that later in the show. Plus, the president of Mexico blaming the United States for the fentanyl crisis, charging lawmakers haven't done a thing about it. But what is being done about the fentanyl that's killing thousands and thousands of Americans every single year? And there is news out of the Fulton County grand jury investigation of former President Trump. You remember this phone call he made with the Georgia secretary of state trying to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  So, look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.

A lot to talk about, you guys, particularly on this issue of fentanyl. And as we know, the opioid crisis in this country and the fentanyl crisis in the country does not care about which party you are in or how you vote. It seems to be an equal opportunity assassin in so many ways, and yet it has been very political in terms of how it is dealt with. And recently, we just heard Mexico's president now blaming the United States for doing nothing to stop fentanyl in this country. Listen to what he says. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The border is an open wound in American politics. We're all divided on the question of immigration. One of the reasons is we have never solved this issue of border security. So, the fentanyl crisis is in part a border issue. So, we've got to come together and solve that. But there is a lot of rhetoric in this debate that's not terribly constructive, where there are Republicans talking about declaring war on the Mexican cartels. There needs to be greater law enforcement. There needs to be tougher measures, but it is schizophrenic for the GOP to have this conversation about let's not get involved in forever wars but let's go declare war in Mexico.

Not just did the thing happen, but did the defendant intend to commit the crime that he's charged with. And multiple pieces of evidence in these phone calls where the president seems to be trying to almost shake down everyone in the Georgia State chain of command is going to speak to his intent if the question is the possible violation of Georgia election law.

And we saw it in the '90s when Republicans went after Clinton with the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he became more popular as a result of that.So, Stormy -- as a Republican conservative, I'm worried if there is an indictment around Stormy Daniels, that would help Trump much more than it would hurt him even if he committed wrongdoing. And the question on the Georgia issue really gets to the heart of our political system. Because you have a politician, a former president, who campaigned as someone who is listening to the forgotten man, well, he forgot to respect their vote. He forgot to respect the Constitution of the United States.

The question is are the antics going to be too much for more mainstream GOP voters or even some who would like to see a more effective, a more strident administration coming out of the Republican Party, potentially from a Ron DeSantis. And, really, the Trump shenanigans, whether it is Stormy Daniels or about Fulton County, are really distracting from a broader project that the Republicans have been implementing in control of the system. It is not an accident that these phone calls were happening in Georgia, in Fulton County, the largest Democratic black stronghold in the state of Georgia, right? It is where the county had already been under question for long lines, for voter disfranchisement that had the grand jury previously found voter fraud, well, then Fulton County would have been run by the state and not by local officials anymore.

It's one thing to make that comment specifically about the board of supervisors, but it's another to put it out there just broadly.Folks came there. They put their hearts, their souls and their history on the line. And for them, it was not performative. It was about the city being able to listen and hear why people think it's important. I think that that language is part of why not just the financial piece but why people are so upset. Black people specifically, they feel invisible. They feel like they are labeled and that they are generalized and they are not welcome in San Francisco and that that continues to happen and it is perpetuated, that it has not happened just in language but in deed, that all throughout the ages we have seen the policies, we have seen the people in power, and we have seen the system set up to make sure that black people can't buy. And that when they do buy homes, they were taken from them for a percentage or sometimes not for anything that they were worth. So, I think the challenge here is how do we make sure that we own and acknowledge that wrong has been done and that when black people come out it is not minimalized and focused on the board of supervisors, but that we actually listen to what the folks said when they stepped up to the podium.",

But my comments were not directed at the people who made -- who were making public comment last night. No, far from it.The theater was directed by the Democrats who control the San Francisco board of supervisors. Again, they know well that having those folks stand in line and give their impassionate pleas to get these reparations will never materialize, and it's another failure, again, of the Democrats, you know, to drag the black community through this exercise.

But if we could properly interpret that and properly bring it to being, that's the way to do it. So, yeah, there needs to be not a government top-down reparations plan.
