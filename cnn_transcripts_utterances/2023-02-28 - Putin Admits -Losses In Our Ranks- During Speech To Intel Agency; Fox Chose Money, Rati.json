One professor who's speaking out publicly is my guest tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the enemy is raging. Those are the exact words of a Ukrainian general on the front lines in Bakhmut tonight.

But the reality of it is, when you think about what they're doing, speaking out against the military that they serve, the country they serve for, wanting to fight for Wagner, those words are damning for Putin's generals and for Putin himself. In fact, Putin today admitted to losses, which he almost never does, saying that his top-secret intelligence agency, the FSB, specifically has been suffering losses because of the war.He is saying that units suffering losses were directly involved in his, quote, special military operation, actively fighting terrorism, organized crime, corruption and extremism, as he called it, talking about death in their ranks. And it comes as tonight we have new video of the vicious back and forth around Bakhmut. Here you can see Ukrainian forces storming Russian trenches. So that's a trench there that you are looking down on. At one point, a Ukrainian fighter hurls what looks to be a grenade into that trench. And you can see the blast. Now, obviously what follows is too graphic to show. We're not going to show you that. You can imagine it, and we can tell you, yes, the explosion left the bunker littered with bodies. Human lives now extinguished. And amidst all this death, Putin's top ally, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is trying to help get more military aid for Russia. He arrived in China today for a state visit on the same day that the U.S. reiterated concerns that China could up the ante big time in this war, sending lethal military aid to Putin.

Fred, thank you very much, live from Moscow tonight.I want to go straight now to the Democratic congressman and former army ranger, Jason Crow, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. Congressman, I really appreciate your time and I want to get straight to this current, you know, huge request from Ukraine that has really met with a wall in the U.S. and that is the F-16 fighter jets. You've signed a bipartisan letter supporting that, calling on the Biden administration to provide those F-16s. But Biden's comment just the other day about Zelenskyy, quote, he doesn't need F-16s now. Why is Biden wrong? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO):  Well, Erin, first of all, President Biden and this administration have done a tremendous job of leading and building an international coalition to put Ukraine in the position to win. Not since World War II have we seen a mass mobilization and a logistics operation like we are leading and executing right now to help the Ukrainians fight for their freedom. But, you know, what I learned in war is that every day is a new day. You can't take for granted the successes of the past days. This war is constantly evolving. It's constantly changing. Putin is playing a long game. He believes he can continue to send young Russian men into the teeth of the Ukrainian army to be chewed up, and he can just do that for a year, two years, three years. So, yes, there is a short game that we have to play, it is true we have to send munitions, we have to send tanks, armored personnel vehicles, the things that they need right now. But, at the same time, we have to send the things that they might need in the midterm and longer term. That means we need to start putting the logistics together for the F-16s.",

And what that looks like is we synchronize all of our forces, our ground forces, our infantry, our armor, that is synchronized with what's called long-range fires, that's long-range rockets, long range artillery. And then it's complimented by air superiority. We have an air cap that goes over all of it that does direct strikes that coordinates everything.We're now training the Ukrainians on that style of warfare. We have brigades that are rotating through the training fields of Europe and Germany and other places. We're trying to now modernize and change their style of warfare so they can be more effective against a larger Russian army. But they can't do that unless they have all the pieces to that puzzle. And that includes more advanced fourth-generation fighters. I've been told in my discussions with senior military leaders that we can train these pilots, these Ukrainian pilots and get this ready in three to six months, much faster than I've been told by other folks in the administration. And the reason we know this is because we have had a nine-year partnership between the California Air National Guard and the Ukrainian air force. For nine years they've been flying and training with the Ukrainians, over a thousand training engagements in that time. And they are telling us the Ukrainians know these systems, they know how to train, they are capable of getting this done.",

It's a very different frame that you're talking about.But one of the reasons that they have held back on the F-16s. And before that held back on the tanks, right, and before that -- this has been a step process, has been this fear of escalation into World War III. You heard Prigozhin has referred to that. Putin has made plenty of threats to world war three if the U.S. helps attack inside Russia. And certainly by his definition he would do in Crimea. So what do you say to that?

Our troops are not involved. And that is the right answer.But, listen, talk about escalation. What I am concerned about is the escalation of failure. If Russia wins this and conquers Ukraine, what message does that send to autocrats, the dictators around the world, to China, you know, fill in the blank?

And so, this is -- the argument on the Fox side is they're trying to pull Rupert Murdoch into this. The issue is what these emails show is that Rupert Murdoch was very much, along with Lachlan Murdoch, involved in conversations about how they were going to repair the broken trust with our audience, the broken trust, we see that come up with these emails, and the trust was broken by declaring Arizona for Biden, by calling Biden president- elect after everybody kind of together made the call the following weekend after the election.

China lashing out over the lab leak theory today, taking on Elon Musk. The Global Times, which is a Chinese state run newspaper, threatened the Twitter CEO, who also happens to of course be the CEO of Tesla, threatened his business dealings in China, after he tweeted about the suspected lab leak in Wuhan. And, this is a big deal for Musk. He has got a huge factory campus in Shanghai. China is the second largest market in the world for Tesla. And, it's just the latest example of how sensitive this topic is.\"Outfront\" now, David Feith, he is the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. He has extensively investigated the lab leak theory and done so since 2020. So, David, since the very beginning here, you have been saying it is very plausible that COVID came from that lab in Wuhan, right, which is in Wuhan, and is designed to study Coronaviruses, and is where scientists - apparently there was - had Coronavirus at some point. Is there a question in your mind that that's where the virus originated? DAVID FEITH, FMR. DEPUTY ASST. SECY. OF STATE; INVESTIGATED COVID ORIGIN: Well, I think that we don't have certainty here, and it's important to maintain appropriate doubt and care about what we say and what we assert. What we do have, though, is the high plausibility of the lab leak explanation as the origin of COVID. This was a very high plausibility from the absolute beginning of the outbreak. But, it was an explanation that was just about immediately driven underground by all sorts of scientific authorities on these issues. And, only slowly have people come around to recognizing the plausibility of it, which is important not only for understanding COVID and understanding the U.S. government response, including the shortcomings of our response to the issue, but also for understanding China, how to understand the inherent secrecy, non-transparency and even hostility that comes to us from the Chinese authorities.

It hit vulnerable populations very badly, but it was not deadly to many other segments of the global population. If you combined the deadliness we had 20 years ago with the infectiousness that we've had from COVID, which is the kind of combination that these laboratory experiments seek to produce, you could have a future pandemic that actually threatens the entire species, which is why taking this possibility seriously is so important.",

They especially happen when you have substandard safety practices, and when you have endemic secrecy as we do in China's politics, and that sort of thing can be devastating. We've now lived through that.
