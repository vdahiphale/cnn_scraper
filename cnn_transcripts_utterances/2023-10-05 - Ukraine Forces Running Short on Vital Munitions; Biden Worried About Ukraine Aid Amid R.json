Just ahead, Ukraine's President is meeting with European leaders right now seeking reassurance from allies in their continued support in the war in Ukraine.This all comes on the heels of U.S. President Joe Biden expressing concern of republican infighting can hurt America's ongoing policies supporting Kyiv. And the singing, dancing wonder of the 11 strong K- pop bands excerpts this one key difference. We will tell you what that is. Ukraine's President says Europe's biggest challenge will be to preserve its unity as he arrived in Spanish City of Grenada, Granada rather. Just hours ago, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making an unannounced visit to a summit of European leaders, pushing for more military assistance amid the republican political turmoil in Washington. Which, put continues U.S. aid for Ukraine in limbo. The Biden administration is already resorting to other plans. He has begun shipping seized Iranian ammunition to Ukraine. More confiscated equipment including weapons is set to follow as well. Nada joins now there is lot more going on here. First of all take us through the meeting of European leaders, which lets us just turned up during the massive conversation that having to have there today.",

We saw EU Foreign Ministers visiting Kyiv holding the Foreign Affairs Council for the first time outside of EU premises.And the focus of today's summit in Granada is really on that collective European security. And as we heard earlier in the week, Ukraine has become in the words of the EU, the heartbeat of the EU's focus when it comes to that collective security issue. We heard from Joseph Burrell, the EU High Commissioner describing Russia's aggression against Ukraine as an existential threat to Europe. Now, of course, the key focus collectively will be the security issues that the continent faces that Europe as a whole faces but for President Zelenskyy he has gone in with a clear agenda. He spoke with us this morning. In a statement he said that the key priorities he will be going in to this meeting with is focusing on gaining that support on reaffirming that support from -- particularly when it comes to air defenses. And we know he has held meetings and talks on the sidelines of this summit. He spoke with his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez about a new defense package which they asked to put forward, which will include crucially, both air defense systems and anti-drone systems. But of course, a key topic, a key concern is funding. And we've heard from the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on proposals for long term funding now from the EU, take a listen.

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTI think we had Ursula von der Leyen there say it's all a matter of time will the Ukrainians really say that they don't have very much time because they are already running very low on ammo and we saw that with frontline troops here's what we witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): The artillery troops need to move fast. Russian drones might be in the air, line up calibrate fire. Three rockets that's it, even though this grad launcher would be more effective firing large salvos. It's not very precise. The soldier named Alex says it also depends on the weather and the range it would be good to have more precise rockets or guided ones. But the Ukrainians are running short on even these unguided Soviet era rockets and ammo shortages are a problem across the battlefield here in Eastern Ukraine. Soldiers from the ADF airborne Assault Brigade have a quick snack then get ready to fire their western donated howitzer.

And so the White House is making it clear that this remains a priority not only domestically, and how they see this as an important role that the U.S. needs to play in supporting Ukraine, but also in providing reassurance to allies around the world that they will continue that support. In fact, just this week, President Biden convened to call with allies to reassure them of support for Ukraine, even though the funding was not included in that bill over the weekend. But senior administration officials privately believe that there are enough funds for the weeks to come, but that eventually it could run out and that it could have battlefield effects. So the timeline here is also clear. We're looking at November 17, as when this funding bill runs until that point. And so the question remains as to whether there will be a House Speaker and if there is that a house speaker that would include Ukraine funding in the next funding bill and so all of these questions remain up in the air. But President Biden made clear that he plans to give a speech on this matter, again, underscoring the importance of it. Officials say that no date has been set just yet. But it just goes to show that this remains a priority for the White House and one that they are going to be focused on in the weeks to come to shore up those funds, Max.",

This is something that had been taken for granted as being a largely bipartisan effort.But with the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, you are now staring down the barrel at the very real possibility that funding will start to dwindle. And that will have a major impact on the ground in Ukraine. This couldn't really be coming at a more crucial moment, just as you're seeing Ukraine's counter offensive, stalling somewhat. While at the same time the fighting has been harder than ever, they are burning through that ammunition and so there is a strong sense when you speak to people on the ground in Ukraine that more than ever now. They need the support just in terms of morale, but specifically in terms of weaponry, in terms of munitions, in terms of fiscal aid, in order to be able to sort of take this thing across the line. So there is very real concern that the political caprices of the U.S. political system.

We've just heard from the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni who has remained steadfast in that country's support of Ukraine. But she did raise the very real prospect that European leaders have to listen to the public. And the public does have real concerns about some of the knock on effects that this war has had in Europe. You mentioned some of them in your introduction to me, surging energy prices, migration and inflation. These are very real issues that democratically elected leaders have to contend with. And all of this, I should say, Max really plays in to President Vladimir Putin's playbook. And it's been his playbook all along, which is just to keep this conflict grinding. He understands that the longer it goes, the tougher it becomes. The more likely it is that you will start to see cracks emerging in the U.S. and the EU, and then that will have a tremendous effect on Ukrainian forces abilities to move this across the line on the ground, Max.",
