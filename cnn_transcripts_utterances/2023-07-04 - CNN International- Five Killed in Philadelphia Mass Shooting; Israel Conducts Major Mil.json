And behind me, you can see it is still clearly active. There are shell casings all over the street. Sources tell me that at least 40 shots were fired by a male suspect, he's 40 years old. Preliminary reports from Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, she said that the suspect came here armed with a rifle, a handgun, a bulletproof vest and a scanner. He started firing at his victims somewhere along the route here at 56th and Chester. He shot his victims and then continued moving through this neighborhood. Police were called, they came in, they found his location and then a pursuit went on. They chased him down into an al alleyway, we're told on the 1600 block of Frazier. They cornered him in an alleyway and that's when officers at the Philadelphia police department did incredible work, they cornered him and they got a him to surrender. Here's the commissioner, let's take a listen. DANIELLE M. OUTLAW, PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER: Our officers were able to apprehend the male in the rear alley of 1600 Frazier St. and when they did, this male was wearing a bulletproof vest with multiple magazines in the best. He also had a scanner and an AR style rifle and a hand gun underneath his body. He was taken into custody without further incident.",

And is making a point not to disrupt things so much. I want to point to an editorial that I just read in Xinhua -- is the Chinese state news organization, it's newspaper -- just published an editorial saying to the effect that today's human society is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century. Regional conflicts are raging. The Cold War mentality and group politics are resurfacing, and so are unilateralism and hegemonism. Economic globalism also encountering headwinds. A more turbulent and intertwining world is calling for an SCO type community.

And today Modi is sitting at that table with the leaders of Russia and China. But it's a tight rope walk for India and for Narendra Modi simply because he's going to have to navigate very, very rough waters there in terms of rough diplomatic relations across the board. On one hand, there are deep ties with the U.S. that you've seen, there was grand welcome for him, a red carpet welcome by Biden just about two weeks back. On the other hand, India is very close to Russia. It buys oil from Russia. It buys more than 50 percent of its weapons from Russia. And this a traditional oil ally of India, if I may. So at this point it doesn't want to be seen only as a friend of the West or the East, India wants to be seen as a friend of both.

Which is the first time he even met with Xi Jinping since the start of the invasion. But it is still a chance to show, one, his people that he's still out there in charge and in control. And two, to show the world that they have failed to isolate him as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. These alphabet soup groupings, the SCO, the ASEAN, you know, the Eurasian economic union, they all matter to Putin. Because they are counterpoint to the Western grouping like NATO and the EU.And unlike India, Russia really does want this to be seen to the counterpoint to what it calls the Western hegemony over the world. I think clearly the insurrection will be the elephant in the room here. If not directly addressed, it will have rattled Russia's allies in this virtual room. Because of the political risk that it highlighted. Because of the economic risks that it highlighted. But for Russia right now they need these alliances, these oil customers that are mopping up their oil that has been displaced from Europe more than ever. Oil and gas revenues in Russia were down in the first five months of the year by half compared to last year. But because of sanctions, but also because of the oil price dropping, defense spending is going up. So the economics really matter here.",

As you say Ukraine has said nothing. But this is -- to the best of my knowledge -- the third time drones have targeted Moscow in the space of just over two months.It was obviously the Kremlin at the beginning of May that was hit by several drones. And then we saw those -- that sort of larger scale drone attack that targeted some of the wealthiest suburbs around Moscow. And now this. Now the five drones Russia is saying were all shot down, but we are seeing some video emerging -- it can't be independently verified -- but you see this now a sort of smoke rising. This is not the kind of imagery that Russia wants at a time when it's trying to show, as we've said, that business as usual, you know, Putin is in charge as he is speaking at this Shanghai Corporation Organization.

It began with drone strikes on what Israel says was a command-and-control center belonging to the Jenin brigade -- which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad.The death toll as you say, is 10 Palestinians so far. Israel says that no uninvolved Palestinians have been killed. The implication being that all ten of those were either members of militant groups or they were involved somehow in attacking Israeli forces as they entered the refugee camp. The wounded so far, Palestinian Ministry of Health saying about around 120 of them seriously wounded. And we talked -- you were talking just before about the Palestinians fleeing some neighborhoods of Jenin. And we understand from the Palestinian Red Crescent that some 3,000 have left. And that's -- and they've only left from three neighborhoods because that's where Israel is very much focused on at the moment. So there's something like between 8- to 12,000 more Palestinians who remain in the Jenin refugee camp who haven't been asked to leave by the Israelis. But as I say, this operation continues. Israel as you mentioned, Max, is trying to target ten more targets. It says these are infrastructure targets before it can say that this is a job done. And it says that it has destroyed and/or confiscated a number of weapons and weapons manufacturing facilities as well. And says that this operation could continue for a few hours or it could continue for another day. And this operation has been condemned, I should say, by the Palestinian Authority, by the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Emiratis. The United States for its part has reiterated its support for Israel's right to defend itself, while highlighting the need to avoid any civilian casualties. But of course, the longer this operation goes on, the more danger there is that both the casualty count will grow and that the possibility of escalation, not just within the West Bank, but perhaps to Israel's other borders, either with Gaza or with Syria and Lebanon in the north. The more danger is and what the greater the danger that this fighting going on in Jenin could escalate to those other parts of Israel and its borders -- Max.",
