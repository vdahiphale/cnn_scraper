The judge overseeing Donald Trump's New York criminal trial left scratching his head, apparently, about the Trump team's strategy during what became the most explosive testimony of the trial so far.The judge saying that that, what I just quoted, just before he denied a second move by Trump's defense team to try to declare mistrial over Stormy Daniels' testimony. The headline in The Washington Post this morning, let's call it a review, Stormy Daniels testimony on sex, lies and money was risky for both sides. Very soon, Donald Trump will make his way back to the courtroom after he reportedly left fuming last night. And jurors are now standing by to hear more from a former White House aide to Trump this morning as she's laying out more groundwork for the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen. Cohen is expected to take the stand next week. CNN's Zach Cohen and Alayna Treene are here with more. Do we need to do the disclosure, no relation? I don't think so. I'm pretty sure we don't. Zach, what are the takeaways as we enter in? Where are we now, Day 15 of this trial?",

And, look, it's been a very uncomfortable week for the former president.Stormy Daniels was one of the witnesses that his team was the most worried about. And we've kind of seen that play out this week now because she did get on the stand and share a lot of salacious details, details that are very embarrassing for Donald Trump. And when I talked to his team, they say a lot of the same things we heard from his attorneys. They try to discredit her. They try to say that she's making this up for her own gain. But they also will acknowledge privately, and they've told me this in our conversations, that they really do not know how this is going to play. When you take a step back and you think about the politics of it, they have no idea how this testimony or how the rest of the trial is going to play in a general election. And, of course, from the political side of this and from the campaign side of this, that's really one of their big concerns. Now, I do just want to walk you through something very interesting because Zach did a very good job of laying out kind of the tone in the room and what we've been hearing. Stormy Daniels, as she did on the stand, continued to taunt Donald Trump on social media last night. I'm going to read for you what she wrote. She wrote, quote, real men respond to testimony by being sworn in and taking the stand in court. Oh, wait, never mind. So, you know, a pretty taunting message from Stormy Daniels. And, look, I mean, I'm not sure what her strategy is, if she's trying to goad him into testimony. But this is, of course, something that is going to get under the former president's skin. We know that in the past, he has said that he wants to testify. It's in Donald Trump's nature that he wants to be the one to defend himself. Of course, his lawyers have been behind the scenes telling him that is not a good idea. And, you know, I also think just big picture here, this is part of why he is so angry about the gag order as well. Because when people like Stormy Daniels, witnesses are able to come out and attack him, he feels like he has no way to defend himself. And I think we'll see a very similar type of situation with Donald Trump feeling similarly furious when Michael Cohen ultimately takes the stand, Kate.",

And so when the Israeli Defense Forces started establishing a presence along the border, choking off some of those points of entry, that's when the Biden administration and the president specifically decided that those private warnings simply were not enough. And the president, as we have heard, then disclosing to CNN's Erin Burnett that if Israel were to go into Rafah, then aid would be withheld. NSC Spokesman John Kirby telling reporters yesterday, I can assure you that direct and forthright nature with which he expressed himself and his concerns in that interview with Erin Burnett is consistent with how he has expressed himself to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to Israeli officials. Now, that public declaration, Sara, as you mentioned, coming in advance of that highly anticipated report where the U.S. was required to certify whether Israel was in compliance with or had violated international humanitarian laws that would allow it to continue receiving that aid, and CNN has learned, according to Contributor Barak Ravid, that Secretary of State Tony Blinken will be saying that Israel has complied and can continue to receiving aid, though, Sara, you should be sure that some of those warnings will continue behind the scenes.",
