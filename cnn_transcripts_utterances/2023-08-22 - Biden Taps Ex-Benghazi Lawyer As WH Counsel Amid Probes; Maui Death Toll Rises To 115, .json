But there was a terrible reality, many of the missing may never be found. President Biden addressed the sorrow and loss felt by some of the islands residents.The President took an aerial tour of Maui and met with fire survivors, first responders and officials on the ground there with about 850 people who are still unaccounted for. The death toll has risen again to 115 and is expected to rise even higher. Federal officials say they're nearly 90 percent through going through some of the devastated remains there and their focus will soon switch from recovery to rebuilding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "President and Dr. Biden spent several hours both over Lahaina on the ground here and meeting with both first responders and victims of this tragedy at the big shelter, the War Memorial shelter in central Maui.And he said the right things in many cases when he came to the microphone to give his statements. He said the thing that a lot of folks I've been hearing from for two weeks have been saying that he wants Maui, the people of Maui to help determine how this place is rebuilt. There was a question as to who will have the most influence and that conversation going forward. Locals here working class Native Hawaiians and multigenerational locals are worried of Disaster Capitalism, people moving in to exploit this and buy up as much land as they can in this paradise and rebuild it for their interests as well. The President says promises that that won't happen. It remains to be seen. There's a lot of forces at play here right now. He did serve as empathizer-in-chief after five days of being mostly silent on the issue publicly. But the governor said he was working behind the scenes to assure first responders that the feds had their back on this. He shared the stories were familiar with losing his daughter and wife and wondering if his son have survived a car accident early in his political career. And that's what so many people here are going through now. The list of the missing according the mayor of Maui was whittled from over 2,000 by the FBI and authorities down to around 850 now, that still seems impossibly high this many days almost two weeks now after the fire broke out. Forensic anthropologists though say historically, seems like this can take months or even years to sort out the missing you can hope there's still some confusion as to who's on that list. But the real heartbreak is to think about the children who were left home that day. There are parents in this town who lost their kids. There are kids who lost their parents were unclear if the President Biden was able to meet with any of those. We know he did meet with Archie Kalepa historic figure here. Uncle Archie as he's known as a Hall of Fame water man who led a lot of the relief efforts from a sort of a cul-de- sac command post that we went into as well as some of those who have been very active on social media. Were at the table at least with President Biden for the few hours he was here. But now all eyes are on this place to see how soon they can find the huge number of missing or and make peace with those families and how exactly they will rebuild. Bill Weir, CNN Maui.",

They are holding steady with their proposal for the case to go to trial in January of next year. And they say this isn't just what they want. This is what the country deserves. Remember, the -- there is a consideration for the national interest when a former president and possibly future President goes on trial.And that's the argument from the prosecutors. They have also accused the Trump team of basically cherry picking the data, cherry picking the numbers, as they were arguing to stretch out this case, delay the case and they want to have the trial go in 2026, which is really far in the future. For their part, prosecutors have also made it clear that they're keeping up with their discovery obligations. They've turned over millions of documents, including materials from the January 6th Committee and materials from the U.S. Secret Service. So as far as the Special Counsel is concerned, they say they're ready to go and that Trump's team should be ready as well for January. But of course, Kate as we always say it will be up to the judge to decide.",

Two civil trials starting later this fall with the New York Attorney General civil suit against Trump and his kids alleging fraud in the business sector, then as we've been talking about, in January of next year, the proposed start date for the Federal Election subversion trial, the defamation case, the second round of defamation trial with E. Jean Carroll, the writer and columnist.Then in March, Fani Willis that's when she wants to take the Georgia case to trial. That's very ambitious, and most experts don't think it will happen that quickly. Also, in March, the scheduled start of the New York State hush money criminal trial, the state charges which of course Kate was the very first indictment that Trump was hit with. It feels like a lifetime ago. And then the last one that's on the books as of now is the Mar-a-Lago trial over the classified documents. So a legal trial, a legal schedule and a political schedule, it's going to be a wild 2024.",
