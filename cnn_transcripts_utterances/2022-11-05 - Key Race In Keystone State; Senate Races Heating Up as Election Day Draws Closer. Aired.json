      "sentences": "Place your bets, I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. We're three days away from Election Day. We're all eyes are on a handful of toss up races in Senate and gubernatorial contests so much so that political betting is surging. According to \"The Washington Post,\" \"In the election markets, traders can typically buy a share of a candidate, priced between one and 99 cents. Like stocks, investors want to buy low and then unload when the value is much higher.\"So for example, if I were to buy one share of a candidate for 50 cents and they turn out to be a winner on Tuesday, I'd earned $1 gaining back 50 cents on top of my original bet. Sites like Predict It have become a source for political insiders to gain wisdom straight from people's pockets. So what do the betting markets tell us? Right now, control for the Senate, trading at 75 cents in the GOP's favor. Here on the East Coast, Pennsylvania Senate race heating up with Dr. Mehmet Oz trading at 62 cents. Following his recent debate performance, John Fetterman has fallen to 44 cents. The race to win over working class voters tightening in Ohio between candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Ryan. But Vance is predicted to win 89 cents to Ryan's 14. In Georgia, fight for control of the entire U.S. Senate could come down to Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock. In the betting market, Walker the stronger pick at 64 cents compared to Warnock's 42. Now, if you don't believe the conventional polls or the betting, you might want to consider this. A total lunar eclipse predicted to turn the moon blood red on Election Day. Most importantly, I want to know what you think. Go to smerconish.com and answer this week's poll question, real simple, real straightforward. Will the Republicans take control of the United States Senate? Where control in the U.S. Senate is up for grabs and will come down to a few battleground states. We've assembled a top political reporters for each of those contests. Joining me now three reporters who know the races best. Tia Mitchell, the Washington Correspondent for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Anna Staver, Political Reporter with USA Today's Network Ohio Bureau. And Holly Otterbein, a National Political Reporter at Politico and former reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Holly, the Oprah endorsement of John Fetterman got a lot of attention. I read your reporting. You were the one who had the sort of backstory as to how they were able to land it. When I actually heard her words, it's not what I had anticipated. I want to roll the tape and then explain why. Play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I would argue, though, that because, you know, you and I and media in general are just spending even one minute talking about Oprah's endorsement of Fetterman as opposed to his debate performance or his stroke or Democrats hand wringing about his debate performance is a good thing for Fetterman. I mean, he had, you know, really bad media in the last few weeks, and now he's getting a little bit of positive earned media. And that's good for him.And actually, the top Democratic Senate Super PAC actually just did put an ad up on T.V. today, you know, promoting the endorsement. But that being said, you know, I was talking to a Republican who questioned, you know, does the average voter even put together immediately that Dr. Oz was on Oprah's show and that it's significant because of that.

And then you saw the betting market and the betting market seems to say, no, J.D. Vance is in a more comfortable position. Put those headlines up, by the way, Katherine (ph), that show, you know, horse race in the state of Ohio. Is it because in Ohio, there's a perception of well, they said the same thing in 2020.

So, even if Tim Ryan over delivers on Biden and Clinton, you know, by six or seven points, even if he makes this a very close race, I mean, he's still could end up losing on election night because what Tim Ryan has to do is hit three different goals.

So, Oz does have a bit of momentum.And you know, while I do agree with the idea that the bottom didn't fall out for Fetterman after the debate, the race did tighten. And in a race that is so close in a state like Pennsylvania where it's really built to be very purple, you know, a few points could absolutely make a difference. Now, Democrats will say the race was always going to tighten in these final weeks a little bit more and that's probably partly true.

And this is a real question about whether they will have moved entirely to the Republican camp or whether they can be won back by Democrats. I mean, obviously, Sherrod Brown carried some of those voters in 2018, but that was a really good year for Democrats.Generally, I think it's about a question of whether we're seeing a change in what makes a swing state. A lot of the swing states that we see now are out west, where you have a large, highly educated city like a Denver or a Portland, and that sort of overwhelms its rural areas.

So if none of the candidates on the -- on -- in any race gets to 50 percent, there will be a runoff in December. That's changed from the 2021 run offs. It used to be a nine-week runoff period.

Catherine, roll that tape would you?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARI LAKE (R-AZ), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: I know for a fact we will no longer accept rigged elections. Who's with me on that? We have a wide open border, the cartels are in control. We have this illegitimate President Biden who is allowing it to happen. Yes, but the fake news wants us to think that that guy got 81 million votes. OK. All right. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They understand that it's more about threats to your vote, the end of early voting, voting entirely on Election Day. Other measures our legislature could take to somehow suppress the vote, curtail the vote, that is a big issue. For a lot of voters here, however, I'm sitting in Phoenix. The inflation rate is 13 percent. They're looking at the gas prices. They're looking at the grocery bills. And they're saying, hang on, this isn't right, I want change.I'll add one more thing. I think the pandemic is a very understated or maybe not so well understood issue in shaping voters' feelings right now, the way they look at the world. I know certainly Kari Lake is taking advantage of that. I think it affects everybody in different ways here and we don't quite understand how that's playing into this election.",

But that's led to this opening for McMullin who again is trying to create this sort of independent coalition of Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated voters altogether.

Smerconish, ticket splitting is moronic. Like voting to get nothing accomplished. Ticket splitting is moronic. Really? So when I voted in Pennsylvania, which I did by ballot this week, I should have just voted for all Ds or all Rs. [09:40:07] What if I know the state representative candidate because I've gotten to know him or her? This is a hypothetical. And regardless of party -- like they're a solid person, oh, no, I can't do that because I need to vote for Rs or Ds. Nope. Still to come, our expert voices return for even more analysis, stick with us. And I want to remind you have you voted yet at Smerconish.com? This is the question. I mean, there's only one question, will Republicans take control of the United States Senate? Go vote. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

You know, you've got both candidates running ads constantly, out there hustling, things that we haven't really seen before. However, our voter turnout right now is 22 percent. County clerks I've been talking to say people, it just seems, are kind of sitting on their ballots just waiting to see what happens. Not sure what they're waiting for but they're waiting to see. It's going to come down to who turns out on Election Day, who turns out in these last days. We are a vote by mail state. People are getting their ballots in but we're, again, not seeing huge numbers.
