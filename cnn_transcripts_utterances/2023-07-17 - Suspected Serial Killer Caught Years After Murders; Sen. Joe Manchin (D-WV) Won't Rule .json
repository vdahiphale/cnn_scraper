In the T.V. show Dexter, remember that one, who was a serial killer who quietly let a double life, holding down a normal job on the one hand, had a family in the suburbs, blending perfectly, they say, into society? Well, listen, in real life that plot is now eerily similar to an accused killer in a series of horrible murders. This is Rex Heuermann, an architect in New York. He's a husband, father of two. He's also behind bars tonight charged with the killers of three of the four women were known as the Gilgo Four. And investigators fear that there could be more victims. The unsolved murders have literally terrorized Long Island for more than ten years now. In fact, ten years ten other sets of human rain remains have also been found. The cold case now, it recently became warm after a task force big got a sample of Heuermann's DNA, get this, from pizza crust of the throughway. Among the items that were found during the search of his own home, more than 200 guns and a child-like doll in a case. And tonight, I am speaking to the case's top investigator who says the crimes are the worst he's ever seen and that he is afraid that there are more victims. Joining me now in Suffolk County is Deputy Police Commissioner Anthony Carter. Commissioner, thank you for joining us. This has been captivating Long Island and the nation for quite some time. But this is the Gilgo Four but only three charges linked to three different women have actually been filed right now. So, let me begin with that fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Is there a connection from Heuermann to her death yet?",

REP. ANNIE KUSTER (D-NH): Well, the irony is they are trying to show unity when actually they are going to sow division. And, Laura, good to be with you, it is wonderful to have people come to New Hampshire. We major in politics. This is what we do. We've had the first of the nation primary for many, many years and I always welcome people to come with their ideas. But what is different about No Labels -- and you always have to follow the money. What is different about No Labels is I think they are not being honest with voters. Voters from New Hampshire expect for candidates to say what they believe and believe what they say. And what we have here with No Labels is a group of people that have come together, many of them billionaire Republican donors, supporters of Donald Trump, trying to disrupt the two-party system in order to re- elect Donald Trump. And I think that is where we will end up if they end up on the ballot in places like New Hampshire. COATES: Now, with No Labels, though, they, of course, one, point out that there are donors who have supported Democrats as well, who are providing money for the conference as well. And there is a thought that they have explained that the reason they don't want to be transparent, so to speak, is because there's a lot of antagonize and that could go on to donors who try to endeavor to be bipartisan.

They put out this commonsense platform without specifics, acting as though these issues are simple. Laura, let me tell you, the simple issues have already been resolved. The ones that we have left are very, very complex. And we have people in this race President Joe Biden, who have put forward platforms, put forward positions, passed bipartisan legislation. They talk about a bipartisan approach? That's exactly what we did. And we won the bipartisan infrastructure bill and got it signed into law. And we won the Inflation Reduction Act on clean energy.

Albert, thank you for joining us. I can tell you, I have sat through many a plea colloquy, as they are said. The judge lays out the fact that the person is giving up a lot of rights, they go to great lengths, I would assume, under a case like this in particular to ensure that the person is well-represented and knows what they are doing. He's now saying that he really wasn't and did not actually mean the things he said. What's your reaction?",

For Jake to have asserted ineffective assistance counsel, he had to do so within a one-year period following the sentencing. That's the period during which the court had continuing jurisdiction. Jake had a new attorney after sentencing, and that's appropriate, and no such motion for ineffective assistance to counsel was filed for, period, ever.Jake had the right and entitlement even though he took a plea and even though he waived many of his appellate rights, he had the right to appeal the sentence. With his new attorney who came in right after sentencing, he filed a notice of appeal but never filed an appellate brief. In fact, his new attorney dismissed the appeal. So, those two avenues, the appeal and the assertion of ineffective assistance to counsel, which doesn't bother me, I mean, it's a part of doing business. I've been doing this for just shy of 40 years. It happens. People accuse you of that because that's all they have. But now we're past that period. Jake has served this time, in fact he's gotten out very, very early, and he's a free man. Where Jake was compromised, was not by the appeal or absence of appeal, it was by the government not providing to Jake. During his pre-plea period, those videos ended up showing up on Tucker Carlson's show. They were not disclosed to him during the course of discovery in his case. That was an absolute duty by the government, and the government had no right to make that decision to not share that required disclosure with Jake. It's not about whether Jay is guilty.",
