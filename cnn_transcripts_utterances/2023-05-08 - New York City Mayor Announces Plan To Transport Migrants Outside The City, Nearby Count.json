The U.S. is bracing for tens of thousands of desperate migrants to try to cross the southern border in a few days. That's when the Trump-era policy expires that allowed some migrants to be quickly turned away. Already, men, women and children are lining up for food, sleeping on the streets, more than 150,000 people are reportedly just across the border waiting to cross. But it's the responsibility of Congress to pass new immigration laws. So, what can the Biden administration actually do? Our panel has ideas. Plus, nobody wants to live in fear that we're only a day or two away from the next mass shooting. This past weekend saw another one, eight people killed, this time at a mall in Allen, Texas. The shooter was a 33-year-old who served in the military for three months. But a defense official says he was terminated years ago because of a mental health condition. The shooter appears to have posted a photo of a patch on his clothing that represents a white supremacy group. Of course, these mass shootings make us all feel helpless. So, tonight, we'll look at a bill in the Texas House that could be getting some unexpected support. And there's a plan to pay reparations to African-Americans in California. John Avlon is here with a debut of CNN TONIGHT's Reality Check. But let's start with what we know about the looming immigration deadline. The repercussions of this are spreading across the country. New York City Mayor Eric Adams announcing a plan to send migrants away from his city to nearby counties, but officials there want no part of that plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ED DAY (R), ROCKLAND COUNTY EXECUTIVE: The mayor is engaged in human trafficking of the worst kind. He's talking out of both sides of his mouth about how wonderful he's taking care of people. And what he's doing, he's putting them in the worst possible situation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

First of all, Title 42, that Trump-era policy, was predicated on COVID. So, that's got to be -- where back to status quo. And the status quo force is broke. So, the people who are politicizing this, it should highlight the fact that we desperately need to deal with our border. We need a balanced comprehensive plan.

Democrats, obviously, and liberals, believe it's the guns. They're just nowhere near crossing lines on the graph right now. That's the fundamental debate.So, to say that Republicans are effing it up is to say I don't find your argument about the root causes of this valid. Just like on the immigration question we debated in the first segment. If I said to you everything you just said is invalid because I fundamentally disagree with you, that would not be a very productive conversation. To me, where the rubber hits the road here is liberals are going to have to understand that there are people who take the Second Amendment and their individually right, according to the Supreme Court, to keep and bear arms very seriously. And the conservatives are going to have to take what you said, and what everyone else has said here about the need for safety very seriously. Only then will anything move on this.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:40:00] CAMEROTA: Tonight, protesters on the streets of New York, railing against the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a subway last week. 24- year-old Daniel Penny put Neely in a chokehold after Neely was reportedly shouting at passengers that was hungry, thirsty, fed up, and ready to go to jail for life. Prosecutors still deciding whether to bring charges against Penny. Earlier, CNN's Omar Jimenez spoke to an eyewitness who saw Penny put Neely in a chokehold. He described Neely then as staring off and being limp after Penny released him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHNNY GRIMA, EYEWITNESS TO JORDAN NEELY'S DEATH: I looked from the window and stuff, and I saw that his eyes were staring off and that he was limp. So, I went in through another door and I said to them to put him on his side so he doesn't choke on his own spit or something. And they flipped him over. Daniel Penny drew his arm out really rough like, threw him around like that. And then I went through another door, and I went to pour a little water on Jordan Neely's head, and Daniel Penny came up and told me to stop. He got over him and said stop. All right. And I should have -- I should have been more -- more on it, man, and not walked away, but I did. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
