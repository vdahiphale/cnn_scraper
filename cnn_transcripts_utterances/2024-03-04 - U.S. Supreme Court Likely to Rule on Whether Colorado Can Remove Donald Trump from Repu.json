That's a little surprising that its' been almost a month now since this case was argued, but it's a case with enormous significance, especially as voters across the country head to their primary polling locations tomorrow for Super Tuesday, including the state of Colorado.If you remember how this case played out at the Supreme Court several weeks ago, former President Trump's lawyer did pretty well. Not only did the law really appear to be on his side, but the justices on bolds sides of the aisle appeared willing to agree with a lot of what he was saying. So it's widely expected that he will likely win in this case, but it's not clear exactly how, why it's taken so long, how difficult it might have been for Chief Justice John Roberts to build some sort of consensus behind the scenes. And we'll be looking to see how narrow that consensus is. It's also expected that once this is a decided that what they decide will also apply to other states, because of course, we have seen in Illinois and Maine, they have also tried to remove former President Trump from the ballot. But this is, as you noted, its one of the most significant election- related cases since Bush v. Gore. But unlike those cases, of course, they're not deciding the outcome of an election. They're just deciding who can appear on the ballot.",

And also losers who are losers are never graceful.CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Arlette, a very -- it was a long sit down.

It's very rare that he sits down for an interview in the Oval Office and rare that he sits down for an interview with print reporters, but he did so with \"New Yorker's\" Evan Osnos where he talked about the stakes of this election. The president really said that he is driven to run for reelection by two things. One, he believes that he has accomplishments that he can tout and has provided benefits for the American people. He argues that those benefits are just starting to kick in now and will need more time to come to fruition.But also, the president believes that he can beat former President Donald Trump. He said that he did it once back in 2020, one of the only people to be Trump, and that he does believe he can do it again. Now, this interview comes, these comments come as the president is facing very close polling in hypothetical head-to-head matchups with Trump. And also, there are voters, including some Democrats, harboring questions about the president's age and his ability to serve a second term. But in this interview, the president also spoke about what's at stake if Trump -- if Biden wins and Trump were to not concede. He said that he fully expects that Trump would not concede again, just as he did back in 2020, saying in that interview, you read part of that quote where he said \"Losers who are losers are never graceful. I just think that he'll do anything to try to win. If and when I win, I think he'll contest it no matter what the result is.\" We have heard Biden use similar language in the past, calling -- referring to Trump as a loser, calling him an election denier in chief. And recent polling has found that the American public also believes that Trump would not concede if Biden were to win. A CNN, recent CNN poll released found that only 25 percent of Americans say they expect Trump will accept the results those of a loss if he were to lose to Biden. That is actually down from 37 percent in October. So the president really speaking to what is at stake here in this election, what would happen, once again, if Trump were not to concede if Biden were to win, as he is trying to make this case and present this contrast with the former president as voters are trying to make up their minds heading into November.",

In the early years of his presidency, when people asked him about his age, his stock response was, 'watch me.' He doesn't say that as much anymore.

You see four officers begin to work their way through the apartment clearing the apartment, and then you see an officer kick in the door. And then almost simultaneously, there's the sound of a gunshot. There's just a very brief pause and then there's the sound of another gunshot. There's also the sound of a taser being deployed. The body camera video from the first officer in that line is obscured by a ballistic shield. So it's very unclear what prompted them to open fire on Isaac Goodlow. I've reviewed all of the angles of this, I cannot see what that first officer would have seen that would have prompted any one of those officers to open fire, that Sara, remains the open question. The video that Carol Stream released begins with about a five-minute statement from the Carol Stream Police chief. He does not say, Sara, why police opened fire on Isaac Goodlow. They do though give an explanation of what led up to this incident. They say February 3rd, 4:15 AM, they get a call of a domestic violence incident. According to police, the girlfriend of Isaac Goodlow, who shared that apartment with him ran outside after an altercation with Isaac Goodlow. She was barefoot. She claimed to police that she had injuries. She was checked out by paramedics. Police were there for about 45 to 50 minutes with her and in that time, she granted them permission to go inside that apartment. Police say they spent 45 to 50 minutes trying to contact Isaac Goodlow. They tried to call his cell phone, they say they tried to knock on the door, they tried to knock on an exterior window. They didn't hear anything. They made arrangements with the apartment company to get a key to get inside that apartment. And that's what you see at that beginning of that video which is the perspective of the supervising officer on scene. This body camera video while answering some questions leaves many questions unanswered. The family spoke with CNN's Omar Jimenez over the weekend. Here's what they said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
