He was critical of Trump's vice presidential pick, Senator J.D. Vance, after the shooting.Christie says Vance, quote: Turned directly to the current flawed playbook, demonized the other side and lay the blame at the feet of the Democrats as if they had pulled the trigger themselves. President Joe Biden talked about the growing calls for him to step aside from the 2024 race in an interview with BET News. He said he's reluctant to walk away because there's more to do for the country and only a medical condition diagnosis might convince him to drop out. Now this comes as a growing faction of House Democrats are calling on the Democratic National Committee to ditch plans to virtually nominate Mr. Biden before the party convention in Chicago next month. A clear sign some are still concerned about the president staying at the top of the ticket.

Who you are, what you've done, what you'll do, that's fair game. Well, here's the truth about why Donald Trump's presidency was held for Black America. He tried to repeal Obamacare to kick millions, I mean millions of Black Americans off their health insurance. He had a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the super wealthy, the biggest corporation, and exploded the federal debt larger than any one president has in one term. He left no room for us to do what we should be doing, invest in things that affect people's lives, like child care, elder care, and so much more, that grow the economy to help people.

It's not easy to expel a senator, even one as guilty as Menendez, but it's so much broader than that. Democrats, having been the incumbents in the Senate and the incumbents in the White House, they're not in the House, House of Representatives, they have a lot of the establishment in the current conditions to defend.
