And controversial new law in Louisiana requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in all public school classrooms. Civil liberties groups are already calling it unconstitutional.

After months of suggesting Americans have ignored the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees this debate as a fresh start and a chance to show just how different the two candidates are in front of a new audience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITCH LANDRIEU, BIDEN CAMPAIGN NATIONAL CO-CHAIR: So the president is going to ask Donald Trump questions. He's going to want to know why he appointed three justices that eviscerated Roe versus Wade and put women's lives in danger. He's going to ask Donald Trump why he threatened democracy in this country and help with the insurrection and now wants to pardon those folks. He's going to talk to him about why he continues to seek revenge and retribution and try to give his friends, his billionaire friends, another tax break and why he hurt the country so badly when he was president. You can expect our president to speak about those issues with Donald Trump. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden huddling with aides at Camp David, the mountainside Maryland retreat north of the White House, where he'll be hunkered down for the next several days preparing for the momentous debate that awaits him next week. President Biden and his team are expected to go through binders of potential questions, punches, counter punches, topics and refine the material to culminate in a 90-minute mock debate where CNN has learned that the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is likely to stand in as President Trump in that mock debate, as he did four years ago. Now, as for the messaging, the Biden team plans to highlight the remarks that Trump has made in the past that it sees as incendiary, but believes that voters may have missed proving in their words that Trump is a danger to democracy and highlighting the high stakes that await voters in November. Among the comments that the campaign plans to raise are Trump's comments that he plans to be a dictator on day one to highlight the choice that they see voters needing to make. As for the setup on stage, President Biden's team won the coin toss and they got the choice of whether to choose the podium position or whether they wanted to choose who made the closing argument. President Biden chose stage right. So President Trump will have the final word. Kayla Tausche, CNN, the White House.",

We've heard in the past from Israeli officials saying that they can, quote, \"copy and paste what is taking place in Gaza in Lebanon if Hezbollah continues to target Israeli territory.\" But, of course, important to remember that the U.N. and many international partners consider Israel to be an occupying force in the war in Gaza. Gaza is a small strip of land that has been under a blockade for nearly 20 years.Lebanon is a sovereign nation. And while the confrontations that we've been seeing over the last few months have been directly between the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in the south of Lebanon and the Israeli military, we've heard from the Lebanese government in the past saying that they will not stand idly by if Israel threatens to push the Lebanese state into an all-out war. And then, of course, important to remember that Hamas and Hezbollah are not the same. Hezbollah is politically and militarily far more sophisticated. It has a far more powerful and much larger military arsenal than Hamas. We're talking about drones and short-range rockets, which we've seen used across the border over the last few months, but also, of course, longer-range missiles that could target deeper into Israeli territory. And the fear amongst many in the international community, including the United States, is that Israel would not necessarily be prepared for that sort of military arsenal. You heard the warnings there from military officials in the U.S., U.S. officials, rather, saying that Israel's Iron Dome air defense system could be overwhelmed. We've heard from the State Department now pushing for a cessation of these violent tensions that we're seeing. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The best way to unlock the possibility of a resolution along the Israel-Lebanese border would be achieving a ceasefire in Gaza. And we continue to actively pursue a ceasefire in Gaza, primarily to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza and to secure the return of hostages. But a very important side effect, we assess, would be making it much easier to achieve a ceasefire and diplomatic resolution along the Israel-Lebanon border. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, of course, this is providing some much needed respite. But the message we continue to hear from aid organizations is that there needs to be a continued focus on these land crossings into Gaza as the most effective way of getting aid in. At this stage, we are still, according to aid organizations, seeing obstructions and delays at these land crossings with not enough aid as needed getting into the Gaza Strip. And of course, U.S. officials have repeatedly reiterated that this pier is a temporary measure. It's unclear when it will be officially taken out of operation.
