Thanks, Kaitlan.And good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip. We begin tonight with some breaking news and more possible evidence of witness tampering and obstruction by Donald Trump. Now, according to reports, his former assistant told investigators that Trump told her to say that she didn't know anything about the boxes of classified documents over at Mar-Lago. But that was after he learned that the feds wanted to speak to her. The assistant also alleges that Trump would write to-do lists on classified papers that he would then give to her. Now, tonight, a Trump spokesperson responded to that report, in part, blasting, quote, illegal leaking. But, remember, one of Trump's other aides has already flipped on him, telling investigators that Trump ordered him to delete tapes. Let's discuss all of this with CNN Senior Political Analyst John Avlon and Attorney Temidayo Aganga-Williams. Temidayo, thanks for being here. Look, you don't know anything about boxes. That's the quote. How damaging is that? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER JAN. 6 COMMITTEE LAWYER: I think it's incredibly damaging. I mean, Molly Michaels, I think, is going to be a central critical witness to Jack Smith's case. One, it substantiates the charges, right? It's showing it's putting these documents in Trump's hands. That's where she's writing these to-do lists. That's critical. Second point is going to be that obstruction count, as you're talking about, the obstruction point. And what that does is it puts the jury in the mind of the former president. That's always tough in a criminal case. How do you show knowledge and intent? That's what's required under the law. And with here, that's evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong and he intended to act with that criminal intent. And that's going to be critical. And for any cover-up, that's what a jury is going to love to see. That's what people understand. Everyone knows what it means to lie after the fact. It shows that you knew what you were doing was wrong.",

But how significant is that, that people are deciding, you know what, I've got to tell what I know, and they're coming forward to the special counsel?AGANGA-WILLIAMS: It's incredibly significant. And what I'll note here is that I think it's a point to talk about credibility. This is not some Democrat out of nowhere with political opposition to Trump. This is his personal assistant. She stuck by him through impeachment one, impeachment two, the January 6th attack. She was with him. And she's someone who's shown loyalty to him. And even at this point, she broke. Why that's important is that a jury is going to look at that and say, why would she lie? She has no bias. She has no incentive to mislead here. So, that's going to be a critical point, a credibility that she has. And like a lot of the witnesses we had in our Jan. 6 investigation, they were Republicans. They were handpicked by the former president and they all said, this guy did something wrong.",

And now onto the chaos over on Capitol Hill. So, Pew asked Americans to describe the state of the United States politics in just one word, and I want you to listen to some of the most common responses.

No repeats there. And only one response can be considered a positive adjective. And that was, quote, good. Well, it's hard to argue with many of those descriptions since next week the government may shut down again. Republican hardliners in the House are refusing to agree to a plan to fund the government and they're demanding even deeper spending cuts. Here is how one moderate Republican is reacting to all of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): This is not conservative Republicanism. This is stupidity. These people can't define a win.

You will get this back. It is now almost 15 years later. And any new hire in 2009, thanks to what the UAW at the time agreed to, was making $15.48 an hour.

And they said, thank you, we will make sure you get it back. Well, they'd never got it back. So, they had been hoodwinked. And they are not going to give up this fight. And, in fact, I've got to say, the union has been very generous this week. They could have shut the whole thing down on Thursday night. They only shut down three factories as a little flare over the bow to let the carmakers know that they have the power to crush them. They will shut the whole thing down. And not just 150,000 who -- of UAW workers who would go on strike, this will shut down thousands of companies, distributors, people who build parts for the auto industry, people who live in the towns around the auto industry.

There's no evidence of anything except that this man was accused falsely of being a federal agent, and now he's actually been charged with a crime. So what are you implying exactly? RIVERA: I imply nothing other than to tell you that years ago, I was the first one to air the Zapruder film of the John F. Kennedy assassination. It was 1975. I'm the father of conspiracy television. I have not been able to shake that. This is another one of those cases where the federal government's ham- handed approach, I use that word again, or two words, ham-handed approach will only fuel conspiracy notions. This is a person who should have been arrested a very long time ago. I believe that responsibility for what happened on January 6th is primarily with Donald Trump and a lot of other people, his minions, who drank the Kool-Aid and they did something, some in character, like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, others, who knows where they came from and why they decided to attack the United States Capitol. This handling of this case, these are questions that must be answered. Otherwise, it will haunt us the way the Kennedy assassination conspiracies have haunted us.",

You saw the president at the United General Assembly today, which is the world stage, the world stage, not just for talking clearly to the American people, but to the world about how we see the future of the American leadership, right? And our leadership in the last two years, in particular, what the president has been done been able to do is to say that we have to work together to deal with the pressing issues in front of us. And that's what he's done, right? Working with our allies, working with our partners. And we've been able to do that in a way so that we are helping Ukraine. Let's not forget what is happening in Ukraine. Russia did an unprovoked war, a brutal war on the people of Ukraine, where it is a sovereignty, their democracy is under attack and we have come together with the leadership of this president, bringing NATO together stronger than it's ever been before to make sure that they are able to fight bravely, continue to fight bravely on the ground to have that protection, look, or to be able to fight on the battlefield. Look we believe that we will continue to see that strong bipartisanship support that we saw in Congress continuing, right, to make sure that Ukraine has all that they need the security assistance that they need to fight. And so I can't speak to any specific thing that we may be able to provide clearly when those conversations happen, they will happen. But we want to make sure that we are there for them as long as it takes as they are fighting for their freedom. That's what they're doing Abby for their democracy.",

Look, I was in the hall today when the president was speaking on that world stage for UNGA.

They have been working and engaging with the parties for the past couple of weeks, helping in any way that we can. The president certainly believes it's collective bargaining. That's something that the workers should be able to move forward with, and they should be able to do that. But it is up to them to come to a resolution to have these negotiate -- negotiation and so the president certainly believes that he is pro- union about the workers, about the UAW workers. And so there was a mutual decision, a mutual agreement that was made by all parties so that Gene and Julie Su were to not come down, go out this week just yet, to continue those conversations from Washington, D.C. Again, a mutual decision. So we give them the space to continue to negotiate UAW and the big three, and so that's what we're doing.",
