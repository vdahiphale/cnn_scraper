Meantime, rescuers digging through the rubble and debris hoping to find dozens still believed to be trapped after that deadly earthquake in Taiwan. And the founder of World Central Kitchen accuses Israel of systematically targeting aid workers. And in fact, we will learn if the deadly strike will push President Biden to set limits on military aid to Israel. And we do begin in Taiwan this hour where rescue teams are searching for more survivors a day after the island was hit by its strongest earthquake in a quarter century. Now a driver's dash cam captured the terrifying moment the 7.4 magnitude quake struck on Wednesday morning. Now we want to warn you, some viewers may find this video disturbing. These drivers were on a hillside road, if you can imagine, when a quake triggered the rock slide. They put their car in reverse and started backing up when one of the boulders, you see it there, just smashes into one of the vehicles. CNN cannot independently verify the video and unfortunately, we're unaware of how many people were inside and if anyone was injured. Officials say the quake killed at least nine people and injured more than 1,000. More than 100 people remain trapped and dozens are still missing at this hour or unaccounted for. CNN's Ivan Watson has more now from Taipei. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just before 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, the ground in Taiwan starts to shake. The island rocked by the most powerful earthquake to hit Taiwan in a quarter century. In the capital, Taipei, CNN photojournalist John Mees tries to protect his wife and children as the walls of their home lurch back and forth. An earthquake has just hit, announces the anchor of this morning news show as she struggles to stay on her feet. But the worst damage is at the epicenter in the rugged mountains of Hualien County on the island's east coast. The 7.4 magnitude earthquake triggers massive landslides. Authorities say several people were killed by falling rocks. In the town of Hualien, apartment buildings on the verge of collapse. Emergency workers in action. Authorities say they've rescued scores of people from toppled buildings and highway tunnels. And rescue teams are still trying to reach others trapped high in the mountains. The workers continued in Hualien throughout the night. No one's left inside this building, says this firefighter. He adds, people are frightened. There are constant earthquakes here, says this woman. I've lived here 50 years and never felt one so big. It's really scary. People in Taiwan are accustomed to feeling to the earth shake, but rarely with this much destructive force. Ivan Watson, CNN, Taipei. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

World Central Kitchen says its operations in the enclave remain closed for now, and it's not yet reached a decision on when it will resume its vital work. The group immediately suspended its mission after the death of its workers, and all its aid ships are now back at the Cyprus port. This video shows one boat that left Gaza following the deadly strike. And this is key here without offloading most of its cargo, which added up to about 332 tons of humanitarian aid. Now that's according to the Cyprus foreign ministry. Now the founder of World Central Kitchen is lashing out at Israel, accusing it of systematically targeting his seven team members in Monday strike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Either way, it's a problem. In response to some of those conversations, Israel's defense minister has said that they will be setting up a situation room and encouraging open and transparent communication about the location of aid workers as a result of this. But even so, there are still a lot of very serious questions to be asked by the U.S. government and the format for those questions going on right now will be that conversation happening between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where I'm told themes will be anger and accountability. And on a leader to leader level conversation, some of those very serious concerns are going to be presented to Bibi Netanyahu. Now, as far as the policies that the administration is pursuing toward Israel, the sharp rhetoric that we've seen coming out of the administration this week, both privately and publicly, now appears increasingly divorced from what the administration's stated policy on Israel is. The White House was asked repeatedly in recent days whether there would be consequences for Israel and conditions placed on military aid as a result of these strikes on civilians.

We have seen not only the U.K. becoming increasingly willing to speak up, but others as well, whether that will translate to action on the part of the United States. Again, I think we need to be very skeptical until we see any evidence that is the case. As we speak, we understand the United States continues to move forward on arms sales. I know that it continues to authorize arms transfers to Israel on a daily basis and is preparing to notify Congress of a very large multibillion dollar fighter jet sale to Israel. So will that go ahead? We will see.

And yesterday it was reported there is an internal cable in the State Department that says so.

Prosecutors insist that legal premise is wrong, and a jury instruction that reflects that premise would distort the trial.

Now, the secretary general, as he typically does, didn't again get into details, said look, you've been briefed by someone, but not briefed by me. But what he wanted to achieve and what NATO was trying to achieve here is this financial commitment that allows Ukraine to plan for the coming years of the war.

And for defense providers manufacturers throughout Europe and the United States, to know that there's long-term commitment for them to produce the armaments.

We haven't seen anything like this since Greenspan, who is being called the maestro in the mid-1990s. But it's still very tricky to bring it that last mile down to 2 percent.They're worried that if they sit for too long with high interest rate, they could get a recession, then suddenly is not the maestro. And on the other hand, nobody quite knows what's going on. I think it's like a little bit longer concern that that's not just the overnight interest rate but mortgage rates and 10-year rates that have inflation built in to them. And I think those aren't going to come down as much. That people will see somewhat higher inflation expectations, higher so-called real interest rates, even allowing for inflation. So even if they bring inflation in the short run down to 2 percent and even if they bring interest rates down -- short-term interest rates down to say 3.5 percent, the mortgage rates are going to stay high.
