      "sentences": "There's two real primary reasons why this is one of the early post \"State of the Union\" travel destinations for the president. The message and the foils, to some degree the foils. The message you saw it live and in person and the exchange that the president had back and forth with Republicans off script on the issues of Medicare and Social Security.You talk to White House advisers, they make clear there are no two issues that pop more in their polling than defending Medicare and Social Security. No state where that is more important given the scale of the population that's over the age of 65 and the state with two politicians that represent the contrast that the Biden administration, the president personally, wants to detail then Ron DeSantis, the governor, and Rick Scott the senator from Florida who he was citing in that speech. As one White House official pointed to me, we want this fight, we relish this fight. That fight is certainly going to be brought to the table by the president as you saw in the \"State of the Union,\" as you saw in Wisconsin. But keep something in mind here, take a look at the travel of the vice president and the president in these first two days. And one state is not like the other. The president going to Wisconsin, then Florida, the vice president going to Georgia and then Minnesota. Three of those four states are critical to any electoral path for the president in 2024. Florida is not one of them and White House officials are candid when they say they are not expecting it to swing dramatic dramatically back toward Democrats given the way it's gone over the course of the last couple of cycles. But they know that this is a perfect place to lay out that message on Social Security and Medicare and to have foils. As one White House official pointed to me, we like foils, there are no better foils in politics than Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott. Again, when you talk to White House officials, they make clear Florida is not necessarily a political winner for them, but on the message and they actual politicians they believe it is. That's why he is going down there. When you talk to them about what happened last night, the back and forth with Republicans, as one official put it to me, we didn't plan for that, but Republicans walked right into the trap. Chaos and extremes. I asked if that is how they viewed DeSantis and Senator Scott, and they said the most chaos, the most extreme. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But I think the question is also why now, right. There's a lot of concern in Ukraine that Russia could be preparing, regrouping for some kind of spring offensive. We're seeing reports coming out of places like Kharkiv and Sumy in the north along the Russian border, of taking shelling. Officials in the Luhansk, in Donetsk region, in the Donbas, have reported accumulation of Russian troops, that they might be stockpiling weapons in the area. So, there's concerns that we're getting closer to something like that happening. And look, fighter jets would not be for a blitz, they would be part of a sort of the broader arsenal that could help Ukraine push forward and with this they could help with air defense. They could help hit the targets behind enemy lines. We know that Russia has been using its own planes over Ukraine so they could potentially attack Russian planes as well. So, it's not a silver bullet but it would certainly help. And would certainly help Ukraine modernize its military, moving away from Soviet era weapons. But I think all of this is about trying to get ahead of some kind of new offensive from Russia. And about not only defending their lines but also trying to push Russia out of the country.",
