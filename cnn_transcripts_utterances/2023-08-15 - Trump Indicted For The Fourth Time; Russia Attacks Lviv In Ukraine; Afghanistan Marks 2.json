Tonight, theclock is ticking for Donald Trump to turn himself in after he is indicted for the fourth time. We'll look at why these charges are so significant. Then Russia launches a fierce attack on Lviv miles from the frontlines. We're live in Dnipro. Plus, two years on from the Taliban's return to power, Afghan women fear they're being erased from society. We have a special report just ahead. Now, it's been the most sweeping indictment yet against Donald Trump, and could lead to a televised trial allowing the public to watch a former president answer to charges he tried to overthrow the very democracy he's campaigning to lead once again. Republican frontrunner has until next Friday to surrender in the state of Georgia. The grand jury there indicted him and 18 other defendants using a statue traditionally targeting mobsters to charge them with criminal racketeering. They're accused of scheming to overturn Trump's election loss to Joe Biden in 2020. And you may know already that Trump has been indicted in three other times, in three other jurisdictions. But there are critical differences in this case that we will unpack for you this hour. Trump is already vowing to fight the Fulton County Georgia indictment, saying he will hold a major news conference on Monday. So, let's begin with CNN's Zachary Cohen, he's outside the courthouse in Atlanta this hour. So, Zachary, Donald Trump now has ten days to turn himself in to face these accusations. Just walk us through here, what is going to come next, and if we expect the former president to cooperate. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants all given ten days to voluntarily surrender here in this court case. You know, found -- they're facing criminal charges related to this effort to overturn the 2020 election. And you know, we do at this time sort of say, we do expect Donald Trump to personally and physically surrender here in Fulton County, we should see him in person. Now, that process might play out a little bit differently than what we've seen in previous indictments of former President Donald Trump, where he appeared, he surrendered on the same day as he appeared in court. It's a little bit different here in Georgia where that court date will be set by the judge. So, we could see Donald Trump surrender, and then a judge set a court date a few weeks or even months in the future. So, it's going to remain to be seen how that will play out, how long before we see Donald Trump in court again. But we are expecting to see him turn himself in voluntarily within the next ten days.",

The District Attorney Fani Willis says she wants thetrial to begin within the next six months, but it will be up to a judge to actually set that date. Now, let's talk more about the next steps in this case. We're joined by CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams. Elliot, thank you so much for joining us in what has been an explosive 24 hours. And Elliot, I want to say off the top here that for international viewers, you know, it has been quite hard for us to follow the details of the various indictment cases we've already seen. But I think in this case, the thing that really stands out, that is really surreal, frankly, for viewers, is that the laws being used in this case were designed to bring down mafia bosses, mob bosses essentially. So, that's kind of where I want to begin with you, because we know that Fani Willis has had experience bringing RICO with these racketeering charges. So, just explain to our viewers what RICO is as a legal concept, and the legal jeopardy it brings for Donald Trump in particular.",

Also evidence that applies to Donald Trump also likely applies equally to Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows because they were probably in the same room at the same time in the same meeting, same phone calls, same conversations and so on. None of it bodes well. You know, we shouldn't overvalue Rudy Giuliani or Mark Meadows' relationships with the former president.

It's convoluted, it's confusing, but it's going to require litigation to sort out what could actually happen. And so, it -- we're well aware of the former president's long history of attempting to delay and slowdown criminal cases. He's done it in other circumstances. But he actually might have a point here.

Now, most -- some of the defendants may not still be around by the time it gets to trial, some may decide to plead guilty or some may decide to provide testimony or evidence elsewhere. But the idea that you could bring a 19-defendant case to court in six months is pretty absurd. Now, beyond that, they're going to have to work around the fact that the former president just has other trials. And at some point, the judges overseeing these cases are going to have to put their heads together and try to determine when these trials can happen.

And so much of the damage essentially shattered glass, injuries from 10-year-old to 72-year-olds as a result of the shockwaves that these missiles clearly caused. But it was across Ukraine last night that these blasts were heard. I was awakened at 5 O'clock this morning by some explosions here in Dnipro. And this just part of Russia's nightly barrage, frankly, against Ukrainian, often civilian targets here. We've also obtained some exclusive video footage of one of the attacks which perhaps is fueling some of Russia's desire to wreak some kind of revenge on the Ukrainian civilian population. And that was a July attack on the bridge that runs between occupied Crimea and the Russian mainland, the Kerch Bridge. And Ukrainian security services have told us in rare televised comments how they were behind that attack, and how there may be more to come, really some extraordinary video about how it was carried out by seaborne drone. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over): It's become the most beleaguered symbol of Russian occupation. This weekend, Moscow saying this incident was just a smoke screen foiling a Ukrainian attack on a $4 billion Kerch Bridge. The link between Russia and occupied Crimea that Putin seems to dote on. Now, CNN has obtained exclusive footage heralding a new way of warfare of another earlier devastating Ukrainian seaborne drone strike there in July. From Ukrainian security services, the SBU, who say they did it, and more will follow. This is exactly what the drone pilot saw, thermal imagery, the wall to rippling as up to a ton of explosive approaches. The bridge, the feed then obviously went dead as it hit the concrete. Russian officials say two civilians died in the attack, cameras on the bridge captured the first blast on the road section, the cursor shows the drone moving in, and another on the railway tracks at about the same time. Ukraine has been coy, some officials saying these huge blasts are from, quote, \"unidentified floating objects\". But no longer, the head of the Ukrainian security services told CNN, this is just the start. VASYL MALIUK, HEAD, SECURITY SERVICE OF UKRAINE (through translator): Sea surface drones are unique inventions of the security service of Ukraine. None of the private companies are involved.

Polandis a growing power within NATO, and its show of force comes as tensions rise on the border with Russian ally Belarus. Well, Michal Sznajder from Polish news channel TV, \"TVN24\" joins me now live from Warsaw. Michal, as I said, this is the largest military parade in decades for Poland. What message is Warsaw looking to send here? Not just to Russia, to Belarus, but also to its own people about its commitment to their security? MICHAL SZNAJDER, SENIOR ANCHOR &amp; POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, TVN24: Good evening, Christina, thank you very much for this invitation, the possibility to speak with you. I would say that there is a double message intended to -- for two kinds of recipients. As you said, one is for the Polish public, the message being, you are safe, we are taking care of you. We are improving our military. We are modernizing our armed forces, and what happened today was -- well, pretty much unparalleled military parade. These events used to take place every year. They were put on hold for a few years due to the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And today, we saw 2,000 service members attend. We saw 200 items of equipment, we saw 92 aircrafts, and the message was something that the Polish people perhaps wanted or needed to hear, given what's going on in Ukraine, given the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And also, there's -- that message also has an interesting context. We are speaking on the 15th day of August, and that means that exactly in two months, a parliamentary election in Poland will take place. And also, that has its significance because the ruling party, Law and Justice, is being accused of using the military as a political prop, if you will, for the purposes of this political campaign. So, that is one context. And the other context is exactly as you said, is a message being sent to Moscow, to Vladimir Putin, to the Kremlin, but also to Alexander Lukashenko; the Belarusian dictator, the threat coming from Belarus is being considered, well, extremely dangerous right now. We must remember, there are thousands of mercenaries from the Wagner group right now in Belarus. And there is this fear that they might create some sort of provocation, provocations even towards Poland, and that might pose some sort of threat, those might be mercenaries crossing the border towards Poland. That might be some sort of involvement in human trafficking and migrants coming through Belarus to Poland to western Europe, exactly through Poland. And also, the significance today was the fact that was being promoted quite heavily, is that not only is the Polish military, the armed forces getting stronger and larger, but also that Poland has very strong friends, France has -- is a member of the NATO alliance, and also has a strategic partnership with the United States confirmed by the American ambassador to Poland, Mr. Mark Brzezinski, whom I spoke with today in Warsaw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK BRZEZINSKI, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO POLAND: This Polish-American friendship is closer now than ever before, and that's especially because of the extremely significant military collaboration that we do day-in-and-day-out to keep Poland and NATO secure.

We were up in here, the Kula neighborhood, up country from Lahaina where several hundred homes are burned. They say it was the power lines that brought this down. These were still hot well after the fire started they say. And that is a lot of the reason a class action lawsuit has just been filed against Hawaiian Electric over the weekend.

A grand jury in the state of Georgia has voted to indict Trump and more than a dozen others on state criminal charges. Trump is accused of 13 new crimes and is now charged with 91 crimes total, from four indictments. Trump calls the new charges politically inspired. Joining us with more is correspondent Stephen Collinson. Stephen, in a cnn.com article today, you called these Trump indictments astonishing, surreal and a wrecking ball assault on democracy. You go out to, write which I particularly like, that Trump could in 17 months be raising his right hand as the 47th president and swearing to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution he was accused of plotting to shred. For so many people, I think those words reflect the chilling reality in the United States right now. Where does this latest indictment leave the race to the White House in 2024?",

Still the most popular Republican in the United States, with a huge following among conservative voters. And if you look at general elections, anyone who wins that nomination, if Trump goes ahead and does that next year, they have a good chance of becoming president, especially in a country that's split right down the middle. Last time, when President Biden took on Donald Trump for the presidency, the race effectively came down to three states. All of those states, the difference between the two men was about 20,000 votes. You can see, if Trump does win the Republican nomination and he's miles ahead of his rivals right now, all of whom have failed to navigate a way of criticizing the president of his liabilities over his legal problems while avoiding alienating the Republican base that they need to vote for them. So right now, Donald Trump is looking very good. That doesn't mean it's going to stay that way. It's still five months until the first votes are cast in the Republican nominating race. We don't know what impact will have on voters, especially general election voters, if Donald Trump spends most of his time in court next year and not on the campaign trail. He's under enormous criminal pressure with all these indictments. But right now, it looks like he is the man to beat in the Republican race for the White House.",

There will be cameras in the courtroom and, to your point there, I think about swing states. It's going to be seeing Trump repeatedly on trial throughout 2024.

The closure of secondary schools for girls, the forced implementation of the burqa, the restriction on travel without a male chaperone, the banning of women from universities and working at NGOs, including the United Nations.
