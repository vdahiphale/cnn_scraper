But that's the reality for them, living through what is supposed to be a ceasefire.Right now, Medicines Fund here or Doctors Without Borders, telling CNN that at least half of the hospitals in the capital of Khartoum are out of action. They've been bombed or shelled. Doctors, nurses, medical professionals are afraid to go in because it's not safe for them. And the few hospitals that are functioning are getting inundated. At least one hospital alone saw 138 wounded people brought in just one day. So that's the scale of this. And the fact that hospitals are getting targeted not just in the capital and other places. A short while ago Doctors Without Borders tweeted that in their region in the Nyala compound in Darfur, it was raided by armed men and they stole everything, including vehicles and office equipment. And they don't even know the exact scale of what's left there because they still don't have access and it's not safe for them to do so. That is the situation on the ground. We saw, for instance, in one university, the University of Khartoum, there were about 100 students who had been stranded there for four days were finally rescued and evacuated with the help of the Sudanese armed forces. But this conflict is still grinding on, on day five. That is why you see the Japanese saying there will be among the first countries to evacuate the citizens there. There are 60 of them.
