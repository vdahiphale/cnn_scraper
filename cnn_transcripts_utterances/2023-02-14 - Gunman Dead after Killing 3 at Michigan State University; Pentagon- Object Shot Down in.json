It builds up, and usually, there are a set of stressors that occur right before the action. Fired from work. Divorced. Loss of the home. Things like that.

But if we look at what's happened over the last couple shootings, it has been older men, John. Is there something -- am I reading too much into this? MILLER You know, we had an individual who ran over, you know, half a dozen people in New York City, 62 years old yesterday. You had the -- the two shootings in California, one in Northern California and the other at the dance hall, 62 and, I think, 67. But when you see those in the past, generally, it's been workplace violence. It's been something that fit within that age group, because going back to your school shootings, whether it's Columbine or Parkland or Virginia Tech, the list goes on, about half of these are in schools; and 12 percent of them are in places of higher education, as we saw last night. That age usually skews lower. [06:1015] So, it will be a matter of interest to figure out what was this individual's interest.

Everyone got that wrong.So now you have economists who are really digging into these numbers. They're stripping out housing, and they're looking at services, ex (ph), food, fuel and housing for kind of a core, even a super core reading of inflation. And they're hoping that's starting to go down a little bit more and can give us a clue that the worst of inflation is behind us. But Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary, and others have said we can't get too sanguine on the inflation story. We have to be very careful here, because if it rears its ugly head again, it can be very hard to get inflation out of the economy, and it can be damaging. So these numbers are critically important for what the Fed does and also, of course, for our own family budgets.",
