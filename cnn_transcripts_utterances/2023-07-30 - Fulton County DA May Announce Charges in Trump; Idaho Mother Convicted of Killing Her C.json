She was abducted along with her child and this was actually on what they call as the campus of this charity close to Port-au-Prince.Now, they announced this abduction on their website for El Roi. And in a statement, they say that Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. Alix works tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus. Now, U.S. officials say that they are aware of this abduction in a statement to CNN, also said that the State Department and our embassy and consulates abroad have no greater priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. It is interesting here that the U.S. had already asked for all Americans to leave Haiti. They made that call again on Thursday, on the day that this nurse and her child were abducted. But also, they made it seem as if it was much more urgent for Americans to leave. And that is because they also evacuated non- emergency personnel that worked for the U.S. government there from Haiti. Now, this is unfortunately a state of terror that so many Haitians live in day after day. Many people are released sometimes for no reason, sometimes for ransom, but clearly, this is a dangerous situation for this family, the charity at this hour saying that they are asking for everybody's prayers and they are also asking for privacy.

LASSETER:  So, if you have a pregnancy that is unwanted or you have a pregnancy that is, you know, the baby is not going to be able to survive after they're born, that is a lot of pressure and turmoil on the woman to carry that pregnancy. And we see that people who are pregnant with pregnancy complications are at much higher risk for developing mental health disorders. So, you add in the mix of them not being able to make the decision and having to carry the pregnancy, that creates a much higher risk of mental health disorders. And the reason why this is so important to treat and to address is that mental illness and pregnancy and postpartum has huge risks to a developing baby and to a baby who's a newborn. We've seen that increases their risk for having developmental disorders, it increases their risk for behavioral disorders, and it increases the risk in the child having mental health disorders later on in life.

And what steps can and should be taken if that mother is seeing symptoms of postpartum depression and how she can go about finding coverage for mental health.DR. LASSETER:  So, the common symptoms are feeling really down or even really anxious most of the day. So, a lot of times, family members will notice that the mom is just not herself. Maybe she's having crying spells, having trouble sleeping, falling asleep and staying asleep when the baby's asleep at night. Having a lot of feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt. A lot of times these moms will feel like they're a huge burden to their family, so they'll have thoughts that their family would be better off without them. They'll have thoughts of death or harming themselves. And a lot of difficulty bonding or feeling attached to their baby. One of the ways to get help is talking to an OB/GYN or a therapist or mental health provider. And unfortunately, that comes at the issue of a lot of our providers are not trained on how to manage and deal with these mental health disorders. But reaching out to somebody who has contact with the mom is helpful. There's a great organization called Postpartum Support International that helps connect moms with different resources in their state.",

So, let's be real about what we moms are going through after having our babies. Dr. Kristin Lasseter, thank you for this very important conversation. We're back after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
