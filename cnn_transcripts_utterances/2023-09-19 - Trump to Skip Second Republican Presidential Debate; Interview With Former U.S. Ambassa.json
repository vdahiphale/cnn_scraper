This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Just moments ago, President Biden finished his address to the 78th gathering of the United Nations General Assembly. The president said, we are at an inflection point in world history. The key tenets of the United Nations, sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights, they are at risk. And he made the case they are at risk because of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. That would be Russia, nearly 600 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and President Biden said Russia alone is responsible for the war there, Russia alone is responsible for the aggression. And the world, he said, must get together and react accordingly, a very important speech, not just for the world, but also domestically as well, obviously, President Biden very much in the midst of a reelection campaign, implications both here and abroad. A lot to discuss. Here with me now, CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. Kayla, a very important speech, a speech the White House had worked on. And I want to start with some sound from the president talking about Russia. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

President Biden began his speech by talking about many of those issues, essentially a nod to those countries' concern saying:  The United States hears you. We care about what your concerns are. And we're focused on continuing to invest in those priorities. But it was the fact that he spent the last call it eight minutes or so of his address talking about Ukraine, talking about the risks to the world order if the Russian aggression in Ukraine is allowed to continue unchecked that tells you that the president wanted the audience to take away a lasting impression about the importance there. Zelenskyy will be giving his own address later today. You can expect yet another impassioned plea to the United Nations General Assembly and specifically to the Security Council, where there have been questions about whether President Biden and Zelenskyy would have a meeting of the Security Council, but none of the other permanent members are in attendance, which really presents a problem here, when they're trying to generate support. But the administration says that it's still important. It's an essential forum, and that the president was coming here to show that he cares and showing up is half, if not more of the battle.",

We knew that democratic values would figure in this speech. Administration officials had suggested that they would, especially because there's been this bigger theme of democracy versus authoritarianism for the duration of Biden's presidency. But it comes on the heels last night where President Biden was speaking to donors here in New York City. And he once again made the point for the first time in several months that it is President Trump here in the United States that presents a threat to democracy and saying that, in 2024, democracy is again on the ballot. Reporters who were in the room suggested that this is Biden road- testing a new message, trying to sharpen that message as he prepares to go out and deliver stump speeches and rally voter support in the next few months. But, certainly, he's trying to take direct aim at the former president on that front, even as he's largely here in New York to address the world stage.",

And he talked about them in the beginning of his speech, expanding theSecurity Council. These are countries that arguably have left out -- been left out, and that's what he said. So what he's making the argument about, that quote that really stuck with me is, if we allow Ukraine to be carved up, what -- is any nation safe? And I think that's a really compelling point that hasn't really been very successful. And one of the reasons it hasn't been successful is because Vladimir Putin right now is positioning Russia as the friend of the developing world. This is a huge narrative that Russia is pounding right now in its relations with Russia and other -- with Africa and other countries. So I think Biden is saying, look, if it happened to Ukraine, it can happen to you. And I think that could be a powerful way of broadening support for Ukraine at the United Nations.",

And the leaders in the Global South need to understand that. So, the president was making the pitch for the rules-based international order, which has underscored relative stability and prosperity over the past 70 years. In 1950, 70 percent of the world's population lived in absolute poverty. Because of the absence of major war, today, that number is under 10 percent. People need to understand the relationship between these rules and the benefits they enjoy.",

I think a lot of these -- as the ambassador is indicating, a lot of these institutions that came about after the end of World War II are really, let's say, being perceived as not being effective and not giving an answer to countries that want to get into the door. They want power, to Brazil, India. All of these want more power than they have and influence. And that is right. So I think Biden is talking about that. But what we have right now is a lack of faith in international institutions, most of which were started by the United States after World War II. So, Biden really has to repair the belief, bring back the belief and include more people in these institutions, so they can do something.

I think, if the president laid out in a very clear fashion how American interests are at stake in Russia's war on Ukraine, he would rally support, greater support at home, including among Republicans. The points he made today to the U.N. audience about the international order are fine, but what Americans need to hear, if Putin wins in Ukraine, he's coming for our NATO allies, and we're going to have to spend more money to defeat Putin and American lives will be at stake.

However, CNN reporters in the courtroom say that the judge seemed skeptical of Clark's argument. That same judge has already denied a similar request from Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Clark is one of Trump's 18 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case and one of five who have requested to have their cases moved to federal court.
