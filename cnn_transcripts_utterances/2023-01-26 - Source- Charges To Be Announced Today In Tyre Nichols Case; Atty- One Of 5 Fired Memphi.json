A source now telling CNN, criminal charges are coming this afternoon in Memphis in connection to the beating of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols. And we also are told to expect tomorrow the release of the video of that police encounter, and we are told that is three minutes of Savitri (Ph). Memphis police officers brutalizing Nichols, right now that city fed up.(Video Inaudible) Plus, a new temperature check of the U.S. economy today. New data does give President Biden reason to brag, the economy growing faster than expected. It is more proof a recession is not inevitable, but it also comes as some big-name companies slash thousands of jobs and releasing right now some brand-new CNN poll numbers. Here's what they show. You think leaders in Washington, especially House Republicans are out of touch with what you think your government should be doing and doing first. Up first for us though, word charges are coming today in Memphis. A source close to the investigation of a horrific police beating, telling CNN the Shelby County District Attorney one-ounce charges in the Tyre Nichols case. We expect that update this afternoon. Three o'clock here in the east, 2pm local time in Memphis. And it follows the Memphis police chief pleading, pleading for her city. Please remain calm. Please state non-violent. As that department, her department prepares to release video of this police encounter. Those who have seen it, say prepare to be furious. Second, sad and worse. Nichols 29, died two weeks ago after that confrontation with five Memphis officers. The officers involved have since been fired. Prosecutors now determining if they should be indicted. That incident also under federal investigation, and the video from police and perhaps from witnesses as well is coming, a source also telling CNN tomorrow Friday after today's announcement from the district attorney. What it shows, according to the police chief, is a blatant disregard of human rights, a blatant disregard of decency. Her offices doing the opposite of their oath. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, as Elliot notes, you have to protect a prosecution. You cannot put everything out there in the public. And there's tension often between transparency and trying to build your case.But we've had this conversation several times about your view, especially after what the country has been through the last several years. Have these officers received the right de-escalation training? You know, what other training and sensitivity classes have they been to? In this case, this is a special crime unit. So perhaps, the suspect was real, the now the deceased was recklessly driving, perhaps he was known to them, that does not justify what those who have seen the video say, we are going to see in the next few hours in any case.

Law enforcement is working with the prosecutor. And the prosecutor is saying, hey, let's just team up in part on how we release information. Some of the information I want to have and be able to dissect, and I will release it maybe during the press conference and at the appropriate time. And I think that's what we'll see today. So, I will agree, there's some things that need to be said. But it's probably more appropriate for those things to be said by the prosecutor. So, it does not impact the case. And hopefully, we'll hear those today. But training is going to really be important to the training they've had, the history they've had.

That right there is basis for a federal civil rights charge.

I do think that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is involved, the federal investigators are involved.And so, there are some outside entities.

For a while that word was recession, now though it's resilient. These GDP numbers look surprisingly strong.And when you dig in, there are some good elements here really across the board, consumer spending, business spending slowed, stayed positive, government spending helped too, the only blemish was housing, but that's no surprise, that's because mortgage rates have spiked. We also got this good news on the jobs front, despite layoffs that we keep hearing about initial jobless claims are at the lowest level since April. They're actually lower than they were a year ago. Now this does not mean the economy is out of the woods. Some economists do still worry about a recession. But I talked to the chief economist over Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius. And he told me that he thinks a soft landing is not just possible, it is likely at this point. In fact, Hatzius has said that he thinks that this economic expansion could last through the 2024 election.

I think White House officials have viewed the proposals Republicans have put on the table, not just kind of what a mess and circus it looked like on the floor just to get their leadership in place. But the actual tangible policy proposals that have been put on the table to some degree has been like Christmas gifts for them.On a day-to-day basis, in terms of whether it's a national sales tax proposal or whether some Republicans want to go after entitlement programs. Every single day, they feel like they've got something to talk about elevate in the polls very poorly for Republicans, very well for them, and that the president will certainly be highlighting that as well. But I also think it underscores why White House officials before all of the classified documents, information came out and that became a huge part of their every day. We're so confident at how they were standing at this very kind of first quarter of this year. I hadn't talked to officials that it felt better about where they'd been in their first two years.

You know, Republicans, it's separate. We'll talk about spending later. This is about paying bills. A lot of the debt was racked up in the Trump years. Sorry, this is your responsibility.But as Matt just noted, if economists are starting to believe maybe the growth continues through 2024, and you're Joe Biden, you want to be running for reelection. Isn't there at least a little voice in your head saying, try to give the Republicans - see if the Republicans will take a little, give it to them to avoid the possibility of a crisis? Because, yes, people might blame the Republicans now, but if the economy tanks, you're running for reelection in that economy. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: Potentially, I mean, a lot of the economists that I've talked to, whether they are, you know, with the U.S. Chamber, or they're more democratic economists say, that Republicans should not be trying to get concessions and trying to negotiate around the debt limit and should simply pass it, and then the negotiation should happen later. I think that's the vast majority of economists right now. Because, again, to your note, John, a lot of them have seen where in the past, it wasn't always this partisan brinksmanship that was occurring and Republicans did vote, a good amount of Republicans voted at least three times under former President Trump to increase the debt limit, without any types of concessions. So, the White House so right now, you know, the president is meeting with congressional leaders, is holding meetings and conversations with Kevin McCarthy.
