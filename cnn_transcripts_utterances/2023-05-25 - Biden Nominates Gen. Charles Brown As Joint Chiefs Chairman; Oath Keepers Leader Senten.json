He would be, following Senate confirmation, the most senior-ranking U.S. military officer.General Brown comes from the Air Force's most recently served as head of the Pacific Air Command leading the Indo-Pacific -- the air component of the Indo-Pacific forces in the course at a crucial time between U.S. relations tensions with China. He replaces -- would replace General Mark Milley, who served since 2019 under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Of course, at crucial times the wind down of the war in Afghanistan and the wind up of U.S. military support for Ukraine in the ongoing war against Russia following the Russian invasion. Of course, the other point here is that with his nomination, this would be the first time in U.S. history that both the civilian head of the military that being Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, and the military had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles brown here would be African American. CNN's Oren Liebermann, of course, covers the Pentagon. He joins us here now. An important moment, most-senior uniformed military leaders in the U.S. particularly notable, given that component of the history, the first time you'll have African Americans, leading both the civilian and uniformed side of the U.S. military.",

      "sentences": "Jim, you're absolutely right. That would certainly mark a milestone if confirmed. That would mean the Pentagon's top two leaders as you point out Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Charles Q. Brown, more commonly known either as CQ Brown or even just CQ would both be African American men.Now, Brown himself has already made history. He was the first black Service chief in U.S. history when he became chief of the Air Force in 2020. So, making history is something we have seen General Brown do already. Now, this nomination was widely expected. Barbara Starr and I would sit here in this booth and talk about it. We've expected this for more than a year wondering when it would come. Well, we just got our answer from President Joe Biden who stood there and announced that it would be General CQ Brown, who would be the next choice for the -- for the top U.S. military officer to replace General Mark Milley, who, as you point out, was nominated by Trump and is served under the former administration. And this one, of course, coming in at a very critical, crucial, and even complex time with the war going on in Ukraine as well as the challenge of facing China. It is worth pointing out that Brown, who is normally very reserved is known and made news himself just days before his confirmation vote to be chief of the Air Force. This is in the summer of 2020, when there were race protests across the United States after the killing of George Floyd and other African American men at the hands of police, Brown at that point decided he had to say something. A frank assessment of what he's been through, but also a positive look forward. Here is part of what he said in uniform when he was the commander of the Pacific Air Forces. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. CHARLES Q. BROWN, CHIEF OF STAFF, U.S. AIR FORCE: I'm thinking about the pressure I felt to perform error-free, especially for supervisors I perceive had expected less from me as an African American. I think about having to represent by working twice as hard to prove their expectations and perceptions of African Americans were invalid. I'm thinking about how I can make improvements, personally, professionally, and institutionally, so that all enamored both today and tomorrow, appreciate the value of diversity and conserve an environment where they can reach their full potential.

They said -- and they showed evidence of the amount of coordination that they say Stewart Rhoads and some of these other members went through before January six.There was efforts to do some training -- military-style training, militia-style training in North Carolina, for instance. So, they stockpiled weapons in a van in Northern Virginia with the idea that you know, if and when the former president, President Trump at the time, were to declare and invoke the Insurrection Act that they could be the foot soldiers. They would be the militia that would cross over into Washington and help him keep power. Even after the dust had settled on January six, even after it was clear that Donald Trump would be leaving, they vowed to keep fighting on. They vowed to keep -- to prevent the former the -- new president, their lawfully elected president, Joe Biden, from being able to take offense. So, those are the things that prosecutors were successful in playing for the jurors showing them photographs, showing them some of the messages that were being exchanged that persuaded that jury to come back with the -- with the extraordinary thing, which is to convict these people on seditious conspiracy, essentially trying to overthrow the U.S. government, and why you see this very stiff sentence today from this judge, 18 years, the longest that has been given to anybody in these -- in these cases related to January six.",

They stockpiled weapons and ammunition in preparation for that day. There was a great deal of organization and effort facilitated by Stewart Rhodes as the leader of the Oath Keepers. And obviously, we saw the violence that played out that day.

You know if the former president was to admit that it was, in fact, a free and fair election, then he would also, you know, in turn, be admitting some degree of culpability for the violence that took place that day. January 6 -- Stewart Rhodes, I think, is he is looking for a pardon.

Negotiators for President Biden and Speaker McCarthy have about a week to come to some kind of agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default and all the economic consequences. But logistics and politics, imagine that, standing in the way.Some hard-right members on the Republican side have just signaled they will not back any compromises. 35 of them sent a list of new demands to Speaker McCarthy, things outside the budget process. And the House is in recess starting today. Plus, even if they do hash out a deal, the bill would require three days of review, put it all together, and that's why the Fitch Ratings agency has warned a U.S. credit downgrade could already be on the horizon. All right, CNN's Manu Raju, he's been tracking all these developments on the Hill. And I wonder, I spoke with Shane Harris and Rohit Kumar just few minutes ago and they said the idea that you now have these hard-right Republicans putting out this plan might actually be a good thing. I don't know if this is -- this is finding a silver lining here and that you know the hard-right -- hard-left go into their camps and then the middle comes to some sort of deal.

Do you think especially considering what you're hearing now, about this group of Republicans now asking negotiating in public wanting some new things in this negotiation? Are these economists being overly optimistic, Catherine?CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I worry that they are. Look, I do very much hope that we will avoid a default. I hope that there will be a resolution before the so-called X-date around which there's great uncertainty about when it actually falls. But it's very hard for me to see a pathway to that resolution. People keep assuming that just because we've resolved this issue in the past before, after some brinksmanship, you know, always at the 11th hour, whether in 2011 or 2013 or in previous episodes. There has been an agreement struck at the very last minute that that will happen again today. And I hope it does. The problem is the dynamics are very different this time. McCarthy does not control his caucus, as you just reported. Members of the Freedom Caucus, in particular, are making even more demands, even though there are -- there's significant distance between where the Democrats and the Republicans already were. And I don't know that McCarthy could deliver the votes, even if Biden paid off all of the ramsons that they are demanding. So, look. I really hope we avoid financial Armageddon.
