This is the first time we've heard from President EmmanuelMacron addressing the nation since that controversial and deeply unpopular legislation, raising the pension age from 62 to 64 was signed into law by the president over the weekend. And of course, we have heard those calls already from the unions for further demonstrations to take place, and you heard there from President Emmanuel Macron, saying that he regrets that a compromise wasn't able to be reached by the two parties. We have seen attempts in the past by the government and the unions to reach some sort of agreement around these talks. And in fact, President Emmanuel Macron invited the unions for talks tomorrow, those haven't gone anywhere thus far because we've heard from the unions already rejecting that invitation. In fact, one of the largest unions in France has already called for some protests, for further strikes this Thursday as we have seen over the last 12 weeks, and also for historic strikes, for historic protests to take place on May 1st, which is traditionally Labor Day here in France. We would typically see people taking to the streets on May 1st, but this is set to be an even larger scale protests in response to these pension reforms. And you heard there from Macron, acknowledging that this is a difficult situation that France has faced difficulty in the last few weeks over labor, over wages, over working conditions, and these are huge concerns still for the unions. I know you will stay on top of this for us. Nada Bashir for us in Paris, thanks very much Nada, appreciate it. I want to turn now to Sudan where deadly fighting between rival military groups is raging for the third day. These are the scenes on the streets of major cities. Have a look.

One point, there was even the sound of an explosion in the background, and clearly a full scale attack. Full scale fighting around the army headquarters was continuing and intensifying. But to your point of what is the way forward here? General Burhan was in great pains when I asked him, of course, this is the question -- so many Sudanese are troubled by. He said that he is committed to returning to the political process. He said that he believes that Commander Dagalo is currently a fugitive of the state, has mutinied against the official offices that he was asked with as an auxiliary forces, a paramilitary force to the army. What complicates that, of course, is that they were in partnership in the October 2021 coup that subverted Sudan's democratic process. And I actually pushed him on that. I said to him, how can the Sudanese people trust you? You were the one who went into partnership. You were the one who still birthed the democratic process, and he sent his apologies to the people of Sudan. He said he feels that now, he is even more committed.

What we heard in the last 20 minutes or so, was President Macron defending those pension reforms, of course, in a very unpopular bill was signed into law, if you remember on Saturday, but he was defending his reforms from raising the pension age or time and age in France from 62 to 64. He said it was necessary to guarantee everyone's pension as well as for the economy, and to produce more wealth for our nation, he said that in the last 20 minutes. But as you can see, unions aren't at all happy with what he had to say or in fact -- or indeed, the fact that the reform has been signed. The text has been signed into law. He talked about the anger that is being felt across the street for the last 13 weeks of protests by union. Says -- he said it's an anger that was expressed, anger at work that for too many people, of French people doesn't allow them to live.

These dramatic scenes of a cold blooded assassination in India's Uttar Pradesh state were broadcast live on television. It all went down within minutes. A former Indian lawmaker Atique Ahmed convicted of kidnapping, and his brother stepped out from the back of a police car. Police believe both men were part of a local organized crime ring. Handcuffed and flanked by policemen, Ahmed was being escorted to a hospital when approached by reporters. The attackers were hiding among the TV crews. Ahmed paired questions from the journalists. His response brief and dismissive. Seconds later, the first gunshot went off knocking(ph) Ahmed to the ground, and then more gunshots over a dozen killing him and his brother. Facing heavy criticism from opposition leaders, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath; a Hindu nationalist ordered a probe into the killings amid the media glare, Ahmed was laid to rest Sunday.

Authorities are not releasing that at the moment.And so that's why a lot of people are pointing to this racial factor of a white man who shoots a teenager, a black teenager here. He was held for less than two hours and then he was released. So, he has not been charged yet. And authorities say they need more time, they need more evidence, they need to talk to Ralph before they make a decision on the charges here. That is why this man is free at the moment. There is also this component of the Stand Your Ground law that is currently in place in Missouri and the law in that state essentially says that you're allowed to use force if a person reasonably believes that they should use that force. So, the keyword there being reasonable. And so later on, that's what investigators and really prosecutors are going to have to look at to decide whether or not this man is going to be charged. But at the moment, he is free, Isa.",

But the family has also said, look, yes, he's doing well physically, but this is a long road ahead for him in terms of his emotional and mental health and healing process. So, they are concerned and they are demanding answers from authorities.

It's a moment that was caught on camera and posted on social media. The video shows a member of the security detail kicking away a pipe bomb that appears to have been thrown in the Prime Minister's direction. That officer then uses a protective board to shield Kishida as he's rushed away from the scene. And then moments later, the sound of an explosion. Over the weekend, police raided the home of the 24-year-old suspect. They removed several items including a computer, a mobile phone, tools, and what appears to be gunpowder, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said.
