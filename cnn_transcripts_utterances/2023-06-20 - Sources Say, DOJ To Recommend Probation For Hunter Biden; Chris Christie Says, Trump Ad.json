We do begin with the legal ramifications for Hunter Biden after his newly announced plea agreement with the Justice Department and the political implications for his father, the president. Our correspondents are all standing by at the White House and on Capitol Hill. First, let's go to CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what more are we learning about this deal on the tax and run gun-related charges?",

Now, he did eventually pay those taxes and we've learned Justice Department is expected to recommend that he be sentenced to probation. And if Hunter can comply with certain requirements set forth by the court, he will also avoid being charged for failing to disclose his addiction when purchasing a gun.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REID (voice over): President Biden's son, Hunter, reaches an agreement with the Justice Department to resolve a long-running criminal investigation. According to a letter filed Tuesday by federal prosecutors, Hunter will plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and struck a deal to resolve a separate felony gun charge if he complies with his end of the plea agreement. According to court documents, Biden owed at least $100,000 in federal taxes for 2017 and at least $100,000 for 2018 but did not pay the IRS by the deadline. His lawyers say he eventually paid the tax bill, along with fees and penalties. As part of this deal, the Justice Department has agreed to recommend a sentence of probation for the tax charges, according to sources, but the final punishment will be up to the judge. On the gun charge, prosecutors allege he possessed a gun despite his addiction, in violation of federal law. Biden's lawyers met with the Justice Department in April and sources tell CNN that negotiations to resolve the case have ramped up in recent weeks. The deal comes after a broad years-long investigation that also looked at Hunter Biden's foreign deals and possible money laundering. On Capitol Hill, Republicans have been focused on the president's son and his foreign business dealings. But prosecutors haven't charged him on those claims. On Tuesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized Hunter's deal. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): It continues to show the two-tiered system in America. If you are the president's leading political opponent, DOJ tries to literally put you in jail, give you prison time. If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal.",

I'm told by multiple people familiar with the matter that the president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, top White House officials maintained close contact with Hunter Biden's legal team. Now, they did not direct or advise their legal strategy, but, certainly, unlike other investigations, other prosecutorial decisions by the Justice Department, this is a White House that was not caught off guard by this, that was in close touch with Hunter's legal team. At the same time, this is also a White House that has maintained the Justice Department is independent, did not interfere in this investigation that was carried out by a Trump-appointed attorney. And so, ultimately, President Biden knowing that this, even as it impacts his son, it will impact him on the campaign trail going forward. We have seen Republicans already seizing on these allegations, and they can expect that that will continue even as this legal matter concludes for Hunter Biden. Alex?",

He's going to keep his only surviving son close.On the other hand, I mean, I think that there are two main questions. One, whatever happens on Capitol Hill, are they going to be able to establish some kind of connection between any unethical that might have happened with Hunter and President Biden? I think we don't know that yet. However, there's really no evidence to suggest that they have that proof. And then the second thing is, do voters care whether Hunter Biden is a drug addict, or was a drug addict? Do they care whether all of these salacious pictures are floating around the internet? That part, I think there's some evidence to suggest that voters are not attaching that to President Biden. Back in 2020, those things were out there. They didn't necessarily affect him.

So, Trump is basically saying, yes, I still wanted more time to go through stuff. If that's true, then why did you let your lawyers who are representing him at the time go into this?

(END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUEZ (on camera): So, when Stockton Rush, the individual who is on that Titan capsule, this submersible, was developing it back in 2018, look, this is a very small and serious bunch of people who do this sort of underwater exploration. And the marine technology services sent a letter to Rush when he was developing this Titan capsule they're searching for now, in part, it says that, your representation at a minimum is misleading to the public and breaches an industry-wide professional code of conduct for all endeavor -- we all endeavor to uphold. There was great concern what he was developing with this sub didn't make the standard that the rest of the industry set for themselves and they asked him if they could watch and see what sort of testing he was doing on that sub. It is not clear how that all resolved itself. This is something, a letter that The New York Times found some time ago, but there were concerns raised early on about this Titan capsule, and now there's a massive search under way. There's a Coast Guard ship -- another Coast Guard ship already on the way, the Canadian Coast Guard. This ship may be heading out. And there are three C-17 cargo planes have landed at the airport in St. John's, bringing gear so that they can hopefully, hopefully have a happy ending to this one. Alex?",

And in fact, even in the Republicans' own reports and public documents to this point, they have not connected any of the bank records that they have to President Biden. Nor did the U.S. attorney, Mr. Weiss, connect any of the financial investigation that he conducted of Hunter Biden to President Biden. There's been no implication that President Biden was involved at all in any of the financial dealings they looked at. And, of course, we know that if there were a criminal investigation warranted into the president, that there would have to be a special counsel. And the allegations that Chairman Comer is referencing were considered by the Trump DOJ, and they declined to pursue an investigation into President Biden, determining, as we did in the first impeachment investigation, and as everyone who has looked into them has concluded, that these allegations are bogus and that President Biden has never engaged in any misconduct and has simply executed U.S. foreign policy to the highest standards and integrity.",
