And amid rather grim predictions, it has to be said, for the outlook of the world economy, the World Bank says economic growth could slow for the third straight year. In fact, it forecasts the weakest growth performance of any half decade since the 1990s. Much of the same doom and gloom from an annual survey by the World Economic Forum, which predicts a, and I quote here, \"precarious year\" ahead for the global economy. Well, despite that, my next guest is charting a path for growth for his country and striking deals that allow the UAE to expand its non-oil sector. He's the man who's cutting all the UAE bilateral trade deals. UAE's Minister of State foreign Trade, Thani Al Zeyoudi, joins me here in Davos. Sir, a pretty anemic forecast, it has to be said, from both WEF and the World Bank when it comes to global GDP growth this year. Do you share that gloomy outlook? I mean, certainly, you know, a sluggish global growth story is included in that. You know, and against that backdrop, what's your forecast for the UAE? THANI AL ZEYOUDI, UAE'S MINISTER OF STATE OF FOREIGN TRADE:  Let's see. OK, again. Let's go back a year ago. And that was last year. Everyone was very pessimistic about the global growth, and there will be -- there would be a recession throughout 2023. We ended up the year without recession. So, we're starting the year of 2024 with the same almost this mistake. But no, there will be growth. It won't be as much, but at least we're going go toward the right direction hopefully. For the year, we are we had an excellent year. The growth was excellent. The average growth of our GDP is around 3.4 to 3.8 with a good growth in our non-oil foreign trade. We had a growth as well in our service exports and imports. We had an excellent growth in our talent attraction. So, we ended up the year with an excellent performance in all factors.",

A.I. is controversial, so controversial that the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024 ranks A.I.-derived dis and misinformation ahead of climate change, war, and economic weakness. And that's worrying in a year of what can only be described as fraught elections. Some more than 60 elections this year all over the world. A.I. tech company, G42, controlled by the UAE's ruling family, has made some waves in Washington over reports of alleged ties to Beijing. The tech giant has been furiously denying any links with the Chinese government. My next guest is the head of G42, Peng Xiao. Welcome to \"Connect the World\" at Davos. Before we talk about G42, the U.S., the U.S. and its concerns about your ties -- your alleged ties with China and the sort of, you know, U.S. China A.I. arms race, as it were, I just want to get your sense of where we are at with A.I. Every investor note that I have read looking into 2024 and beyond has got A.I. or A.I. applications across sectors at the top of the investor note. This absolutely red hot at present. I know this your first time to Davos. What have you seen here? And tell us where are the opportunities and where are the challenges? PENG XIAO, CEO, G24:  Well, Becky, first, thank you for this opportunity to be here. My road to Davos started a few months ago in the UAE, during COP28 in Dubai, I met many global leaders. Just like this event here, in COP28, the topic was A.I. I remember a conversation with a group of global leaders. We talked about A.I. being the single most important human invention since our discovery and master of fire. And with that, it is true, A.I. has great potential for good. But if we don't manage it properly, out of control, it can do great damage as well. So, yesterday, my first session here in Davos, I was at this wonderful forum called A.I. House Davos. One of my co-panelists, my good friend, Bill Ford, from General Atlantic, on stage. He talked about, as an investor, how they are looking at A.I. In fact, not just looking. They are now a practitioner in the air domain. He taught the whole audience in his I.C., the Investment Committee, there is a new A.I. board members, helping to go through decades of the data of all the company he's evaluating and making decision in real-time together with his I.C.",

I hope they get all the facts straight, andwe're opening a dialogue to have a conversation with them. But I can tell you, UAE is not in a race vis-a-vis with anyone. UAE is on its own path. UAE is racing ahead in the world of A.I. I think for two major reasons. Number one, it's a country with limited human resources. It's a small population. We can't rely on humans to do everything for us. That's why, as early as eight, nine years ago, as a nation, we decided we must create our A.I. ministry. We also created MBZ University of Artificial Intelligence, the first one in the world. So, we've been building all this additional source of intelligence and support for our national economy. Second reason is that we are a country historically rooted in fossil fuel. You saw this theme we discussed in COP28. But we also want to celebrate the last barrel of oil. We believe there need to be new resources we can leverage to grow our economy. So, for these two reasons, we are doubling down on the development of A.I.
