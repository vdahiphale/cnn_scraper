And that certainly includes this no limits partnership between Russia and China.And as we have seen some images shortly of Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin shaking hands. This is the third time these two men have met face to face. This time on Russian soil. And the optics of that certainly do say a lot considering all of the other conflicts that are taking part in the world right now. Xi, in his remarks with Putin, talked about this idea of fairness in the global landscape. And that the U.S. is often, has more of a dominant position than perhaps other countries in the global South. It's a theme that we have heard many times from Xi before. Let's listen to more of his remarks from Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator): The world today is facing momentous transformations unseen in a century, resulting in a fast changing and turbulent international landscape. Yet I am confident that the profound and lasting friendship between China and Russia will not change. Nor will our sense of responsibility as major countries for the world and for the people.

Before the summit began, the two nations did reach an agreement over a border, a very contentious border dispute between the two nations.

We were talking yesterday that Putin is using this as a chance to glean legitimacy on the world stage at a time when he's becoming isolated from the West. And I think most in the West see this summit for what it is. However, there are some who take a different view. Let's just have a listen to this soundbite. Do we have that soundbite from Donald Trump? OK, well, we were going to throw to a soundbite there from Donald Trump, essentially praising these world leaders, these autocrats, as we have seen him do many times before, as strong men. I mean, how dangerous is that, you know, in this particular instance? It's not just about the optics, is it? If someone like Donald Trump, potential president, is going to be making those types of comments?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's not clear cut, right? I think on the one hand, the BRICS summit and the timing of it just two weeks before the U.S. election is -- makes this even more of an effective power play for Russia in some ways, because Putin stands there at the center of this global alliance. They are on state TV mocking the West.They had a montage on a very well-watched talk show last night showing, you know, on one side of the split screen, U.S. officials, including Biden, saying, you know, Russia is isolated. On the other hand, they showed the arrivals on the other side of that split screen of Modi, of Xi Jinping, of all the leaders arriving at the BRICS summit. But I think it's not clear cut, right? I think certainly we saw with the first Trump administration that just because he might praise people, call them strong, doesn't mean he's not going to get tough on them. So I mean, we saw with the tariffs on China, sanctions on Russia actually went up during the first Trump administration. But that is the prism through which Russia will be looking at this, right? Their key goal here is one, to erode by any means possible Western support for Ukraine, and two, to sort of work towards a lifting of sanctions eventually. So they will be looking at this and hoping that it fits into a bigger picture of sort of an affinity for Russia and Putin combined with skepticism for supporting Ukraine. And obviously, for Ukraine, looking at this, it is extremely concerning. So I think you have to look at this BRICS summit in the context of the U.S. election and that sort of layer of unpredictability that it has put on everything.",

The trouble is, I think that this British government, the Labour government now and Sir Keir Starmer are really quite worried about what their relationship will be like with a future Trump administration if he were to win.
