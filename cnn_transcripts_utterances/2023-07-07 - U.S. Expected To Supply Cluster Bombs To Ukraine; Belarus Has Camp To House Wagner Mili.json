This is CONNECT THE WORLD.Coming up this hour, the U.S. is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine that includes controversial cluster munitions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy gets ready to meet with Turkish President Erdogan in Istanbul. Japan is set to release treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear site into the Pacific Ocean. And a Hollywood celebrity is suiting up to race at this weekend's British Grand Prix. Welcome to the show. And we begin on news that controversial weapons banned in more than 120 countries could be headed for Ukraine. Today, the Biden administration is expected to announce a new military aid package to Ukraine that will include controversial cluster munitions or cluster bombs. You can see them here. They are canisters filled with smaller bombs that can be dropped from the air and released across a wide area. They also pose a major threat to civilians after the moment of attack because they leave behind unexploded munitions. CNN U.S. national security reporter, Natasha Bertrand, has more from the Pentagon. Natasha, cluster munitions. Controversial. They're banned in many countries as we've just said. It is important to note, however, that both Russia and Ukraine have used cluster bombs since the war began. Why is the U.S. making this decision now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, we're told that this really has to do with the changing conditions on thebattlefield over the last several weeks, specifically the fact that Ukraine's counteroffensive is going more slowly than U.S. and Western officials had anticipated. And the Ukrainians are burning through a large rate of artillery ammunition in a way that the U.S. is not certain will be sustainable in the long term without tapping into that stockpile of cluster munitions that the U.S. has had for many years now. Now this all comes, of course, as the U.S. is trying to figure out how best to support Ukraine throughout the entirety of the war. And the ammunition problem has been a very acute one for the last several months. Ukraine has been asking for the cluster munitions for a while now, saying that they could really make a big difference on the battlefield. But the administration has been reluctant. They did not want to seem out of step with U.S. allies, who of course -- many of whom have banned the use of cluster munitions. Over 100 countries worldwide have. But in the end the U.S. realized that it was not sustainable to keep providing Ukraine with the level of ammunition that it needs without tapping into the stockpiles of these very controversial munitions. Now the U.S. does say that the ones that they are going to provide to Ukraine are not the very old variant that the U.S. has in its stockpiles. The ones that have a higher dud rate and that could perhaps pose a greater risk to civilians, but that the ones that they are looking at providing to the Ukrainians have a dud rate of 2.35 percent or lower. So they are making the argument here that the cluster munitions that the U.S. is preparing to provide to Ukraine won't necessarily be as dangerous as the ones that Ukraine and Russia have already been using on the battlefield. Yesterday, the Pentagon press secretary said that the cluster munitions that the Russians have been using have a dud rate of as high as 40 percent. So the argument they're making is, look, we can help Ukraine make a dent in its counteroffensive into Russians while at the same time making sure that they have enough ammunition to support the war against Russia for the long term -- Eleni.",

You can see it's a vast tent city with all these enormous canvases which we're told can house about 5,000 people. They've been erected in the past few weeks. There were satellite photographs of this place before and after, and we all believed this is the location where Wagner forces, the mercenaries from Russia, would be located if they came to Belarus. That was part of a deal, remember, with the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko inviting Wagner and its leader to come into exile in Belarus as a way of diffusing their military uprising in Russia last month. Well, I mean, at the moment, though, these tents are completely empty. I mean, you have a look inside of one of these here, completely empty, there's nobody in in there. It's too dark for us to show you inside but I can tell you, it's just wooden platforms. Nobody in there at the moment but ultimately it can house as many as 5,000 people. The problem is, is of course the events of yesterday here with the revelations from Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian leader, that actually is that plan is no longer sort of in operation. It's on hold at the moment and at the moment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, is not here in Belarus, he's said to be in Russia, and not a single Wagner soldier has so far come here. And so we don't know whether there is going to be a transfer of Wagner to Belarus or not at the moment, or we can tell you is that it hasn't happened yet. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As a result of the deal that was mediated between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey Ukraine has been able to export about 30 million tons of wheat and other food stuffs. It's considered very important to keep those supplies of grain going to those countries that desperately needed to avoid food shortages. But the problem is, as you mentioned, it's expiring on the 17th of July. The Russians have said they don't want to renew it because they feel that they have not been able to export their grain and other goods as a result of sanctions imposed by Western nations. And certainly, President Erdogan is perhaps an ideal figure to mediate between the Ukrainians and the Russians because he is on good terms with both sides, despite the fact that Turkey is a member of NATO and Turkey has actually supplied Ukraine with a fair amount of weapons since the invasion began last year. Also on the agenda, however, President Zelenskyy will be pressing President Erdogan to drop his objections to Sweden's membership in NATO. Those objections are based upon the Turkish impression that the Swedes are not cracking down on Kurdish militants who are based in Sweden. Kurdish militants who have been fighting for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in Turkey. So there's going to be a lot on the agenda.

For a leader like Gustavo Petro, the bilateral is also an occasion to raise his profile on the international stage.

The water has been treated and diluted to remove radioactive elements. One exception, tritium, a radioactive isotope which the government says is impossible to remove. It's all part of the process to slowly decommission the plant. As you can see on this map, the release of tritium is common for nuclear plants around the world. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission says that the radiation from tritium is far less than what one might assume. It says a cross- country roundtrip flights exposes a person to 12 times more radiation compared to water with tritium from a nuclear plant.

Now I want to make clear that at this point in the process almost all of Donald Trump's legal court challenges to try to overturn the election have mostly failed. And there was a resounding conclusion that there was not any evidence of widespread voter fraud to justify continuing to push those plans forward. But this Oval Office meeting was a moment where, you know, there was a stark divide, a showdown of sorts between White House lawyers and outside advisers to Donald Trump. The advisers wanted Trump to take extreme steps like seizing voting machines, using the military and the Department of Homeland Security to do so, while White House lawyers effectively said you can't do. There is no fraud. That is not a legal thing to do. And so the House January 6th Committee really painted this meeting as a moment where Trump himself made a choice. And he chose to side with those advisers who were really pushing this idea to continue forward and continue trying to challenge and overturn the election.

In between practicesessions a Hollywood A-lister is suiting up to drive the course. Amanda Davies joins me now, who's going to tell me about why we are seeing Brad Pitt on the screen and also at Silverstone Circuit. AMANDA DAVIES, CNN'S WORLD SPORT ANCHOR: Yes. We've been hearing, haven't we, about Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney getting involved in Formula 1 as part ownership of a team. Well, Brad Pitt is getting even closer to the action. Eagle-eyed viewers would spot a new team represented in the pit lane this weekend. And this is a fictional team because Brad Pitt is working with Apple and Formula 1 to create, to make, a new film where Brad Pitt -- his new name is Sunny Haze is coming back. A former driver who has retired, who's deciding to make a return to Formula 1. So he's actually driving a car at Silverstone at the British Grand Prix this weekend. Not a Formula 1 car, I hasten to add. A Formula 2 car which goes a little bit slower. It's got special adaptations but there's a lot of excitement around the paddock about Hollywood being in town. But, Eleni, we're not only building up to the British Grand Prix in \"WORLD SPORT\" in a couple of minutes. We are doing it even more style because we've got an interview with the two-time Formula 1 world champion, the current championship leader Max Verstappen coming your way.",
