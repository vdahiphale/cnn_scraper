I'm Erin Burnett and this is CNN's special coverage of Election Night in America Continued yet again, because we are still on the edge of this cliff.Three days since voters went to the polls, and the suspense is still growing, because votes are coming in. We're getting closer and closer to knowing, but still close to call. And control of the Senate and the house are still both up in the air as I speak. We are watching right now Arizona and Nevada. That is where it's all at. Two key states with margins that are simply so razor thin, we do not yet know who will control the senate. Let's take a look at Arizona. The Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is expanding his lead right now over the Republican Blake Masters. Every new batch of votes that come in, that lead has increased. 24 hours ago, we were just shy of 100,000. Now we're at isn't 115,000 in terms of the margin that Mark Kelly is ahead by. And just a short time ago, Bill Gates, who was the top official for Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona, home of Phoenix, told CNN that they will be releasing more votes in the coming hours. To be specific, 60,000 to 70,000 and they hope to be finished counting in the coming days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL GATES (R), CHAIR, MARICOPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISOR:  We anticipate that will be early next week. Based upon the clip at which we're going again maintaining that focus on accuracy. I would anticipate very early next week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, we are not there yet.Now, let's take a look at Nevada, the other crucial race. The Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto, continues to close the gap with her Republican opponent, Adam Laxalt, although he still ahead by just shy of 9,000 votes and keep again there, it's all about that margin compared to the votes still outstanding and there, according to CNN's estimate, 95,000 votes remain to be uncounted. So you can't call a race like this. We are standing by for new vote totals that could come at any time and change who is in the lead, change these margins. If the two incumbent Senate Democrats, though, in Arizona and Nevada win re-election, Democrats would have a majority in the Senate. That would call the Senate and that would be regardless of happens next month in the Georgia runoff. Meantime, let's take a look over at the House, where obviously it's still too close to call. Democrats still have a path to maintain control, it is a path that has been narrowing more and more. Still exists, though. We have a team of reporters standing by. Gary Tuchman is in Nevada, Kyung Lah is in Arizona, these two crucial states. Let's begin in Arizona, though. The latest numbers do show, Kyung, the lead for Senator Mark Kelly expanding right now. What is the very latest that you know in terms of when new votes are going to come out and how many of those new votes may come out relative to what's still outstanding?",

We will see those numbers tonight. Thirty- four thousand of those ballots may be tabulated today and counted tonight, but if they're not finished, by tomorrow, they expect all 50,000 of those ballots to be counted and we will see those numbers. But, and this is a big but the, in addition, there's another 15,000 votes that are provisional ballots or have to be cured. The deadline is next week for that. So this is a potential of up to 62,000 more votes to be counted. In addition, you are allowed to mail in your ballots, as long as they're postmarked by election day to arrive today and tomorrow. An additional number is 104 ballots, a small number that arrive today. More ballots to arrive tomorrow. So that's the timing. Those are the numbers.

So I look at this graphic here, Erin, as a bit of a viewer's guide, so when we get more vote from Nevada in the system, be looking to see, is Catherine Cortez Masto in that range? Is she getting 52 to 54 percent of that batch out of Clark County? Is she getting that out of Washoe County up in Reno area, when they deliver? Those are two Democratic strongholds.

I count votes and do math. I understand it. Let me give you the scenario. This is why Democrats are optimistic. And you can decide at home if you share their optimism or not. In a minute, we'll get to the unanswered questions that leave me in the \"I don't know\" phase. Why are they optimistic? Here's where we are right now, 48 Republican seats, 49 Democratic seats. These three, Georgia, we have to wait until December, and Nevada and Arizona, which you were discussing earlier in the program. So, why are they optimistic? They look in Arizona and see Senator Kelly with a 100-plus vote lead and they are confident a lot of ballots still to be counted. Democrats are confident that he will hold that lead. So, just for the sake of argument, we don't know that. We'll get to that in a minute. Then you were just having the conversation with a journalist, a very fine journalist in Nevada. At the moment, the Republican candidate Adam Laxalt is ahead there. The take of many on the ground, the assumption is, when they count these ballots, that it will follow 2020 and those mail-in ballots will be mostly Democratic. They believe Senator Cortez Masto can overcome that gap. That's where they base the optimism. If that happens, right, and she does that, where are you? Then Democrats get to 50 and that's all they need, Erin. If those two western states actually fill in blue at the end, Democrats have the Senate and Georgia is then gravy. You're trying to get to 51. If it doesn't happen, and let's say this one stays red in this hypothetical, well, then it all comes down to Georgia. Democrats are voicing that optimism on the fact they think that they're going to pick those both up. We're not there yet. I get their thinking and this scenario that plays out.
