      "sentences": "Developing this morning, we're learning new details of how President Biden plans to kick off the election year. A speech on Saturday near Valley Forge, in the battleground commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Valley Forge is where George Washington and the continental army spent a brutal winter as they fought to throw out the British in the revolution. But, of course, Saturday is also January 6th, the anniversary of the riot at the U.S. Capitol after the 2020 election.With us now is Quentin Fulks, the Biden/Harris deputy campaign manager. Thank you so much for being with us. Why Valley Forge for Saturday? Are you expecting a cold winter? QUENTIN FULKS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN 2024: No. You know, we're expecting a very good winter come next November. But look, we chose Valley Forge, George Washington, as you just said, you know, unionized the colonies there and brought them all together and then he became president and set the precedent for, you know, a peaceful transition of power. Something that Donald Trump and Republicans refused to do as just as late as yesterday. And, you know, we believe that they pose an existential threat to democracy. And over the last four years that threat to democracy has only grown. And our campaign wants to communicate that message to voters that, you know, Donald Trump is telling us every day who he's going to be if he's re-elected president, a dictator on day one, ripping health care away from millions of people. These are threats to democracy, and we feel that the American people deserve to hear these things from us. And it's a more responsibility of this campaign to paint that picture for the American people.",

We should take him at his word.\"\"We should take him at his word.\" The reason I was highlighting those words, because it sounded like something we heard way back in 2016 from Hillary Clinton. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mexican immigrants, rapists and criminals, saying John McCain was not a war hero, being reluctant to denounce the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke. And the list goes on. And so, for me, I think you have to take him at his word at how he's behaved and what he has said. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Americans are waking up every day and they're thinking about how they're going to put food on the table. They're thinking about, you know, all the things that they need to do, how they're going to take care of their kids, the schools that they're going to send their kids to. And while Donald Trump, you know, when he was president, he did everything he could to make those things harder. And so these aren't an either or. They're a both and. We've got to communicate to American voters about what we're doing to make their lives easier, but also remind them, because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have gotten to work and done a lot of the things that they promised to do in 2020 for the American people. But we have to remind them that those things can be taken away by somebody who's already done it before, right? We just came out of a hole. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris got to work bringing this country back from the brink of destruction that Donald Trump left to them. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris got to work in this country bringing back jobs, 14 million. They got to work investing in our schools. They got to work, you know, equalizing the playing field for minorities in this country. And Donald Trump poses a threat to all of that. These aren't just, you know, threats to the grand scheme. I know these sound like big things, freedom and democracy. But, unfortunately, that's where they are. It's across the board. It's from foreign policy to domestic policy. Donald Trump and the Republicans pose a threat to all those things. And so, yes, we do have to remind voters and we are going to remind voters of just that.",

They also revealed that they have found the cockpit voice recorder of the smaller coast guard plane but they're still searching for the black box of that Airbus. And, in fact, the Airbus has sent a team of investigators to assist with the technical operations of locating that cockpit voice recorder and getting that information processed because another key question is going to be, why did none of the three pilots in the cockpit of that Japan Airlines jet not see that there was a smaller plane in their flight path on the runway when the weather conditions were clear and aboard the landing before that collision took place?But we all know, in the seconds that followed, as the plane was slowly becoming -- actually very quickly becoming engulfed in flames and there was black smoke billowing through the cabin, the nine flight attendants in the back performed a pretty heroic effort of getting everybody off, even though passengers say some of the exit doors were not operational. And as this video reveals, there was also no functioning communication system inside the aircraft. So they basically had to use megaphones and shout to get those hundreds of passengers, every single person on the plane, off safely. Take a look. We don't have that video, but you saw it yesterday in our coverage. It was a pretty incredible thing, Rahel, to see those flight attendants basically shouting to people, getting them all off in a matter of seconds. Of course, at least five coast guard crew members died in this accident and there are a lot of questions, key questions being asked right now about how this happened. Where was the mistake made. Was it human error. Was it just a miscommunication. Was the pilot of the coast guard aircraft lost. Is that how he ended up in the middle of the runway. Or was he following orders and just the wrong orders. Those are questions that Japanese investigators intend to have fully answered so that they can do what they can to prevent anything like this from happening again on an airport in Tokyo, in Japan, or anywhere in the world. A lot of crucial lessons learned from this, Rahel.",

Bear in mind, she came into office around the time in which - I should say, after the Hamas attack in Israel and a rise in anti- Semitism and a concern among students and others about the safety and well-being of students on campus. And in the wake of legitimate concerns about anti-Semitism, she finds herself the subject of these unrelenting attacks. So, we start with the conversation about how to protect Jewish students and we end up in a conversation about assault on programs that benefit black and brown people, DEI, affirmative action, and the ousting of the first black president of Harvard.

Let's note, the Harvard corporation, as well as President Gay, both noted in their e-mails, their (INAUDIBLE), about her departure, racial animus. Racial animus is just another word for saying racial hate. When we look at the e-mails that she's been subject to, when we look at the way in which she has been characterized, this is not about plagiarism, it's really about an attack on higher education and an attack on diversity, equity and inclusion. And the reason we note that, and knew that, is because her critics spend more time talking about DEI and affirmative action than they talk about the legitimate concern about anti-Semitism.
