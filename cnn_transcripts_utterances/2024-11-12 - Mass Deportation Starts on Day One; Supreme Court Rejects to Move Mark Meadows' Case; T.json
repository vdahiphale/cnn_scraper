      "sentences": "A top Trump aide says the incoming president is eager to begin mass deportation. Stephen Miller told Fox News they'll begin as soon as the president-elect takes the oath of office. Joining me now is the man who led the fight against then President Trump's family separation policy, Lee Gelernt. He is an attorney with the ACLU and deputy director of its Immigrants' Rights Project.Lee, thank you for joining us. I was just talking with Chad Wolf about all of this your thoughts on what we may be seeing here in the months ahead. LEE GELERNT, ACLU ATTORNEY, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, ACLU IMMIGRANTS' RIGHTS PROJECT AND LED FIGHT AGAINST TRUMP'S FAMILY SEPARATION POLICY:  Yes, thanks for having me. I'm wary about this rhetoric now that we're only going to go after the worst of the worst, that they're only going to go after hardened criminals and national security threats. I mean, that not consistent with what President Trump and his aides have been saying now for many, many months, that it's going to be mass deportation. So, I am worried about. How they're going to go about it, whether they're going to try and use the military, which is flatly illegal in our view, and who's going to be caught up in. And I think your discussion with Chad Wolf really illustrates a critical point. I do not think that the American public, as much as they want reform to the immigration system and border policies, which we also want, and for something like family separation again. I think in the first Trump administration, they thought they dehumanize these people to such an extent that the American public wouldn't push back against something like taking little babies away from their parents. What we saw is people from across the ideological spectrum, conservatives, liberals, Republicans, Democrats all pushing back on it. So, I think if we see some kind of extreme measure like that, the American public will push back. I'm hopeful that they will. Because we are still, as you pointed out in the prior segment, looking at the effects of family separation from the first time around. Not only are there potentially 1,000 families or more still separated, but even those little children who have been reunited are suffering enormously. One little boy we worked with was just reunited, a three-year-old boy. When he got home would stand by the window looking to see if men were going to come and take him away again. Little children going to sleep, worried about men coming to take them out of their bed again. So, what happened in the first administration was horrific.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you're exactly right. I mean, mass deportation does not mean simply going after hardened criminals and national security threats. And maybe they're now trying to hide the ball a little, and they're still going to engage in mass deportations. I mean, I haven't heard the president move off that. So, there may be people out there now trying to soften it. But until we see some kind of softening of it, I think we're preparing for the absolute worst.And we're going to -- it's going to need to be a national effort. I think all civil rights attorneys will tell you that you can do a lot in the courts, but you can't do everything. And I think it's going to require people taking to the streets peacefully to protest, like they did with family separation. It's going to take volunteers. People are going to need individual lawyers. It's going to be a real effort. Because I do think that as much as people are right to ask for immigration reform and we also are calling for that, there needs to be a balance. We can't go over to the point where we don't give anybody asylum in this country where we're starting to separate little children. That's just too much. And I hope that, you know, the rhetoric is not consistent with the policies, but until I see actually the policies, I'm going to have to believe that what President Trump is saying is he's going to do is mass deportations.",

      "sentences": "And, Lee, I mean, Chad was also being a bit evasive about how this volume of people would be managed. He was talking about existing detention and processing facilities and so on. But when you get into the neighborhood of millions of people that is why there was reporting in the run up to the election about deportation camps, that there would be detention -- large detention facilities that are capable of holding hundreds of thousands of people.This is something that the American people have not really seen before. I suppose part of what you might want to see in the incoming administration is there to be a lot of transparency, where the media is allowed to observe a lot of this, where the cameras are rolling. And so, these images, as ugly and ungodly as they may turn out to be, can be beamed out to the rest of the world.",

And once we were able to bring the lawsuit and get the stories out of these little babies and toddlers being ripped away, the American public did push back.So, I think it is absolutely critical that there be transparency. And if the American public really wants military going through the streets looking for immigrants and military camps, then they need to see what it really looks like. And I do not believe that they're going to want that when they see it. But you're 100 percent right, the media need to be allowed in and to show the images.",

One is it says it has to be an invasion and by foreign governments. We don't think that applies to immigration at all. I mean, that may be nice to say, and during the campaign as campaign rhetoric at a rally, but as a legal matter we think that there's no way this law could be stretched for regular deportations. Now, whether they try it is another case, but we are prepared to challenge that in court once we see details.",

And this is complicated because Donald Trump, of course, comes to power in January 20th, but Joe Biden is president until then. So, they need to reach some sort of funding agreement that will avoid a government shutdown, Trump indicating to Johnson, they have not -- you know, Johnson indicating they have not spoken about that yet, but that's going to be a big decision for Donald Trump on how he deals with that in the first days in office, Jim.",

Right now, the judge in the case here at the Athens Clark County courthouse, and both the prosecution and the defense are meeting behind closed doors trying to decide when is this case continued? And yes, it is a very significant development that the prosecution has agreed to a bench trial, especially if we consider that it was going to be tomorrow that they were going to begin jury selection in this case. As you know, and many of our viewers know, that means that now the question of guilt is going to be in the hands of the judge and not in the hands of a jury. And let me tell you this, it may not be a big surprise for many people because the case was not looking very good for the defense. There was a couple of motions earlier this month, November 1st, the defense wanted to throw out a phone evidence and also DNA evidence because they say it was not gathered properly. The judge said no to that. They also wanted to change the venue. They wanted to move the trial out of here in Athens. The judge said no to that. So, it was going to be very difficult for them, especially if they went to trial.Now, a 26-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra is facing 10 counts. Many of them had to do with the death of Laken Riley in February. We're going to wait when they decide to continue this case. Jim, back to you.",
