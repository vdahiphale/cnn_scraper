So, now really the number to beat is the 2.88 million person record set back on Thanksgiving 2019. We will see if we get that high. You know, what is so interesting here is that Memorial Day last year really kicked off this summer of cancellations for the airlines. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, airlines canceled about 55,000 flights. The TSA insists it's ready this time around. The airports insist they're ready this time around. And airlines insist they're ready this time around with right staff, they've added about 48,000 workers. Also, right size, they're operating fewer flights, using larger airplanes.

But I am here with some good news because despite the rising demand, the cost of road trips is actually going down. Drivers are being greeted by cheaper gas prices this year. Much cheaper. The national average according to AAA is $3.57 a gallon. That is down by more than a dollar from the $4.60 years ago. And that is miles away from the record high last June of $5.02 a gallon. GasBuddy says that drivers in all 50 states are seeing lower gas prices. Some of them a lot lower. In California the average is down by $1.31, Alaska, $1.30, New York, New Jersey, Florida, all of them down by more than $1.20 from a year ago. Now, this is all evidence of the cost of living getting better. I mean this inflation crisis isn't quite over, but it is easing. We should note that gas prices were cheaper in 2021 during that Memorial Day weekend. And, of course, in 2020, when Covid was shutting the economy down. Also the reasons for this drop in gas prices, it's not all positive. Some of it is good news like improved supply. But also it's those recession fears that have lowered oil prices. And oil is the main driver of gas prices. Still, people are going to save a lot of money. GasBuddy projects that Americans are going to spend $1.6 billion less on gasoline this Memorial Day weekend than last. And, Rahel, that is undeniably good news.",

He said, this case was about patient privacy and the trust between the doctor and patient that was broken. What if it was your child or your patient or your sibling who was going through a sensitive medical crisis and the doctor who you thought was on your side ran to the press for political reasons. It's not right and the facts we presented today make that clear. And so a victory for the state in this case. She does get a reprimand. She is allowed to continue practicing.

Kyle Mullen died in February of last year hours after he had finished a brutal part of the training course. It's known as \"Hell Week.\" And during the training, he apparently suffered respiratory issues, but that information was not passed on to the Navy's medical staff -- medical clinic, so they concluded that he was not at risk.

With us now is Katie Cherkasky, a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney. If we could put the calendar up so people can see what we're talking about here, the visit from the investigators and prosecutors to pick up the classified documents, to serve the subpoena, which I think you'll be able to see on a calendar here, was June 3rd.

But if there's a question about whether my actions are within the realm of law or not, that's where you're going to have those differentiations.So, it's a very difficult case on a prosecutorial side when you don't have proof -- clear proof of an underlying crime, but it's certainly not an impossible case. And here, because we're talking about a former president, again, I know I keep saying that, but that is nothing that the Supreme Court has ever weighed in on in terms of the classification status of documents kept by a former president because there is no specific process in place. And I know that that's something that people have kind of disputed. But, really, there's been no court that's weighed in on it.
